12481209,"OBJECTIVE: The Russian mortality crisis of the early 1990s attracted considerable attention, but information on possible covariates of mortality is lacking, and concerns have been raised about the validity of official mortality data. To help elucidate the determinants of mortality, we examined whether indirect demographic techniques could be used to study mortality in countries such as the Russian Federation, where mortality data are inadequate, using input data independent from official vital statistics. METHODS: A national sample of the population was interviewed (n = 1600, response rate = 67%). Participants who had ever been married (82% of the sample) were asked about the date of birth and vital status of their first spouse. Spousal mortality was then estimated indirectly for the 531 men and 710 women for whom valid data were available. FINDINGS: The estimated risk of death between the ages of 35-69 years was 57% for male spouses and 17% for female spouses. Corresponding figures derived from national data for 1990 were 52% and 25% for the Russian Federation, and 31% and 20% for the United Kingdom. According to spouses' reports, 38% of their husbands died from cardiovascular disease, 22% from cancer, and 14% from injuries and accidents. Mortality of male spouses was inversely related to the education level of their wives, and the age-adjusted hazard ratios for death from all causes, compared to primary education, were 0.77 for secondary education and 0.57 for university education (trend P = 0.03). Mortality was also inversely related to ownership of household items, but not to size of settlement, pride in Russia, membership in the Soviet Communist Party, nationality or self-assessed social status. CONCLUSIONS: Although the indirect estimates were imprecise (partly owing to the small population size of the study), and mortality in women was probably underestimated (owing to many factors, including poorer reporting by males and high male mortality), our results are nevertheless consistent with the mortality pattern observed in official mortality data. The indirect technique thus appears to be a useful tool to study the determinants of mortality in the Russian Federation and other populations, where reliable or sufficiently extensive data are not available."
15603114,"Occupational violence is a worldwide, multifaceted problem affecting all industries, including healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the experiences of 158 allied health professionals, 135 doctors, and 1229 nurses working in a rural area in eastern Australia. Response rates were 72 percent for allied health professionals and 62 percent for general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. Proportionately more nurses experienced occupational violence than did allied health providers and GPs. During the past 12 months (August 2001 to July 2002), 68 percent of nurses, compared with 47 percent of allied health providers and 48 percent of GPs, reported violence. All three professional groups indicated that the most distressing occupational violence was perpetrated by patients, followed by patients' relatives. The most frequent form of occupational violence was verbal abuse, followed by threatening behavior, physical violence, and obscene behavior. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of violence was found among the different allied health professional disciplines or fields of nursing. Health services management strategies addressing occupational violence need to be comprehensive and multidisciplinary in scope. Strategies to minimize violence need to focus on resource allocation, cultural change, and perseverance. Systems to monitor violence are a priority. Further research into the determinants of this pattern of violence is required."
3407490,"The influence of parental factors on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use has been examined previously, and findings have been contradictory. Previous studies, which found little relationship between parental norms and adolescent sexual activity, have been limited by their failure to recognize developmental differences in the relative weight of parent and peer influences between younger and older teens and by use of selected samples, resulting in a restriction of range. The current study differs in that it utilizes a clustered sample household survey of 329 males and females, aged 14 to 17, and 470 of their parents. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that parents' reported behavioral norms account for 5% of the variance in whether adolescents have had intercourse, and for 33% of the variance in use of contraception at last intercourse. The study suggests that while parents' normative beliefs have limited effect in the decision to become sexually active, they have considerable impact on later contraceptive use."
3883893,"Our review has focused centrally on the etiologic significance of social factors in the development of psychopathology. Our implicit assumption has been that social factors in general, and stressors in particular, may play a causal role in the development of psychopathology. Yet the evidence is clear that the vast majority of people who are exposed to stressful life events or to chronic stress situations do not develop significant psychiatric impairments. For this reason, research interest over the past decade has shifted to factors like social support and coping strategies that may ameliorate the impact of stress. We have examined some of the important empirical results from recent studies of stress, support, and coping, and we have discussed ways in which these new understandings have informed long-standing attempts to explain group differences in emotional functioning. In each section of the review we have attempted not only to summarize existing results but also to provide some evaluation of the literature and suggestions for future research. It is important to recognize that the contributors to the work reviewed here do not all share a common research agenda. Some of them are primarily committed to unraveling the psychosocial determinants of a particular clinical disorder. Others are mainly concerned with the effects of a particular stressor. Still others are interested in the processes that link stress to health across a broad array of stress situations and health outcomes. In the face of these diverse interests, it is little wonder that our understanding of social factors in psychopathology is uneven. There is good reason to believe, however that these diverse strands of research are beginning to converge on a common conception of the stress process and on a common research design. The conception at present is only in rough form, but its outlines are nonetheless capable of description. At its center is the notion that stress exposure sets off a process of adaptation. It recognizes that this process unfolds over time, and it acknowledges that this process is modified by structural factors as well as by personal dispositions and vulnerabilities. There is growing recognition that the analysis of this process requires longitudinal methods. Also, it is becoming increasingly clear that experimental interventions are required to unravel the parts of this process that link stress and health. It is too early to know if this nascent convergence will lead to an integrative theory of adaptation, yet it is almost certain to promote methodological and conceptual rigor and facilitate replication and cumulation of findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
7239734,"Recent studies of job satisfaction, working conditions, and changes in the content of work indicate that problems of low productivity and dissatisfaction may be related to changes in the organization of work which have reduced the amount of autonomy and control which workers have over the labor process. At the same time, elements in the labor movement, which has traditionally focused almost exclusively on obtaining higher wages and greater benefits for union members, now seem to be directing their attention to issues of workplace democracy and worker control over the production process and company policies. The research reported here investigates the determinants of worker autonomy and of workers' desire for increased worker control over the workplace. This article describes what are viewed as the main hypotheses suggested by earlier research and reports the findings and new hypotheses derived from a preliminary analysis of data from the ISR National 1977 Quality of Employment Survey and pilot in-depth interviews with sixteen Baltimore workers."
12965967,"Improving end-of-life experience is a major challenge to successful aging. Deaths that are reasonably free of discomfort, in accordance with patients' wishes, and within acceptable professional and ethical standards are high-quality deaths. The authors developed a 31-item measure of the quality of dying and death and applied it in a community sample and a sample of hospice enrollees. Scores on the Quality of Dying and Death Instrument and measures of perceived quality of care were collected from patients' loved ones after death. Higher overall after-death ratings of the quality of care received from all providers and from physicians were associated with higher-quality dying and death. How well patients' symptoms were controlled in the community study and how well wishes were followed and treatments were explained in the hospice study were associated with higher-quality dying. Major challenges to end-of-life research include recruiting representative population samples, given widespread reluctance of patients and loved ones to participate in research at the end of life; important variation in evaluations among different reporters after death; reluctance of loved ones to assign negative evaluations to dying experiences after death; and the highly individual and dynamic nature of dying experiences. Overcoming these challenges is of great importance in the search for the social, organizational, and individual determinants of high-quality dying in the U.S. cultural and health care context."
6701952,"This paper applies the diffusion of innovations model to the study of the birth control discontinuance of first-time users in the Dominican Republic. Two sets of factors are examined: social characteristics of the adopters are used to test Rogers's and Shoemaker's contention that discontinuers have more traditional values than continuers; and the adoption decision process is analyzed to identify the relationship of communication factors to discontinuance. Although number of children and experience of method problems were the major determinants of discontinuance, unfavorable information from friends and other birth control users was a significant factor. Rumor was found to have little effect on a women's decision to continue or discontinue."
17151800,Engagement is a core component of effective educational programs for children with autism. Analysis of 711 naturalistic goal-directed classroom behaviors of four school-age children with autism and four comparable children with Down syndrome (DS) was conducted. The definition of engagement was expanded to include child compliance and congruence. A main finding was both child and environmental factors influenced type of engagement. Children with DS produced 20% more goal-directed behaviors that were both congruent and compliant compared to children with autism. Large group instruction was associated with less congruent engagement but more compliant engagement for children with autism. These findings suggest specific types of engagement which may lead to advances in developing evidence-based practices for specific developmental disorders.
15798130,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship among father's occupational group, daily smoking, and smoking determinants in a cohort of New Zealand adolescents. METHODS: The longitudinal Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study provided information on adolescents' self-reported smoking behavior and potential predictors of smoking, such as social and material factors, personality characteristics, educational achievement, and individual attitudes and beliefs regarding smoking. Longitudinal logistic generalized estimating equation analyses were used. RESULTS: Adolescents whose fathers were classified in the lowest-status occupational group were twice as likely as those whose fathers occupied the highest-status occupational group to be daily smokers. This high risk of daily smoking among the adolescents from the lowest occupational group was largely predicted by their lower intelligence scores and by the higher prevalence of smoking among fathers and friends. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent socioeconomic differences in smoking, school-based interventions should seek to prevent smoking uptake among adolescents, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Programs need to provide positive, nonsmoking role models consonant with the culture and norms of lower-socioeconomic-status groups. Adolescents need to acquire resistance skills and protective behaviors against social pressure and influences."
2471142,"Rather than speaking broadly about the determinants of the nurse-patient relationship, as I did in my book, in this article I have focused more narrowly on psychiatric mental health nurses and their patients. I cited, as the chief influence on the context of the relationship between the two, the psychological changes concomitant with the stellar transition from the Piscean to the Aquarian Age and the burdens these changes impose on the psyche of the individual. I talked a bit about the paradoxical nature of the psyche and how it relates to paradoxical psychotherapeutic approaches. I mentioned win, win negotiations as being skills necessary for coping in the Aquarian Age. I also mentioned that our own value system, although absolute for us, is not necessarily binding on the other unless it is mutually agreed upon beforehand. In addition, I spoke about the possibility of many theories and methods, each equally valid and workable in the solution of a particular problem. I said our approach to the patient will depend on our role conception as psychotherapist, our typology, and concomitant with that, our model of psychological processes and the theoretical framework in which it is couched. I have stated what I consider the four key points for all of us to be aware of in order to negotiate the new psychology. We need to differentiate between needs, wants, and entitlement: we are entitled to our needs, but we are ultimately responsible for their fulfillment (which does not necessarily mean that we have to fulfill them ourselves). We need to be aware of the two-pronged aspect of every bit of communication; i.e., the simultaneous factual and directional message contained in each, and yet the selectivity of the tuning in by the receiver. We also need to be aware that any communication can imply a message about the object discussed or about one's subjective relation to it, as well as the confusion and rage that can be caused by ambiguities and the misunderstanding of which of the two has been meant. We have to learn to live with the fact that all of us have one area of our personality that is reasonably well adapted and another one that is still young and needs all our (and others') help that it can get.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
11676587,"BACKGROUND: A clear, up-to-date picture of smoking prevalence and its determinants is needed to inform the development of an effective tobacco control policy in Ukraine, particularly given the way in which the tobacco industry has targeted post-Soviet countries since transition. METHODS: A nationally representative household survey was undertaken in Ukraine in February 2000. RESULTS: Data were available on 1,590 individuals (response rate 72%). Fifty-seven percent of men and 10% of women were current smokers and an additional 21 and 7%, respectively, were ex-smokers. Smoking behavior has changed considerably over successive generations, with an increase in the proportion of women smoking and a reduction in the mean age at first smoking. Factors associated with smoking include young age, urban residence (among women), and material hardship, particularly unemployment. Involvement in social networks appears to reduce the probability of smoking. Smoking commonly occurs in public places and smokers differ from nonsmokers in their health beliefs about smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of smoking among men are already high and among young women are increasing rapidly. Unless an effective tobacco policy response is developed to address the issues identified, tobacco will continue to make an increasingly large contribution to premature morbidity and mortality in Ukraine."
7467670,"The high degree of interindividual variability of processes of aging is mentioned and biographical factors influencing age stage and processes of aging were analyzed. A review of empirical biographical studies is presented, which emphasize a conceptualization of behavior in older age at the interaction of past experience, current situation, and future time perspective of the individual. As an example it is discussed how the mother experiences and reacts to her last child's leaving home (""empty-nest-reaction""). An analysis of the data of the BLSA (1965-1977) demonstrated many patterns of change. It could be shown that there exists consistency as well as variability in personality variables. It could be shown that the biographical and social context was closely related to these interindividual differences in consistency and change. Conditions are multidimensional rather than uniform. This high degree of interindividual variability of change calls for a differential gerontology."
17128623,"AIMS: To describe the epidemiology of Suicide in Tuscany according to the triad of time, place and person. METHODS: The 4,764 cases of suicide, defined according to categories E950-E959 of ICD-9 in Tuscany over the period 1988-2002, were obtained from the Tuscan Mortality Register. Mortality indicators were calculated and analyzed. The spatial analysis was carried out by deriving Empirical Bayes Estimates for the 287 municipalities. RESULTS: The crude mortality rate in the 2000-2002 is 7.8 per 100000 population (male: 12.4; female: 3.5). The age-standardized rate in the 2000-2002 is 5.8 per 100,000 population (male: 9.6; female: 2.6). The highest risk for suicide, especially in the case of males, are concentrated in the southern hinterland Tuscany, in a cluster of rural municipalities that represent the old mining district of Tuscany. The SMRs according to residential municipality (population per square kilometre), confirm a greater risk of suicide for males residing in rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster of excessive mortality from suicide in Southern Tuscany could be the consequence of social determinants, related to the urban and social crisis following agriculture decline and mine closure."
7458619,"Three parameters of social function-socialization in the home, socialization outside to the home, and hobbies and interests--were analyzed to determine social reintegration of long-term survivors of documented completed stroke, who had already achieved satisfactory levels of physical function as measured by the Kenny self-care evaluation. A significant proportion of survivors manifested social disability, despite complete physical restoration. Much of this disability cannot be accounted for by age, physical impairment or specific neurologic deficits. The distribution of functional disabilities documented suggests that psychosocial factors, as well as organic deficits, are major determinants."
3629664,"Data from a 1982 sample survey of 3,830 married women below age 50 in a district of Beijing City are applied to the Bongaarts model of the proximate determinants of fertility. A total fertility rate (TFR) of 0.75 births per woman is estimated from the model, compared with a TFR of 1.24 actually observed from the survey. The estimated TFR (0.75) results from the assumed total fecundity (TF) of 15.30 births per woman being inhibited by the indexes of the proximate determinants of fertility, most notably non-marriage (.280), contraception (.315), and induced abortion (.586). The effects of two other proximate determinants, lactational infecundability and spousal separation, were negligible. Comparative data from other countries confirm that the study area has very low levels of fertility and marriage, a very high prevalence of induced abortion, and a small effect of lactational infecundability. The extremely low level of fertility was, thus, achieved through a high level of induced abortion. Future research needs and policy implications associated with the study are discussed."
19253847,"OBJECTIVE: To undertake a research into the maternal health care services and its determinants in poor regions in Sichuan province. METHODS: Stratified cluster sampling strategy was employed to select the participants who had pregnancy since 1998 to complete the interview administered ""maternal health care questionnaire"". A total of 462 women participated in the study. RESULTS: Of the 462 women, 387 received prenatal care services, the most common maternal health care services. Only 144 women got post-natal visits at least once. Maternal age and education had significant impacts on the use of maternal health care services including prenatal examinations and birth in hospitals (P<0.05). Low-income (< Yen 1000) women used less maternal health care services than the high-income (> Yen 5000) women (P<0.05). The women who were covered by the cooperative medical insurance scheme and poverty alleviation scheme used more prenatal care and post-natal services and were more likely to deliver babies in hospitals than those who paid the services entirely out of pocket (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Poor social and economical situation has a detrimental impact on the use of maternal health care services, which might be associated with poor education and low financial capacities of the women."
2670174,"The literature on anorexia nervosa and bulimia in male patients was reviewed with the intention of (a) identifying differences that may exist between male and female sufferers, and (b) isolating, through a study of etiological factors in the low-risk (male) group, those factors that may be specific in the etiology of these disorders in both sexes. Current knowledge suggests that fundamental male-female differences do not exist as far as the etiology or symptomatology of these disorders is concerned. Given such similarities, the lower incidence among males suggests biological, social and intrapsychic determinants, that can be conceived to be more active in female versus male populations."

12501479,"In an attempt to add to the knowledge about concerns regarding the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a sample of 186 Jewish and Arab adults with no family history of the disease were examined on the basis of sociodemographic and health characteristics, social-cognitive determinants, and knowledge about AD. Nearly 50 percent of the participants reported being very concerned about developing AD. Memory problems and the likelihood of developing the disease emerged as significant predictors of concern about AD. The need to expand the use of theoretically-based models, including social-cognitive determinants, for the study of specific concerns about AD as a basis for the development of educational programs is discussed."
3420484,"The extent, determinants and consequences of cigarette consumption and alcohol abuse in Mamre are investigated in this article. Among both males and females smoking rates were found to be higher in the 25-44-year-old group than in the 45-64-year group. Males smoked more than females. In the 25-44-year age group a relationship between employment status and smoking as well as between level of education and smoking was established. Odds ratios for smoking of 1,78 for males and 2,42 for females were found in the 25-44-year age group, while odds ratios in the unemployed group were 1,81 for males and 1,79 for females. Alcohol was reported to be a problem in 32.0% of households of which the head was an unskilled manual worker, compared with 9.1% of households of which the head was a professional or a white-collar worker. A positive association was found between alcohol being a problem in the household and the presence of a disabled person in the house, independent of employment status (odds ratio 1,8, 95% confidence interval 1,2-2,5). Respondents who viewed their health as satisfactory or bad were more likely than those with good or excellent health to come from households where alcohol was reported as a problem (odds ratio 1,9, 95% confidence interval 1,4-2,5)."
6474551,"Breastfeeding can play a major role in fertility regulation in developing countries. The effect of breastfeeding is enhanced when the incidence of breastfeeding is high and the duration extended. These factors are more likely to occur when suckling at the breast is frequent. Sociological and behavioral factors can also influence a woman's decision to initiate and terminate breastfeeding. The effects of urbanization, maternal education, and socioeconomic status act through the intervening variables of sociocultural factors, health services, employment status of women, and availability of breastmilk substitutes. Strategies to alter these intervening variables include educational campaigns and support groups for lactating women, changes in health services, availability of child care facilities near employment centers, and enforcement of the international code of marketing of breastmilk substitutes."
18194525,"BACKGROUND: Considering the high costs of sick leave and the consequences of sick leave for employees, an early return-to-work of employees with mental disorders is very important. Therefore, a workplace intervention is developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for employees with low back pain. The objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of one year. Employees eligible for this study are on sick leave for 2 to 8 weeks with common mental disorders. The workplace intervention will be compared with usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise approach that aims to reach consensus about a return-to-work plan by active participation and strong commitment of both the sick-listed employee and the supervisor. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome of this study is lasting return-to-work, which will be acquired from continuous registration systems of the companies after the follow-up. Secondary outcomes are total number of days of sick leave during the follow-up, severity of common mental disorders, coping style, job content, and attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal perspective. A process evaluation will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: Return-to-work is difficult to discuss in the workplace for sick-listed employees with mental disorders and their supervisors. Therefore, this intervention offers a unique opportunity for the sick-listed employee and the supervisor to discuss barriers for return-to-work. Results of this study will possibly contribute to improvement of disability management for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Results will become available in 2009. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN92307123."
12265102,"The aim of this paper is to assess the relative importance of economic and quality of life (QOL) factors as determinants of inter-metropolitan migration in the United States. The study is based on the generalized systemic gravity model of Alonso and on data from a sample of 25 SMSAs over the period 1965-1970. ""The most striking feature of the empirical results is the apparent lack of importance of origin economic and QOL factors as determinants of outmigration.... On the other hand, the empirical results suggest both economic and QOL factors to be significant determinants of inmigration."""
11020935,"In Bangladesh, the total fertility rate declined from more than six children per woman of reproductive age in 1980 to 3.3 children per woman in 1996. Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decision making to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning."
3780230,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits, reproductive and medical histories were compared of 328 women who had ever used oral contraceptives and 2306 never users from a case-control surveillance conducted in Northern Italy. Oral contraceptive use was positively and strongly related with the level of education and indicators of social class. The rate ratio of ever use (adjusted for age and diagnostic category) was 3.3 for women with 12 years of education or more compared with less than 7 years, and 3.0 for women of highest compared with lowest social class. The frequency of pill use was lower among never married women, and significantly elevated among smokers (rate ratio = 2.4 for heavy smokers). In contrast, no relation was evident between alcohol or coffee consumption and pill use. Likewise, ever users of oral contraceptives were not significantly different from women who had never used the pill with regard to major reproductive factors (parity and age at first pregnancy) or several medical variables of potential interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), with the only possible exclusion of obesity which was less frequent among pill users. Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of oral contraceptive use in this Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on oral contraceptive and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of oral contraceptive users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits."
7264477,"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered."
18341123,"Renewed international interest in the structural determinants of health manifests itself in a focus on the social determinants of health and the public policy antecedents that shape their quality. This increased international interest in public policy in support of the structural determinants of health has had little traction in the United States. This should be surprising since the United States presents one of the worst population health profiles and public policy environments in support of health among wealthy developed nations. The U.S. position as a health status and policy outlier results from long-term institutional changes that are shaped by political, economic, and social forces. U.S. public health researchers' and workers' neglect of these structural and public policy issues conforms to the dominant ideological discourses that serve to justify these changes. The author presents some means by which public health researchers and workers can challenge these dominant discourses."
2773911,"This study investigates the association of wartime stress variables and coronary artery disease as determined by coronary angiography in Lebanon in 1986, a country with an ongoing civil war for over a decade. A total of 127 patients who underwent coronary angiography at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were individually matched on age and sex with visitor controls free from any evidence of clinical coronary artery disease. Arteriographic cases (greater than or equal to 70% maximal stenosis) were compared with two control groups: arteriographic controls (entirely normal coronaries) and visitor controls. Findings suggest that there is a relation between exposure to both acute and chronic war events and coronary artery disease in this patient population. The reporting of exposure to acute war events was significantly higher in cases compared with both visitor controls (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.17-4.90) and arteriographic controls (OR = 2.8, 95% Cl 0.93-8.47). Crossing the ""green-lines"" that separate two belligerent sides, considered as an attribute of war-related chronic stress, was more frequent in cases compared with visitor controls (OR = 3.25, 95% Cl 1.54-6.89) and arteriographic controls (OR = 5.38, 95% Cl 1.65-17.6). The relation observed between wartime stress and coronary artery disease could not be explained by possible overreporting of stressful events in patients with suspected coronary artery disease or by an increase in clinical awareness for the disease for those under continuous stress. Adjusting for the effect of the well-established coronary artery disease risk factors did not alter the above findings."
20841128,"This article presents a multidimensional model of psychosocial determinants of health behavior for health promotion research and policy analysis. Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented."
3705997,Forty-five severely obese patients were treated with jaw fixation as a means of initiating weight loss. Patients who reported eating for consolation showed significantly greater difficulties in maintaining the achieved weight loss than the others. This finding constitutes further evidence of a relationship between obesity and depression. Low capacity to experience feelings of aggressiveness also seems to be linked to poor treatment results.
3724364,"The male C57BL/6 mice used in this study were the offspring either of untreated or lead treated (0.1% lead acetate (PbAc) instead of drinking water) parents. Offspring of lead treated parents were reared on 0.1% PbAc until weaning, and also given 0.5% PbAc to drink for 3 weeks prior to testing (Pb2 group). Offspring of untreated parents were either given 0.5% PbAc to drink (Pb1 group) or maintained on tap water throughout (Control group). Control (C) and lead treated mice were subdivided according to single- or group-housing; no confrontation (""unfought"") or confrontation with a trained aggressor mouse (""defeated""). All the mice were then given a hot-plate pain test, in which paw-lick and escape latencies were recorded. In untreated mice, latencies were reduced after defeat. This effect was not seen in lead treated animals. Lead treatment increased latencies in most instances relative to the appropriate control group. The paw-lick latencies were less consistently affected than the escape latencies. Escape latencies, with one exception, were longer in the Pb2 group than in the Pb1 group. Treatment with naloxone of single-housed C and Pb2 was without effect, except for Pb2 treated undefeated mice: here, naloxone abolished the analgesic effect of lead treatment. Lead-induced analgesia is discussed in terms of central mechanisms of pain reception."
16813040,"Results of longitudinal studies suggest that the stability of preferences varies across individuals, although it is unclear what variables account for these differences. We extended this work by conducting periodic assessments of preference for leisure activities over 3 to 6 months with 10 adults with developmental disabilities. Although previous research has collectively shown that preferences identified via repeated assessment are highly variable, our results showed that preferences were relatively stable for the majority (80%) of participants. In an attempt to identify some environmental determinants of shifts in preference, we provided extended daily access to high-preference items (preference-weakening manipulation) and paired access to low-preference items with social and edible putative reinforcers during brief sessions (preference-strengthening manipulation). Preference assessments continued over the course of these manipulations with 2 participants. Results showed that changes in preference across time could be produced systematically and suggest that naturally occurring changes in establishing operations or conditioning histories contribute to temporal shifts in preference.

16910806,"BACKGROUND: Family caregivers caring for a patient with terminal cancer may experience significant psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the family caregivers' psychological distress is influenced by the patients' performance status while taking into account individual characteristics of caregivers and their unmet needs. METHODS: Two hundred twelve family caregivers were assigned to three cohorts according to the patient's performance status, as measured by the Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group Functional Scale (ECOGS). Interview information was collected on the services and care provided, as well as on the caregivers' characteristics and level of psychological distress. RESULTS: Family caregivers' psychosocial distress is strongly associated with the patients' terminal disease progress and declined functioning. The level of psychological distress varies from 25.2 to 33.5 (p = 0.0008) between the groups. Moreover, the percentage of caregivers with a high level of psychological distress varies from 41% to 62%, while this percentage is estimated at 19.2% in general population. A high distress index was significantly associated with the caregiver's burden, the patient's young age, the patient's symptoms, the caregiver's young age and gender, a poor perception of his/her health and dissatisfaction with emotional and tangible support. CONCLUSIONS: Family caregivers of patients in the advanced stages of cancer experience a high level of psychological distress, which increases significantly as the patient loses autonomy. Health care policies and programs need to be revisited in order to take the reality of these patients and their families into account."
15113642,"Informal care is an indispensable element in the care for many patients. In order to maintain a sustainable input of informal care, it seems important to identify measures to alleviate the burden of care giving for caregivers at risk of burn out or other serious health problems, such as support and respite care. Thus, far research has focused on the burden of caregiving and on the supply of respite care. The demand side: what type of care is preferred by informal caregivers and what determines their preferences, is virtually unknown. We analysed the preferences and the underlying determinants for several types of support and respite care in a sample of 950 Dutch informal caregivers. Almost 80% of the respondents desire support or respite care in general, 42-47% would prefer more communication with other informal caregivers or more information of professional caregivers. Some time off is preferred by 40% of the respondents. The results show that caregiver characteristics, care recipient characteristics, elements of the caregiving situation and institutional variables determine the desire for support and respite care. Especially, the subjective burden of caregiving is important, whereas the number of caregiving tasks and the time invested (objective burden) hardly affect the desire for support and respite care."
12342565,"The relationship between labor migration and relative deprivation is examined. ""We model migration from one reference group to another as a response to relative deprivation and satisfaction: We say that a strong incentive to migrate exists if relative deprivation decreases while satisfaction rises with migration and that a weak incentive exists if the individual increases or decreases his satisfaction and deprivation at the same time by migrating. We derive conditions under which different incentives, weak or strong, hold for different individuals.... Our analysis enables us to explain several perplexing migratory phenomena, identify income inequality as a distinct explanatory variable of migration and establish an incentive to migrate in situations where the utility-social welfare approach does not."""
10786724,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyse the associations between the food variety score (FVS), dietary diversity score (DDS) and nutritional status of children, and to assess the associations between FVS, DDS and socioeconomic status (SES) on a household level. The study also assessed urban and rural differences in FVS and DDS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional studies in 1994/95, including a simplified food frequency questionnaire on food items used in the household the previous day. A socioeconomic score was generated, based on possessions in the households. Weight and height were measured for all children aged 6-59 months in the households, and anthropometric indices were generated. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Three hundred and twenty-nine urban and 488 rural households with 526 urban and 1789 rural children aged 6-59 months in Koutiala County, Sikasso Region, Mali. RESULTS: Children from urban households with a low FVS or DDS had a doubled risk (OR>2) for being stunted and underweight. Those relations were not found in the rural area. There was an association between SES and both FVS and DDS on the household level in both areas. The FVS and DDS in urban households with the lowest SES were higher than the FVS and DDS among the rural households with the highest SES. CONCLUSIONS: Food variety and dietary diversity seem to be associated with nutritional status (weight/age and height/age) of children in heterogeneous communities, as our data from urban areas showed. In rural areas, however, this association could not be shown. Socioeconomic factors seem to be important determinants for FVS and DDS both in urban and rural areas. FVS and DDS are useful variables in assessing the nutritional situation of households, particular in urban areas."
16277821,"This paper discusses possible consequences of energy excess throughout the life cycle. Firstly we consider the effects of foods on hunger, satiety and satiation. Also, the changes in food availability and consumption in relation to changes in social and economic determinants of energy excess. The relationship between physical activity and energy intake (EI) is also considered. Secondly we explore the definition of energy excess and the metabolic effects of macronutrients (mainly in relation to fuel partitioning oxidation/storage) on energy balance. The cellular and molecular regulation determined by specific genes involved in lipogenesis, fuel partitioning and/or in energy dissipation are explored. Thirdly, we examine the main consequences induced by energy excess and positive energy balance, starting with the alterations in glucose utilisation (insulin resistance) leading to type 2 diabetes and the linkage of energy excess with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Biological, social and psychological consequences during perinatal, childhood and adolescence periods are specifically analysed. Fourthly, the transition from energy deficit to excess, under the optic of a developing country is analysed with country examples drawn from Latin America. The possible role of supplementary food programmes in determining positive energy balance is discussed especially in relation to pre-school and school feeding programmes. Fifthly, we deal with the economic costs of energy excess and obesity related diseases. Finally, some areas where further research is needed are described; biological and genetic determinants of individual and population energy requirements, foods and food preparations as actually consumed, consumer education and research needs on social determinants of energy imbalances."
3225143,"Subjects completed two brief questionnaires, one concerning the description of, and attitudes towards schizophrenia and schizophrenics and the second on the possible cause of schizophrenia. Both questionnaires yielded a clearly interpretable factor structure and the relationship between the cause and 'symptoms' was examined. The results are discussed in terms of the range, determinants and structure of lay beliefs in mental illness, particularly schizophrenia."
7424839,"A stratified sample (race, sex, and social class) of 469 laymen from two North Carolina communities responded to a 190-item MMPI-based questionnaire with the degree of mental illness concern evoked by each item. The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance. Although laymen had roughly similar rank orderings for the 13 homogeneous clusters of items, blacks indicated greater concern over breakdowns in social orientation than whites, while the opposite pattern held for traditionally defined psychopathy (internal distresses). Upper-class concerns were, comparatively, with cognitive dysfunction, middle-class with moral and social responsibility, and lower-class with social inadequacies."
3806448,"Social psychological models of health care behaviour frequently take as their starting point perception of the illness. This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed."
3060449,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement."
16872670,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the motivational determinants of the continuation of breast-feeding until 3 months postpartum. METHODS: A prospective cohort study using the Integrated Change Model in 341 women in 5 child health care centers. RESULTS: At birth, 73% of the mothers started with breast-feeding and 39% of them continued at least 3 months postpartum. Mothers who continued for 3 months differed in almost all the motivational determinants from mothers who discontinued. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, social support for formula feeding from significant others and situational self-efficacy for breast-feeding made a significant independent contribution to the continuation of breast-feeding. Among the predisposing determinants, the strongest positive predictor of continuation was the intention to return to work at 1 month postpartum. CONCLUSION: The Integrated Change Model is valid to explain and predict the continuation of breast-feeding. Hence, the results may be used to tailor future interventions aimed at promoting breast-feeding. In the discussion, we use the results to target interventions."
7076787,"Mortality from ischemic heart disease has declined sharply since the mid 1960's in the United States and several other industrialized nations. The causes of this decline have thus far not been established. Six major strategies for investigating determinants of ischemic heart disease mortality trends are discussed in this review: (1) analyses of mortality data; (2) morbidity surveillance; (3) surveillance of change in medical care; (4) surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors; (5) social and ecological surveillance; (6) experimental and quasi-experimental community approaches. The rationale, problems and limitations of each are discussed."
3538185,"Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity."
3867226,"The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
15772506,"Distance education offers many advantages to students, faculty, and educational institutions. Despite these advantages, distance education classes historically have higher dropout rates than do the courses taught in the traditional, face-to-face setting. Current research includes information related to technology, teaching tips, and resources for these extended learning opportunities. However, information related to student success in distance education is limited and success indicators are poorly defined. Current studies on success indicators often lack a defining framework that provides an opportunity for study replication and strengthens the credibility of study findings. An empirical model developed by Powell et al divides potential determinants of success into three categories. This literature review identifies indicators in each category and indicates a need to revise the current framework to include technology as a fourth category. The revised framework should provide a basis for additional research in this rapidly growing area."
3646999,"This paper reports the results of an empirical study of psychological stress in nurses employed in a large Special Hospital and caring for mentally disturbed patients who may be a danger to themselves or to others. Such an environment would appear to be dangerous and stressful and the findings of this study show that this sample of nurses do indeed report relatively high levels of stress when compared to some other employed samples. Relationships between psychological distress, anxiety and depression and aspects of their jobs, such as job demands, supports and constraints, are discussed. Individual differences in experiences of stress are also considered."
12282631,"This paper reviews recent new trends in population structure in the world and its major regions in order to access the determinants of those trends and explore issues regarding the recent and projected changes in the age structure of population and the relationships of those changes to social and economic development. In particular, the paper compares the change in age structure projected by the Population Division of the UN Secretariat in its most recent 3 series--namely, those completed in 1984, 1986, and 1988. By and large, the most recent UN assessment projects that a larger proportion of the world population will be aged 60 and over in 2000 and 2025 than was previously estimated. Those changes in projections can be observed for the world and for the more developed countries as a whole, and for the regions of Africa, Latin America, Northern America, East Asia, Europe, and Oceania. While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries."
18314472,"BACKGROUND: Wage losses after breast cancer may result in considerable financial burden. Their assessment is made more urgent because more women now participate in the workforce and because breast cancer is managed using multiple treatment modalities that could lead to long work absences. We evaluated wage losses, their determinants, and the associations between wage losses and changes for the worse in the family's financial situation among Canadian women over the first 12 months after diagnosis of early breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among women with breast cancer from eight hospitals throughout the province of Quebec. Information that permitted the calculation of wage losses and information on potential determinants of wage losses were collected by three pretested telephone interviews conducted over the year following the start of treatment. Information on medical characteristics was obtained from medical records. The main outcome was the proportion of annual wages lost because of breast cancer. Multivariable analysis of variance using the general linear model was used to identify personal, medical, and employment characteristics associated with the proportion of wages lost. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among 962 eligible breast cancer patients, 800 completed all three interviews. Of these, 459 had a paying job during the month before diagnosis. On average, these working women lost 27% of their projected usual annual wages (median = 19%) after compensation received had been taken into account. Multivariable analysis showed that a higher percentage of lost wages was statistically significantly associated with a lower level of education (P(trend) = .0018), living 50 km or more from the hospital where surgery was performed (P = .070), lower social support (P = .012), having invasive disease (P = .086), receipt of chemotherapy (P < .001), self-employment (P < .001), shorter tenure in the job (P(trend) < .001), and part-time work (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Wage losses and their effects on financial situation constitute an important adverse consequence of breast cancer in Canada."
19183131,"BACKGROUND: This study assesses racial/ethnic disparities in negative social consequences of drinking and alcohol dependence symptoms among white, black, and Hispanic Americans. We examine whether and how disparities relate to heavy alcohol consumption and pattern, and the extent to which social disadvantage (poverty, unfair treatment, and racial/ethnic stigma) accounts for observed disparities. METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2005 U.S. National Alcohol Survey, a nationally representative telephone-based survey of adults ages 18 and older (N = 6,919). Given large racial/ethnic differences in abstinence rates, core analyses were restricted to current drinkers (N = 4,080). Logistic regression was used to assess disparities in alcohol-related problems at 3 levels of heavy drinking, measured using a composite variable incorporating frequency of heavy episodic drinking, frequency of drunkenness, and maximum amount consumed in a single day. A mediational approach was used to assess the role of social disadvantage. RESULTS: African American and Hispanic drinkers were significantly more likely than white drinkers to report social consequences of drinking and alcohol dependence symptoms. Even after adjusting for differences in heavy drinking and demographic characteristics, disparities in problems remained. The racial/ethnic gap in alcohol problems was greatest among those reporting little or no heavy drinking, and gradually diminished to nonsignificance at the highest level of heavy drinking. Social disadvantage, particularly in the form of racial/ethnic stigma, appeared to contribute to racial/ethnic differences in problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol-related problems, public health efforts must do more than reduce heavy drinking. Future research should address the possibility of drink size underestimation, identify the particular types of problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities, and investigate social and cultural determinants of such problems."
22077172,"Summary In order to unravel the complex set of the determinants of fertility, we suggest that the child-bearing process be separated into a sequence of events and intervals. As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval. The strong effect of ethnicity is consistent with a cultural interpretation, but important qualifications are noted."
16217003,"BACKGROUND: Despite its effectiveness in reducing mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are low, especially among low-income and minority groups; however, physician recommendation can increase screening rates. METHODS: We performed a multilevel analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data linked to Medicare claims and the Area Resource File to identify determinants of racial and socioeconomic disparities in CRC screening among 9985 Medicare Parts A and B beneficiaries with a usual physician. Recent CRC screening was defined as receipt of either a home fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy at recommended intervals. RESULTS: Unadjusted rates of screening were 48% for white and 39% for black beneficiaries (P<.001). Racial differences in CRC screening receipt were eliminated after adjustment for socioeconomic status as measured by income and education. Socioeconomic status disparities decreased but remained significant after adjustment for personal and health system factors. Awareness of CRC (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 2.29-3.33) and having a primary care generalist (vs another specialist) as one's usual physician (adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.53) were associated with higher odds of screening, controlling for other factors. The odds of screening were also higher among those whose usual physician was rated more highly on information-giving skills. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in CRC screening rates among Medicare beneficiaries with a usual physician are explained by differences in socioeconomic status. Beneficiaries with a primary care generalist as their usual physician had higher rates of CRC screening receipt. Increased efforts to make Medicare beneficiaries aware of the benefits of CRC screening may capitalize on the associations found in this study between CRC knowledge, physician information giving, and timely screening."
11450925,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify 'non-medical' datasets holding routinely collected information that might be used to measure and monitor the wider determinants of community health and well-being. METHODS: An expert panel discussion, involving public health and environmental health academics and professionals with expertise in a variety of backgrounds (including environmental health, housing, transport, community safety, public health, primary and secondary care), and interrogation of the Office for National Statistics database were carried out for the West Midlands region. The aim was to identify routinely collected 'non-medical' datasets containing information on the following factors: physical environment, crime, housing and homelessness, social services, socio-economic environment including employment, lifestyles, education, leisure and culture, transport and accidents. RESULTS: Fifty-six datasets were identified. Although 43 (77 per cent) were collected at least annually, few (17; 30 per cent) held data that were disaggregated and routinely available at the sub-local authority level. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a number of datasets that hold information relevant to health. However, no single dataset is likely to provide information on all dimensions of health and the determinants of health, and local agencies should consider carefully the strengths and weaknesses of each. Through the development of inter-sectoral working and multi-agency involvement at the local level there is now considerable scope to improve the quality of many of these datasets and to promote their use in the measurement and monitoring of community health."
16094843,"OBJECTIVE: We aim at analysing the increase of CVDs in the Tunisian hospitals in order to assess the burden of NCDs in the transitional context. METHODS: Data are recorded through the Tunisian National Morbidity and Mortality Survey (TNMMS). In order to assess the CVDs (CHDs vs RHDs) trend, two representative samples of Cardiology Departements patients were compared one is selected from the TNMMS and the second from the hospitalisations recorded in 1992. Causes, stay duration, status at the end of the hospitalisation, transfer to another hospital and patients socio-demographic characteristics are recorded and compared for the two periods. All the diagnosis are coded referring to the DMC 10. To analyze the determinant of the epidemiological transition, we have elaborated the CVD causal pattern and we have documented all their determinants. RESULTS: CHD rate has dramatically increased, while RHD has decreased especially on men. In 1992, 39.2% of men and 11.8% of women were admitted for CHD. In 2002, these rate are respectivly 58.8% and 38.2% while RHD rates were, in 1992, 11.8% on men and 25.3% on women vs 4.4% and 11.7% respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed that so far controlling transmitted diseases seems to be successful, Tunisian people are about to face a new problems as hypertension, obesity, diabetes and tobacco smoking. The new challenge with the burden of diseases requires the implementation of a national strategy relevant to the epidemiological, social and economical transition. Population needs and cost effectiveness of interventions assessment is crucial to set the national priorities."
6474230,"The paper examines role of social support, structural-environmental and perceptual variables in explaining variation in illness behaviour in a sample of 240 adults with impaired hearing. The specific behaviour examined is physician visits over a 12 month period. We find that previous experience with illness and perceived health status are important variables with respect to illness behaviour and that the relevance of these variables and social support vary considerably by level of psychological distress. While the addition of psychological distress as an explanatory variable makes little contribution, the variation in the power of the model to explain variation in behaviour across levels of distress is substantial. Our findings argue strongly for increased awareness of the role of social and psychological factors in illness behaviour, particularly among those who plan and deliver health care services."
18561037,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the incidence and outcome of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Switzerland and to test the feasibility of a large cohort study with case identification in the first 24 hours and 6-month follow-up. METHODS: From January to June 2005, we consecutively enrolled and followed up all persons with severe TBI (Abbreviated Injury Score of the head region >3 and Glasgow Coma Scale <9) in the catchment areas of 3 Swiss medical centres with neurosurgical facilities. The primary outcome was the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) after 6 months. Secondary outcomes included survival, Functional Independence Mea - sure (FIM), and health-related quality of life (SF-12) at defined time-points up to 6 months after injury. RESULTS: We recruited 101 participants from a source population of about 2.47 million (ie, about 33% of Swiss population). The incidence of severe TBI was 8.2 per 100,000 person-years. The overall case fatality was 70%: 41 of 101 persons (41%) died at the scene of the accident. 23 of 60 hospitalised participants (38%) died within 48 hours, and 31 (53%) within 6 months. In all hospitalised patients, the median GOSE was 1 (range 1-8) after 6 months, and was 6 (2-8) in 6-month survivors. The median total FIM score was 125 (range 18-126); median-SF-12 component mea - sures were 44 (25-55) for the physical scale and 52 (32-65) for the mental scale. CONCLUSIONS: Severe TBI was associated with high case fatality and considerable morbidity in survivors. We demonstrated the feasibility of a multicentre cohort study in Switzerland with the aim of identifying modifiable determinants of outcome and improving current trauma care."
3628634,A theoretical model designed to assess the contribution of systematic factors contributing to vulnerability to life-events exposure is described. This model is applied to six-year longitudinal data on life events exposure for a sample of New Zealand women with school-aged children. The fitted model suggests that in the region of 30% of the variance in life-event reports over the six-year period was attributable to a common vulnerability factor. Modelling of this vulnerability factor suggested that two major determinants of vulnerability to life events were the level of social disadvantage of the woman and her level of neuroticism: women of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and women with high neuroticism scores showed a consistent tendency to report high life-event exposure during the six-year period. The implications of these findings are discussed.

17003158,"PURPOSE: A seamless system of social, behavioral, and medical services for the uninsured was created to address the social determinants of disease, reduce health disparities, and foster local economic development in 2 inner-city neighborhoods and 2 rural counties in New Mexico. METHODS: Our family medicine department helped urban and rural communities that had large uninsured, minority populations create Health Commons models. These models of care are characterized by health planning shared by community stakeholders; 1-stop shopping for medical, behavioral, and social services; employment of community health workers bridging the clinic and the community; and job creation. RESULTS: Outcomes of the Health Commons included creation of a Web-based assignment of uninsured emergency department patients to primary care homes, reducing return visits by 31%; creation of a Web-based interface allowing partner organizations with incompatible information systems to share medical information; and creation of a statewide telephone Health Advice Line offering rural and urban uninsured individuals access to health and social service information and referrals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Health Commons created jobs and has been sustained by attracting local investment and external public and private funding for its products. Our department's role in developing the Health Commons helped the academic health center (AHC) form mutually beneficial community partnerships with surrounding and distant urban and rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: Broad stakeholder participation built trust and investment in the Health Commons, expanding services for the uninsured. This participation also fostered marketable innovations applicable to all Health Commons' sites. Family medicine can promote the Health Commons as a venue for linking complementary strengths of the AHC and the community, while addressing the unique needs of each. Overall, our experience suggests that family medicine can play a leadership role in building collaborative approaches to seemingly intractable health problems among the uninsured, benefiting not only the community, but also the AHC."
11520404,"Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in industrialised societies. Its incidence is greatly increased among the socially disadvantaged, but the reasons for this excess are unclear and have been relatively unexplored. We hypothesise two distinct sets of causal pathways and mechanisms that may explain social disparities in preterm birth. The first set involves chronic and acute psychosocial stressors, psychological distress caused by those stressors, increased secretion of placental corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), changes in sexual behaviours or enhanced susceptibility to bacterial vaginosis and chorioamnionitis, cigarette smoking or cocaine use, and decidual vasculopathy. The second hypothesised pathway is a gene-environment interaction based on a highly prevalent mutation in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), combined with low folate intake from the diet and from prenatal vitamin supplements, consequent hyperhomocysteinemia, and decidual vasculopathy. We propose to test these hypothesised pathways and mechanisms in a nested case-control study within a prospectively recruited and followed cohort of pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who deliver at one of four Montreal hospitals that serve an ethnically and socio-economically diverse population. Following recruitment during the late first or early second trimester, participating women are seen at 24-26 weeks, when a research nurse obtains a detailed medical and obstetric history; administers several scales to assess chronic and acute stressors and psychological function; obtains blood samples for CRH, red blood cell and plasma folate, homocysteine, and DNA for the MTHFR mutation; and performs a digital and speculum examination to measure cervical length and vaginal pH and to obtain swabs for bacterial vaginosis and fetal fibronectin. After delivery, each case (delivery at < 37 completed weeks following spontaneous onset of labour or prelabour rupture of membranes) and two controls are selected for placental pathological examination, hair analysis of cotinine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine, and analysis of stored blood and vaginal specimens. Statistical analysis will be based on multiple logistic regression and structural equation modelling, with sequential construction of models of potential aetiological determinants and covariates to test the hypothesised causal pathways and mechanisms. The research we propose should improve understanding of the factors and processes that mediate social disparities in preterm birth. This improved understanding should help not only in developing strategies to reduce the disparities but also in suggesting preventive interventions applicable across the entire socio-economic spectrum."
2589474,"Data on nutritional intake and patterns of physical growth in the rural Andean community of Nunoa, Peru (elevation 4,000 m), are described and compared to data previously collected from this location. Food consumption data and selected anthropometric measures were obtained from a sample of 33 households. Estimates of caloric intake from this study are very similar to those obtained in Nunoa during the mid- and late 1960s. However, within the present sample, upper income (i.e., middle class) individuals have significantly higher caloric intakes than those of the lower income group and also appear to have an improved diet relative to individuals of 20 years ago. Anthropometric data show that children of the upper socioeconomic status (SES) group are significantly taller and heavier than the lower SES group children. Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not. These results indicate that nutritional factors have significantly contributed to the extreme pattern of slow growth previously reported for children of Nunoa and, moreover, demonstrate how social and environmental forces interact to create differential levels of stress that contribute to variation in biological well-being."
6143404,"This paper uses a national probability sample to examine major correlates of drug use among American adults. Demographic correlates of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana, tranquilizer, sleeping pill and stimulant use are explained in terms of a self medication or coping perspective of drug use. Two analysis procedures are used. In the first, respondents were asked to list strategies they use when they have problems. These responses are 'broken down' by drug use categories or 'taking pills'. In the second procedure, attempts are made to interpret the correlations between age, sex, marital status, education and drug use by introducing variables which measure how respondents were experiencing fundamental aspects of their lives (role stress items) and mental health variables. A substantial portion of the variance in drug use that is explained by demographic variables appears to operate through social role and mental health variables, that is, these latter variables interpret the demographic/drug use relationships in a way that is consistent with a coping perspective. The authors conclude that these data and this analysis provided cautious support for a coping perspective."
7100991,"Five hypothesis regarding the social psychological determinants of patient satisfaction were tested among patients attending the primary care clinics of a university medical center in Manhatten. The social psychological variables operationalized here were expectations, values, entitlement and perceived occurrences; the three dimensions of satisfaction studied were doctor conduct, convenience and general satisfaction. The social psychological variables together were found to explain only a small proportion of the variance in satisfaction, although their contribution varied with the dimension of satisfaction. Expectations consistantly explained most of the variance in satisfaction ratings; particularly noteworthy was the direct effect of prior expectations of the doctor's conduct on subsequent satisfaction with that dimension of the care received. Values had little independent effect on satisfaction, and the combination of values and expectations (their interaction) was unrelated to satisfaction. Feelings of entitlement were also unrelated to satisfaction ratings. There was some support for the discrepancy model, which holds that the greater the discrepancy between perceived occurrences and prior expectations the less the satisfaction. The importance of carrying out further methodological studies aimed at developing reliable measures of these constructs is stressed."
3685922,"The study was based on 471 males, aged 19 to 20 years, who started their compulsory military service in three military bases in Southwest, Southeast and Northern Finland in February 1982. Of these subjects 48% smoked regularly and had smoked in the past three weeks. The correlation between the reported number of cigarettes smoked a day and serum thiocyanate was 0.60. Seventy-four per cent of the subjects whose best friend smoked, were current smokers compared with 24% of the others. Proportion of smokers was higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Among the 14 explanatory variables in the multivariate logistic analysis, family members' and friends' smoking, the place of residence, strenuousness of leisure-time physical activities, number of friends, rebelliousness, intelligence test score, and general pessimism were most strongly associated with the likelihood of being a current smoker. The model explained 87% of the smoking variance."
12718455,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the influence of rates of general practitioner visits on rates of hospitalisations. DESIGN: Ecological cross-sectional study of factors influencing hospitalisation rates. Aggregated data on primary care centre area level. SETTING: The county of Ostergotland, Sweden, with 3 hospital districts and 41 primary health care centres, and the hospital district of Jonkoping in the county of Jonkoping, Sweden, with 11 primary health care centres. OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalisation rates. RESULTS: Age and rates of outpatient hospital visits were the most important factors explaining the variation in rates of hospitalisations between the primary health care centre areas. Hospital districts, socioeconomic factors and rates of GP visits also influenced the rates of hospitalisations. CONCLUSION: When evaluating the influence of primary health care on the rates of hospitalisations, both socioeconomic factors and health care structure must be taken into consideration. Doing this, the rates of GP visits correlated negatively with the rates of hospitalisations."
18447989,"INTRODUCTION: Many factors have been reported as being responsible for starting smoking during school age, but it is still not well known which cognitive determinants may be used as predictive factors of tobacco use. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, study, including 417 pupils from 12 to 17 years, was carried out over three years in two rural Secondary Education Institutes in Castilla y Leon. The ESFA questionnaire was used, which included scales on attitudes and beliefs, social influences, self-efficacy, intention to smoke in the future and smoker behaviour. RESULTS: Of the 417 pupils studied, 36.7 % were smokers (38.6 % females and 34.4 % males). The mean of starting smoking was 12 years (11.83-12.15). In the initial analysis there was a clear relationship between cognitive determinants and smoker behaviour. The advertising and peer pressure lost predictive value after 3 years. The multivariate analysis showed that the determining factors of tobacco use are, besides age (OR = 3.85; 95 % CI, 1.27-11.64), to have a favourable attitude to smoking, (OR = 4.47; 95 % CI, 2.15-9.32), and the conduct perceived among peers (OR = 5.05; 95 % CI, 2.50-10.19). CONCLUSIONS: The determining factors that demonstrates a clear relationship with smoker behaviour are, age, favourable attitude of pupils towards smoking, and the perceived behaviour by smoker friends. Smoking prevention programs should take these factors into accounts when designing their activities."
11119174,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, sociodemographic determinants, and depression correlates of intimate partner abuse among an ethnically diverse population of women patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey in English and Spanish of a random sample of women patients aged 18 to 46 years. SETTING: Three public hospital primary care clinics (general internal medicine, family medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology) in San Francisco, Calif. PARTICIPANTS: We interviewed 734 (74%) of the 992 eligible participants. Thirty-one percent were non-Latina white, 31% African American, and 36% Latina. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using questions adapted from the Abuse Assessment Screen, we determined recent and lifetime history of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. Overall, 15% reported recent abuse by an intimate partner (in the preceding 12 months); lifetime prevalence was 51%. Recent abuse was more common among women aged 18 to 29 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.7), non-Latinas (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.9), and unmarried women (adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.7). The prevalence of abuse did not differ by education, employment, or medical insurance status of the women. Compared with women with no history of abuse, a greater proportion of recently abused women reported symptoms of depression (adjusted OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.2 to 5.5). CONCLUSIONS: Because a substantial proportion of women patients in primary care settings are abused, screening for partner abuse and depression is indicated. In contrast to other studies, lower socioeconomic status was not associated with partner abuse history."
12225453,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and investigate potential predictors of psychological distress in Filipino women living in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: The sample of n = 487 women (88% response rate) was drawn from Filipino organization membership lists and supplemented by snowball sampling. Participants were interviewed in their homes or at a community event in 1996/1997. Follow-up in 1997/1998 involved n = 346 women (71% response rate) who were interviewed either in their homes or by telephone. The two surveys included measurement of demographic, immigration, physical health, satisfaction with life in Australia and life event variables. The GHQ-28 was included in the follow-up survey as a measure of psychological distress. RESULTS: The proportion of women having an above threshold score (using the cut-off of 4/5) on the GHQ-28 was 23%. Women who were single, dissatisfied with life in Australia, had reported a major change in their financial situation, their relationship or their health in the year between surveys were significantly more likely to have an above threshold score. CONCLUSIONS: The level of mental distress among Filipinas in Queensland appears to be slightly higher than the levels reported in the general population but lower than other migrant groups. The determinants of mental distress in this population contrast with those in the general Australian population and other migrant groups. The social context of these determinants in Filipinas needs to be elicited for an understanding of these differences."
16153480,"OBJECTIVE: The social stigma of tuberculosis is much less studied than those of other diseases such as AIDS or mental problems. However, it has important implications on the affected person's well being and on the epidemic's control. Our study aims at exploring this social stigma in five local health systems of Nicaragua, prior to implementing interventions to reduce it. METHODS: Through in-depth interviews and focus groups involving stakeholders in the care of people affected by tuberculosis (PATBs), we analysed interactions between PATBs and family members, first line government health services' personnel, and community members. RESULTS: According to our results, the interaction between stakeholders and PATBs can be described as the intersection between two sets of contradictory feelings and attitudes: (a) feelings of affection and supportive attitudes toward PATBs opposed to the fear of being infected or that PATBs will infect others and, (b) confidence in PATBs considered to be unlucky opposed to mistrust of PATBs considered to be negligent. PATBs react against this mainly by hiding their condition which leads them to a, loss of confidence and depression. This intricate group of feelings and attitudes is influenced by two sets of determinants related to domination and power between stakeholders and issues of knowledge and information. CONCLUSION: Analysing tuberculosis-related social stigma as a social process enabled us to better understand some key social structural factors of health care system's organisation and identify locally acceptable interventions to reduce such stigma. The fact of analysing, in a more thorough study, some interventions in the currently changing social structural context of health care systems in Nicaragua will give us a better insight into the relevance of our analysis and the interventions' effectiveness in reducing the social stigma of tuberculosis."
17307954,"Women and men are different as regards their biology, the roles and responsibilities that society assigns to them and their position in the family and community. These factors have a great influence on causes, consequences and management of diseases and ill-health and on the efficacy of health promotion policies and programmes. This is confirmed by evidence on male-female differences in cause-specific mortality and morbidity and exposure to risk factors. Health promoting interventions aimed at ensuring safe and supportive environments, healthy living conditions and lifestyles, community involvement and participation, access to essential facilities and to social and health services need to address these differences between women and men, boys and girls in an equitable manner in order to be effective. The aim of this paper is to (i) demonstrate that health promotion policies that take women's and men's differential biological and social vulnerability to health risks and the unequal power relationships between the sexes into account are more likely to be successful and effective compared to policies that are not concerned with such differences, and (ii) discuss what is required to build a multisectoral policy response to gender inequities in health through health promotion and disease prevention. The requirements discussed in the paper include i) the establishment of joint commitment for policy within society through setting objectives related to gender equality and equity in health as well as health promotion, ii) an assessment and analysis of gender inequalities affecting health and determinants of health, iii) the actions needed to tackle the main determinants of those inequalities and iv) documentation and dissemination of effective and gender sensitive policy interventions to promote health. In the discussion of these key policy elements, we use illustrative examples of good practices from different countries around the world."
7258353,"In 1957 California began placing responsibility for public mental health services on county programs still vary widely in emphasis and size. The authors explored determinants of counties' unequal program developments using per capita expenditures as the measure of county services. Sociodemographic variables that help explain states' social program expenditures correlate weakly or not at all with county mental health expenditures. The most powerful predictor of these expenditures is number of psychiatrists per 10,000 population. Equal per capita expenditures, however, are not a reasonable goal; these can mask wide variations in program content, efficiency, and quality of care."
3175556,"The purpose of this study was to identify and rank potential determinants of respirator use among painters in the construction industry. As part of a health survey of union painters, 169 male spray painters were questioned about their own beliefs concerning the consequences of wearing cartridge respirators, as well as about the perceived attitudes of others in the workplace toward respirators. Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success."
14658092,"AIM: The paper is aimed at investigating what the actual topics of social-psychiatric research in German speaking countries are. METHOD: German and international journals covering psychiatry and adjacent disciplines were screened for articles dealing with social-psychiatric topics. All in all, 426 relevant articles were identified and subjected to a content analysis. RESULT: Almost one third of all articles was dealing with research on mental health services. Another research area that was strongly represented was epidemiology. By contrast, articles devoted to the study of psycho-social causes of mental disorders and psycho-social determinants of its course were rather rare. DISCUSSION: Possible reasons for the observed trends in social-psychiatric research are discussed. Potential risks for social psychiatry resulting from a too one-sided emphasis on health service research are pointed out."
2784523,"Three hundred forty-three family-practice patients were surveyed by questionnaire and medical record audit to evaluate the relationships between social support and medical care utilization. Social support was not associated with laboratory test ordering. The mean number of office visits per year was higher for patients with low versus high confidant support (4.71 vs. 3.81, P less than 0.10) and affective support (5.21 vs. 3.60, P less than 0.05). Mean total charges in 1 year were higher for patients with low versus high confidant support ($232 vs. $148, P less than 0.05) and affective support ($244 vs. $154, P less than 0.05). Poor confidant and affective support were both associated with longer visits. Structural measures of social support were not related significantly to any utilization indicator. These findings were maintained in multiple-regression models controlling for physical health and seven demographic characteristics. Second-order regression models revealed interaction by race, employment status, and sex. Blacks showed no effect of confidant support on office visits. Poor confidant support resulted in $201 more in total charges for the unemployed (P = 0.003) versus $49 more for the employed (P = 0.15). Women with low affective support had $119 more in charges (P = 0.001) versus $16 less for men (P = 0.82). The results suggest that low functional social supports are important determinants of increased medical service utilization and that they may have differential effects by race, sex, and employment status, all of which should be considered independently in future studies."
6706793,"Questionnaires addressing areas expected to relate to contraceptive use were completed by 230 female adolescents. Contraceptive use among the 130 sexually active subjects were predicted by a model composed of 12 scales assessing social permissiveness, costs and benefits of contraception, parent communication, boyfriend support, sex education and knowledge, attitudes about pregnancy and contraception, and access to contraception services. Scales from the predictive model which raise ideas for potential intervention strategies assessed parent communication, boyfriend support, and perceived costs and benefits related to contraception. Since there has been public concern that intervention programs for enhancing adolescent contraceptive use might also stimulate sexual activity, correlations were computed between the predictive scales and the measure of sexual experience among all 230 subjects. These data indicated that positive parent communication about sexuality and a perception of high benefits and low costs associated with contraceptive use were not positively correlated with sexual experience. Implications for the prevention of adolescent pregnancy are discussed with an emphasis on designing innovative sex education, improving parent-child communication, resolving conflicts in contraceptive decisionmaking, and supporting the role of boyfriends in contraceptive use."
16530864,"The purpose of this study was to investigate factors related to self-rated health and to mortality among 2490 community-living elderly. Respondents were followed for 7.3 years for all-cause mortality. To compare the relative impact of each variable, we employed logistic regression analysis for self-rated health and Cox hazard analysis for mortality. Cox analysis stratified by gender, follow-up periods, age group, and functional status was also employed. Series of analysis found that factors associated with self-rated health and with mortality were not identical. Psychological factors such as perceived isolation at home or 'ikigai (one aspect of psychological well-being)' were associated with self-rated health only. Age, functional status, and social relations were associated both with self-rated health and mortality after controlling for possible confounders. Illnesses and functional status accounted for 35-40% of variances in the fair/poor self-rated health. Differences by gender and functional status were observed in the factors related to self-rated health. Overall, self-rated health effect on mortality was stronger for people with no functional impairment, for shorter follow-up period, and for young-old age group. Although, illnesses and functional status were major determinants of self-rated health, economical, psychological, and social factors were also related to self-rated health."
6738684,"Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance."
15714217,"OBJECTIVE: To outline the rationale, objectives and strategies used in a systematically designed research programmme to study specific weight gain-inducing behaviours, their social-psychological as well as environmental determinants, and the effects of interventions aimed at the prevention of weight gain. DESIGN: The evidence for potential behavioural determinants and strategies to prevent weight gain was reviewed, and the methods applied within the Netherlands Research programme weight gain prevention (NHF-NRG) project were described. The project is designed according to the Intervention Mapping protocol. SETTING: The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: The main target groups are (a) adolescents (12-16 y) in secondary school, (b) young adults (20-40 y) at the workplace and (c) recently retired people (55-65 y) at home. INTERVENTIONS: Each intervention includes an individual component, in which computer-tailored information is provided. Additionally, interventions are aimed at changing environmental components. RESULTS: The short-term results of this project can be expected by the beginning of 2005. Guidelines for nationwide weight gain prevention, based on this research programme, will become available in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the few interventions that were evaluated to date, no robust conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of obesity prevention. The systematic and multidisciplinary design of the NHF-NRG programme enables the identification of potentially effective methods and strategies for the prevention of weight gain."
19079707,"BACKGROUND: Arbovirus diseases have emerged as a global public health concern. However, the impact of climatic, social, and environmental variability on the transmission of arbovirus diseases remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: Our goal for this study was to provide an overview of research development and future research directions about the interrelationship between climate variability, social and environmental factors, and the transmission of Ross River virus (RRV), the most common and widespread arbovirus disease in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search on climatic, social, and environmental factors and RRV disease. Potentially relevant studies were identified from a series of electronic searches. RESULTS: The body of evidence revealed that the transmission cycles of RRV disease appear to be sensitive to climate and tidal variability. Rainfall, temperature, and high tides were among major determinants of the transmission of RRV disease at the macro level. However, the nature and magnitude of the interrelationship between climate variability, mosquito density, and the transmission of RRV disease varied with geographic area and socioenvironmental condition. Projected anthropogenic global climatic change may result in an increase in RRV infections, and the key determinants of RRV transmission we have identified here may be useful in the development of an early warning system. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that there is a complex relationship between climate variability, social and environmental factors, and RRV transmission. Different strategies may be needed for the control and prevention of RRV disease at different levels. These research findings could be used as an additional tool to support decision making in disease control/surveillance and risk management."
12733243,"The purpose of this study was to identify how women with breast cancer perceive themselves as subjects in the process of making decisions on their own treatment. Two objectives were pursued: (a) to identify social and political determinants that, by affecting the socialization process of these women, might have influenced them in adopting a style of participation, and (b) to understand the meaning of such participation, as it was perceived by these women at the time they decided on their treatment options. The theoretical-methodological support adopted was that of Symbolic interactionism. The population sample included nine women with breast cancer. Semi-structured interviews allowed data to be gathered, and led to collecting further field notes and data from medical records. The hermeneutic dialectic method was employed as a compass for data interpretation, which made it possible to identify two broad theme units: 'construction of the female identity' and 'style of participation when choosing one's own treatment'. By means of these units it was possible to grasp what it meant for these women to deal with the issue of limits and, therefore, of ethics. In their view, they did not participate in the decision-making process, being regarded as unqualified to decide on the fate of their own bodies and lives. They were thus seen as obedient subjects in relation to medical decisions that are based on the principle of beneficence, where health care delivery is dependent on hierarchical social relationships and power structures are present between classes, genders, and levels of knowledge."
6676332,"A review of the literature indicates that until recently little attention has been paid to the effects of the environment on well-being among the aged. This study analyzes data relevant to both the individual and his or her environment from a large (N = 2265) national sample of low- and middle-income elderly. A recursive causal model is presented; the results indicate that perceived health and housing satisfaction contribute the most to well-being among the elderly. In addition, for men and women home ownership was not found to affect well-being positively. For men who owned their own homes lower scores on well-being were reported. The findings also indicate that while the quantity of neighbor interaction benefits the well-being of men, women benefit more from the positive sentiments of sociability in the neighborhood. This study emphasizes the importance of environmental satisfaction and neighborhood sociability as key determinants of well-being in later life."
14722836,"A positive parent-child relationship is one of the most important determinants of a healthy cognitive, emotional and social development. The relationship from parent to child is determined by parenting styles. Parenting styles are characterised by the two dimensions parental attitudes and rearing practices. The development and the psychometric properties of a questionnaire on parental attitudes and rearing practices (FEPS), which contains an extended version of the Parental Bonding Instrument by Parker et al. (PBI, 1979) and two scales on parental reinforcement and punishment behaviour, is presented. In a sample of 457 women and 159 men factorial and item analysis revealed four scales (care, autonomy, low punishment and low material reinforcement). The care dimension contained items of immaterial reinforcement on the positive pole and items of coldness and ignorance as means of punishment on the negative pole. Based on findings from its first application in a clinical study it can be assumed that the FEPS differentiates between clinical and non-clinical populations. Additionally, varying patterns of the four scales may emerge as risk factors for the development of certain psychiatric/psychological problems."
12799782,"BACKGROUND: Much has been written about the determinants of psychiatric hospitalisation, chiefly for psychotic patients in an emergency. This paper reports the results of a comparative study between in-patients and pathological subjects from the general population. The aim of this work is to evidence the psycho-social determinants of hospitalisation in a psychiatric department for neurotic disorders. METHODS: This study was conducted on a socially fairly privileged population which was, therefore, also fairly homogeneous. The subjects from the two groups were assessed clinically using standardised instruments both for diagnosis (SCAN) and for psycho-social variables (Stressful Life Events: LEDS; Social Support and Self-esteem: Pearlin checklist; care itinerary). RESULTS: Following the analysis of frequency and a multivariate logistic regression analysis, four risk factors for hospitalisation for neurotic disorders were evidenced, including: severity of neurotic disorders, taking a long time to consult a specialist after first onset of anxiety disorders, poor social support, and having experienced one or more provoking agents (Brown and Harris methodology) in the year previous to hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: The severity of the mental pathology is largely responsible for hospitalisation in neurotic patients as it is in psychotic patients, but it is not the only determinant for hospitalisation."
29357164,"This study introduces a new approach to identify determinants of competitive success in small mammals. An experimental population of Clethrionomys rufocanus consisting of laboratory-raised individuals with known origin and life history was introduced to a realistic competitive situation in the field. Successful females could be distinguished from nonsuccessful females on the basis of four individual attributes measured 25 d after they were released on the study plot, whereas males could not. The most consistent determinant of competitive success seemed to be the sex ratio of the litters in which females were born. Successful females originated from litters with a strongly female-biased sex ratio. These results are considered in the light of recent research on the consequences of prenatal conditions on female social behavior."
3317879,"Social science research on cultural issues in maternal and child health has stressed some aspects and neglected others. From the perspective of both policy applications and theory development, new research efforts could profitably be directed to the following areas: cultural adjustments to changed energy and nutrient requirements in pregnancy and lactation; maternal illness; the mother/infant dyadic interaction; emic views of growth and development; determinants of infant and young child feeding; management of childhood illnesses; popular medicine and childhood illnesses; intra-household food distribution; household composition and maternal and child health; and macrolevel/microlevel linkages and health."
18272938,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential risk factors for developing complications and their magnitude during the antenatal period. METHODOLOGY: The data used in this paper came from a prospective survey in rural areas of Bangladesh conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Research for Promotion of Essential and Reproductive Health and Technologies (BIRPERHT) between November 1992 and December 1993. The differential patterns were analyzed for respondents' selected characteristics, and multivariate analysis was performed employing logistic regression and proportional hazards models for life-threatening and high-risk complications during pregnancy. RESULTS: For life-threatening complications during pregnancy, several factors emerged as potential risk factors, such as number of the pregnancy, age at marriage, duration of pregnancy, economic status and history of anemia prior to the index pregnancy. The last two covariates were associated only in the proportional hazards. Potential risk factors for high-risk complications during pregnancy were level of education, age at marriage, wanted pregnancy, duration of pregnancy and economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Health planners and policy makers in developing countries are trying to facilitate health services at the doorsteps of rural people. Our findings will help them understand the magnitude and underlying determinants of maternal morbidities and help their health planning process to reduce both life-threatening and high-risk complications during the antenatal period. Early age at marriage needs to be prevented through encouragement of girls' education as well as through increased social awareness programs. An effective quick referral mechanism should be developed to provide emergency services to high risk-groups. Finally, the importance of additional food supplements needs to be promoted during antenatal care visits as well as through mass media in order to reach people living in remote areas of rural Bangladesh."
3288230,"Research to develop and ensure diffusion of smoking prevention programs must (a) be based on an appreciation of the social, psychological, and biological determinants at each stage in the onset process, (b) disentangle major interactions between program content, participant, provider, and setting factors as they determine impact, and (c) ensure both that diffusion is based on empirically grounded principles and that the process is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated. Sufficient evidence supports the tentative conclusion that social influence curricula can be efficacious--at least with some youth. However, we lack key information for diffusion, in particular concerning provider and setting factors. Thus, a cautious advance to diffusion research is recommended, noting that there is much we do not know, and that the public health need for applications must be balanced with continuing research to clarify for whom and under what circumstances current curricula work. At the same time, there should be strong continuing research to improve current interventions, especially for high risk populations."
2738317,"This study examined the personal and environmental factors related to the activity involvement of older people living in congregate residential settings. A sample of 1,428 residents in 42 such settings provided information about their activities, functioning, and background. Measures of facility features were also available. These data show that individuals are more likely to participate in facility-organized activities in settings where overall resident participation is greater, the average functioning of residents is lower, staffing is higher, and the program more structured. Participation in facility activities is not related to personal characteristics. In contrast, involvement in resident-initiated activities, both in the facility and in the community, is related to personal characteristics (being functionally intact, female, and better educated) and to facility features (larger size, lower staffing, greater autonomy and cohesiveness). The impact of some features varies depending on the functional capacity of the individual resident."
18032810,"Poverty and social exclusion are important socio-economic variables which are often taken for granted while considering ill-health effects. Social exclusion mainly refers to the inability of our society to keep all groups and individuals within reach of what we expect as society to realize their full potential. Marginalization of certain groups or classes occurs in most societies including developed countries and perhaps it is more pronounced in underdeveloped countries. In the Indian context, caste may be considered broadly as a proxy for socio-economic status and poverty. In the identification of the poor, scheduled caste and scheduled tribes and in some cases the other backward castes are considered as socially disadvantaged groups and such groups have a higher probability of living under adverse conditions and poverty. The health status and utilization patterns of such groups give an indication of their social exclusion as well as an idea of the linkages between poverty and health. In this review, we examined broad linkages between caste and some select health/health utilization indicators. We examined data on prevalence of anaemia, treatment of diarrhoea, infant mortality rate, utilization of maternal health care and childhood vaccinations among different caste groups in India. The data based on the National Family Health Survey II (NFHS II) highlight considerable caste differentials in health. The linkages between caste and some health indicators show that poverty is a complex issue which needs to be addressed with a multi-dimensional paradigm. Minimizing the suffering from poverty and ill-health necessitates recognizing the complexity and adopting a perspective such as holistic epidemiology which can challenge pure technocentric approaches to achieve health status."
19067262,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the use of psychotropic drugs and alcohol among non-institutionalised elderly adults in Germany. METHODS: Using data from the 1998 German National Health Interview and Examination Survey, we analysed patterns of current psychotropic drug and alcohol use among 726 male and 879 female survey participants between the ages of 60 and 79. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with alcohol consumption and psychotropic drug use. RESULTS: The overall weighted last-week prevalence was 20.1% for the use of psychotropic drugs, 47.3% for the use of alcohol, 15.1% for risky drinking, and 7.6% for combined psychotropic drug and alcohol use. Factors significantly related to psychotropic drug use included female sex, older age, poor health status and polypharmacy. Male sex, smoking, higher social status, better health status and living alone were determinants of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other European countries, overall psychotropic drug use among the elderly in Germany is slightly lower, whereas alcohol use as risky drinking and concurrent use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs are highly prevalent. It should be of particular concern to health professionals that people at high risk for psychotropic drug use include the most vulnerable subgroups among the elderly."
2660090,"The United States must improve its efforts to reduce teen pregnancy. We occupy an alarming position in the developed world from the standpoint of the magnitude of the pregnancy issue. While our society promotes sexuality to sell all sorts of consumer goods, it still refuses for the most part to make contraceptives familiar and available to sexually active teens. The youngest adolescents, 10 to 14 years, are having sex and babies at an increasing rate. Their children will have limited futures. Only by stepping up our efforts to prevent early pregnancy will we make possible a life of opportunity and choice for the young people of our country. Consequences will be costly and tragic if we do not."
6929960,"An analysis is made of the contraceptive practice of 100 women prior to abortion. Half the women were not using any method during the month they became pregnant. Problems with the pill, risk-taking behaviour and fears of infertility, were the commonest reasons for non-use. In the 50 percent who were using a method, failure was most commonly due to human error and to the use of less reliable methods. Psychological and social factors were seen to be important determinants of behaviour. This study emphasises the need for remedial action."
6486251,"On the basis of Western studies suggesting that infants with difficult temperaments are at greater risk for behavioral and physical disorders, the author postulated that Masai infants with difficult temperaments would be at greater risk in the harsh environment created by the sub-Saharan drought in 1974, which disrupted the life of the Masai people of East Africa and resulted in increased infant mortality. Two groups of infants with difficult and easy temperaments were defined and followed. Contrary to expectations, mortality was greater for the infants with easy temperaments. The infant's contribution, child-rearing orientation, and feeding practices were factors influencing survival."
3990300,"Contemporary theorists view many alcohol effects as complex functions of a number of interacting variables ranging from pharmacological factors (e.g., limb of the blood alcohol curve), environmental factors (e.g., setting) and dispositional factors (e.g., individually held expectations concerning the effects of alcohol). To examine this general model, the joint effects on subjective state of beverage (alcohol vs placebo), of setting (alone vs group) and of individual differences in alcohol expectancies were examined in a sample of 98 men social drinkers. Assessment of subjective state included measures of both mood and perceived physical sensations. The results demonstrated the complex determinants of subjective effects of alcohol and illustrated the difficulty of making strong generalizations concerning the subjective effects of alcohol. Alcohol consumption, alcohol expectancies and setting appear to have both independent and interacting effects on subjective state. These effects appear to vary in importance across the types of effects considered and the time since drinking."
2489983,"The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods."
12899910,"This paper represents an investigation into the determinants of young children's quality of life (QOL) in Thailand. The empirical work is based upon a sample of 498 children (aged 5-8); 220 were urban children and 278 children of construction workers in Bangkok. Their QOL was assessed using a new self-report QOL measure for children. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the father's income and education, type of school, mode of transportation to school, and the amount of time that the child spent on extra study courses were significant explanatory variables. It was found that these factors had different influences on the QOL of urban children and those of construction workers. Extra sport-related activities and extra work (other than housework) improved the QOL of urban children, while the QOL of construction workers' children was directly linked to father's education and income. This result is consistent with income having a diminishing marginal effect on the QOL of children. There is also evidence that amongst construction workers' children, boys have a lower QOL than girls. The different causal explanations for the QOL of urban and construction workers' children suggests that it is context specific, and what impacts one group of children's QOL within a particular context may not impact another group in a different situation. This has important policy implications. Throughout the study we could find no significant impact of health on QOL-neither chronic, acute nor severe illness has any significant impact on QOL. This is consistent with the hypothesis that QOL is influenced by expectations (Social Science and Medicine 41 (10) (1995) 1403). Findings of the effects of social and environmental factors on children's QOL are new in this field and should be further investigated."
6656327,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension."
11042429,"The study aimed to determine the factors associated with a delay in seeking health care for symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among a sample of 1482 patients attending STD clinics. Of the sample 78% were male, 58% sought help from the clinic within the first 6 days of noticing symptoms, 24% waited between 7 and 10 days and 17% waited longer than 10 days before seeking health care. Patients who delayed were those who treated themselves prior to seeking health care, who were female, whose friends waited before seeking treatment, who held misconceptions regarding the cause of STDs, who perceived STDs not to be serious and who valued personal autonomy in sexual behaviours less and had less positive outcome expectations of refusing sex. The data suggest that targeted interventions should be directed specifically at women and the youth. Early health care seeking could be facilitated through improved basic knowledge regarding STDs, control over one's own sexual behaviour and social support for early health care seeking."
11419836,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study cross-cultural variations in the impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on health-related quality of life by an international comparison of disease-related concerns. METHODS: Item and factor scores on the Rating Form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Concerns and overall mean concern levels were compared by analysis of variance among 2002 IBD patients in eight countries. RESULTS: The overall level of concern varied from 51 out of 100 in Portugal to 19 in Sweden, with intermediate scores for Italy (43), Canada (40), United States (39), France (39), Austria (33), and Israel (25). Having surgery, an ostomy, the uncertain nature of the disease, and medication side effects were each rated among the first five in importance in six countries. Other items varied considerably. For example, concern regarding pain and suffering was high in Israel and low in Portugal, whereas concern over developing cancer was low in Italy. Concern over financial issues and access to high-quality health care were inversely associated with measures of national economic prosperity. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Cross-cultural comparisons of patient concerns related to IBD are feasible using translated scales. 2) Reporting tendencies vary greatly; within Europe, patients from southern countries report greater overall concern. 3) The complications and the variable evolution of disease elicit general concern, but the importance of specific issues varies among countries. 4) The reasons for national differences may have social, cultural, and/or economic determinants with relevance to the patient-physician relationship, patient education, and therapeutic decision making."
3435040,"A cohort of 1163 pregnant women in two small towns in South Wales, UK, was identified and followed until the children born to them were five years of age. Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers. There effects decreased with age but there were still residual effects at age five years."
28564235,"One component of sexual selection is sperm competition. It has been reasoned that the intensity of sperm competition may be reflected in the relative testicular sizes of animals. Among males residing in multimale breeding systems, testicular size is relatively larger than among males residing in unimale mating systems. Information on whether differences in testicular size within a species can account for differences in male reproductive success is unavailable for natural populations of primates. A population of six troops of savanna baboons in Kenya was surveyed for morphometric analysis, and one of these troops was the subject of extensive behavioral observations afterwards. Testicular weights could not be obtained, but measurements of linear dimensions were transformed into volumetric estimates. Male weight accounted for 30% of the variance in testicular volume. Neither body size nor testicular volume was associated with differences in male reproductive activity. The outcome of fights over access to females could not be related to male body size, and ejaculatory patterns of males were independent of testicle size. Both sperm competition and aggressive competition intensified during the four-day optimum conception period, but fights over access to consort females were infrequent. Among savanna baboons, the probability of an ejaculation resulting in a conception is fairly low, which may account for the infrequency of injurious fights. Although testicle size influences sperm production, it does not influence either the timing of mating or the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa, and both of these factors probably account for a substantial fraction of the variance in male baboon paternity. Sperm competition is an adjunct to agonistic competition as a mechanism affecting male baboon reproductive success. It is concluded that male reproductive success in baboons is affected more by social factors than by morphological traits associated with size."
12179093,"Female migration in Thailand, especially from rural areas to the Bangkok Metropolis, is an important migratory phenomenon which leads to an unfavorable population distribution. Generally the migration level in Thailand is low but many women from the rural areas, especially from the Northeast Region, move to Bangkok Metropolis to seek work. Findings reveal that the majority of migrants are young, single women. Women migrants find it relatively easy to participate in the Bangkok labor market. Service work is the main source of employment. For the temporary migrants, it was found that those from the Northeast Region tend to return to their hometown in higher proportion than those from other regions. This was particularly so among young women migrants."
3633877,"Value-expectancy theory proposed by Lewin states that motivation for behaviour is based on the probability that a given action or behaviour will achieve a valued or desired outcome. Becker and Maiman elaborated on this theory and developed a model to study compliance by considering the influence of sociobehavioural determinants in the inter-relationship of motivating and modifying factors which dictate human behaviour. The Becker-Maiman framework was used to determine factors which influence the use of the nursing care plan by staff nurses. From interviews with staff nurses, surveys of nurses attending workshops on NCPs and review of literature a model was developed for use in examining the nursing care planning behaviour of nurses."
3395696,"Specialization--the predisposition to violent behavior persisting over an extended period of time--is considered in relation to congenital factors, to determine whether such factors are contributory to this predisposition. Congenital factors include inherited characteristics and perinatal experiences. Evidence for inherited characteristics in criminal behavior is approached through family studies, the study of twins, and adoption studies. Of those three, adoption studies provide the most fertile ground for study. Predisposition toward criminal behavior is noted to be limited to property crime. The second congenital factor is the perinatal experience. Minor physical anomalies appear to be strongly related to hyperactivity and later criminal involvement, but only if the offender was reared in an unstable, nonintact family. Indices of perinatal problems relate to later violent crime, rather than to property crime, and may have as their basis some form of trauma occurring very early in life."
7380104,"The effects of social isolation on the behavior of juvenile domestic cats were assessed by rearing 4 male and 4 female infant kittens in each of the following rearing conditions: (1) mother-littermate; (2) mother-only; (3) brooder-littermate; and (4) brooder-only. They were then tested twice a week individually and twice a week socially from 2 to 6 1/2 months of age in a playroom, utilizing multiple categories of behavior. The mother-only-reared juveniles were hyperactive in both object play (when tested individually) and social play. The brooder-only-reared kittens displayed enhanced socially directed behavior and were generally hypergregarious, whereas the brooder-littermate-reared kittens displayed retarded social behavior. Observations indicated that littermate-deprived kittens did not learn social communication skills and that some prolonged separation effects existed for littermate-reared kittens. The results suggest that the determinants of social play are more complex than the determinants of object play."
19323024,"Local health determinants, perceived by a local community in Mueang District, Khon Kaen Province, were explored using a qualitative approach during November 2006. Health determinants could be classified into three categories: environmental, individual and family, and institutional factors. Community perspectives on health determinants included flooding, habits of lottery buying, fluctuation of vegetable market prices, and job opportunities. Community participants gave high value to the social determinants of health as opposed to environmental/biomedical factors, considering that such conditions could positively build social cohesion and even lead to better well-being. They prioritized flooding as a major environmental health determinant that affected villagers' physical and mental health, as well as family income. For social health determinants, they also indicated that many villagers were addicted to lottery buying that led to mental and financial problems within families."
3234016,"This sub-study of the WHO Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders research project was aimed at characterizing the behavioral and expressive qualities of schizophrenia in two highly diverse cultures. Early research has indicated that the core elements involving affect, perceptual and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are highly similar in form in most cultures of the world. Much of the cross-cultural literature emphasizes, however, strong differences in the ways in which schizophrenia is actually expressed and manifested in different settings. The basic methodology for psychiatric description and diagnosis in the WHO program was the Present State Examination. In five of the field centers a method for investigating the expressive quality and the social behavior of patients in their own communities through the eyes of significant others was applied. This method was then subjected to psychometric tests of cross-cultural applicability and found to be valid for comparing behavior across settings. The expressive patterns of the Indian and Nigerian patients were studied from two perspectives. Indian schizophrenics were described by family members as manifesting a more affective and ""self-centered"" orientation; the Nigerian patients presented with a highly suspicious, bizarre, anxious quality to the basic behavioral pattern. The main features of pathology were in general accord with the descriptions of indigenous psychiatrists. The special qualities of the psychosis in the two cultures were interpreted against the background of traditional psychopathological and anthropologic theories concerning the psychodynamics and the influence of differing social conflictual themes in the two cultures. Analysis of psychopathology in this manner was found to enhance understanding of underlying mechanisms and the role of cultural conflicts in its expression."
3874140,"Criminal homicide has increased steadily during the past two decades to account today for more than 1 percent of deaths in the United States. After providing background information on the rates and patterns of homicide in the U.S., the author uses the literature to present a twofold discussion of factors affecting the incidence of homicide: those that act as a deterrence to crime, such as punishment, and environmental and biological factors that can interact in a complex way to produce violence and murder. Examples of these latter factors include firearms, drug and alcohol abuse, genetics, race, psychiatric disorders, metabolic states, the economy, geographic region, the media, and political instability."
18950922,"Research on societal determinants of health suggests the existence of an ""inverse hazard law,"" which we define as: ""The accumulation of health hazards tends to vary inversely with the power and resources of the populations affected."" Yet, little empirical research has systematically investigated this topic, including in relation to workplace exposures. We accordingly designed the United for Health study (Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts, 2003-2004) to investigate the joint distribution and health implications of workplace occupational hazards (dust, fumes, chemical, noise, ergonomic strain) and social hazards (racial discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace abuse). Focusing on blood pressure as our health outcome, we found that among the 1202 low-income multi-racial/ethnic working class participants in our cohort - of whom 40% lived below the US poverty line - 79% reported exposure to at least one social hazard and 82% to at least one high-exposure occupational hazard. Only sexual harassment, the least common social hazard, was associated with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) among the women workers. By contrast, no statistically significant associations were detectable between the other additional highly prevalent social and occupational hazards and SBP; we did, however, find suggestive evidence of an association between SBP and response to unfair treatment, implying that in a context of high exposure, differential susceptibility to the exposure matters. These results interestingly contrast to our prior findings for this same cohort, in which we found associations between self-reported experiences of racial discrimination and two other health outcomes: psychological distress and cigarette smoking. Likely explanations for these contrasting findings include: (a) the differential etiologic periods and pathways involving somatic health, mental health, and health behaviors, and (b) the high prevalence of adverse exposures, limiting the ability to detect significant associations. As clarified by the ""inverse hazard law,"" to understand health inequities, research is needed that contrasts exposures and health status population-wide, not just among those most inequitably exposed."
11028281,"In a community sample of 394 elderly aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed. Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed. The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person. In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time. 88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year. 55.8% took at least one medicine each day. The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine. Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor. Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life. Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support. There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine."
19629855,"OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the presence of sex preference and its influence on contraceptive use among the Garo, a matrilineal community, of Bangladesh. METHODS: In this study, 223 currently married Garo women were interviewed, selected purposively from two districts of Bangladesh, where most of the Garo people live. A binary logistic regression model was fitted to explore the determinants of current use of contraceptives among the Garo community. RESULTS: About 80% of the Garo women were currently using contraceptive methods, which was much higher than the contraceptive prevalence at the national level (55.8%). However, the use of modern male methods was very low in that community. Regression analysis revealed that the strong preference for girls was a significant determinant of contraceptive use. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the Garo apply contraception more than the Bangladeshi community in general, their strong preference for girls may restrain its success. Family planning information can be designed so as not to challenge the matrilineal structure of the society and both spouses counselled together to promote also modern male methods."
19286838,"BACKGROUND: We used case-control design to compare utilization of health and social services between older decedents and survivors, and to identify the respective impact of age and closeness of death on the utilization of services. METHODS: Data were derived from multiple national registers. The sample consisted of 56,001 persons, who died during years 1998-2000 at the age of > or = 70, and their pairs matched on age, gender and municipality of residence, who were alive at least 2 years after their counterpart's death. Data include use of hospitals, long-term care and home care. Decedents' utilization within 2 years before death and survivors' utilization in the same period of time was assessed in three age groups (70-79, 80-89 and > or = 90 years) and by gender. RESULTS: Decedents used hospital and long-term care more than their surviving counterparts, but the time patterns were different. In hospital care the differences between decedents and survivors rose in the last months of the study period, whereas in long-term care there were clear differences during the whole 2-year period. The differences were smaller in the oldest age group than in younger age groups. CONCLUSION: Closeness of death is an important predictor of health and social service use in old age, but its influence varies between age groups. Not only the changing age structure, but also the higher average age at death affects the future need for services."
17435206,"BACKGROUND: In earlier studies, determinants of socioeconomic gradient in mobility have not been measured comprehensively. AIM: To assess the contribution of chronic morbidity, obesity, smoking and physical workload to inequalities in mobility. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on 2572 persons (76% of a nationally representative sample of the Finnish population aged > or = 55 years). Mobility limitations were measured by self-reports and performance rates. RESULTS: According to a wide array of self-reported and test-based indicators, persons with a lower level of education showed more mobility limitations than those with a higher level. The age-adjusted ORs for limitations in stair climbing were threefold in the lowest-educational category compared with the highest one (OR 3.3 in men and 2.9 in women for self-reported limitations, and 3.5 in men and 2.2 in women for test-based limitations). When obesity, smoking, work-related physical loading and clinically diagnosed chronic diseases were simultaneously accounted for, the educational differences in stair-climbing limitations vanished or were greatly diminished. In women, obesity contributed most to the differences, followed by a history of physically strenuous work, knee and hip osteoarthritis and cardiovascular diseases. In men, diabetes, work-related physical loading, musculoskeletal diseases, obesity and smoking contributed substantially to the inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Great educational inequalities exist in various measures of mobility. Common chronic diseases, obesity, smoking and workload appeared to be the main pathways from low education to mobility limitations. General health promotion using methods that also yield good results in the lowest-educational groups is thus a good strategy to reduce the disparities in mobility."
15046963,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the personality dimensions, neuroticism and alexithymia, and the affective state dimensions measuring negative and positive affect significantly contributed to changes over time in the number of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) reported. METHODS: A total of 318 patients, presenting to their primary care physician with MUS, participated in the study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess to what extent neuroticism, alexithymia, negative affect and positive affect independently contributed to (1) increase vs. decrease in the number of symptoms reported, and (2) the presence of a consistently high number of MUS over a 6-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Negative affect was the strongest determinant of changes in the number of symptoms reported. In addition, low positive affect significantly contributed to changes in the number of symptoms over time. Next to negative affect, the dimension of alexithymia measuring difficulty in identifying feelings (DIF) was found to be an independent predictor of a consistently high number of MUS. Neither neuroticism nor general alexithymia independently contributed to changes in the number of symptoms over time or to symptom persistence. CONCLUSIONS: Negative affect is an important determinant of MUS, because it contributes both to symptom evolution and symptom persistence. Positive affect has a beneficial effect on somatic symptom evolution, whereas the alexithymia dimension measuring DIF clearly contributes to the prediction of symptom persistence."
17888013,"The aim of this study was to evaluate determinants of consultation for migraine in a representative sample of the French general adult population. We interviewed 10,032 subjects, of whom 1534 fulfilled the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine. These were categorized into migraine, probable migraine and chronic migraine. Information was collected on consultation experience; 436 subjects (28.4%) had never consulted for headache, 473 (30.8%) were in active consultation and 625 (40.7%) had previously consulted but lapsed. Subjects with chronic migraine showed the highest active consultation rates (51.8%). All subjects completed rating instruments for headache [Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6], psychiatric (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scale) and psychological [Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), Brief COPE Inventory and Coping Strategy Questionnaire] variables. The strongest determinants of active consultation were BIPQ scores, HIT-6 scores and migraine type. Consultation was associated with maladaptive coping strategies (social support, emotional expression and acceptance). Determinants of remaining in consultation were catastrophizing coping scores and previous consultation experience."
6393872,"Research in mental retardation in the GDR has been influenced primarily by the brain damage--development theory, which assumes biological as well as social determinants in human development. The theory was based on the results of brain damage (encephalopathy) research, which distinguishes between primary and secondary symptoms of mental retardation. The importance of social factors such as family conditions for development was demonstrated in a variety of studies, including research with adopted children. Positive results have been achieved with early education programming for developmentally disabled children, as well as with medical treatment for some genetically induced metabolic disorders. Results from longitudinal studies suggest that intelligence continues to develop in educable mentally retarded adolescents. New diagnostic methods have been developed; test of motor skills, visuomotor coordination, and a developmental test for young infants. Further developments of traditional school entrance diagnosis for special education classes is reported. Several studies show that there has been some success in the vocational and social integration of mentally retarded persons in the GDR."
7020985,"The association between reported alcohol intake and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration is examined in an effort to establish whether it was a cause-and-effect basis. A cross-sectional descriptive study of several populations reveals a strong and consistent dose-response pattern: Social drinkers have mean HDL cholesterol levels that are higher than those of teetotalers by as much as 33%. Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period. The evidence supports the conclusion that alcohol habits are probably one of the determinants of plasma HDL cholesterol level. A clarification of the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical medicine awaits future clinical efforts."
11128887,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the domain-specific quality of life (QOL), including physical, social and role functioning, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health domains, and to assess QOL's clinical and sociodemographic correlates in patients who were disabled by ischemic stroke. DESIGN: One-year prospective study of an inception cohort of patients with first-ever brain infarction. SETTING: Stroke unit of a neurologic department of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Eighty-five consecutive patients (36 women, 49 men; mean age +/- SD, 65+/-12.5 yr) with first-ever stroke of a mild to moderate nature caused by brain infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were examined at 3 and 12 months poststroke. QOL was measured using the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. The variables studied were lateralization of cerebral lesion, neurologic and functional status, depression, age, gender, marital status, and living conditions. Depression was evaluated according to the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition. Neurologic impairment was assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale, performance in activities of daily living by the Barthel index, and the intellectual deterioration by the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: QOL was poorer for the patients with mild to moderate stroke impairments at 3 months poststroke. The test domains most prone to being affected were physical functioning, physical role limitations, vitality, and general health. Only the domains of physical functioning and physical role limitations improved during the follow-up at 1 year. Depression, although mostly minor, was the most important reason for impaired QOL. Depression, being married, and age emerged as significant independent contributors to the low score value of vitality. Depression and being married were related to the low score value of physical role limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke affects QOL, impairing its physical and psychosocial domains. The most important determinants of low QOL seem to be depression and being married. These findings provide new challenges for stroke rehabilitation, calling for identification of patients and spouses in need of supportive services."
12340179,"Using a sociodemographic model of the determinants of illegitimacy rates, a multivariate regression analysis of annual change in age-specific Swedish illegitimacy rates is applied to the 1911-74 period. The proxy measure of change in sexual activity was significant for all age groups. Legitimation rates for out-of-wedlock conceived births were significant for all ages except teenagers, and the final predictor, women's status, was significant for all ages except women 35-44. Explained variance for annual change was highest among ages 20-24 (66%), 25-29 (66%), and 30-34 (63%) and lower among teens (34%) and women 35-44 (47%). These results support earlier research that used a sociodemographic model to explain post-World War II change in cross-national illegitimacy rates among 23 developed countries."
12084810,"BACKGROUND: The present study explored factors that influenced older individuals' subjective perception of hearing problems. In addition to objectively screened hearing ability, nonauditory factors such as stressful life conditions (visual impairment, chronic disease, disability, and recent stressful life events), neuroticism, and social resources were hypothesized to be predictors of self-perceived hearing problems. METHODS: These hypotheses were tested with a hierarchical regression model using a stratified sample of 425 community-dwelling older individuals (mean age = 72.2). RESULTS: Individuals with more recent stressful life events, higher levels of neuroticism, and less emotional support reported greater hearing problems after controlling for objectively screened hearing. In addition to the main effects, a significant interaction was observed between neuroticism and screened hearing, indicating that the combination of poor hearing and high neuroticism increased the level of self-perceived hearing problems. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the effects of nonauditory factors should be taken into account in the application of self-assessed measures of hearing problems."
3210110,"A prospective study was conducted to determine the effects of maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy on the birth weight of fetuses in an unselected study population. Several confounding factors were taken into account. The main factors associated with an increase of birth weight of both sexes were gestational age at birth and parity. Both maternal smoking and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy had the effect of decreasing the birth weight of female fetuses, whereas smoking, but not alcohol, had a decreasing effect on birth weight of male and female fetuses."
19377537,"Alarming trends in childhood obesity even among preschool children have re-focused attention on the importance of physical activity in this age group. With this increased attention comes the need to identify the amount and type of physical activity appropriate for optimal development of preschool children. The purpose of this paper is to provide the scientific evidence to support a link between physical activity and biological and psychosocial development during early childhood (ages 2-5 years). To do so, we summarize pertinent literature informing the nature of the physical activity required to promote healthy physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development during these early years. A particular focus is on the interaction between physical activity and motor skill acquisition. Special emphasis is also placed on the nature of physical activity that promotes healthy weight gain during this period of childhood. The paper also discusses the strongest determinants of physical activity in preschool-age children, including the role of the child's environment (e.g., family, child-care, and socio-economic status).

Interestingly, we do find a significant negative correlation between contact rate and the distance between the two colonies in susceptibility to a spectrum of parasite strains. This cannot be explained by either of the a priori alternatives so we propose two further testable hypotheses to explain our results."

2614820,"Social and psychological variables are used to explain why young people become cigarette smokers, whereas biological factors have been virtually ignored as possible determinants of that behavior. In this study, salivary testosterone was positively associated with cigarette smoking among 201 subjects 12-14 years of age. This finding suggests that testosterone should be included in future considerations of adolescent cigarette smoking."
16299386,"Myxococcus xanthus has two different mechanisms of motility, adventurous (A) motility, which permits individual cells to glide over solid surfaces, and social (S) motility, which permits groups of cells to glide. To identify the genes involved in S-gliding motility, we mutagenized a delta aglU (A-) strain with the defective transposon, magellan-4, and screened for S- mutants that form nonmotile colonies. Sequence analysis of the sites of the magellan-4 insertions in these mutants and the alignment of these sites with the M. xanthus genome sequence show that two-thirds of these insertions lie within 27 of the 37 nonessential genes known to be required for social motility, including those necessary for the biogenesis of type IV pili, exopolysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide. The remaining insertions also identify 31 new, nonessential genes predicted to encode both structural and regulatory determinants of S motility. These include three tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, several regulators of transcription that may control the expression of genes involved in pilus extension and retraction, and additional enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism. Three insertions that abolish S motility lie within genes predicted to encode glycolytic enzymes, suggesting that the signal for pilus retraction may be a simple product of exopolysaccharide catabolism."
15694708,"This paper suggests to rigorously test the hypothesis that there are causal links between visible light and the development of leukaemia and other cancers in children. Light can be considered as a candidate risk factor because it suppresses melatonin biosynthesis which may play a role in a series of anticancer defences. Indeed, melatonin may offer some protection against all ""hallmarks of cancer"" [i.e., self-sufficiency in growth signals; insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals; evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis); limitless replicative potential; sustained angiogenesis; tissue invasion and metastasis] recently suggested by Hanahan and Weinberg. Already ongoing investigations into the possible nexus of light, endocrine systems and the development of cancers will be further fueled by recent insights into photoreception and -- transduction, including the discovery of ""novel"" photoreceptors in the eye. Among a variety of different photosensory tasks, these receptors constitute crucial gates for light information from the environment which is employed for the temporal organization of our physiology and it has been proposed that chronodisruption, i.e., a significant disturbance of the coordination and thus order of biological rhythms, could contribute to the development of cancers. With regard to public health, the pervasive exposures to light -- at work and in homes -- imply that visible radiation could be a strong risk factor defined epidemiologically as a causal contributor to disease in a large proportion of cases. Importantly, if light were to be corroborated as a contributor to cancers in children, it would be amenable to manipulations with the perspective of reducing inherent risks significantly. In fact, it could be much easier -- and much more effective -- to reevaluate and modify lighting systems than to manipulate other possible determinants of the chronic processes of cancer such as genetic, nutritional or lifestyle factors."
18799005,"BACKGROUND: This article aims to provide an introduction to emerging evidence and debate about the relationship between climate change and mental health. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The authors argue that:i) the direct impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events will have significant mental health implications;ii) climate change is already impacting on the social, economic and environmental determinants of mental health with the most severe consequences being felt by disadvantaged communities and populations; iii) understanding the full extent of the long term social and environmental challenges posed by climate change has the potential to create emotional distress and anxiety; and iv) understanding the psycho-social implications of climate change is also an important starting point for informed action to prevent dangerous climate change at individual, community and societal levels."
2768294,"A life table analysis is made of the duration of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea in Orissa, India, taking one variable at a time using data from a baseline survey of fertility and mortality (BSFM) conducted on the lines of the World Fertility Survey. Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age. The durations of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea are strongly related."
16848898,"BACKGROUND: Although there has been concern about the levels of carbon monoxide exposure, particularly among older people, little is known about COHb levels and their determinants in the general population. We examined these issues in a study of older British men. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 4252 men aged 60-79 years selected from one socially representative general practice in each of 24 British towns and who attended for examination between 1998 and 2000. Blood samples were measured for COHb and information on social, household and individual factors assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were based on 3603 men measured in or close to (< 10 miles) their place of residence. RESULTS: The COHb distribution was positively skewed. Geometric mean COHb level was 0.46% and the median 0.50%; 9.2% of men had a COHb level of 2.5% or more and 0.1% of subjects had a level of 7.5% or more. Factors which were independently related to mean COHb level included season (highest in autumn and winter), region (highest in Northern England), gas cooking (slight increase) and central heating (slight decrease) and active smoking, the strongest determinant. Mean COHb levels were more than ten times greater in men smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day (3.29%) compared with non-smokers (0.32%); almost all subjects with COHb levels of 2.5% and above were smokers (93%). Pipe and cigar smoking was associated with more modest increases in COHb level. Passive cigarette smoking exposure had no independent association with COHb after adjustment for other factors. Active smoking accounted for 41% of variance in COHb level and all factors together for 47%. CONCLUSION: An appreciable proportion of men have COHb levels of 2.5% or more at which symptomatic effects may occur, though very high levels are uncommon. The results confirm that smoking (particularly cigarette smoking) is the dominant influence on COHb levels."
2928145,"Reward allocation in selected American universities was investigated using tenure receipt as the most valuable faculty reward. Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review."
18567407,"There are relatively few systematic investigations concerning sexual disorders in schizophrenia. In the paper, the most important set of symptoms of sexual disorders in schizophrenia, such as weaker libido, erection and ejaculation disturbances in men, and lubrication and orgasm disturbances in women are described. The lacking of satisfactory partner and sexual relationships is emphasized in the article. In the case of women, the most significant are the problems related to the period of pregnancy, childbirth and care giving. The overview of research literature is focused on differences between females and males in relation to sexual disorders determinants as well as clinical, mental and social effects in the course of schizophrenia."
15544638,"BACKGROUND: In the past decade, the countries that emerged from the Soviet Union have experienced major changes in the inherited Soviet model of health care, which was centrally planned and provided universal, free access to basic care. The underlying principle of universality remains, but coexists with new funding and delivery systems and growing out-of-pocket payments. OBJECTIVE: To examine patterns and determinants of health care utilization, the extent of payment for health care, and the settings in which care is obtained in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. METHODS: Data were derived from cross-sectional surveys, representative of adults aged 18 and over in each country, conducted in 2001. Multistage random sample of 18,428 individuals, stratified by region and area, was obtained. Instrument contained extensive data on demographic, economic, and social characteristics, administered face-to-face. The analysis explored the health seeking behavior of users and nonusers (those reporting an episode of illness but not consulting). RESULTS: In the preceding year, over half of all respondents visited a medical professional, ranging from 65.7 percent in Belarus to 24.4 percent in Georgia, mostly at local primary care facilities. Of those reporting an illness, 20.7 percent of all did not consult although they felt they should have done so, varying from 9.4 percent in Belarus to 42.4 percent in Armenia and 49 percent in Georgia. The main reason for not seeking care was lack of money to pay for treatment (45.2 percent), self-treatment with home-produced remedies (32.9 percent), and purchase of nonprescribed medicine (21.8 percent). There are marked differences between countries; unaffordability was a particularly common factor in Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova (78 percent, 70 percent, 54 percent), and much lower in Belarus and Russia. In Georgia and Armenia, 65 percent and 56 percent of those who had consulted paid out-of-pocket, in the form of money, gifts, or both; these figures were 8 percent and 19 percent in Belarus and Russia respectively and 31.2 percent overall. The probability of not consulting a health professional when seriously ill was significantly higher among those over age 65, and with lower education. Use of health care was markedly lower among those with fewer household assets or a shortage of money, and those dissatisfied with their material resources, factors that explained some of the effects of age. A lack of social support (formal and informal) decreases further the probability of not consulting, adding to the consequences of poor financial status. The probability of seeking care for common conditions varies widely among countries (persistent fever: 56 percent in Belarus; 16 percent in Armenia) and home remedies, alcohol, and direct purchase of pharmaceuticals are commonly used. Informal coping strategies, such as use of connections (36.7 percent) or offering money to health professionals (28.5 percent) are seen as acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: This article provides the first comparative assessment of inequalities in access to health care in multiple countries of the former Soviet Union, using rigorous methodology. The emerging model across the region is extremely diverse. Some countries (Belarus, Russia) have managed to maintain access for most people, while in others the situation is near collapse (Armenia, Georgia). Access is most problematic in health systems characterized by high levels of payment for care and a breakdown of gate-keeping, although these are seen in countries facing major problems such as economic collapse and, in some, a legacy of civil war. There are substantial inequalities within each country and even where access remains adequate there are concerns about its sustainability."
7397056,"A Paracetamol elimination was measured, using serial saliva samples, in 114 London factory and office workers, 76 Whites and 38 Asian immigrants. 2. Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man."
3227366,"Self-evaluated health represents an important aspect of quality of life that may influence the rehabilitation process after a major illness. However, health is a multi-dimensional concept and relatively little is known about the determinants of, and the interrelationships between the separate aspects of health. In a prospective longitudinal study of myocaridal infarction (MI) patients, two indices of self-evaluated health, maximal physical ability (MPA) and perceived global health (PGH), were used. On the average, both ratings were clearly reduced compared with pre-MI levels even as long as 3-5 yr after the MI. Females and older patients indicated lower MPA before and after the MI, whereas PGH was not related to any sociodemographic variable. The severity of the MI appeared to be of relatively limited importance for self-evaluated health. Heart-related symptoms before and after the MI were more strongly related to lower MPA, whereas non-cardiac health problems and psychological distress more clearly influenced PGH. However, initial illness perceptions were of some importance for both health perceptions. The data suggest that to some extent self-evaluated health can be influenced by educational or psychological support in order to faccilitate readaption and recovery after a MI."
6541496,"The effects of two methoxyindoles, melatonin (MEL) and 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTL), on partner investigation and other aspects of pair behaviour in the open field, were observed on male and female mice of the albino TO, and the pigmented C57BL/6 strains. Both indole derivatives are major secretory products of rodent (and human) pineal glands. They were administered by i.p. injection (100 micrograms/kg) to both members of the pair 1 h before each 10 min open field exposure. The testing took place on 3 consecutive days. There were no significant differences in behaviour over days, and group means were used in subsequent data analysis (MANOVA and Dunnet's test). Males, more socially active than the females in both strains, responded to MEL by a reduction in contact time; 5-MTL had the same effect on C57 males (TO males showed no change). Females, on the other hand, did not respond to MEL, and increased their social contact seeking after 5-MTL. There was no consistent effect of either indole on locomotion, and erratic (TO strain only) effects on defaecation. The data are discussed in terms of possible actions of pineal indoles on determinants of social behaviour."
3989430,"The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats."
15978130,"CONTEXT: The Kenya Partnership for Health (KPH) program began in 1999, and is currently one of the 12 field projects participating in the WHO's 'Towards Unity for Health initiative' implemented to develop partnership synergies in support of the Primary Health Care (PHC) approach 1. CONTENT: This paper illustrates how Program-linked Information Management by Integrative-participatory Research Approach (PIMIRA) as practised under KPH has been implemented within Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya to enhance community-based health initiatives. It shows how this model is strategically being scaled-up from one community to another in the management of political, social, cultural and economic determinants (barriers and enhancers) of health. OBJECTIVE: Target rural communities in the development of a community-based health information management and feedback initiatives that can provide insights on the social, cultural, political and economic determinants of health for utilization in informed health service management. KEY FINDINGS AND ACHIEVEMENTS: 1. Cues for health seeking and health service utilization are determined by the social, cultural, political and economic factors as seen by the individual and as defined by the community but not due to the pathological nature of the illness. 2. Establishment of community-based health surveillance and health action initiatives as the best practices in transferring health as a resource that can be 'owned and guarded' by the community. 3. Establishment of Healthy Villages Initiative (HVI) through which health service delivery and scale-up can be sustained at the community level. 4. Provision of actionable health information necessary for health planning and evaluation of preventive health programs thorough PIMIRA. CONCLUSION: It has been realized that for every one person who visits a health facility for medication, there are nine others who had the same condition but sought health care from other sources including self-medication and five others who never sought health care. Innovative means of involving the community in health information management and utilization such as PIMIRA are hence the best ways of guaranteeing equitable delivery of health services that are accessible and sustainable by the community."
15081207,"Gender-based inequalities in health have been frequently documented. This paper examines the extent to which these inequalities reflect the different social experiences and conditions of men's and women's lives. We address four specific questions. Are there gender differences in mental and physical health? What is the relative importance of the structural, behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health? Are the gender differences in health attributable to the differing structural (socio-economic, age, social support, family arrangement) context in which women and men live, and to their differential exposure to lifestyle (smoking, drinking, exercise, diet) and psychosocial (critical life events, stress, psychological resources) factors? Are gender differences in health also attributable to gender differences in vulnerability to these structural, behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health? Multivariate analyses of Canadian National Population Health Survey data show gender differences in health (measured by self-rated health, functional health, chronic illness and distress). Social structural and psychosocial determinants of health are generally more important for women and behavioural determinants are generally more important for men. Gender differences in exposure to these forces contribute to inequalities in health between men and women, however, statistically significant inequalities remain after controlling for exposure. Gender-based health inequalities are further explained by differential vulnerabilities to social forces between men and women. Our findings suggest the value of models that include a wide range of health and health-determinant variables, and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in health."
11133341,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with estabLished coronary artery improves if smoking is stopped. Still, about half of patients who suffer a myocardial infarction continue smoking after that event. In order to predict to whom additional support should be offered, various baseline characteristics were compared with smoking status at short-term and long-term follow-up. METHODS: Demographics, medical history, presence of coronary risk factors, psychological determinants, and the clinical course were recorded in a group of 530 unselected consecutive patients who had been admitted with a myocardial infarction and were smoking. Patients who were smoking at admission, and who were alive at 4-year follow-up, were studied to relate smoking status and baseline characteristics. RESULTS: At 3 months, persistent smokers were younger than quitters, had shorter hospital stays, underwent revascularization procedures less often, smoked more cigarettes per day at baseline, and were more socially isolated. After 4 years, patients who stopped smoking had had a more serious myocardial infarction and had a lower displeasure score than those who continued smoking. Also, quitters received more support from their social environment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of the patients try to stop smoking after a myocardial infarction, about half smokes after 4 years. In the future, special support should be offered to smokers who suffer myocardial infarction, especially to those whose psychosocial profiles are less favorable."
3435040,"A cohort of 1163 pregnant women in two small towns in South Wales, UK, was identified and followed until the children born to them were five years of age. Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers. There effects decreased with age but there were still residual effects at age five years."
16970785,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to study the whole spectrum of birthweight in a population-based birth cohort in order to document the role played by social factors, which complement physiological and behavioural factors, in the development of birthweight inequalities at the population level. METHODS: The analyses were performed with data from the 'Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development 1998-2002 (QLSCD)'. The study follows a representative sample (n = 2103) of the children born in 1998 in the Canadian province of Quebec. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for gestational age and mother's age indicate that mean birthweight was higher for boys than girls; improved with birth rank, mother's body mass index (BMI), and family socioeconomic status; and was lower for children of smoking mothers. Compared with children born to non-smoking mothers of higher socioeconomic status, the odds of having a low birthweight were between 6 and 12 times higher for children born to smoking mothers of lower or middle socioeconomic status. When maternal smoking status and mother's BMI are combined, socioeconomic status could still be seen to have a positive effect on mean birthweight except for overweight or obese smoking mothers, among whom the relationship between socioeconomic status and mean birthweight was reversed. In families of lower socioeconomic status, maternal smoking was the most important factor in birthweight inequalities, and in families of higher socioeconomic status, mother's BMI was the most important factor in birthweight inequalities. CONCLUSION: This research is not only important for children in developed nations, but also for those in developing countries, where high birthweight and obesity are becoming more prevalent."
18569355,"The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the merits of evaluating new public health campaign materials in the developmental phase using an experimental design. This is referred to as experimental pretesting. In practice, most new materials are tested only after they have been distributed using nonexperimental or quasiexperimental designs. In cases where materials are pretested prior to distribution, pretesting is usually done using qualitative research methods such as focus groups. Although these methods are useful, they cannot reliably predict the effectiveness of new campaign materials in a developmental phase. Therefore, we suggest when pretesting new materials, not only qualitative research methods but also experimental research methods must be used. The present study discusses an experimental pretest study of new campaign materials intended for distribution in a national sexually transmitted infection (STI) AIDS prevention campaign in the Netherlands. The campaign material tested was the storyline of a planned television commercial on safe sex. A storyboard that consisted of drawings and text was presented to members of the target population, namely, students between the ages of 14 and 16 enrolled in vocational schools. Results showed positive effects on targeted determinants of safe sexual behavior. The advantages, practical implications, and limitations of experimental pretesting are discussed."
3064632,"Retrospective information about teenage alcohol use was obtained from 1589 adult twin pairs aged 20-30 years from the Australian twin register. Twin pairs were highly concordant both for teenage drinking (or abstinence) and for early versus late onset of drinking. Sociodemographic variables (e.g., paternal occupation and parental religious affiliation) and psychosocial variables (e.g., personality and attitudinal traits), assessed when the twins were adults, were comparatively poor predictors of teenage drinking. Environmental influences on onset of drinking appeared to be sex-specific, i.e., uncorrelated over twins from unlike-sex pairs. Among drinkers, early versus late onset of drinking was more strongly influenced by inherited factors in females, but by shared features of the social environment (e.g., family background or school experience) in males."
12280405,"An overview of the relationship between demographic factors and rural poverty in developing countries is presented. The author examines both the micro- and macro-level perspectives of this relationship and the determinants and consequences of population growth. The author notes the prospects for a rapid increase in the rural labor force and considers its implications for the agricultural production structure and the need for institutional change. Consideration is also given to the continuing demand for high fertility at the family level and the role of infant and child mortality in the poverty cycle. ""The paper concludes by drawing attention to the need for developing the mechanism for reconciliation of social and individual optima with respect to family size and population growth."" The need for rural development projects that take demographic factors into account is stressed as is the need for effective population programs. (summary in FRE, ITA)"
7190778,"The critical determinants of extended diurnal death feigning were assessed in a refinement experiment in which visual and tactile cues during rearing and/or testing were systematically eliminated. Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing. It was concluded that visual novelty of the environment is the minimal condition for sustained death feigning by young chicks in the daylight hours."
3874527,"Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values."
2801628,"Ethics code books provide only general guidelines and are inadequate in resolving explicit ethical dilemmas that frequently occur in community intervention. Ethical choices often reflect personal values as well as professional role proscriptions and are difficult to resolve for a number of reasons. It often is not clear to whom the interventionist should be accountable, or what the long-range impact may be of specific programs that seem to have short-term benefit. Value clashes can occur between consultants and consultees, even when both groups believe that they represent the best interests of vulnerable client groups. Since personal values are important determinants of ethical choices, whenever possible, they should be communicated openly so community groups can understand the interventionist's values before community projects begin. It also is important to share ethical dilemmas with professional colleagues in order to provide community psychologists with constructive feedback from their professional peers, and to help others anticipate similar value conflicts in their own work. These points are illustrated by discussion of the vignettes presented by O'Neill (1989) and by additional examples drawn from my own experience."
11682918,"Given the longevity achievable with current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for persons with HIV infection, quality of life (QOL) has emerged as a significant medical outcome measure, and its enhancement as an important goal. This review highlights current knowledge about the relevance and complexity of physical, psychological, and social factors as determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected persons. Existing data suggest physical manifestations, antiretroviral therapy, psychological well-being, social support systems, coping strategies, spiritual well-being, and psychiatric comorbidities are important predictors of QOL in this population. Health care professionals are encouraged to become familiar with the full spectrum of predictors of HRQOL, which may eventually contribute to the development of multiple entry points for interventions in promoting QOL in these patients. Identifying variables influencing QOL among diverse groups, particularly women, injection drug users, and adolescents, and designing effective interventions specific to the social and psychological well-being of HIV-infected individuals are areas for research."
2738317,"This study examined the personal and environmental factors related to the activity involvement of older people living in congregate residential settings. A sample of 1,428 residents in 42 such settings provided information about their activities, functioning, and background. Measures of facility features were also available. These data show that individuals are more likely to participate in facility-organized activities in settings where overall resident participation is greater, the average functioning of residents is lower, staffing is higher, and the program more structured. Participation in facility activities is not related to personal characteristics. In contrast, involvement in resident-initiated activities, both in the facility and in the community, is related to personal characteristics (being functionally intact, female, and better educated) and to facility features (larger size, lower staffing, greater autonomy and cohesiveness). The impact of some features varies depending on the functional capacity of the individual resident."
25196925,"According to life course analysis, age systems create socially recognized turning points, which outline life paths, channel people into positions and roles, and determine the distribution of rights and obligations. Yet few studies have examined these social parameters. Another problem with life course research is its ahistoricity. Even specifically historical studies have often been unable to measure the dynamics of change because of their use of cross-sectional household data, which only measures a small portion of kinship relations. This case study of the Mennonite family of Cornelius and Helena Richert Voth, who migrated from Russia to the Kansas Plains in 1874, analyzes the role that religious and ethnic traditions and inheritance rules play in preserving family stability, providing security in old age, and shaping the family life course. It contributes to our understanding of the social determinants of life course change by illustrating how traditional Mennonite patterns of family organization and property transmission, formed during centuries of community life in Prussia and Russia, shaped the timing of life course transitions and how the differing social, political, and economic conditions the immigrants encountered on the American frontier altered those traditional patterns."
7264477,"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered."
7249932,"The authors have investigated reasons for medication compliance in a population of epileptic patients. The hypothesis that the health care belief model would be predictive of medication-taking behavior was validated. A pilot study was constructed which investigated the comparative responses of compliant and noncompliant epileptic outpatients to questions regarding demographic, clinical history, and attitudinal characteristics. Noncompliant patients were characterized as having a longer duration of epilepsy, more complicated dosage regimens, and more changes in medication. In addition, noncompliant patients both demonstrated more confusion over medication directions and less insight into the need for anticonvulsants and feared addiction to their medication. They had a lower level of satisfaction with their health care and were more frequently subject to the social complications of epilepsy. The authors suggest that a more holistic approach be taken when attempting to reverse noncompliant behavior."
12087482,"An individual's leisure time (pastime) engagements are in a way important for society. Irrespective of whether leisure time activities are causal determinants of health or health is a prerequisite for taking full part in society, the interaction is a challenge for Public Health. The first question is whether the sum of their influence results in coherence between enjoying good health and having leisure time activity. The aim of this study was to estimate their covariance.A random sample was drawn from the adult population of Stockholm County, Sweden. The residents were mailed a questionnaire regarding their social circumstances, their health complaints, the social repercussions of the complaints, and if they had any leisure time activity. Altogether, 7252 (about 93%) individuals responding to the questionnaire constituted our cohort. The individuals aged 18-65 y in November 1969 were followed up to the age of 65 y, or to 1996 as to mortality. The main outcome measure was mortality irrespective of cause of death. More than two-thirds of the respondents (71%) reported that they had some leisure time activity. Leisure time activity was a determinant of survival in the statistical sense. The risk ratio was 0.77 and its 95% confidence interval was 0.68-0.87 for those reporting leisure time activity when age, sex, baseline health and baseline alcohol consumption was discounted. The conclusion was that having leisure time activity, unspecified, covaried with health. Further studies should specify the pastime activities."
16502967,"OBJECTIVE: This paper investigates the culture of workplace learning within a study of eight small hospitals in rural New South Wales (NSW), Australia. DESIGN: The study used a focus group method of data collection, undertaken before then after a series of interventions designed to nurture a culture that supports learning within the rural health care setting. PARTICIPANTS: Student AINs, AINs, ENs and RNs from any of the eight hospitals. CONCLUSION: Framed within a critical social perspective it applies a theory of culture to understand the determinants of social divisiveness that was occurring between different levels of the nursing workforce. These results are further analysed within a theoretical discussion of culture and power in nursing."
19789061,"While global prevalence of obesity continues to increase dramatically, treatment options remain less than optimal. The etiology of obesity is multifactorial, ranging from lifestyle choices such as excess food intake and insufficient physical activity, to use of medications that have weight gain as an undesirable side effect. Economic and political determinants of available foodstuffs and even social networks may also contribute to obesity. Successful management of obesity requires the understanding and acceptance of a new paradigm that identifies obesity as a disease--one defined by waist circumference--that requires treatment. Obesity meets all accepted criteria of a medical disease, including a known etiology, recognized signs and symptoms, and a range of structural and functional changes that culminate in pathologic consequences. Excess adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ to produce excess free fatty acids, as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, leptin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. These bioactive molecules are associated with hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, development of diabetes, endothelial damage, and the onset and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Options for treating obesity include lifestyle modifications (dietary changes, increased physical activity, behavior modification) and, for the morbidly obese, surgery. Lifestyle modification is rarely successful over the long term; therefore, addition of pharmacotherapy should be considered for obese individuals who have difficulty achieving and maintaining weight goals with lifestyle modifications alone. Several weight loss drugs are available for long-term use, with others in various stages of clinical development."
17549509,"BACKGROUND: We recently developed the Amblyopia & Strabismus Questionnaire (A&SQ) to assess the quality of life in amblyopia and/or strabismus patients, and evaluated its content and criterion validity. The A&SQ was now validated clinically by correlating its outcome with past and current orthoptic parameters in a historic cohort of amblyopia and/or strabismus patients. METHODS: The cohort was derived from all 471 patients who were treated by occlusion therapy in the Waterland Hospital in Purmerend between 1968 and 1974 and born between 1962 and 1972. All children with insufficient visual acuity from the Waterland area had been referred to a single ophthalmologist and orthoptist. Of these, 203 were traced, and 174 filled out the A&SQ. In 137 of these, binocular vision, visual acuity, and angle of strabismus were reassessed 30-35 years after occlusion therapy. These clinical parameters were correlated with the five A&SQ domains: ""distance estimation"", ""visual disorientation"", ""fear of losing the better eye"", ""diplopia"", and ""social contact and cosmetic problems"". RESULTS: The current acuity at distance of the amblyopic eye and reading acuity of the amblyopic eye correlated significantly with all five A&SQ domains (significance level P = 0.01-P = 0.05). Weaker correlations were found for binocularity. In spite of the expectation that stereopsis should strongly correlate with the domain ""distance estimation"", and angle of strabismus with the domain ""social contact and cosmetic problems"", the acuity of the amblyopic eye was the overall dominant parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The adult acuity of the amblyopic eye seems the most important clinical determinant for quality of life in amblyopia and/or strabismus patients, even in domains of distance estimation, visual disorientation, and social contact and cosmetic problems, although intermediate determinants cannot be excluded."
11888046,"The present study analyzed what determinants are important to describe and explain the intention of testicular self-examination (TSE) for young men aged 15-19 attending senior high school (response rate 80%, n = 274). The questionnaire assessed determinants, including knowledge, attitude (positive and negative consequences, anticipated regret, and moral obligation), social influence (social norm, social support and modeling) and self-efficacy. Knowledge of testicular cancer and TSE was very low. Only 2% of the subjects reported regularly performing TSE. After hearing of TSE (through the questionnaire), 41% of all young men had a positive intention to start performing TSE regularly. The various intention groups (positive, neutral and negative) differed significantly on almost all of the determinants. Multiple regression analysis showed that young men who where anxious about TSE and those who were not anxious had different determinants explaining the variance in the intention to perform TSE regularly (R2 = 41-57%). Differences in determinants of intention between young men who are anxious about TSE and young men who are not can be used to design health education interventions that may therefore be more effective for these different subgroups."
17261528,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the preferences of French elderly inpatients concerning medical information and surrogate designation in life-threatening situations. METHODS: Intention-to-act questionnaire was completed by two geriatricians during a patient interview in the week following admission in three geriatric units in France. The participants were elderly patients (> or =70 years) with adequate cognitive performance for decision making as assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination. The impact of socio-demographic factors, level of confidence in medical care, cognitive or physical disability on surrogate designation and amount of medical information expected were measured. MEASUREMENTS: Impact of socio-demographic factors, level of confidence in medical care, cognitive or physical disability on surrogate designation and amount of medical information expected. RESULTS: 426 consecutive elderly patients were recruited. 32.6% wanted to receive complete information about their care and 77% declared they would want to be informed if they were in a life-threatening situation. 4.5% reported they would not want any medical information. A family member was designated as surrogate by 73% of the patients. In 28%, a second surrogate was also designated, usually the family physician (22%) or a member of the hospital medical staff (10%). Polytomous logistic regression analysis was used to assess determinants of the amount of information expected and social and medical parameters. MMSE score, the presence of physical disability, a low level of confidence in medicine and the presence of children were identified as independent determinants of a high level of information expectation. CONCLUSION: Elderly hospitalised patients expressed a strong desire to receive extensive information and were willing to designate a surrogate in a life-threatening situation. The surrogate was usually a family member alone or with another person, usually a practitioner."
18274042,"Disasters have been and will continue to be relatively common events in the human experience, and they make important contributions to variations in population health. There is a need, therefore, for conceptual models that identify the social and ecological factors influencing post-disaster consequences on population health. This article presents one such conceptual model which links the health consequences of natural, technological, and human-made disasters to a set of nested socioecological factors. Specifically, we attempt to link post-disaster consequences to aspects of the global and local environment and to highlight the roles played by social and ecological factors, including the social infrastructure, cultural beliefs, demography, and underlying historical and geographical circumstances. Examples from existing population-based health and disaster research are used to illustrate and amplify connections drawn from the model. From an applied standpoint, the model suggests that the role of multiple contextual determinants in shaping population health is likely to be complex. Practitioners interested in mitigating the consequences of disasters should pursue strategies that improve the underlying determinants of health, as well as practicable population-based interventions that could be implemented rapidly."
3060449,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement."
3168446,"In order to disclose differences between users and non-users of oral contraceptives (OC), 620 women aged 15-54 were invited to participate in an in depth interview about sexual, contraceptive, and reproductive life events. Of the 585 women who participated, 459 were consecutive gynecological in- or outpatients, and 126 were selected from visitors in general practice. Data was analysed by multivariate test statistics. After correction for present age and social class, the duration of use of OC (DOC) among women 15-34 years of age correlated negatively to age at menarche and coital debut and positively to number of sexual partners, oral-genital sexual practice, and number of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Among women over 35, DOC was positively associated only to cigarette smoking. No correlation was found to coital frequency (whether earlier, present or during pregnancy or menstruation), number of births and abortions, or to social classification. In epidemiological research on benefits and risks of oral contraceptives, confounding influence of one or more variables is of crucial importance. The present findings point at sexual and life-style habits as potential confounders in the study of OC and associated diseases."
7254088,"Trends in perinatal mortality and low birthweight (percentage of livebirths under 2500 g) were analysed in relation to certain social and biological variables. Mothers at high risk of adverse perinatal outcome in terms of perinatal mortality and low birthweight were found to be very young and grand multiparous mothers, old primiparas, unmarried mothers, those with multiple pregnancies and mothers born in Asia."
15326465,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the major risk factors of overweight and obesity in prepubertal children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: In all, 32 primary schools in Kiel (248 000 inhabitants), northwest Germany. SUBJECTS: A total of 2631 5-7-y-old German children and their parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight status, socio-economic status (SES), parental overweight, dietary intake, activity, inactivity and further determinants (birth weight, breast feeding, nutritional status of siblings) of the children. RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight (>/=90th BMI percentile of reference) was 9.2% in boys and 11.2% in girls, respectively. Considered univariately, family-, environment- and development-related determinants showed some relations to overweight and obesity. In multivariate analyses parental overweight, a low SES as well as a high birth weight were the strongest independent risk factors of overweight and obesity in children. Additionally, there were sex-specific risk factors: parental smoking and single households were risk factors in boys, whereas a low activity was associated with obesity in girls. Birth weight was associated with obesity, but not with overweight. The prevalence of obesity reached 29.2% in boys and 33.4% in girls with all the three main risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight families of low SES have the highest risk of overweight and obese children. Future prevention programmes must also take into account sex-specific risk factors."
16937950,"Every fifth unintentional injury treated at a healthcare facility in the industrialised part of the world is associated with sports or physical exercise. This article reviews the literature regarding the theoretical and practical underpinnings for community-based sports safety promotion, including both professional and recreational sports. While injury prevention entails the implementation of specific interventions in terms of structural or educational measures, sports safety promotion includes also the antecedent and wider campaigns that are required to succeed with these measures. Comprehensive sports safety promotion programmes thus require that the perspective on the sports injury problem is made broader than consideration of the individual athlete. The results display that involvement in sports safety issues from the sports federations that formulate policies and allocate resources is necessary for coordinated implementation of programme actions. The authorities responsible for sports facilities and legislations in the civil society also need to be included, because of the fact that they control many of the central safety determinants in the sporting environment. It is concluded that the sports injury problem needs to be addressed in liaison with the leaders of socially defined sports communities and the governments representing geographically defined civic communities, and that the safety-supporting environment in professional sports is underdeveloped compared with other areas of working life."
17880613,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to identify factors explaining why some people stop donating blood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A random mail survey of first-time (FT) and repeat (RPT) current (donating within 6 months before survey) and lapsed (donating >2 years prior) donors was conducted. The self-administered questionnaire included questions on personal, social, and behavioral characteristics. RESULTS: Among 1280 current and 1672 lapsed donors with valid addresses, the participation rate was 66.8 and 39.2 percent, respectively. In FT donors, the odds of lapsing increased with education (odds ratio [OR], 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-3.55 for college or higher vs. Grade 12 or less education). Lapsed FT donors were more often asked to donate (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.32-2.70) and had less interest in incentives (p < 0.001) than current FT donors. In RPT donors, lapsed status was associated with being younger (p < 0.001) and female (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.42). Lapsed status was inversely associated with satisfaction with the last donation experience in both FT (p = 0.043) and RPT (p < 0.001) donors. Lapsed and current donors did not differ in perceived need for blood, personal transfusion experience, or mean reported altruistic behavior score. CONCLUSION: A positive donation experience appears to be a major determinant of donor return behavior. Lapsed donors do not appear, on average, to engage in fewer altruistic behaviors than currently active donors. Retention marketing strategies that appeal solely to altruistic values need to be further evaluated for their effectiveness."
17097354,"The purpose of this study was to define the influence of fatigue, depression, and clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. The study was performed on 103 adult patients who visited Erciyes University Epilepsy Outpatient Clinic between 2004 and 2005. Patients were evaluated with the Form of Negotiation, Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-89), Beck Depression Inventory, and Fatigue Severity Scale. Mean age of the patients was 34.3+/-12.6, and mean duration of disease was 12.6+/-9.3 years. Among these patients, 52.4% were men, 49.5% were married, 15.5% had a university education, 53.4% had low incomes, 45.6% had generalized seizures, and 35.0% had experienced one or more seizures per month during the preceding year. The most significant variables in the domain of Overall quality of life were seizure frequency (P<0.001), depression (P<0.001), and fatigue (P<0.001); the variables in the domain of Mental Health were seizure frequency (P<0.001) and fatigue (P<0.001); the variable in the Cognitive domain was fatigue (P<0.001); the variables in the domain of Physical Health were social insurance coverage (P<0.01), fatigue (P<0.01), and age (P<0.01); the variables in the Epilepsy Targeted domain were depression (P<0.001), seizure frequency (P<0.001), and fatigue (P<0.01). Although quality of life has multiple determinants, seizure frequency, fatigue, and depression are the most important factors affecting quality of life in patients with epilepsy. One or more seizures per month, severe fatigue, and depression are associated with lower quality of life in some but not all domains. Partial correlations demonstrated that fatigue was a significant independent predictor of quality of life. The present study confirms that fatigue can be a powerful predictor of quality of life."
3992612,"This article begins with a discussion of the motivation for fertility reduction and related population policies. Next, it identifies the two major approaches to evaluating these policies in the population ethics literature: the individualistic approach and the international approach. Each approach is then characterized according to the kinds of policies evaluated, the ethical principles that are most prominent, and the major conclusions drawn. Major empirical gaps in the population ethics literature are identified, and pertinent social science issues concerning the effectiveness of family planning programs, the socioeconomic determinants of fertility, and the interpersonal or community determinants of fertility are discussed. Finally, these issues are linked with the United Nations World Population Plan of Action to identify ethical questions that warrant detailed scrutiny."

By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on economic socialization."
6481664,"Psychosocial outcome in terms of mental state, health preoccupation, leisure activity, avoidance behaviour, sexual activity and attitude towards life and the future one year after a myocardial infarction (MI) was studied in 177 consecutive male, able-bodied patients below 61 yr of age with a first MI. Questionnaires and a brief interview covered the psychological and social data while the somatic variables were recorded in a standardized medical examination. Emotional distress, self-reported symptoms, avoidance behaviour, overprotection, pessimism and a diminished sexual activity were frequent, indicating a poor adaptation. These disturbances were apparent two months after the MI and remained stable. Psychological factors were stronger determinants of maladjustment than smoking, angina pectoris and recorded somatic illness. Neither severity of the infarction nor social and demographic factors determined maladjustment. Intervention must take place early and be directed to psychological factors as well as to the cardiac condition."
12268087,"Changes in the relationship between population factors and the development process in Mexico from 1940 to the present are reviewed. The authors show how the development that occurred up to about 1970 both absorbed and encouraged rapid population growth. They then describe how the emergence of problems concerning this relationship led to the development of a population policy during the 1970s. ""The paper then takes up the implementation of that policy and the determinants of the fertility decline that took place afterwards, and closes with a brief review of the implications that demographic considerations have for Mexico's future.""

10750165,"Aggression and stereotyped behaviors are not uncommon among people with intellectual disabilities and they are often treated separately as operant behaviors. In this single case study, it is argued that the function of a young woman's aggressive behavior appeared to be that of avoiding or escaping the termination of a chain of complex stereotyped behavior (or ""ritual""). She became aggressive only when this chain of stereotyped behavior was terminated and the aggression appeared to extinguish when it no longer led to escape from the termination of the ""ritual"". It is suggested that this is an example of a complex interaction between two behaviors and that it illustrates the need for very careful analysis of the functions of challenging behavior. Furthermore, it is proposed that the lengthening list of variables already documented as determinants of challenging behavior (provision of attention (verbal and physical), mechanical restraint, sensory or tangible events, escape from demands or from social attention, denials, escape from intrusive medical procedures, escape from task difficulty) be lengthened to include the possibility of escape from (or avoidance of) the interruption of a chain of complex stereotyped behavior or ""ritual""."
16288659,"BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination are significant determinants of HIV transmission in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T), where the adult HIV/AIDS prevalence is 2.5%. T&T is a spiritually-aware society and over 104 religious groups are represented. This religious diversity creates a complex social environment for the transmission of a sexually transmitted infection like HIV/AIDS. Religious leaders are esteemed in T&T's society and may use their position and frequent interactions with the public to promote HIV/AIDS awareness, fight stigma and discrimination, and exercise compassion for people living with HIV/AIDS (PWHA). Some religious groups have initiated HIV/AIDS education programs within their membership, but previous studies suggest that HIV/AIDS remains a stigmatized infection in many religious organizations. The present study investigates how the perception of HIV/AIDS as a sexually transmitted infection impacts religious representatives' incentives to respond to HIV/AIDS in their congregations and communities. In correlation, the study explores how the experiences of PWHA in religious gatherings impact healing and coping with HIV/AIDS. METHODS: Between November 2002 and April 2003, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 religious representatives from 10 Christian, Hindu and Muslim denominations. The majority of respondents were leaders of religious services, while two were active congregation members. Religious groups were selected based upon the methods of Brathwaite. Briefly, 26 religious groups with the largest followings according to 2000 census data were identified in Trinidad and Tobago. From this original list, 10 religious groups in Northwest Trinidad were selected to comprise a representative sample of the island's main denominations. In-depth interviews with PWHA were conducted during the same study period, 2002-2003. Four individuals were selected from a care and support group located in Port of Spain based upon their perceived willingness to discuss religious affiliation and describe how living with a terminal infection has affected their spiritual lives. The interviewer, a United States Fulbright Scholar, explained the nature and purpose of the study to all participants. Relevant ethical procedures associated with the collection of interview data were adopted: interviews were conducted in a non-coercive manner and confidentiality was assured. All participants provided verbal consent, and agreed to be interviewed without financial or other incentive. Ethics approval was granted on behalf of the Caribbean Conference of Churches Ethics Committee. Interview questions followed a guideline, and employed an open-ended format to facilitate discussion. All interviews were recorded and transcribed by the interviewer. RESULTS: Religious representatives' opinions were grouped into the following categories: rationale for the spread of HIV/AIDS, abstinence, condom use, sexuality and homosexuality, compassion, experiences with PWHA, recommendations and current approach to addressing HIV/AIDS in congregations. Religious representatives expressed a measure of acceptance of HIV/AIDS and overwhelmingly upheld compassion for PWHA. Some statements, however, suggested that HIV/AIDS stigma pervades Trinidad's religious organizations. For many representatives, HIV/AIDS was associated with a promiscuous lifestyle and/or homosexuality. Representatives had varying levels of interaction with PWHA, but personal experiences were positively associated with current involvement in HIV/AIDS initiatives. All 4 PWHA interviewed identified themselves as belonging to Christian denominations. Three out of the 4 PWHA described discriminatory experiences with pastors or congregation members during gatherings for religious services. Nonetheless, PWHA expressed an important role for faith and religion in coping with HIV. CONCLUSION: Religious groups in Trinidad are being challenged to promote a clear and consistent response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; a response that may reflect personal experiences and respect religious doctrine in the context of sex and sexuality. The study suggests that (1) religious leaders could improve their role in the fight against HIV/AIDS with education and sensitization-specifically aimed at dismantling the myths about HIV transmission, and the stereotyping of susceptible sub-populations, and (2) a consultative dialogue between PWHAs and religious leaders is pivotal to a successful faith-based HIV intervention in Trinidad."
2784327,"A survey of all registered deaths which occurred during 1981-1983 in women of reproductive age was carried out in Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause."
2785722,"In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact."

11522137,"This ecological study investigated the associations between social deprivation, income inequality and social cohesion and dental caries levels in school children of the Distrito Federal, Brazil. Three sources of data were used: (1) area-based data from a 1997 social survey carried out on 13,000 families, (2) 1995 census data collected for the Government of the Distrito Federal (GDF), and (3) dental caries data from a 1997 oral health survey on 7296 6-12-year-old school children. Results of simple linear regression showed that percent with less than eight years of education (P = 0.03) and percent who did not have a maid (P = 0.009), were negatively statistically significantly associated with the percent of children free of caries. None of the deprivation measures were statistically significantly associated with mean DMF-T scores (P > 0.05). GINI coefficient, an indicator of social inequalities, was negatively statistically significantly associated with both measures of dental caries experience, percent of caries free (P = 0.003) and mean DMF-T scores (P = 0.01). Per thousand number of homicides or attempted homicides, an indicator of social cohesion was of marginal statistical significance associated with caries experience. Results of multiple linear regression analyses showed that only the Gini coefficient remained statistically significantly associated with both dental clinical measures used, after adjusting for potential confounding. In conclusion, relative rather than absolute levels of income were stronger determinants of the onset of caries in this study."
2660269,"The innovation of epidemiology plays a crucial role in the development of the health sciences. The authors emphasize the importance of epistemological analysis related to scientific and technical production. They focus on the theoretical and methodological contributions of the principal Latin American groups in the field of epidemiology, stating their main accomplishments, issues and potentials. When reviewing those conceptual and practical innovations, the authors analyse the effects of broader historical conditions on scientific work. To them, Latin American contemporary innovative epidemiological research and production have developed clearly differentiated principles, methods and technical projections which have led to a movement of critical or 'social' epidemiology. The functionalist approach of conventional epidemiology, characterized by an empiricist viewpoint, is being overcome by a more rigorous and analytical approach. This new epidemiological approach, in which the authors as members of CEAS (Health Research and Advisory Center) are working, has selectively incorporated some of the technical instruments of conventional epidemiology, subordinating them to a different theoretical and logical paradigm. The new framework of this group explains the need to consider the people's objective situation and necessities, when constructing scientific interpretations and planning technical action. In order to accomplish this goal, epidemiological reasoning has to reflect the unity of external epidemiological facts and associations, the so-called phenomenological aspect of health, with the underlying determinants and conditioning processes or internal relations, which are the essence of the health-disease production and distribution process. Epidemiological analysis is considered not only as a problem of empirical observation but as a process of theoretical construction, in which there is a dynamic fusion of deductive and inductive reasoning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

18931911,"There are limited validated quantitative assessment methods to measure features of the built and social environment that might form the basis for environmental preventive interventions. This study describes a model approach for epidemiologic assessment of suspected environmental determinants of violence, alcohol and other drug (VAOD) exposure and fills this gap in current research. The investigation sought to test the feasibility of a systematic and longitudinal assessment of residential block characteristics related to physical and social disorder and indicators of VAOD exposure. Planometric data were used to establish a stratified random sample of street segments within defined neighborhoods of an urban metropolitan area. Field rater assessments of these neighborhood street segments were conducted using the Neighborhood Inventory for Environmental Typology (NIfETy). This report provides a detailed description of the NIfETy Method, including metric properties of the NIfETy Instrument and outcomes of training procedures and quality control measures. Also presented are block-level characteristics and estimates of observable signs of VAOD activity. This work is a first step toward developing future community-level environmental preventive interventions geared to reduce community VAOD exposure among youthful urban populations and may prove to be useful to other public health research groups as well."
19531164,"In spite of vast global improvements in living standards, health, and well-being, the persistence of absolute poverty and its attendant maladies remains an unsettling fact of life for billions around the world and constitutes the primary cause for the failure of developing states to improve the health of their peoples. While economic development in developing countries is necessary to provide for underlying determinants of health--most prominently, poverty reduction and the building of comprehensive primary health systems--inequalities in power within the international economic order and the spread of neoliberal development policy limit the ability of developing states to develop economically and realize public goods for health. With neoliberal development policies impacting entire societies, the collective right to development, as compared with an individual rights-based approach to development, offers a framework by which to restructure this system to realize social determinants of health. The right to development, working through a vector of rights, can address social determinants of health, obligating states and the international community to support public health systems while reducing inequities in health through poverty-reducing economic growth. At an international level, where the ability of states to develop economically and to realize public goods through public health systems is constrained by international financial institutions, the implementation of the right to development enables a restructuring of international institutions and foreign-aid programs, allowing states to enter development debates with a right to cooperation from other states, not simply a cry for charity."
16783115,"The purpose of this study was to examine the demographic, medical, and social cognitive determinants of exercise intentions in a population-based sample of multiple myeloma cancer survivors. Using a cross-sectional survey, 70 multiple myeloma cancer survivors completed a questionnaire that assessed their medical and demographic characteristics, past exercise behavior, and social cognitive exercise beliefs using the theory of planned behavior. Seventy participants provided valuable data. Descriptive statistics indicated that participants had quite positive instrumental attitude, intentions, and subjective norms and moderate levels of perceived behavioral control and affective attitudes for exercise. Forced entry multiple regression showed that the theory of planned behavior explained 43% of the variance in exercise intentions. Instrumental attitude and perceived behavioral control were both independent predictors of exercise intentions. No demographic or medical variable moderated the association between the theory of planned behavior constructs and exercise intentions. The results of the present investigation support the growing body of evidence confirming the utility of the theory of planned behavior to understand the salient determinants of exercise in cancer survivors. Knowledge gained from this study provides important information to oncology practitioners who are responsible for delivering supportive care interventions, including exercise, to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma."
11092151,"This study was designed to examine the attitudes of student athletes toward the use of painkilling drugs. A total of 563 student athletes at two Division One NCAA universities were surveyed in this study. Twenty-nine percent of the student athletes (n = 165) reported that they felt there is nothing wrong with using painkilling drugs on the day of competition (when injured) to cope with pain. These student athletes reported that they would use painkilling drugs to mask injury in order to continue to participate in their sport. Student athletes' perceptions of societal norms and expectations related to competition, and the degree of control student athletes perceive that they have when deciding to use painkillers, may be important determinants governing the extent to which they may be at risk for abusing these substances. Research on planned behavior and reasoned action against suggests that salient beliefs affect intentions and subsequent behaviors, either through attitudes or subjective norms, or the degree of (perceived) control that an individual feels he/she has over the behavior [1, 2]. This theoretical model was used as a guiding framework for analyzing the attitudes of college athletes toward painkilling drugs. Recommendations are included in this article for coaches, educators, team physicians, team trainers, and administrators who are concerned about controlling the use and abuse of painkilling drugs by student athletes."
3389765,"The multiple regression analyses were undertaken to elucidate the significance and relative importance of different potential determinants of several child development traits (i.e. age at which child 1. turns himself over; 2. sits up; 3. stands up; 4. walks, and 5. cuts his first tooth). Despite the fact that we used a relatively wide gamut of potential determinants (such as parental age, geographic origin, occupation, current residence, or family size) of trait variability, the results of multiple regression analysis (N = 300 families) indicate an almost complete absence of significant factors and studied variables of development. Sibling resemblance component of variance and covariance for five mentioned traits of development and some morphological characters (weight, length and head circumference at day of birth and at 16 months) were studied in 66 families. The transmissibility (""heritability"") values for the development traits were small, ranging from 0 (""Turn"") to 0.42 (""Walked""). The Findings suggest that there are significant inverse relationship between some of the developmental traits and inborn morphological characters."
3964428,"Male and female juvenile rats were individually exposed to nonplayful juvenile social stimuli in a novel test of play-soliciting behavior to examine hormonal and experiential determinants of sex differences. In Experiment 1, neonatally androgenized females engaged in play soliciting at a level equal to that of male controls and greater than that of nonandrogenized female controls. In Experiment 2, males and females were reared in unisexual and bisexual groups in order to compare long-term sex-related social experience effects on juvenile play soliciting. Males exposed only to other young males engaged in greater play soliciting than males exposed to both sexes; females, in contrast, were unaffected by sex of cagemates. Within rearing conditions, however, males engaged in greater play soliciting than females. The combined results suggest that perinatal gonadal androgen exposure effects on social play are prepotent and contribute essentially to sex differences in the initiation of social play behavior."
28514037,"Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084)."

It has been demonstrated through analysis of a large quantity of data that family planning under the guidance of national population policies is the major cause for the decline of the fertility rate to the replacement level within the short span of a dozen years."""
18050152,"This paper contributes to analysing and understanding the demand for (social) health insurance of informal sector workers in Kenya by assessing their perceptions and knowledge of and concerns regarding health insurance and the Kenyan National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). It serves to explore how informal sector workers could be integrated into the NHIF. To collect data, focus group discussions were held with organized groups of informal sector workers of different types across the country, backed up by a self-administered questionnaire completed by heads of NHIF area branch offices. It was found that the most critical barrier to NHIF enrollment is the lack of knowledge of informal sector workers about the NHIF, its enrollment option and procedures for informal sector workers. Inability to pay is a critical factor for some, but people were, in principle, interested in health insurance, and thus willing to pay for it. In sum, the mix of demand-side determinants for enrolling in the NHIF is not as complex as expected. This is good news, as these demand-side determinants can be addressed with a well-designed strategy, focusing on awareness raising and information, improvement of insurance design features and setting differentiated and affordable contribution rates."
19149396,"BACKGROUND: Most immigrants to Canada now come from Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Africa, where cultures and languages often differ significantly from the Canadian context. Subgroups of immigrants experience disparities in health. Inability to communicate in an official language in Canada may be a marker of risk for poor health due to both pre- and post-migration factors. We aimed to study the relationship between language proficiency and self-reported health. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the first two surveys of the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada (2001, 2003), a population-based cohort study of new immigrants to Canada. Specifically, we used logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between self-reported health and language proficiency by sex, controlling for a range of health determinants at 6 months (wave 1) and 2 years (wave 2) after arrival. RESULTS: After controlling for covariates (age, sex, education, region of birth, immigrant class, job satisfaction, access to health care), analysis of the wave 1 survey showed that poor proficiency in English or French is significantly related to the self-reported poor health (OR=2.0, p<0.01). And this relationship was consistent in the wave 2 survey (OR=1.9, p<0.01). We also found that this statistically significant association between poor language proficiency and self-reported health holds only for women (wave 1 survey OR=2.6, p <0.01, wave 2 survey OR=2.2, p<0.01), not for men. CONCLUSION: The association between poor language proficiency and poor self-reported health, and particularly its significantly greater impact on women, has implications for language training, health care and social services, and health information."
3182366,"A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers."
16326659,"PURPOSE: Healthful eating is important for optimal diabetes self-care. However, the level of food sufficiency may influence the degree of adherence to dietary self-care behaviors through the affordability of nutritionally appropriate food. This study examines whether homebound older adults with diabetes were at greater risk for heightened food insufficiency over 1 year, despite regular receipt of home-delivered meals. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal study of a randomly recruited sample of 268 homebound older adults in the Nutrition and Function Study (NAFS) who regularly received home-delivered meals and completed baseline and 1-year in-home assessments. Based on an economic context model, self-reported data were collected on fundamental and proximate factors, food-sufficiency status, and intervening events. Determinants of heightened food insufficiency were examined with multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Not only did food-sufficiency status diminish over time in this sample, but it became or remained worse for older adults with diabetes. In addition to diabetes status, heightened food insufficiency was associated with perceived inadequacy of economic resources. IMPLICATIONS: Health care providers and nutrition programs should attempt to identify high-risk older adults - those who have diabetes and are at risk of food insufficiency - and develop community linkages and strategies that integrate nutrition with diabetes care plans, thus supporting a multidisciplinary, chronic care model to improve diabetes management and outcomes."
16186737,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the independent association between socioeconomic conditions and the risk of all-cause hospitalization or death during the course of HIV disease in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. METHODS: Patients in the French PRIMO multicenter prospective cohort of 319 individuals were enrolled during primary HIV-1 infection between 1996 and 2002. Associations between social characteristics (ie, employment status, stable partnership) and the risk of hospitalization or death were assessed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 109 hospitalizations among 84 patients (26.3%) and 3 deaths occurred. Even after adjustment for classic determinants of HIV-infected patients' health status, social characteristics were independently associated with the risk of hospitalization or death, with a significantly increased risk for patients with temporary employment compared with those with stable employment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 5.6) and for patients without a stable partnership compared with those with a stable partnership (OR = 1.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 2.7). CONCLUSIONS: In the era of HAART, adverse social conditions constitute independent risk factors of hospitalization or death during the course of HIV disease."

The growth rates are examined on different levels of aggregation (individual counties, subregions and regions) and in relation to several possible determinants of growth. The main objective of the study is to examine whether the growth patterns in the eighties support the hypothesis of a turnaround in the population development of rural areas.... The results reveal a diversity of growth patterns and significant regional differences. Rural counties within the daily urban system of a metropolitan area have significantly higher growth rates than peripheral rural counties. The results do not support the notion of a turnaround of long established trends. The trends in the eighties bear more resemblance to traditional growth patterns of rural areas."" (SUMMARY IN ENG)"

16443314,"This study examines the physical, behavioral, emotional and social determinants of self-rated health among Chinese older persons, and investigates if the effect of social support varies by gender. A representative sample of 1589 elderly community dwellers in Hong Kong were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Gender difference in the effect of social support was tested by an interaction term, 'gender x social support', in a hierarchical regression analysis. The frequency of falling ill, the number of chronic illnesses, sleep quality, mobility and positive emotions were most important determinants of self-rated health. The effect of social support was completely redundant when these factors were taken into account. The interaction term 'gender x social support' was significant and indicated a stronger effect for women, but the effect size was negligible (adding only 0.3% to the explained variance). This suggests that the effect of social support by and large is gender free. These findings suggest a high degree of similarity in the determinants of self-rated health between Western and Chinese older populations."
10287174,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7333334,"This study was designed to obtain information potentially of value in understanding an modifying the impact of the social environment of the perceived quality of like among institutionalized aged persons. It was hypothesized that Person-Environment (P-E) congruence, as assessed by the Environmental Perception, Preference and Importance Scale (EPPIS), would be related to (1) sex integration/segregation makeup of the health related facility (HRF) living units, and (2) quantity of social interaction between staff and residents. Analysis of sex by unit sex-type interaction for 60 residents' Person-Environment (P-E) congruence scores revealed that elderly females on sex-integrated units reported a higher level of P-E congruence than those residing on female-only units; males on sex-integrated units, in contrast, reported a poorer level of P-E congruence than males on sex -segregated units. Furthermore, behavioral observations of staff-resident verbal interactions confirmed the hypothesis that residents living on units with high staff-resident interaction perceived the environments more congruent with their preferences than residents on units low in verbal interaction. The observed relationships between the P-E congruence measure, resident-staff interaction, and unit sex-type were taken as further support for the relevance and value of the EPPIS measure as a tool for assessing and improving the institutional milieu."
24302171,"Within our present health care system, there is a growing movement that argues that our perceptions of health and illness are in need of change. This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited."
3780230,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits, reproductive and medical histories were compared of 328 women who had ever used oral contraceptives and 2306 never users from a case-control surveillance conducted in Northern Italy. Oral contraceptive use was positively and strongly related with the level of education and indicators of social class. The rate ratio of ever use (adjusted for age and diagnostic category) was 3.3 for women with 12 years of education or more compared with less than 7 years, and 3.0 for women of highest compared with lowest social class. The frequency of pill use was lower among never married women, and significantly elevated among smokers (rate ratio = 2.4 for heavy smokers). In contrast, no relation was evident between alcohol or coffee consumption and pill use. Likewise, ever users of oral contraceptives were not significantly different from women who had never used the pill with regard to major reproductive factors (parity and age at first pregnancy) or several medical variables of potential interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), with the only possible exclusion of obesity which was less frequent among pill users. Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of oral contraceptive use in this Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on oral contraceptive and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of oral contraceptive users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits."
3714667,"Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in different socioeconomic and educational groups in Finland. The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers."
3354493,"In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking."
19936550,"OBJECTIVE: Characterize diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in Bogota, Colombia and examine the extent and determinants of patient delay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using a census approach we identified 1 106 women with breast cancer. Information was gathered through personal interviews and the review of medical records. Patient delay was defined as the time elapsed from first symptoms to initial consultation. RESULTS: More than 80% of the women (902) consulted due to symptoms; the majority had advanced-stage disease. Patient delay was established in 20.3% and the main related factors were older age, lack of social security and advanced clinical stage. Higher education in patients was associated with reduced delays. DISCUSSION: Women do not recognize breast cancer symptoms. Patient delay and related factors are similar to those found in other studies. There is an urgent need to develop communication and education strategies regarding breast cancer symptoms and early detection."
10784368,"BACKGROUND: This study examined (1) disparities in the proportion of persons who accessed a physician for treatment of a diagnosed mental disorder across 17 health regions in Alberta, Canada, and (2) the extent to which regional disparities in physician access could be explained by differences in regional demographies, population needs, or physician supply. METHODS: The study illustrates the use of ecological comparisons for regional health system performance evaluations. Regional characteristics were aggregated from four sources of data: the health insurance registry file (population denominators and regional demographies), physician claims data (treatment access), census data (social indicators of population need), and the medical directory of the College of Physicians of Surgeons (physician supply). RESULTS: Regional variability in needs-adjusted measures of access to physician-based treatment services were comparatively small (varying by a factor of 1.6). Models containing adjustments for demography, need, and physician supply explained 41% of regional variation in access. Of the total variation explained, physician supply explained a smaller proportion (39%) in comparison to social demography and needs (61%). Few large regional imbalances were noted when needs-adjusted and supply-adjusted estimates were compared. Only two areas appeared to be underserviced in comparison to their local needs, reflecting approximately 6% of the provincial population. CONCLUSIONS: While all three study factors proved important, findings support the broad conclusion that social demography and social risk (a proxy for need) will remain the key determinants predicting access to physician services for treatment of mental disorders in publicly funded health systems."
4048286,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect elective hip and knee arthroplasties had on functional activities of daily living and if the background variables of age, gender, and surgery location can be used to predict functional outcome after these types of surgeries. Data were collected from 43 subjects, 6 to 35 months after they had elective hip or knee arthroplasties. The subjects responded to a mail survey that defined before surgery and after recovery functioning in relation to 22 activities of daily living representing personal care, housework-yard work, and recreation-social activities. Approximately 65% of the subjects reported no change in their ability to perform the 22 surveyed activities. Psychosocial variables appeared to be significant determinants of function. When the selected background data were compared with surgery results, women performed significantly better than men (p less than .05), but age and surgery location were not significant variables affecting outcome."
10304496,The diverse factors associated with sexuality among adolescents and the specific issues related to contraception in this developmentally diverse group result in complexity in policy formation. The future of an adolescent may be determined solely on the basis of access to supportive physical and emotional services funded by public and private sector monies. The purpose of this paper is to briefly present contemporary and social policies regarding pregnant adolescent health care. Suggestions as to how these policies can be translated into public adolescent health models are provided. The strategies will be related to primary and secondary public policy interventions.
3874527,"Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values."
2784327,"A survey of all registered deaths which occurred during 1981-1983 in women of reproductive age was carried out in Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause."
17963491,"BACKGROUND: The fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy determine the postpartum evaluation of birth. However, researchers have seldom considered the multiple determinants in one analysis. To explore to what extent the results can be generalised between countries, we analyse data of Belgian and Dutch women. Although Belgium and the Netherlands share the same language, geography and political system and have a common history, their health care systems diverge. The Belgian maternity care system corresponds to the ideal type of the medical model, whereas the Dutch system approaches the midwifery model. In this paper we examine multiple determinants, the fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy, for their association with satisfaction with childbirth in a cross-national perspective. METHODS: Two questionnaires were filled out by 605 women, one at 30 weeks of pregnancy and one within the first 2 weeks after childbirth either at home or in a hospital. Of these, 560 questionnaires were usable for analysis. Women were invited to participate in the study by independent midwives and obstetricians during antenatal visits in 2004-2005. Satisfaction with childbirth was measured by the Mackey Satisfaction with Childbirth Rating Scale, which takes into account the multidimensional nature of the concept. Labour pain was rated retrospectively using Visual Analogue Scales. Personal control was assessed with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire and Pearlin and Schooler's mastery scale. A hierarchical linear analysis was performed. RESULTS: Satisfaction with childbirth benefited most consistently from the fulfilment of expectations. In addition, the experience of personal control buffered the lowering impact of labour pain. Women with high self-efficacy showed more satisfaction with self-, midwife- and physician-related aspects of the birth experience. CONCLUSION: Our findings focus the attention toward personal control, self-efficacy and expectations about childbirth. This study confirms the multidimensionality of childbirth satisfaction and demonstrates that different factors predict the various dimensions of satisfaction. The model applies to both Belgian and Dutch women. Cross-national comparative research should further assess the dependence of the determinants of childbirth satisfaction on the organisation of maternity care."
3068425,"Well school-age children (N = 73) who had experienced the death of a sibling within one year of data collection were interviewed. Their reactions were related to the deceased sibling's age, nature of death, time interval since death, sex of child, and socioeconomic status. Subjects were located through registries of five hospitals and five municipalities of Rizal Province, Philippines. In addition to the interview, children produced stories about nine projective test pictures. Results showed that school grades dropped significantly after the sibling's death. Children's responses reflected three stages: (1) shock, disbelief, denial (10%); (2) guilt, protest, sadness (50%); and (3) acceptance and recovery (40%). Chi-square tests showed that Stage 1 was significantly associated with a younger age of the deceased sibling, more recent death (less than or equal to 6 months), and lower social class. With regard to the projective story themes, children whose siblings died suddenly (compared to those whose deaths were anticipated) had significantly higher loneliness themes. Children whose deceased siblings were of school age also gave significantly more death themes than children whose deceased siblings were younger."
3793442,"We analyze the ethical issues related to the physician's role in informing about, advising, rejecting, or performing a definitive birth control procedure (sterilization). We define a rational request for tubal ligation, the limited delaying (or facilitating) role that guidelines for deciding on ligation should have, the justifiable reasons for rejecting a request, and the physician's obligations and options. We also consider the need to supply adequate information, the implications of recommending a second-best treatment, and the pivotal place of the ""likelihood of regret"" in medical decision-making."
12046994,"Whereas satisfaction is one of the most important outcomes in palliative care settings, there have been no systematic studies investigating the effects of family- and organization-related variables on family satisfaction with care. To clarify factors contributing to family satisfaction with inpatient palliative care services, a cross-sectional mailed survey was performed. A 60-item questionnaire was mailed to 1026 bereaved subjects who had lost family members at one of 37 palliative care units in Japan to evaluate their sociodemographic characteristics and satisfaction levels with care. An institution survey was performed to collect organization-related variables. Caregiver satisfaction was rated on the Satisfaction scale for Family members receiving Inpatient Palliative Care (Sat-Fam-IPC). A total of 640 responses were analysed (response rate = 62%). The responses to overall satisfaction were 'satisfied' in 41 % and 'very satisfied' in 47%. The mean total score of the Sat-Fam-IPC was 82.4 +/- 13.2 on the 0-100 scale. The mean subscale scores were: 85.8 +/- 14.5 (Nursing Care), 81.5 +/- 18.4 (Symptom Palliation), 85.0 +/- 13.8 (Facility), 83.3 +/- 16.6 (Information), 83.1 +/- 17.3 (Availability), 78.3 +/- 18.9 (Family Care), and 79.8 +/- 17.3 (Cost). Significant determinants of family satisfaction identified were: nursing system, the number of nurses at night and presence of attending medical social workers (Nursing Care), patient age and the number of physicians (Symptom Palliation), floor space per bed (Facility), duration of admission and presence of attending medical social workers (Availability), patient age, family age, gender and occupational status (Family Care), patient age and the extra charge for a private room (Cost). In conclusion, informal caregivers are generally satisfied with inpatient palliative care services provided by members of the Japanese Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Units. The levels of satisfaction are influenced by various family- and organization-related variables."
18593800,"The 5-year incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its determinants, in a sample of men and women from Greece, was evaluated. From May 2001 to December 2002, 1514 men and 1528 women (>18 years old) without any clinical evidence of CVD, living in the Attica area, Greece, were enrolled in the ATTICA study. In 2006, a group of experts performed the 5-year follow-up (941 of the 3042 (31%) participants were lost to follow-up). Development of CVD (coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndromes, stroke, or other CVD) during the follow-up period was defined according to WHO-ICD-10 criteria. The 5-year incidence of CVD was 11.0% in men and 6.1% in women (p<0.001); the case fatality rate was 1.6%. Multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that increased age (odds ratio per year=1.09, p=0.04), waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio=5.07, p=0.02), hypertension (odds ratio=4.53, p=0.001), diabetes (odds ratio=4.53, p=0.001) and C-reactive protein levels (odds ratio per 1 mg/dl=1.31, p=0.02) were the most significant baseline bio-clinical predictors of CVD. Furthermore, an increased education level and greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (among 35-65-year-old individuals) were associated with a lower CVD incidence (odds ratio per 3 years of school difference=0.83, p<0.001 and odds ratio per 1/55 units in diet score=0.94, p<0.001), irrespective of various potential confounders. In conclusion, aging, central fat, hypertension and diabetes, inflammation process, low social status and abstinence from a Mediterranean diet seem to predict CVD events within a 5-year period."
3329429,"From a perspective of needs, risks and tasks of women throughout the life and family cycle the paper examines relationships between mental health and poverty by reviewing observed determinants and concomitants of poverty as well as stressors and risks associated with women's socioeconomic position, environmental conditions, and social roles. As a tool for policy development, a three-anchor needs proposition and a coping schema and formula are proposed as a new conceptual framework for appraising women's hazards and strengths. The poverty status of women in Canada is also reviewed."
7208724,"A population of professional dance (N = 183) and modelling (N = 56) students, who by career choice must focus increased attention and control over their body shapes, was studied. Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. The influence of socio-cultural determinants are discussed within the context of anorexia nervosa as a multidetermined disorder."
3446306,"The 800 census enumeration districts of Nottingham were used as a basis for the production of 12 distinct 'clusters' or neighbourhood types. Plotting the place of residence of the 68 patients with 'certain' or 'very likely' diagnoses of ICD-9 schizophrenia, identified in the World Health Organization Study of Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders, showed the expected concentration in central areas of low social status. A more varied distribution was found for 132 patients with a case-register diagnosis of affective psychosis, contacting the psychiatric services for the first time during the same two-year period as the schizophrenic patients. Some of the highest rates for affective psychosis were found in new housing estates of middle and low status at some distance from the town centre."
3169388,"A prospective study was carried out on 133 neurologically deviant infants, 205 with mild abnormalities and 230 normal newborns to compare behavioural and cognitive development with neonatal and nine-year-old neurological condition. Overtly handicapped children were excluded. Major determinants of school failure were the severity of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) and social class. Main risk factors for distractable and clumsy behaviour were MND classification and male sex; for troublesome behaviour male sex and interval complications after two years of age; and for timid behaviour, family adversity. Definite neonatal neurological deviancy contributed both directly and by its association with MND to problems in behaviour and scholastic abilities. Mild neonatal neurological abnormalities and adverse obstetrical events contributed only indirectly to behavioural and learning problems. Preterm birth (less than 34 weeks) was the sole obstetric variable directly related to some of the outcome variables. The difference between home and school perception of the children's behaviour is emphasized."
21694883,"BACKGROUND: The use of antibiotic drugs triggers a complex interaction involving many biological, sociological, and psychological determinants. Resistance to antibiotics is a serious worldwide problem which is increasing and has implications for morbidity, mortality, and health care both in hospitals and in the community. OBJECTIVES: To analyze current research on the determinants of antibiotic resistance and comprehensively review the main factors in the process of resistance in order to aid our understanding and assessment of this problem. METHODS: We conducted a MedLine search using the key words ""determinants"", ""antibiotic"", and ""antibiotic resistance"" to identify publications between 1995 and 2007 on the determinants of antibiotic resistance. Publications that did not address the determinants of antibiotic resistance were excluded. RESULTS: The process and determinants of antibiotic resistance are described, beginning with the development of antibiotics, resistance and the mechanisms of resistance, sociocultural determinants of resistance, the consequences of antibiotic resistance, and alternative measures proposed to combat antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the published literature identified the main determinants of antibiotic resistance as irrational use of antibiotics in humans and animal species, insufficient patient education when antibiotics are prescribed, lack of guidelines for treatment and control of infections, lack of scientific information for physicians on the rational use of antibiotics, and lack of official government policy on the rational use of antibiotics in public and private hospitals."
6393872,"Research in mental retardation in the GDR has been influenced primarily by the brain damage--development theory, which assumes biological as well as social determinants in human development. The theory was based on the results of brain damage (encephalopathy) research, which distinguishes between primary and secondary symptoms of mental retardation. The importance of social factors such as family conditions for development was demonstrated in a variety of studies, including research with adopted children. Positive results have been achieved with early education programming for developmentally disabled children, as well as with medical treatment for some genetically induced metabolic disorders. Results from longitudinal studies suggest that intelligence continues to develop in educable mentally retarded adolescents. New diagnostic methods have been developed; test of motor skills, visuomotor coordination, and a developmental test for young infants. Further developments of traditional school entrance diagnosis for special education classes is reported. Several studies show that there has been some success in the vocational and social integration of mentally retarded persons in the GDR."
2963022,"Research on attitudes toward the disabled generally has focused on adult perceptions of disabled adults, or children's attitudes toward peers. In view of changing social practices, such as mainstreaming in education and community integration of children with special needs, measures of adults' attitudes toward disabled children are needed. This paper reports on the development and validation of a 30-item self-report questionnaire assessing parental attitudes toward children with handicaps, and presents information concerning several determinants of parental attitudes. The measure is easy to use, reliable, and shows good evidence of construct validity. It detects differences among parents by gender, by parental education and occupational status, by cultural background of parents, by parental familiarity with a handicapped person, and by stimulus (physically disabled vs. mentally retarded child referent). Results are discussed in relation to determinants of parental attitudes toward handicaps. Potential applications of this measure for evaluation of teacher attitudes are suggested."
17839015,"Everyday observation reveals that both individuals and organizations often become overly committed to losing courses of action; in a sense, throwing good money after bad. More than 10 years of research on this escalation problem shows that persistence is associated with at least four major clases of determinants: project, psychological, social, and organizational variables. The influence of these four sets of variables evolves over time, forming a dynamic model of behavior in escalation situations."
17582668,"Household surveys from the developing world consistently record a generally low level of illness reporting, but the evidence that substantial differences exist in illness reporting between income groups is scanty. In contrast, a huge gap in illness reporting exists between rich and poor countries. Medical anthropologists have highlighted the differential illness perception across income groups but little is known as to what extent economic variables do determine one's illness decision. In this paper, discrete choice theory is used to explain why some parents choose to report their children's illnesses more often than others in Nepal. An empirical model is developed that depicts illness-reporting decisions as a function of inter alia, price and income. Data are drawn from Phase I of the Nepal Living Standards Survey. The results suggest that income as well as the price that parents expect to pay on treatment of their children's non-chronic ailments determine their decision to report an illness, when controlling for other variables (price responsiveness =-1.16; income responsiveness=0.23; p-value=0.00). This behaviour is theoretically consistent as parents weigh the opportunity costs of their decision (here, choosing to report an illness). Its implications are broader and raise other questions, e.g., Can we explain the difference in illness-perception rates between rich and poor countries that have different mechanisms to finance health care?"
19357732,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for placenta praevia presenting with severe vaginal bleeding in Mulago hospital, Kampala, Uganda. DESIGN: A case control study. SETTING: Mulago hospital labour suite PARTICIPANTS: Between 15th November 2001 and 30th November 2002 we identified and recruited thirty six parturients with placenta previa who developed severe bleeding and 180 women with normal delivery. The risk factors were studied. VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Socio demographic characteristics, social and family history, gynaecological operations, blood transfusion, medical conditions, past and present obstetric performance and HIV status. RESULTS: Significant predictors for severe bleeding in parturients with placenta praevia were: previous history of evacuation of the uterus or dilation and curettage (O.R. 3.6, CI: 1.1-12.5), delivery by caesarean section in previous pregnancy (O.R. 19.9, CI: 6.4-61.7), residing more than ten kilometres from Mulago hospital (O.R. 2.4, CI: 1.0-5.7) and recurrent vaginal bleeding during the current pregnancy (O.R. 7.3, CI 2.4-63.7). CONCLUSION: Severe bleeding in placenta praevia is associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality. The determinants of severe bleeding in placenta praevia can be used in the antenatal period to identify mothers at risk. These, with prompt interventions to deliver the women can be used to reduce the maternal morbidity associated with this condition."
15058797,"BACKGROUND: Mental health is a central determinant of quality of life. While psychiatric morbidity of populations has been studied extensively, the role of perceived stress, social support, and internal resources as determinant of health is still poorly understood. METHODS: We surveyed 2000 randomly selected university students. Perceived stress was measured by the Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument, social support by the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, internal resources (mastery and self-esteem) by a brief version of the Pearlin coping questionnaire. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationships between these variables and mental health, based on the SF-12 health survey. RESULTS: After two reminders, 1257 students answered the questionnaire. In bivariate analysis, mental health was negatively associated with stress and positively associated with internal resources and social support (all p-values < 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, internal resources were positively associated with mental health, and buffered the negative impact of stress on mental health. Internal resources and stress mediated the positive impact of social support on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that perceived stress is an important risk factor for low mental health and suggest that mastery and self-esteem are important protective factors of mental health among young adults."
19168935,"BACKGROUND: In Canada the incidence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 1 in 100 live births. FASD is the leading cause of developmental and cognitive disabilities in Canada. Only one study has examined the cost of FASD in Canada. In that study we did not include prospective data for infants under the age of one year, costs for adults beyond 21 years or costs for individuals living in institutions. OBJECTIVE: To calculate a revised estimate of direct and indirect costs associated with FASD at the patient level. METHODS: Cross-sectional study design was used. Two-hundred and fifty (250) participants completed the study tool. Participants included caregivers of children, youth and adults, with FASD, from day of birth to 53 years, living in urban and rural communities throughout Canada participated. Participants completed the Health Services Utilization Inventory (HSUI). Key cost components were elicited: direct costs: medical, education, social services, out-of-pocket costs; and indirect costs: productivity losses. Total average costs per individual with FASD were calculated by summing the costs for each in each cost component, and dividing by the sample size. Costs were extrapolated to one year. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant determinants of costs and to calculate the adjusted annual costs associated with FASD. RESULTS: Total adjusted annual costs associated with FASD at the individual level was $21,642 (95% CI, $19,842; $24,041), compared to $14,342 (95% CI, $12,986; $15,698) in the first study. Severity of the individual's condition, age, and relationship of the individual to the caregiver (biological, adoptive, foster) were significant determinants of costs (p < 0.001). Cost of FASD annually to Canada of those from day of birth to 53 years old, was $5.3 billion (95% CI, $4.12 billion; $6.4 billion). CONCLUSIONS: Study results demonstrated the cost burden of FASD in Canada was profound. Inclusion of infants aged 0 to 1 years, adults beyond the age of 21 years and costs associated with residing in institutions provided a more accurate estimate of the costs of FASD. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed. Key words: Alcohol, pregnancy, cost, economic burden, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder."
16432486,"Heterosexual transmission of HIV in the United States appears to be following the epidemiologic pattern of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as syphilis and gonorrhea, disproportionately affecting blacks in the Southeastern region. Nationwide, rates of syphilis and gonorrhea are nearly 30 times higher in blacks than in whites, and this racial disparity underlies most of the regional and county-level differences in rates. The racial disparity cannot be explained by traditional measures of socioeconomic differences, and it cannot be explained by individual-level determinants of sexual behavior, but rather reflects deeper group-level social and environmental factors for which race is a marker. A theoretical model based on previous ecologic studies is proposed to explain the relationship between racial discrimination and elevated rates of STDs in blacks. Key factors in the model include: 1) chronic joblessness, 2) drug and alcohol marketing, 3) social disorganization (or social capital), and 4) male incarceration."
7259481,"In 1973, 532 persons desiring to quit smoking and seeking the Hermano therapy of chirothesia were questioned prior to the ritual treatment session. Typical smoking behavior, social background, and personality tests were documented. At intervals of 4 months, 1 year, and 5 years after treatment the group was examined with a follow-up questionnaire. In two earlier studies Gmur evaluated the results of this treatment after 1 year and analyzed in detail the various factors which influence these results. The present paper investigates the determinations for success with a follow-up study 5 years after treatment. The analysis show that the treatment was seldom successful for persons with an accentuated addiction-like smoking behavior. There were no findings proving a correlation between personality pattern and/or sociodemographic data and treatment success. No criteria was found to suggest indications for the successful application of the Hermano therapy."
16228697,"The aim of this was to examine rates and determinants of depressive symptomatology in the immediate postpartum period among Hispanic women in the United States. A total of 3952 Hispanic women who had delivered infants (parturients) were interviewed in postpartum wards in Miami, New York City and San Francisco. Symptoms of depression were regressed onto a series of social, psychological, and socioeconomic variables. Results showed that 42.6% of participants were probable cases of depression (CES-D > or = 16). Depression was negatively associated with perceived level of social support (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53-0.67) and health insurance coverage (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.95), but not with the degree of acculturation or immigration status. It was found that depressive symptoms are common among Hispanic parturients. Pregnant Hispanic women should be carefully monitored for signs of depression and appropriate preventive measures are needed."
3806448,"Social psychological models of health care behaviour frequently take as their starting point perception of the illness. This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed."
2723595,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."
12623523,"BACKGROUND: Although behaviours regarded as unhealthy are widespread, behaving in an unhealthy manner in several respects is relatively uncommon. However, people with multiple unhealthy behaviours exist and their number is larger than expected if the behaviours were not related to each other. The aim of this study was to examine sociodemographic determinants of multiple unhealthy behaviours, with special reference to independent and combined effects of the determinants. METHODS: Data on unhealthy behaviours were derived from nationwide surveys among Finnish adults. The mean number of unhealthy behaviours practised on a daily basis and the probability of reporting three or four of these behaviours was examined across sociodemographic groups. RESULTS: Age, educational level and marital status predicted reporting of three or four unhealthy behaviours. Interactions were observed between education and age in both genders as well as between marital status and age in men and educational level and living area in women. Mean numbers of unhealthy behaviours showed similar patterns to having three or four unhealthy behaviours but few differences between the means were statistically significant and there were no interactions. CONCLUSION: The influence of each sociodemographic determinant on multiple unhealthy behaviours was relatively independent from the other sociodemographic determinants. As the effect of these determinants tends to be cumulative, engaging in multiple unhealthy behaviours is common in population subgroups with several unfavourable characteristics. In health promotion initiatives special attention should be paid to such population groups and their social circumstances."
2808474,"The seasonality of births in the period 1871-1977 is studied in a rural north-western Spanish population. Based on a total sample of 11,695 birth registrations, temporal variation is analysed. For siblings, according to family reconstitution, the total family size, the legitimacy of the child, and birth order are considered. A coefficient of birth month dispersion is defined and estimated for each family. Intra-family variation is related to inter-family coefficients in order to determine whether the local seasonal pattern of births may be partly explained by family characteristics."
12793513,"BACKGROUND: Psychiatric hospitals in Italy had to be closed under a law dated 1994. AIMS: To investigate the discharge of patients from public psychiatric hospitals. METHODS: A total of 4492 patients from 22 psychiatric hospitals were described at recruitment and followed during the period 1994-2000. Their characteristics were investigated as determinants of discharge to community residential facilities for psychiatric patients versus other settings. RESULTS: All 22 psychiatric hospitals closed between 1994 and 2000; 678 patients had died, and the remainder were discharged. Of these, 39% went to nursing homes, 29% to community residential facilities for psychiatric patients, 2% joined their family, less than 1% were settled in private independent accommodation, and 29% remained in the psychiatric hospital, although defined as discharged. Ten patients were recorded as missing when still in the psychiatric hospitals, none after discharge. Younger, more educated patients and patients from two of the four regions studied were more likely to be discharged to community residential facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients were discharged to highly supervised settings. The potential risk of abandonment due to deinstitutionalization was not observed in this population. The wide use of highly supervised settings can be explained by the patients' old age, but different local policies may have affected the discharge process."
2614820,"Social and psychological variables are used to explain why young people become cigarette smokers, whereas biological factors have been virtually ignored as possible determinants of that behavior. In this study, salivary testosterone was positively associated with cigarette smoking among 201 subjects 12-14 years of age. This finding suggests that testosterone should be included in future considerations of adolescent cigarette smoking."
18093027,"BACKGROUND: Empirical research suggests that social disadvantage has a negative effect on the development of language, and related cognitive skills such as reading. There is, however, no corresponding body of research on the impact of social disadvantage on motor development. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of social disadvantage on motor development in young children. In addition, we explored a possible link between an early neuromotor indicator and attainments in language, and reading. METHODS: The Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure was used to identify two contrasting districts based on a composite measure of social disadvantage. We investigated the effect of social disadvantage on the motor attainments of a sample of 239 children aged 4-5 years, and 276 children aged 7-8 years attending mainstream schools in each district using a standardised motor assessment battery, and a motor neurodevelopmental measure. We used standardised receptive language and reading assessments to evaluate possible associations between motor and language/reading attainments. RESULTS: There was a significant negative effect of social disadvantage on motor skills, for both age groups, and for both males and females. A similar negative effect of social disadvantage on attainments in language, and reading was also found. Children from areas of social disadvantage had significant deficits in motor and receptive language attainments relative to their more advantaged peers. In addition, we revealed a significant predictive relationship between a neurodevelopmental measure of early motor development and reading attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Children growing up in socially disadvantaged areas may be at particular risk of motor, including neurodevelopmental, delay, as well as language and reading difficulties. The determinants of motor and neuromotor deficits in children from disadvantaged backgrounds should be explored, and the relationship between early neuromotor development and language/reading development requires further investigation."
12830862,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors (eg, familiarity, sex, neutering status, and time of year) associated with aggression between domestic ferrets and test a method for reducing aggression when introducing ferrets. DESIGN: Prospective trial. ANIMALS: 56 healthy domestic ferrets. PROCEDURE: To identify variables associated with aggression, pairs were placed in an enclosed area and observed. To test whether increasing familiarity would decrease aggression when introducing ferrets, pairs of ferrets were housed in separate cages next to each other or in separate rooms for 2 weeks prior to introduction. RESULTS: 49 of 82 pairs of strangers fought, but 31 cage mate pairs did not. Time of year had no apparent effect. Pairs consisting of 2 neutered females or 2 sexually intact males were significantly more likely to fight than were pairs consisting of a neutered female and a sexually intact male. Pairs caged next to each other for 2 weeks prior to introduction were no less likely to fight than were control pairs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that familiarity, sex, and neutering status are important determinants of aggression between ferrets. If unfamiliar neutered ferrets are introduced, then pairing 2 males or a male and female would likely result in the lowest levels of aggression. However, neutered females and sexually intact males are not indiscriminately aggressive, as a neutered female can be paired with a sexually intact male without resulting in aggression. Caging ferrets next to each other for 2 weeks does not decrease aggression when the ferrets are introduced."
17687880,"Cocaine consumption in Spain continues to rise and is reaching an alarming level. This is a descriptive and correlational study in which a transcultural analysis is made with a sample of 62 different countries. The aim of this study is to compare the influence of macrosocial, cultural and economic variables on the behaviour of cocaine abuse. Thus, the importance of the cocaine traffic and supply is shown in relation to the abuse of the same, but recognition and emphasis is given to the presence of other explanatory factors characteristic of societies in which cocaine is abused and demanded. These factors are: predominance of cultural values of self-expression, high index of subjective wellbeing and a high GNP per capita. Finally, the relevance of social factors, environment and socio-economic context, as determinants of cocaine abuse from a trans-cultural perspective, are discussed. The implementation of different actions is proposed: the promotion of values oriented towards self-regulation and self-control, the control of the cocaine supply (direct and indirect), combating early cultural destruction by means of publicity and promoting cultural creation and the diversification of leisure."
16629693,"Intrauterine growth retardation and preterm birth are more frequent in African-American women and women of lower socio-economic status, but the reasons for these disparities are not fully understood. The physical and social environments in which these women live may contribute to these disparities. We conducted a multilevel study to explore whether conditions of mothers' neighbourhood of residence contribute to adverse birth outcomes independent of individual-level determinants. We analysed data from 105 111 births in 1015 census tracts in Louisiana during 1997-98, merging it with data from other existing sources on neighbourhood socio-economic status, neighbourhood physical deterioration, and neighbourhood density of retail outlets selling tobacco, alcohol and foods. After controlling for individual-level sociodemographic factors, tract-level median household income was positively associated with both birthweight-for-gestational-age and gestational age at birth. Neighbourhood physical deterioration was associated with these birth outcomes in ecological analyses but only inconsistently associated with them after controlling for individual-level factors. Neither gestational age nor birthweight-for-gestational-age was associated with the neighbourhood density of alcohol outlets, tobacco outlets, fast-food restaurants or grocery supermarkets. We conclude that measures of neighbourhood economic conditions are associated with both fetal growth and the length of gestation independent of individual-level factors, but that readily available measures of neighbourhood retail outlets are not. Additional studies are needed to better understand the nature of environmental influences on birth outcomes."
15714217,"OBJECTIVE: To outline the rationale, objectives and strategies used in a systematically designed research programmme to study specific weight gain-inducing behaviours, their social-psychological as well as environmental determinants, and the effects of interventions aimed at the prevention of weight gain. DESIGN: The evidence for potential behavioural determinants and strategies to prevent weight gain was reviewed, and the methods applied within the Netherlands Research programme weight gain prevention (NHF-NRG) project were described. The project is designed according to the Intervention Mapping protocol. SETTING: The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: The main target groups are (a) adolescents (12-16 y) in secondary school, (b) young adults (20-40 y) at the workplace and (c) recently retired people (55-65 y) at home. INTERVENTIONS: Each intervention includes an individual component, in which computer-tailored information is provided. Additionally, interventions are aimed at changing environmental components. RESULTS: The short-term results of this project can be expected by the beginning of 2005. Guidelines for nationwide weight gain prevention, based on this research programme, will become available in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the few interventions that were evaluated to date, no robust conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of obesity prevention. The systematic and multidisciplinary design of the NHF-NRG programme enables the identification of potentially effective methods and strategies for the prevention of weight gain."
7418140,"Correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were studied in 4756 white males and females ages 20-59 years examined during a population survey conducted by 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined. These empirical findings from a cross-sectional study replicated across diverse populations were used to derive speculative estimates of the potential for modification of population levels of HDL cholesterol, consistent with hygienic intervention and lifestyle changes. The results of the study were considered in the context of the literature on determinants of HDL cholesterol."
6520880,"This study tests two theories regarding the attitude and behavioral determinants of women's coital and masturbatory orgasmic responsiveness. Data from 115 sexually active women were analyzed using latent-variable structural equation models. Twenty-one variables are used to represent seven latent constructs: Parent Sexual Attitudes, Sexual Latency, Sexual Behavior, Dating Competence, Social Assertiveness, Subjective Masturbatory Responsiveness, and Subjective Coital Responsiveness. Two specific theories are tested with these constructs. Each theory predicts a different structural arrangement among these latent factors with the fundamental difference being whether behavior predicts responsiveness or vice-versa. Two alternate models were found to reflect the data adequately. In both instances, attitudes predicted behavior and, in general, orgasmic responsiveness tended to be a function of behavior."
12339124,"""This article highlights some of the principal demographic determinants of recent Cuban emigration, while also considering how these demographic variables interact with other social and economic determinants, utilizing a broad conceptualization of emigration.

6644542,"Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition."
12314072,"The factors affecting the modern decline in fertility in the Netherlands are explored using data from censuses from 1930 to 1971 and additional unpublished sources. Particular attention is paid to the influence of religion, socioeconomic status, and region. The author concludes that ""a theory formulated by Lesthaeghe and Wilson on the relation between modes of production and secularization and the pace of fertility decline in Western Europe offers--in combination with van Heek's views on the special position of Dutch Roman Catholicism--a starting point for an explanation of why the fertility decline of Roman Catholics, self-employed and agricultural labourers lagged behind.""

3669072,"This study employed multivariate analyses and structural modeling procedures to examine a model for the determinants of adherence to medical regimens. Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction."
12283031,"""The paper attempts to investigate and identify some of the most important predictors of family size-preferences in Pakistan. Based on cross-sectional data relating to 9,416 currently married women, the results of this study suggest that having one or more sons in the family is the principal predictor of the desired family size. Yet another important predictor is the education of the wife which plays a critical role in the family size determination. The study shows that the preferences for family size do not vary greatly between urban and rural areas."""
6541496,"The effects of two methoxyindoles, melatonin (MEL) and 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTL), on partner investigation and other aspects of pair behaviour in the open field, were observed on male and female mice of the albino TO, and the pigmented C57BL/6 strains. Both indole derivatives are major secretory products of rodent (and human) pineal glands. They were administered by i.p. injection (100 micrograms/kg) to both members of the pair 1 h before each 10 min open field exposure. The testing took place on 3 consecutive days. There were no significant differences in behaviour over days, and group means were used in subsequent data analysis (MANOVA and Dunnet's test). Males, more socially active than the females in both strains, responded to MEL by a reduction in contact time; 5-MTL had the same effect on C57 males (TO males showed no change). Females, on the other hand, did not respond to MEL, and increased their social contact seeking after 5-MTL. There was no consistent effect of either indole on locomotion, and erratic (TO strain only) effects on defaecation. The data are discussed in terms of possible actions of pineal indoles on determinants of social behaviour."
6504868,"Preventive and therapeutic advances have brought life expectancy in the United States to well over 70 years and have shifted mortality causes from acute to chronic diseases, the determinants of which are genetics, lifestyle, the environment, and aging itself. Plausible approaches to chronic disease prevention are likely to increase longevity further, with some foreseeable effects on demographic and economic projections. Primarily, longevity advances would swell forecasts of population size, and would thus have to be met by production advances in order to maintain or improve living standards. This study, a restricted example, considers the probable demographic and economic consequences of a limited prevention program in the context of the Ford Motor Company, based on actual experience and certain expectations up to the year 2000. According to the results, prevention would reduce outlays for life insurance, disability, and health care, but would also generate the higher costs of extending pension plans. Undoubtedly, prevention will continue to be highly ranked in society's pursuit of happiness, and society must prepare to meet its effects with appropriate social and economic policies."
7390022,"A series of experiments was performed to examine the determinants of the rat pups' 1st excursions from the maternal nest into the novel environment outside the burrow. A standardized, nidic environment consisting of a maternal nest and adjoining open field was studied under a variety of structured test conditions. When the mother was outside the nest, pups readily ventured into the field. The early excursions were not stimulated by the mother's absence from the nest because when the mother was removed from the nest but not placed in the field the pups remained nestbound. Anesthetized dams elicited few excursions, suggesting that olfactory cues are less potent in this situation than behaviorally transmitted signals. Nonlactating adults were not attractive to pups but after induction of ""maternal responsiveness"" concaveated males facilitated egression. The data from a final experiment suggest that when in the nest, the dam stimulates egression by providing additional ""permissive"" stimuli that render the weanling more responsive to approach cues outside the nest."
17461334,"Understanding the determinants of individuals' perceptions of their risk of becoming infected with HIV and their perceptions of acceptable strategies of prevention is an essential step toward curtailing the spread of this disease. We focus in this article on learning and decision-making about AIDS in the context of high uncertainty about the disease and appropriate behavioral responses. We argue that social interactions are important for both. Using longitudinal survey data from rural Kenya and Malawi, we test this hypothesis. We investigate whether social interactions--and especially the extent to which social network partners perceive themselves to be at risk--exert causal influences on respondents' risk perceptions and on one approach to prevention, spousal communication about the threat of AIDS to the couple and their children. The study explicitly allows for the possibility that important characteristics, such as unobserved preferences or community characteristics, determine not only the outcomes of interest but also the size and composition of networks. The most important empirical result is that social networks have significant and substantial effects on risk perceptions and the adoption of new behaviors even after we control for unobserved factors."
12479494,"OBJECTIVE: To examine a prevailing conceptual model of health services use (Andersen 1995) and to suggest modifications that may enhance its explanatory power when applied to empirical studies of race/ethnicity and long-term care. STUDY SETTING: Twelve focus groups of African-American (five groups) and white (seven groups) individuals, aged 65 and older, residing in Connecticut during 2000. STUDY DESIGN: Using qualitative analysis, data were coded and analyzed in NUD-IST 4 software to facilitate the reporting of recurrent themes, supporting quotations, and links among the themes for developing the conceptual framework. Specific analysis was conducted to assess distinctions in common themes between African-American and white focus groups. DATA COLLECTION: Data were collected using a standardized discussion guide, augmented by prompts for clarification. Audio taped sessions were transcribed and independently coded by investigators and crosschecked to enhance coding validity. An audit trail was maintained to document analytic decisions during data analysis and interpretation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Psychosocial factors (e.g., attitudes and knowledge, social norms, and perceived control) are identified as determinants of service use, thereby expanding the Andersen model (1995). African-American and white focus group members differed in their reported accessibility of information about long-term care, social norms concerning caregiving expectations and burden, and concerns of privacy and self-determination. CONCLUSIONS: More comprehensive identification of psychosocial factors may enhance our understanding of the complex role of race/ethnicity in long-term care use as well as the effectiveness of policies and programs designed to address disparities in long-term care service use among minority and nonminority groups."
16234425,"BACKGROUND: Recent research has corroborated the notion that seasonality in suicide is more heterogeneous and less consistent than postulated by former scholars. This work investigates the smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland between the late 19th and the end of the 20th century. It includes analyses by region and by suicide method. METHODS: Monthly suicide frequencies in Switzerland are available for the period 1876-2000. Data on canton/region are available for the periods 1901-1920 and 1969-2000, and data on suicide method for the periods 1881-1920 and 1969-2000. Analyses focusing on the overall change rely on data aggregated by quinquennia. The Edwards' test and the peak-low ratio were used in univariate analyses of seasonality. Putative determinants of the peak-low ratio were examined using regression analysis with cantonal data. RESULTS: The decrease of seasonal effects in suicide applies to a period of more than 100 years in Switzerland. Big differences of seasonal effects have existed all the time with regard to specific methods and to specific regions. No seasonality was apparent in poisoning, and in Geneva and Basle City, respectively. However, the seasonal effects have been most impressive in drowning and hanging suicides, and in rural Catholic regions. In regression analysis, the decline in suicide seasonality is associated with the decline in the agricultural work force. CONCLUSIONS: The smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland has been a continuous long term process, which probably started by the end of 19th century. Seasonal effects in suicide will probably fade away in most regions of Switzerland and in most suicide methods. This process is in parallel with the disappearance of the traditional rural society."
3608944,"This study examined the cognitive structures underlying women's intentions to delay or not delay seeking medical care for a breast cancer symptom. Middle-aged women imagined that they had just discovered a particular change in their breast, and they completed a questionnaire that assessed variables specified by Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action with respect to two alternative courses of action: immediately calling the doctor (i.e., prompt behavior) and monitoring the breast change on one's own (i.e., delay behavior). Also assessed were variables external to the theory that were drawn from previous research on cancer delay. Results showed that intentions to delay were positively associated with having favorable attitudes toward delay and with perceived social pressure to delay; the attitudinal factor, however, was more influential than the social factor in determining intentions. Underlying favorable attitudes toward delay were beliefs that delay would be likely to result in maintaining control over and avoiding the disruption of one's own and others' lives but would be unlikely to result in negative health outcomes. No external variable was found to contribute to intentions to delay above and beyond attitudinal and normative considerations."
18537814,"This paper investigates the determinants of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture utilization for cancer patients who are simultaneously having conventional Western medical treatments. This study used five leading cancers in Taiwan, namely cervical, breast, lung, liver and colorectal cancers. A total of 2499 cancer patients were interviewed, of which 2034 had full information and were analysed. Logistic regressions were used for both TCM and acupuncture. The results showed that type of cancer and cancer duration determine the utilization for alternative treatments. While socio-economic factors also affect choice of alternative medicine, the magnitude differs by types of alternative treatment and cancer. Compared with men and older patients, women and younger patients tend to prefer alternative medicine, and patients from south have higher preference for alternative medicine, which could be a reflection of local culture. Our results are useful for the government to determine higher users of TCM and acupuncture among cancer patients, and make policies to suit these patients' needs."
20003516,"Social determinants of health describe the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age and their influence on health. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels, which are themselves influenced by policy choices. Armed conflict and forced displacement are important influences on the social determinants of health. There is limited evidence on the social determinants of health of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been forced from their homes due to armed conflict but remain within the borders of their country. The aim of this study was to explore the social determinants of overall physical and mental health of IDPs, including the response strategies used by IDPs to support their health needs. Northern Uganda was chosen as a case-study, and 21 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with IDPs were conducted in fifteen IDP camps between November and December 2006.The findings indicated a number of key social determinants. Experiencing traumatic events could cause ""over thinking"" which in turn could lead to ""madness"" and physical ailments. Respondents also attributed ""over thinking"" to the spirit (cen) of a killed person returning to disturb its killer. Other social determinants included overcrowding which affected physical health and contributed to an emotional sense of loss of freedom; and poverty and loss of land which affected physical health from lack of food and income, and mental health because of worry and uncertainty. Respondents also commented on how the conflict and displacement and led to changes in social and cultural norms such as increased ""adultery"", ""defilement"", and ""thieving"". Response strategies included a combination of biopsychosocial health services, traditional practices, religion, family and friends, and isolating.This study supports work exploring the political, environmental, economic, and socio-cultural determinants of health of IDPs. Addressing these determinants is essential to fundamentally improving the overall physical and mental health of IDPs."
18030822,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, the city of Milwaukee ranked worse than any Wisconsin county for health outcomes and worse than all but 1 county for health determinants. METHODS: To further examine disparities in health, Milwaukee city ZIP codes were stratified into 3 groups (lower, middle, and upper) by socioeconomic status (SES). Health determinants (15 measures) and health outcomes (2 measures) were compared across these ZIP code groups, and to the rest of Wisconsin. RESULTS: The risk ratio for the lower SES group in comparison to the upper SES group was at least 2.0 for 5 of the 17 measures examined, and was at least 1.5 for 13 of the 17 measures. The upper SES group in Milwaukee, while the healthiest in the city, was worse than the state average in 6 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Large health disparities within the city of Milwaukee are associated with geographic regions of differing socioeconomic status. As the state's largest urban center, Milwaukee's relatively poor health and significant health disparities have a considerable impact on the overall health of the state. To improve population health in Wisconsin, substantial efforts and resources are needed to address these disparities, and their related upstream factors."
10281815,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious."
6520656,"Smoking during pregnancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including fetal and neonatal death. These consequences are tragic in many ways, but perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they are preventable if the smoker ceases to smoke during pregnancy. Although in some instances the so-called constitutional hypothesis is difficult to disprove, the available evidence seems more than convincing that it is smoking itself, and not the smoker's unique constitution, that is responsible. Cessation from smoking is clearly advisable at any time, but more so during pregnancy when every cigarette affects both the smoker and her unborn child."
16300663,"Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a multifactorial problem, which affects men of all ages and in all demographics. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence of prostatitis is approximately 2-10% among unselected men in North America, Europe and Asia. This data clearly indicates that chronic prostatitis constitutes an important problem in international health care. Nevertheless, the aetiology and pathogenesis of chronic prostatitis have yet to be clearly delineated, despite the numerous efforts which have been made, with regard to both basic and clinical research. In fact, factors other than leucocytes and bacteria have been shown to contribute to the symptoms typically associated with prostatitis. Studies of the epidemiology and determinants of prostatitis risk factors may also provide clues to the general aetiology of prostatitis. Other epidemiological data appears to indicate that certain as-yet-unknown factors might be associated with an increased tendency towards the development of chronic prostatitis. However, findings from most studies are considered to represent only preliminary data, because of the small sample sizes or lack of generalizability inherent to most of the studies. The identification and characterization of these relevant risk factors might accelerate or augment the development of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these syndromes."
18265961,"BACKGROUND: Possible interactions between nervous and immune systems during opioid addiction remain elusive. Recombinant mu-delta opioid receptors (MDOR) and the glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) subunit of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid glutamate receptors are involved in acute and chronic effects of morphine. Elevated levels of autoantibodies (aAbs) to these receptors were demonstrated in heroin human addicts and in animal models. This study characterized the role of aAbs to these receptors in behavioral modulations recruited during opioid tolerance and sensitization. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Male CD-1 mice, immunized with either MDOR or GluR1 peptide fragments (80 microg intraperitoneal (i.p.)), were examined for spontaneous behavior and response to morphine (5 mg/kg i.p.). Spontaneous home-cage activity, novelty-induced self-grooming and morphine-induced hyperactivity were higher in GluR1 mice compared to Vehicle subjects, whereas MDOR immunization was associated with an increased morphine-induced conditioned place preference. In response to escalating doses of morphine (from 10 to 60 mg/kg i.p., twice daily) and naloxone-precipitated withdrawal (1 mg/kg subcutaneous), GluR1 mice exhibited a more marked stereotyped sniffing behavior and less body tremors compared to Vehicle subjects, whereas less sniffing and teeth chattering were found in MDOR mice. The expected downregulation of mu receptor binding sites, induced by chronic morphine in vehicle subjects, was completely absent following MDOR immunization. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate an altered response to morphine-related reinforcing and aversive effects in MDOR mice and altered coping with the environment in GluR1 mice. Circulating aAbs to specific neuroreceptors may alter the response to opiates and play a role as determinants of vulnerability to opiate addiction."
11151349,"Work behavior among older men approaching or following retirement has received considerable research attention over the past two decades, but research on older women's work behavior is still in its incipient stage. Based on data from the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey (NBS) and the 1991 New Beneficiary Follow-up (NBF), this study analyzes the extent and determinants of employment among women who received their first Social Security benefits between 1980 and 1981. More than one fourth of the women continued to work or rejoined the labor force following their first Social Security benefit receipt. Financial need was found to be the primary reason for and the most significant determinant of women's continuing work or (re)entry into the labor force. But the level of education, health, spouse's work status, and previous work history were also found to be significant determinants of the likelihood and duration of their employment following Social Security receipt."
16135394,"Racial differences in infant mortality in South Africa are studied using household-level data from 1987 to 1989 and 1998. Logistic regression models are estimated to explore the determinants of the overall trend in infant mortality and racial disparities in infants' survival chances. We do not find evidence for reduced overall risk of infant death among births that occurred from 1993 to 1998 when compared to those that occurred from 1982 to 1989, despite policy and action directed toward this goal by the new government that was elected in early 1994. We also find that persistent inequalities in the personal and household resources of South Africa's four main racial groups substantially account for racial differences in infant survival rates in both periods. These findings are discussed in light of contemporary social and health issues in South Africa."
6106945,"Given the poor quantity and quality of medical care in most villages in the developing countries, the economic determinants of village health are the supply of labour, the cash flow associated with that labour and the availability of land. The paper examines these in the three classical 'time periods', arguing that inability to meet labour peaks is of great significance in explaining seasonal shortage of food and chronic shortage of cash. It also explains community indifference to upkeep of social overhead capital. Substitution of capital goods for labour is socially differentiated, not least by labour availability, and leads inevitably to a regressive distribution of land and the creation or enlargement of a class of landless labourers. Under certain limited conditions this class may enjoy a rising real income with associated health-promotive expenditures. The more normal case, however, is extreme poverty, whether rural or urban, with all that that implies for the undermining of health. Land reform therefore becomes a necessary precondition of health promotion."
7326949,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points."
3494378,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy."
12856126,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To describe the clinical, psychological and social factors affecting diabetes knowledge of veterans with established Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of 284 insulin-treated veterans with stable Type 2 diabetes. All subjects completed the University of Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Centre Knowledge Test, the Diabetes Care Profile, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Diabetes Family Behaviour Checklist. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop a model for the diabetes knowledge score based upon clinical and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: One hundred eighty subjects were evaluated in a derivation set. The mean age +/- SD was 65.4+/-9.6 years, 94% were men, and 36% were members of a minority group. Performance on the diabetes knowledge test was poor (64.9+/-15.3% correct). Self-perceived understanding of all management objectives explained only 6% of the variance in the knowledge scores. Multivariate analysis showed that age, years of schooling, duration of treatment, cognitive function, sex, and level of depression were independent determinants of the knowledge score. When the model was applied to 104 subjects in a validation set, there was a strong correlation between observed and predicted scores (r=0.537; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Stable, insulin-treated veterans have major deficiencies in diabetes knowledge that could impair their ability to provide self-care. A multivariate model comprised of demographic variables and psychosocial profiling can identify patients who have limited diabetes knowledge and be used to assess individual barriers to ongoing diabetes education."
12095425,"BACKGROUND: Very low birthweight, i.e. a birthweight < 1500 g, is among the strongest determinants of infant mortality and childhood morbidity. To develop primary prevention approaches to VLBW birth and its sequelae, information is needed on the causes of preterm birth, their personal and social antecedents, and on conditions associated with very low birthweight. Despite the growing body of evidence linking sociodemographic variables with preterm delivery, little is known as to how this may be extrapolated to the risk of very low birthweight. METHODS: In 1992, two years after the German unification, we started to recruit two cohorts of very low birthweight infants and controls in East and West Berlin for a long-term neurodevelopmental study. The present analysis was undertaken to compare potential preconceptional risk factors for very low birthweight delivery in a case-control design including 166 mothers (82 East vs. 84 West Berlin) with very low birthweight delivery and 341 control mothers (166 East vs. 175 West). RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of various dichotomous parental covariates and their interaction with living in East or West Berlin. After backward variable selection, short maternal school education, maternal unemployment, single-room apartment, smoking, previous preterm delivery, and fetal loss emerged as significant main effect variables, together with living in West Berlin as positive effect modificator for single-mother status. CONCLUSION: Very low birthweight has been differentially associated with obstetrical history and indicators of maternal socioeconomic status in East and West Berlin. The ranking of these risk factors is under the influence of the political framework."
17682571,"This study was carried out to determine the association between body mass index and age related cataract among patients attending eye clinic. We conducted a case control study. The outcome of clinical eye assessment determined the patient's status. Mean body mass index among the cases was shown to be higher (25.4 +/- 4.5) than the control group (24.4 +/- 3.9) (p < 0.01). Crude analysis showed that only obese respondents were 2.4 times more likely to develop age related cataract, however this association was not seen in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for other determinants (aOR 1.81; 95% CI 0.91 - 3.62). We conclude that there is no association between body mass index and age related cataract."
6886584,"Dietary, social, and constitutional determinants of plasma concentrations of some major risk factors for ischaemic heart disease were investigated in a cross sectional study among 711 men from the general population aged 30-69. For high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) six variables were significantly associated with plasma concentrations, and these variables explained 12.6% of the variance. For low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (T-C), and triglyceride 8.4%, 7.5%, and 18.5% of the variance was explained by significantly associated variables. Fibrinogen concentrations determined chemically were significantly associated with age, smoking habit, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and intake of cereal fibre (24.2% variance). These data provide some encouragement for the possibility of dietary intervention to influence plasma concentrations of major risk factors for ischaemic heart disease in men."
19190572,"As the prevalence of obesity rapidly climbs among youth in the United States, public health practitioners and policymakers seek effective means of slowing and reversing these trends. Recently, many state laws and regulations addressing childhood obesity have been introduced and enacted. Understanding determinants of such legislation may inform the development and passage of future policies. For this study, key-informant interviews were conducted with 16 legislators and staffers from 11 states in 2005-2006 to examine qualitative factors that enable and impede state-level childhood obesity prevention legislation. Commonly cited factors positively influencing the passage of childhood obesity prevention legislation included national media exposure, introduction of the policy by senior legislators, and gaining the support of key players including parents, physicians, and schools. Noteworthy barriers included powerful lobbyists of companies that produce unhealthy foods and misconceptions about legislating foods at schools. Although the total number of informants was modest, their valuable insights provide policymakers and practitioners with a set of enablers and barriers to be considered when pursuing state-level policy."
16580567,"BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) can be one of the major determinants of high blood pressure (BP), but there has been no study on SDB with an emphasis on shift workers. The objective of this study was to examine whether a relationship between SDB and blood pressure/hypertension is more evident among shift workers than among day workers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we measured BP levels and oxygen desaturation index (by nocturnal pulse oximetry) among 253 male shift workers and 206 male day workers aged 30 to 62 years at nuclear power plants in Japan. RESULTS: The prevalence of SDB (3% oxygen desaturation index >or=10 and >or=15 per hour) in all subjects was 11.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 8.4-14.2) and 6.1% (95% CI 3.9-8.3), respectively, with no statistical difference between shift and day workers. Systolic and diastolic BP levels were correlated with 3% oxygen desaturation index in all subjects after adjustment for potential confounding variables. This association was primarily observed among workers aged >or=40 years, more specifically older shift workers. CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between SDB severity and diastolic BP levels among shift workers aged >or=40 years suggests the importance of screening for SDB among shift workers for BP control."
2610569,"The results of a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of caries in a sample of 3,237 children aged 5 to 21 are described in relation to some objectives of the WHO program. The prevalence of caries is high in the sample: 1. 31.5% of the children aged 5 to 6 are free of caries (according to the WHO objectives, 50% of the children aged 5 to 6 should have no caries), 2. the mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMF/T index) in children aged 11 to 12 is 6.6 (The DMF/T should be less than or equal to 3). The frequency of toothbrushing is distributed as follows: 23% of the children brush their teeth once a week or less, 46% brush their teeth once a day, and 31% brush their teeth twice a day or more. The purpose and the frequency of the consultations at the dentist's office have been examined: 15% of the children never consult the dentist, 44% consult the dentist in case of toothache, and 41% go to the dentist's office for screening or control. Only 3.2% of the children use regularly and appropriately fluoride tablets. Since the variance of the results is large, it is difficult to distinguish explaining variables or determinants. However, the data indicate that social groups show differences in DMF indices as well as in the behaviors associated with dental hygiene and prevention."
4048286,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect elective hip and knee arthroplasties had on functional activities of daily living and if the background variables of age, gender, and surgery location can be used to predict functional outcome after these types of surgeries. Data were collected from 43 subjects, 6 to 35 months after they had elective hip or knee arthroplasties. The subjects responded to a mail survey that defined before surgery and after recovery functioning in relation to 22 activities of daily living representing personal care, housework-yard work, and recreation-social activities. Approximately 65% of the subjects reported no change in their ability to perform the 22 surveyed activities. Psychosocial variables appeared to be significant determinants of function. When the selected background data were compared with surgery results, women performed significantly better than men (p less than .05), but age and surgery location were not significant variables affecting outcome."
24302171,"Within our present health care system, there is a growing movement that argues that our perceptions of health and illness are in need of change. This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited."
11271751,"The authors investigate the relative importance of actor and interaction partner as determinants of dyadic behavior. Using the social relations model (D. A. Kenny, 1994a; D. A. Kenny & L. La Voie, 1984), the authors estimate the variance attributable to each determinant plus the reciprocity of behavioral responses from 7 studies. The authors find evidence for moderate behavioral consistency in a person's behavior across interaction partners, little or no evidence that people consistently engender the same behavioral response from others, and preliminary evidence of unique responding to particular partners. They also consider several methodological issues concerning behavioral measurement as well as the implications of the results for the study of accuracy."
18336442,"OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the context of sexual abstinence and identify potential determinants of abstinence in this population. DESIGN: Four focus groups. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Twenty-four, predominantly African American (88%) girls aged 14 to 19 years were recruited from urban health centers and youth development programs in Rochester, New York, between September and December 2006. DATA ANALYSIS: Content analysis was used to analyze the four verbatim transcripts. Using analytic induction, groups were compared and contrasted at the micro (within-group) and macro (between-group) levels to identify themes. RESULTS: Four themes were identified that provided insight into how and why these girls remain abstinent despite being in sexually active social climates. They focused on the following: self-respect (I'm worth it), impact of mothers (Mama says ... think before you let it go), influence of boys and other peers (Boys will be boys), and potential negative consequences of sex (Hold on, there's a catch). CONCLUSIONS: Developing interventions to maintain abstinence, delay onset of sexual activity, and promote protected first and subsequent sexual contact in abstinent girls are key to decreasing future sexual risk. These findings suggest opportunities to develop HIV prevention strategies tailored to the needs of abstinent girls."
6638158,"As part of a longitudinal study of 25 preadolescent kibbutz children who lost their fathers during the October War of 1973, child, family, and circumstantial variables were examined in an effort to assess their relative contribution to the intense emotional disturbance exhibited by half of the group. Findings suggest that pretraumatic family and environmental factors are significant determinants of the duration and severity of bereavement."
3503938,"Data from the Oxford healthy life survey were used to explore social class variations in beliefs about the determinants of health, willingness to contemplate behaviour change and experience of lifestyle advice in primary care.While the association between lifestyle factors and health was well-recognized by all social groups, those in social classes 1 and 2 were more likely than others to stress the importance of smoking, diet and exercise, while those in social classes 4 and 5 were more likely than middle class people to emphasize the effect of socioeconomic influences on health such as unemployment, income, pollution and housing. Members of all social classes attributed considerable importance to psychosocial influences on health. In all social classes a substantial proportion of overweight people expressed a desire to reduce their weight, smokers to modify their smoking habits and sedentary people to increase the amount of exercise they took. However, there was less interest in dietary change or reduction of alcohol consumption. One third of the smokers and of those who were overweight had received advice from health professionals about behaviour modification, but less than 10% of those in the other risk groups reported receiving advice. There was a high demand for advice on health; 44% of all respondents said they would be interested in receiving advice on a healthier lifestyle."
6848900,"Using the Princeton School Family Study cohort, our specific aim was to determine whether, and to what degree, parent-offspring and sibling associations for measures of body habitus outlast the period of shared common household environment in a single well characterized community. Familial associations of measures in body habitus were assessed in two and three generation kindreds, in parents and their pediatric offspring (less than 20-yr-old), parents and their adult offspring (less than or equal to 20-yr-old), and in pediatric and adult siblings. The cohort included 177 randomly recalled probands and 202 probands from a hyperlipidemic recall group (top decile plasma cholesterol and/or triglyceride). In randomly recalled whites, significant associations of body mass indices in parents and pediatric offspring and in pediatric siblings, and the absence of significant correlations in parents and adult offspring and in adult siblings, emphasize the potency of common household environmental effects relative to within-family similarities for shared body habitus. In whites from the hyperlipidemic recall group, only the mother-pediatric and adult offspring correlations for body mass indices were significant. We speculate that mothers and their offspring from kindreds selected by hyperlipidemic probands are more likely than fathers and their offspring to share eating habits and relative ponderosity, with these communal behaviors outlasting the period of common household environment. Alternatively, and speculatively, in the hyperlipidemic recall group, determinants for ponderosity may be shared more by mothers and their offspring than by fathers and their offspring. Particularly in the random recall group, within-family associations of body mass indices primarily reflect shared common household environments, and probably secondarily, the outcome of genes held in common."
7214067,Social and audiometric characteristics of the hearing-impaired elderly without aids have been analysed and some understanding developed of the factors which lead people to seek rehabilitation. The two major single determinants of seeking help were found to be severity of impairment and onset of deafness before reaching retirement age. There were strong indications that negative attitudes of both the elderly themselves and their general practitioners towards deafness and ageing played a crucial part in perpetuating the neglect of the disorder.
2740928,"This study explored the roles of acculturation, urban-rural provenance and length of residence as determinants of the utilization pattern of first line health services by Moroccan, Turkish and Italian migrants in Belgium. Concurrently, utilization characteristics were recorded in Belgian reference patients. With increasing acculturation the demand for preventive care decreased, vague complaints became more prevalent, the delay before consulting for a curative problem shortened and the prognosis improved. There was no correlation between the occurrence of psychological problems and acculturation but, except for 15-44 year old female migrants, the rate of social problems was negatively associated with this study factor. Migrants with an urban background consulted earlier and presented more frequently vague complaints than migrants from rural provenance. We observed no significant influence of length of residence on utilization characteristics and only a marginal influence on morbidity pattern. Although acculturation seems to be a strong determinant of the migrant's utilization pattern of primary health care services, it does not consistently lead to a decrease of utilization differentials with the Belgian reference population. This may imply that there is a need for public health interventions targeted at ethnic minorities."
6701952,"This paper applies the diffusion of innovations model to the study of the birth control discontinuance of first-time users in the Dominican Republic. Two sets of factors are examined: social characteristics of the adopters are used to test Rogers's and Shoemaker's contention that discontinuers have more traditional values than continuers; and the adoption decision process is analyzed to identify the relationship of communication factors to discontinuance. Although number of children and experience of method problems were the major determinants of discontinuance, unfavorable information from friends and other birth control users was a significant factor. Rumor was found to have little effect on a women's decision to continue or discontinue."
2653123,"Recent behavioral genetic research has demonstrated that genetic influence on individual differences in behavioral development is usually significant and often substantial and, paradoxically, also supports the important role of the environment. This article reviews research on the heritability of intellectual factors, personality factors, and psychopathology. It discusses the importance of investigating within-family environmental differences in order to understand the environmental origins of individual differences in development."

11804992,"BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence that emotionally stressful behavior can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis, there is less data to support the notion that affiliative social behavior can slow disease progression. The present study examines the influence of social environment on the progression of atherosclerosis in the Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, a model that spontaneously develops lesions because of a genetic defect in lipoprotein clearance. METHODS AND RESULTS: WHHL rabbits were assigned to 1 of 3 social or behavioral groups: an unstable group, in which unfamiliar rabbits were paired daily, with the pairing switched each week; a stable group, in which littermates were paired daily for the entire study; and an individually caged group. The stable group exhibited more affiliative social behavior and less agonistic behavior than the unstable group and significantly less aortic atherosclerosis than each of the other 2 groups. Although the unstable and individually caged groups had comparable aortic lesion areas, the severity of the disease progressed faster in the unstable group, as indexed by a larger area of calcification and increased fibrous cap thickness in complex lesions. The unstable group showed increased agonistic behavior and signs of chronic adrenocortical and gonadal activation, whereas the individually caged group was relatively sedentary, had low glucocorticoid levels, and was hyperinsulinemic compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that social environment can slow, as well as accelerate, the progression of atherosclerosis. It also emphasizes the importance of behavioral factors in atherogenesis, even in a model of disease with strong genetic determinants."
19041187,"Stress and stress-related health impairments are major problems in human life and elucidating the biological pathways linking stress and disease is of substantial importance. However, the identification of mechanisms underlying a dysregulation of major components of the stress response system is, particularly in humans, a very challenging task. Salivary cortisol responses to diverse acute challenge paradigms show large intra- and interindividual variability. In order to uncover mechanisms mediating stress-related disorders and to potentially develop new therapeutic strategies, an extensive phenotyping of HPA axis stress responses is essential. Such a research agenda depends on substantial knowledge of moderating and intervening variables that affect cortisol responses to different stressors and stimuli. The aim of this report is, therefore, to provide a comprehensive summary of important determinants of, in particular, human salivary cortisol responses to different kinds of laboratory stimuli including acute psychosocial stress as well as pharmacological provocation procedures. This overview demonstrates the role of age and gender, endogenous and exogenous sex steroid levels, pregnancy, lactation and breast-feeding, smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption as well as dietary energy supply in salivary cortisol responses to acute stress. Furthermore, it briefly summarizes current knowledge of the role of genetic factors and methodological issues in terms of habituation to repeated psychosocial stress exposures and time of testing as well as psychological factors, that have been shown to be associated with salivary cortisol responses like early life experiences, social factors, psychological interventions, personality as well as acute subjective-psychological stress responses and finally states of chronic stress and psychopathology."
2487128,"This report assesses current knowledge about the ecological determinants of child maltreatment and presents data from an aggregate study of co-variation between seven community characteristics and maltreatment rates. A review of these findings revealed literature in the early stages of development. Nothing is known about the ecology of sexual abuse, and studies of physical abuse and neglect have done little more than demonstrate co-variation between reported incidence and neighborhood population and housing characteristics. Study findings reveal that (a) five of the seven community characteristics are significant and independent correlates of neglect, and four are correlates of abuse; (b) the strongest predictors of both types of maltreatment are percentage of families with income less than 200% of poverty and percent of vacant housing; and (c) the pattern of co-variation between the two economic stress indicators and three inadequate social support indicators are consistent with the ecological hypothesis. Discussion focuses on interpretation of findings and recommendations for future research."
19451199,"BACKGROUND: Despite a high prevalence of smoking for decades, recent research has documented an increase in the rates of both male and female smoking in post-Soviet Russia. As yet, however, little research has taken place on smoking at the subnational level. The current study addresses this deficit by examining smoking in Moscow -- the city that has been at the forefront of the entry into the Russian market of transnational tobacco corporations (TTCs) in the transition period. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Moscow Health Survey 2004 -- a stratified random sample of 1190 people representative of Moscow's larger population. Information was obtained about subjects' smoking habits and age of smoking initiation. RESULTS: The prevalence of smoking was high among both men (55.5%) and women (26.9%), with significantly higher rates in the younger age groups. There was also a high prevalence of smoking initiation before age 15 years, especially in the youngest women (18-30 years). Logistic regression analysis showed that respondents' age, binge drinking, locus of control and economic situation were important determinants of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Although lifestyle factors seem to underpin the generally high levels of smoking, other things, such as its high prevalence in the younger generations and the factors associated with smoking (locus of control), nevertheless suggest that the TTCs may have played an important role in the spread of smoking in transitional Russia's changing social environment."
16732741,"The aim of this study was to test whether the association between disability and depressive symptoms in patients with cervicogenic headache is similar to that found in primary headaches or to the pattern found in low back pain. During a 2-year period, 716 consecutive patients with the clinical diagnosis of cervicogenic headache (n=182), low back pain (n=116), migraine (n=231), tension-type headache (n=176), and cluster headache (n=11) filled in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Disability was scored by the migraine disability score questionnaire reflecting the number of days with lost or decreased work, household and social activities. Non-parametric tests and multiple general regression were used for statistical analysis. In multivariate testing, significant independent determinants of disability were pain frequency, pain intensity and the severity of depressive symptoms in migraine and tension-type headache; pain frequency and the BDI score in cervicogenic headache, and pain frequency alone in low back pain. Disability is related to pain frequency in all pain syndromes evaluated in the present study. The level of disability is associated with the severity of pain only in primary headaches, but not in pain syndromes of vertebral origin (cervicogenic headache and low back pain). Disability is associated with the severity of depressive symptoms in all headache types but not in low back pain. Both the location and the etiology of pain have importance in determining the interrelationship between pain characteristics, depression and disability."
3434411,"This study is concerned with the effect of age, sex, social class, and quality of family interaction on the future orientation of adolescents aged 10-11, 14-15, and 17-19 years. Seventy-three girls and 75 boys were interviewed about their future hopes and fears. The content and extension of each aim and fear as well as the amount of planning, knowledge, and perceived locus of control involved was estimated from answers. The contents of aims and fears were closely related to the developmental tasks. Nearly half the subjects were afraid of war. The extension of subjects' future orientation decreased, whereas their knowledge about the future increased with age. The subjects from the higher social classes were oriented farther into the future than those from the lower classes. An interpretation emphasizing the importance of the principal developmental tasks on young people's future orientation is discussed."
11965528,"All available polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentration data in ambient air obtained over the past 10 years in Germany were evaluated to clarify whether it is justified to use benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) as a marker compound for the total PAH exposure. The data basis comprises annual mean concentrations from 1990 to 1998 supplied by the emission protection authorities of the federal states with additional information on the region, year and site of measurement. The data are very heterogeneous with respect to sample size, the number of individual PAHs analyzed, place of origin and year. Nine of 25 individual compounds with sufficient sample size (74<N<518) were submitted to an explorative descriptive analysis and multiple regression analysis. Six compounds were selected for factor analysis to evaluate whether associations can be related to one or several background determinants. The concentration data of BaA, BeP, BaP, DBA, BghiP, COR, BbF, BkF and INP are not normally distributed and demonstrate great variability. Location, East-West differences persisting after the German reunion and time characterize the distributive patterns, e.g., from 1991 to 1997, a significant decrease in BaP could be determined based on the data from North Rhine-Westphalia (1991, N=51, median 1.6 ng/m(3); 1997, N=45, median 0.7 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). The BaP concentrations in the new federal states in the East (N=80, median 2.2 ng/m(3)) are about twice as high compared to the ones in the old federal states in the West (N=438, median 1.1 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). BaP measurements taken at sites characterized by traffic (1.8 ng/m(3)), industrial (1.3 ng/m(3)) or urban environment (1.3 ng/m(3)) rank significantly higher compared to measurements taken at rural sites (0.92 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). Factor analysis of the intercorrelation matrix of BaA, BeP, BaP, DBA, BghiP and COR yields one factor to explain 92% of the variability of the six individual PAHs. BaP shows the highest factor loading. These results confirm the common practice to use BaP as marker compound for the PAH exposure in ambient air."
15772506,"Distance education offers many advantages to students, faculty, and educational institutions. Despite these advantages, distance education classes historically have higher dropout rates than do the courses taught in the traditional, face-to-face setting. Current research includes information related to technology, teaching tips, and resources for these extended learning opportunities. However, information related to student success in distance education is limited and success indicators are poorly defined. Current studies on success indicators often lack a defining framework that provides an opportunity for study replication and strengthens the credibility of study findings. An empirical model developed by Powell et al divides potential determinants of success into three categories. This literature review identifies indicators in each category and indicates a need to revise the current framework to include technology as a fourth category. The revised framework should provide a basis for additional research in this rapidly growing area."
15263980,"Data from Brazilian national surveys conducted since the 1970s have indicated an increase in the prevalence of overweight/obesity. The two most frequently cited causes of this trend have been dietary changes and reduction in physical activity, characterizing a ""contemporary Western lifestyle"". The objective of this paper is to identify and assess some indicators associated with changes in eating habits and physical activity patterns in the Brazilian population in the last 30 years. Despite the lack of detailed data, the following factors appear to play an important role in the process: internal migration; dining out; increased consumption of fast food; labor changes; transportation; and the use of home appliances. More information on dietary and physical activity patterns in association with anthropometric data on the Brazilian population are needed for a better understanding of each factor's role in these relationships. Meanwhile, inter-sector programs and projects with well-defined targets and outcomes are needed for the population's adherence to a healthier lifestyle, in order to control the increase in overweight/obesity."
19288983,"INTRODUCTION: Intermittent smokers account for a large proportion of all smokers, and this trend is increasing. Social and communication inequalities may account for disparities in intermittent smoking status. METHODS: Data for this study came from 2,641 ever-smokers from a 2003 nationally representative cross-sectional survey. Independent variables of interest included race/ethnicity, sex, household income, education, health media attention, and cancer-related beliefs. The outcome of interest was smoking status categorized as daily smoker, intermittent smoker, or former smoker. Analyses used 2 sets of multivariable logistic regressions to investigate the associations of covariates with intermittent smokers compared with former smokers and with daily smokers. RESULTS: People with high education and high income, Spanish-speaking Hispanics, and women were the most likely to be intermittent rather than daily smokers. Women and Spanish-speaking Hispanics were the most likely to be intermittent rather than former smokers. Attention to health media sources increased the likelihood that a person would be an intermittent smoker instead of a former or daily smoker. Believing that damage from smoking is avoidable and irreversible was associated with lower odds of being an intermittent smoker rather than a former smoker but did not differentiate intermittent smoking from daily smoking. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that tailoring smoking-cessation campaigns toward intermittent smokers from specific demographic groups by using health media may improve the effect of these campaigns and reduce social health disparities."
19477880,"BACKGROUND: Early family-level and social-level stressors are both assumed to be the components of two main path models explaining the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and its long-term consequences on mental health explored through life-course epidemiological studies. AIMS: To investigate the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and mental health outcomes in adulthood when taking into account early family and social stressors. METHODS: A retrospective French cohort study of 3023 adults representative of the general population in the Paris metropolitan area was conducted in 2005 through at-home, face-to-face interviews. The outcomes measures were current depression and lifetime suicide attempt, intimate partner violence, violence against children and alcohol dependence. RESULTS: The adults exposed to interparental violence during childhood had a higher risk of psychosocial maladjustment. After adjusting for family- and social-level stressors in childhood, this risk was, respectively, 1.44 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.00) for depression, 3.17 (1.75 to 5.73) for conjugal violence, 4.75 (1.60 to 14.14) for child maltreatment and 1.75 (1.19 to 2.57) for alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The adult consequences of parental violence in childhood-and this independently of the other forms of domestic violence and the related psychosocial risks-should lead to intensifying the prevention of and screening for this form of maltreatment of children."
6486090,"Associations between smoking habit, social class, body mass index, and diet were examined in 493 men aged 45 to 59 yr, selected from the general population and who had completed a 7-day weighed dietary record. Smokers were lighter than nonsmokers and had a lower body mass index. There was no difference in energy intake, but in general, smokers had lower intakes of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Exsmokers had similar intakes to nonsmokers. Manual workers tended to be shorter, had a higher body mass index, higher intakes of energy and carbohydrates, and lower intakes of vitamins and minerals than nonmanual workers. Social class had a greater effect than smoking habit on intakes of energy and carbohydrates, whereas smoking habit had the greater effect on intakes of minerals and vitamins. Body mass index was associated negatively with sucrose intake and positively with protein intake, smoking habit, and social class being less important determinants."
15639629,"In the past decade, significant debate has surrounded the relative contributions of genetic determinants versus environmental conditions to certain types of human behavior. While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria. Bacteria exhibit many social activities and they represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level. Therefore, we introduce the term 'sociomicrobiology'."
19191176,"PURPOSE: International and national programs to control vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) among children in developing countries are reducing the magnitude but VADD still occurs in deprived populations. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for xerophthalmia in children aged 6-71 months living in slums in Pune, India in 2003. METHODS: Children were enrolled into a cross sectional study from randomly selected Anganwadis (kindergartens) in selected slums using proportional to size sampling. Parents/caregivers were interviewed by social workers about night blindness, risk factors for VADD at individual and household levels, intake of vitamin A rich foods, and history of vitamin A supplementation. Children were examined for signs of xerophthalmia by an ophthalmologist. Risk factors for xerophthalmia were explored using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: 1,589 children were examined (response rate 80.2%) 22 of whom had xerophthalmia, prevalence 1.32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.88%). There were no gender differences. Independent risk factors for xerophthalmia were having an illiterate mother [Odds ratio [OR]15.4 (95% CI 4.4-64.1)] and lack of a safe water supply [OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.5-5.1)]. Only 11.3 and 13.3% of children in different slums had taken vitamin A supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Xerophthalmia was at a level of public health significance in children living in slums in Pune. This study highlights the importance of female education and indicates that vitamin A supplementation and other approaches to control need to be improved in children living in deprived areas like urban slums."
2595827,"With the object of describing how their own health is experienced, the social circumstances and sexual behaviour in anti-HIV-positive homosexual and bisexual men, an anonymous questionnaire to be completed by the recipient was distributed in 1987 in connection with a placebo controlled investigation to assess the value of isoprinosin (Imunovir) in preventing the development of AIDS. 87% participated. Among the total of 85 participants, 78% considered that their health was good, 29% met family members and 75% friends at least once weekly. Fifty patients (65%) felt stressed in their daily lives which was definitely higher than in the normal population. All of the participants had altered their sexual behaviour in a manner which reduced the risk of HIV-transmission but 18 (21%) had had sexual behaviour known to transmit HIV within the past year. This behaviour occurred more frequently in young persons (p = 0.09) and in smokers (p = 0.03). In addition, no connection could be demonstrated between a series of possible determinants for this, which may, however, be due to the limited extent of the material. It is demonstrated that awareness that one is infected with HIV does not eliminate dangerous sexual behaviour in all cases."
16963673,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible role of low socioeconomic status (SES) as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients requiring treatment. DESIGN: Polysomnographic and demographic characteristics and associated morbidity were measured in 686 prospectively recruited adult OSAS patients from two regions in Israel. SETTING: Two university-affiliated sleep laboratories. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The multiple logistic regression (after adjusting for gender, body mass index [BMI], and smoking) revealed that the following are independent determinants for CVD in OSAS patients requiring treatment: each decrease in income level category (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 1.7), age > or = 1 year (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.1), hypertension (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.1), and hyperlipidemia (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 5.8); area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) = 81.9%. The multivariate determinants describing the low-SES OSAS patients included: minorities and immigrants combined (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 12), female gender (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.9), increased BMI (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.9), unmarried status (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.1), and years of education (> or = 1 year) [OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7 to 0.8]; area under the ROC = 78.1%. CONCLUSION: In addition to the already known traditional risk factors, low SES was found to be a novel independent risk factor for CVD among adult OSAS patients requiring treatment."

Particular attention is paid to the influence of religion, socioeconomic status, and region. The author concludes that ""a theory formulated by Lesthaeghe and Wilson on the relation between modes of production and secularization and the pace of fertility decline in Western Europe offers--in combination with van Heek's views on the special position of Dutch Roman Catholicism--a starting point for an explanation of why the fertility decline of Roman Catholics, self-employed and agricultural labourers lagged behind.""

20198904,"Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression."

Topics considered include sources of information on fertility in the USSR; analysis of fertility and reproductive behavior; the study of selected determinants of fertility, including geographical and ethnic differences, female labor force participation, and the relationships among family planning, health, and reproductive behavior; and means of developing an effective population policy."
17658397,"Psoriasis, a papulosquamous skin disease, was originally thought of as a disorder primarily of epidermal keratinocytes, but is now recognised as one of the commonest immune-mediated disorders. Tumour necrosis factor alpha, dendritic cells, and T-cells all contribute substantially to its pathogenesis. In early-onset psoriasis (beginning before age 40 years), carriage of HLA-Cw6 and environmental triggers, such as beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections, are major determinants of disease expression. Moreover, at least nine chromosomal psoriasis susceptibility loci have been identified. Several clinical phenotypes of psoriasis are recognised, with chronic plaque (psoriasis vulgaris) accounting for 90% of cases. Comorbidities of psoriasis are attracting interest, and include impairment of quality of life and associated depressive illness, cardiovascular disease, and a seronegative arthritis known as psoriatic arthritis. A more complete understanding of underlying pathomechanisms is leading to new treatments, which will be discussed in the second part of this Series."
17580127,"BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to clarify the knowledge and attitudes of Chinese university students regarding living organ donation and analyze the determinants impacting their decisions. METHODS: A questionnaire was delivered to college students chosen by random assignment. The data was analyzed by Statistics Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Of 434 participants, 49.8% indicated they would be willing to be living organ donors, 58.4% believed living organ donation could ease the organ shortage, 48.2% thought that the recovery rate of recipients of living organ donors transplants was equal to or even better than deceased donation, 62.4% designated relatives as their most probable recipients, 48.0% argued that partial compensation was an effective method to increase live organ donation, and 53.7% wished to donate through transplantation centers. According to univariate analysis, attitudes regarding the value of life, relationship between body integrity and health as well as body integrity and conventional culture were factors that impacted on an individual's decision. Students' knowledge of the value of living organ transplantation and their economic background were considered to be determinants of individual willingness. Furthermore, the operation's impact on quality of life and postoperative complications were additional concerns. Multivariate analysis indicated that other factors influencing students' willingness to donate included attitudes toward the relationship between body integrity and health, beliefs regarding body integrity and conventional culture, value of living donor organ transplantation, economic background of students, and anxiety about the impact on postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous students were willing to participate in living organ donation. At the same time, social education and advertisements for living organ donation were far from adequate, having little or no influence on the decision-making process."
20024760,"A life course approach was used to assess household level impacts and inform interventions around HIV risk and AIDS vulnerability across seven major age-related stages of life. Our focus was sub-Saharan Africa. We provided a qualitative review of evidence from published literature, particularly multicountry reviews on impacts of AIDS, on determinants of risk and vulnerability, and reports of large surveys. Areas of potential stress from birth to old age in households affected by AIDS, and interventions for dealing with these specific stresses were identified. While specific interventions for HIV are important at different stages, achieving survival and development outcomes demands a wider set of health, social security and development interventions. One way to determine the priorities amongst these actions is to give weighting to interventions that address factors that have latent impacts later in life, which interrupt accumulating risk, or that change pathways to reduce the risk of both immediate and later stress. This qualitative review suggested that interventions, important for life cycle transitions in generalised epidemics where HIV risk and AIDS vulnerability is high, lie within and outside the health sector, and suggested examples of such interventions."
16872670,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the motivational determinants of the continuation of breast-feeding until 3 months postpartum. METHODS: A prospective cohort study using the Integrated Change Model in 341 women in 5 child health care centers. RESULTS: At birth, 73% of the mothers started with breast-feeding and 39% of them continued at least 3 months postpartum. Mothers who continued for 3 months differed in almost all the motivational determinants from mothers who discontinued. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, social support for formula feeding from significant others and situational self-efficacy for breast-feeding made a significant independent contribution to the continuation of breast-feeding. Among the predisposing determinants, the strongest positive predictor of continuation was the intention to return to work at 1 month postpartum. CONCLUSION: The Integrated Change Model is valid to explain and predict the continuation of breast-feeding. Hence, the results may be used to tailor future interventions aimed at promoting breast-feeding. In the discussion, we use the results to target interventions."
17538057,"Research has shown that married women's greatest risk for HIV infection is their husbands' extramarital sexual activities. Using 6 months of ethnographic research in southeastern Uganda, I examined how the social and economic contexts surrounding men's extramarital sexuality and the dynamics of marriage put men and women at risk for HIV infection. I found that Uganda's HIV prevention messages may be inadvertently contributing to increased difficulty in acknowledging HIV risk and to newer forms of sexual secrecy and that structural determinants, including persistent poverty, intersect with gender inequalities to shape marital risk. After examining a community effort to regulate men's sexuality, I suggest that HIV prevention strategies should focus more on endogenous forms of risk reduction while simultaneously addressing structural factors that facilitate opportunities for men's extramarital sex."
3965566,"Data from two national longitudinal studies of older workers were examined in order to compare the determinants and consequences of retirement for white and black men, and for poverty, marginal, and upper economic level men. The number of categories important in determining retirement was greater for white men than for black men and increased with increase in economic level. Retirement was found to have few consequences, being important mainly with respect to health and economic matters. Blacks and poverty level men were minimally affected by retirement, the impact of retirement probably being somewhat ameliorated by age-determined income maintenance programs and subsidies. Men at the marginal economic level were affected most adversely."
19573229,"BACKGROUND: In the past decade in activities aiming at return-to-work (RTW), there has been a growing awareness to change the focus from sickness and work disability to recovery and work ability. To date, this process in occupational health care (OHC) has mainly been directed towards employees. However, within the working population there are two vulnerable groups: temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, since they have no workplace/employer to return to, when sick-listed. For this group there is a need for tailored RTW strategies and interventions. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the structured and stepwise process of development, implementation and evaluation of a theory- and practise-based participatory RTW program for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). This program is based on the already developed and cost-effective RTW program for employees, sick-listed due to low back pain. METHODS: The Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to develop a tailor-made RTW program for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to MSD. The Attitude-Social influence-self-Efficacy (ASE) model was used as a theoretical framework for determinants of behaviour regarding RTW of the sick-listed worker and development of the intervention. To ensure participation and facilitate successful adoption and implementation, important stakeholders were involved in all steps of program development and implementation. Results of semi-structured interviews and 'fine-tuning' meetings were used to design the final participatory RTW program. RESULTS: A structured stepwise RTW program was developed, aimed at making a consensus-based RTW implementation plan. The new program starts with identifying obstacles for RTW, followed by a brainstorm session in which the sick-listed worker and the labour expert of the Social Security Agency (SSA) formulate solutions/possibilities for suitable (therapeutic) work. This process is guided by an independent RTW coordinator to achieve consensus. Based on the resulting RTW implementation plan, to create an actual RTW perspective, a vocational rehabilitation agency is assigned to find a matching (therapeutic) workplace. The cost-effectiveness of this participatory RTW program will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. CONCLUSION: IM is a promising tool for the development of tailor-made OHC interventions for the vulnerable working population."
12134731,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate in a population-based sample of hypertensive men and women the impact of factors that determine frequency and pattern of antihypertensive treatment. METHODS: We used pooled data of two independent surveys conducted 1989/90 and 1994/95 in the Augsburg region among men and women aged 25 to 74 years. Co-morbidity and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed by questionnaire and examination. Multivariate and polytomous logistic regression analyses were used to assess treatment patterns adjusting for cofactors. RESULTS: Among a total of 9,795 survey participants, 2,279 men and 1,699 women were hypertensive with 30% of men and 43% of women using antihypertensive drugs. Hypercholesterolemia was unrelated and smoking even inversely related to treatment (adjusted odds ratio OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.56-0.92). Women were more likely to be treated than men (adjusted OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.34-1.82). Furthermore, women on monotherapy used diuretics significantly more often than men (adjusted OR relative to betablocker use 2.8, 95% CI: 1.6-4.8). CONCLUSIONS: We identified several determinants of drug treatment among hypertensives in the community. During the study period antihypertensive treatment seemed to be determined primarily by clinical disease but not by concomitant cardiovascular risk factor status, such as male gender, smoking, or hypercholesterolemia."
18018956,"In this paper we present a conceptual model focusing on activity performance and social participation of individuals in the period prior to their first acute episodes of psychosis. The model was developed using the constructivist grounded theory method. Data from interviews and documents was collected from 25 primary participants. Interviews were also conducted with 15 members of the participants' support networks and six experts in the field of early psychosis and rehabilitation. The model illustrates how the core constructs of activity performance and social participation are set against the natural context and influenced by shifts in three determinants: faltering personal capacities, negotiating for success and risk factors. The model suggests rehabilitation and recovery practices in early intervention work."
18592980,"OBJECTS: The aim of this paper was to identify factors affecting the urgency of nursing home placement after introduction of public long-term care insurance. METHODS: The subjects were families including at least one disabled elderly person and one another family member in two cities in Chugoku Prefecture. The measure of the urgency of placement was 0 if the family did not submit any application for placement, 1 if the care managers judged that the elderly person should enter in the future when she/he really needs placement, 2 if the care managers judged that she/he might be able to wait for a short while, and 3 if the care managers judged that she/he should enter as early as possible. Our estimation method was by ordered logit model. The dependent variable was the measure of the urgency and the independent variables were several attributes of the families. In the estimation, we considered the possibility that the coefficients depend on categories of dependent variable. RESULTS: We obtained data for 146 waiting families and 494 others (total 640). There were differences in the urgency of placement among waiting elderly as follows ""she/he should enter as early as possible"" (28.8%); ""she/he can wait for a while"" (32.2%), ""she/he should enter in the future when she/he really needs placement"" (39.0%). The results of multivariate analyses showed that the urgency of placement correlated significantly with the severity of the elderly persons disabilities, the number of primary caregivers' self-symptoms, the family members' negative attitude toward caregiving, residing in city A, not having one's own house and limited use of short-stay facilities due to the circumstances of the providers. CONCLUSION: When judging the urgency of placement, we should consider not only whether the applicant has submitted a request for a nursing home or not, but also differences among the waiting families. The urgency of placement correlates significantly with severity of disability of the elderly person, the number of primary caregivers' self-symptoms, the family members' negative attitude for caregiving, residing in city A, not having one's own house, and limited use of short-stay facilities due to the circumstances of the providers."
3780230,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits, reproductive and medical histories were compared of 328 women who had ever used oral contraceptives and 2306 never users from a case-control surveillance conducted in Northern Italy. Oral contraceptive use was positively and strongly related with the level of education and indicators of social class. The rate ratio of ever use (adjusted for age and diagnostic category) was 3.3 for women with 12 years of education or more compared with less than 7 years, and 3.0 for women of highest compared with lowest social class. The frequency of pill use was lower among never married women, and significantly elevated among smokers (rate ratio = 2.4 for heavy smokers). In contrast, no relation was evident between alcohol or coffee consumption and pill use. Likewise, ever users of oral contraceptives were not significantly different from women who had never used the pill with regard to major reproductive factors (parity and age at first pregnancy) or several medical variables of potential interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), with the only possible exclusion of obesity which was less frequent among pill users. Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of oral contraceptive use in this Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on oral contraceptive and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of oral contraceptive users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits."
3701582,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors."
16151029,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A large proportion of disabled stroke survivors live at home and are supported by informal caregivers. Identification of determinants of caregiver burden will help to target caregiver interventions. METHODS: Data on patient, caregiver, and health and social support characteristics were collected prospectively over 1 year in 232 stroke survivors in a randomized trial of caregiver training. The contribution of these variables to caregiver burden score (CBS) and quality of life (QOL) measures at 3 months and 1 year was analyzed using regression models. RESULTS: Stroke patients had a mean age of 74+/-11 years, and 120 (52%) were men. The mean age of caregivers was 65.7+/-12.5 years, 149 (64%) were females, and 116 (50%) had received caregiver training. The mean CBS was 48+/-13 and 38+/-11 (score range of bad to good 88 to 22) and QOL score was 75+/-16 and 75+/-15 (score range of bad to good 0 to 100) at 3 months and 1 year, respectively. CBS and QOL correlated with each other and with patient (age, dependency, and mood), caregiver (age, gender, mood, and training), and support (social services and family networks) variables. Of these, only patient and caregiver emotional status, caregiver age and gender, and participation in caregiver training were independent predictors of either outcome at 3 months. Patient dependency and family support were additional independent predictors at 1 year. Social services support predicted institutionalization but not caregiver outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Advancing age and anxiety in patients and caregivers, high dependency, and poor family support identify caregivers at risk of adverse outcomes, which may be reduced by caregiver training."
16138493,"The collapse of the Soviet Union was a massive natural experiment that has provided many insights that help our understanding of the determinants of population health. This paper identifies a series of lessons learnt from this experience: (1) Rapid transition can damage health. (2) When undertaking comparative research, it is essential to have a common understanding of what different terms mean in different places. (3) When looking at exposures and outcomes, it is important to appreciate that the delay between exposure to a risk factor and the appearance of disease can range from almost none to several decades. (4) Contrary to the views of some commentators, modern healthcare has made a substantial contribution to the health of populations in industrialised countries. (5) Science can flourish only where it is free from ideology. (6) Public health and basic science achieve most when they work together. (7) Without functioning democracy, the outlook for better health is poor."
18771064,"Using data from a 2005 national survey of working adults in the United States, we examine the effects of the gender composition of the superordinate-subordinate role-set on mental and physical health measures. Subordinates' and superordinates' genders are important determinants. Men who work in gender-mixed superordinate contexts (i.e., with one male and one female superior) report lower levels of distress and physical symptoms than men who work with one male superior. Women who work with one male superior report less distress and fewer physical symptoms compared to women who work with one female superior or in gender-mixed superordinate contexts. With a few exceptions, these observations generally hold net of occupation, job sector, and an array of work-related conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of predictions derived from the similarity-attraction and role congruity theories. We also outline ways that theoretical development in relational demography can be refined by a more specific focus on the demographic characteristics--especially gender--of the superordinate-subordinate role-set."
15242021,"The aim of the study was to assess quality of life (QL) of residents of Polish urban area and analyze the influence of selected sociodemographic and clinical variables on their QL. The study revealed a very high level of reported problems, especially regarding pain and anxiety. The mean subjective assessment of health state was poor in comparison with results obtained in other (usually western) countries. Presence of major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases had an important impact on QL. Elevated blood pressure and unsatisfactory level of physical activity were the strongest factors deteriorating QL in the studied population. There is a need for implementing effective interventions in the society, especially in the area of prevention and management of hypertension and sedentary lifestyle."
12660214,"OBJECTIVES: This article describes Canadian civil servants' awareness of, attitudes toward, and self-reported use of ideas about the determinants of health. METHODS: Federal and provincial civil servants in departments of finance, labor, social services, and health were surveyed. RESULTS: With civil servants in finance departments a notable exception, most Canadian civil servants see the health of populations as a relevant outcome for their sectors. Many (65%) report that ideas about the determinants of health have already influenced policymaking in their sector, but most (83%) say they need more information about the health consequences of the policy alternatives their departments face. CONCLUSIONS: Civil servants should consider developing accountability structures for health and researchers should consider producing and transferring more policy-relevant research."
12973577,"This article presents the relationship between wage labor, housewifery, and health from a gender perspective. The relationship between the two types of work determines the characteristics and meaning of daily life. The methodology combined quantitative and qualitative techniques. An individual questionnaire was applied to 256 male and 121 female workers (n = 377) in a modern pharmaceutical factory in Mexico. In addition, seven in-depth interviews were performed with selected employees. Despite important similarities between female and male wage-earners, there were two key differences: gender segregation in the workplace and the division of household work. The social determinants of this uneven situation result from a complex gender relationship, leading to different disease profiles and health concepts."
7424839,"A stratified sample (race, sex, and social class) of 469 laymen from two North Carolina communities responded to a 190-item MMPI-based questionnaire with the degree of mental illness concern evoked by each item. The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance. Although laymen had roughly similar rank orderings for the 13 homogeneous clusters of items, blacks indicated greater concern over breakdowns in social orientation than whites, while the opposite pattern held for traditionally defined psychopathy (internal distresses). Upper-class concerns were, comparatively, with cognitive dysfunction, middle-class with moral and social responsibility, and lower-class with social inadequacies."
19573222,"BACKGROUND: Identification of subpopulations at high risk of overweight and obesity is crucial for prevention and management of obesity in different socioeconomic status (SES) categories. The objective of the study was to describe disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity across socioeconomic status (SES) groups in 18-74 year-old French adults. METHODS: Analyses were based on a multistage stratified random sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18-74-years-old from the French Nutrition and Health Survey (ENNS), a cross-sectional national survey carried out in 2006/2007. Collected data included measured anthropometry (weight, height and waist circumference (WC)), demographic and SES data (occupation, education and frequency of holiday trips as a marker of family income). SES factors associated with overweight (BMI > or = 25) and central obesity (WC above gender-specific references) were identified using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Almost half (49.3%) of French adults were overweight or obese and 16.9% were obese. In men, the risk of overall overweight or obesity was associated with occupation (p < 0.05), whereas the risk of central obesity was independently associated with occupation (p < 0.05) and frequency of holiday trips (p < 0.01). In women, both overall and central overweight and obesity were independently associated with educational level (respectively p < 10(-3) and p < 10(-3)) and frequency of holiday trips (respectively p < 0.05 and p < 10-3). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was found to be similar to that of several neighbouring western European countries, and lower than the UK and eastern Europe. Risk of being overweight or obese varied across SES groups both in men and women, but associations were different between men and women, indicating differing determinants."
18799005,"BACKGROUND: This article aims to provide an introduction to emerging evidence and debate about the relationship between climate change and mental health. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The authors argue that:i) the direct impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events will have significant mental health implications;ii) climate change is already impacting on the social, economic and environmental determinants of mental health with the most severe consequences being felt by disadvantaged communities and populations; iii) understanding the full extent of the long term social and environmental challenges posed by climate change has the potential to create emotional distress and anxiety; and iv) understanding the psycho-social implications of climate change is also an important starting point for informed action to prevent dangerous climate change at individual, community and societal levels."
17446793,"Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) has changed from a disease of middle-aged men in the late 1970s to a disease of elderly women in the 2000s. Most clinical studies during the past three decades have been conducted with men. Cardiac rehabilitation programmes were also developed with special regard to improving the rate of return to work in middle-aged men. The rehabilitation needs of older patients and women in particular have been largely neglected. The aim of this review is briefly to outline our present knowledge on gender issues in cardiac rehabilitation, and to specify barriers with regard to physical activities especially in (older) women. Coping with a cardiac event, women tend to minimize or play down the impact of their health situation and avoid burdening their social contacts. After a first cardiac event, women report greater psychological distress and lower self-efficacy and self-esteem. In addition, older age, lower exercise levels and reduced functional capacity or co-morbid conditions such as osteoporosis and urinary incontinence are barriers to physical activities in women with IHD. Recent studies on psychosocial intervention revealed less favourable results in women compared with men. These findings have not yet been well explained. This emphasizes our current lack of knowledge about the processes and determinants of successful psychosocial interventions in men and women with IHD. A large (European) trial on gender-specific coping styles, needs, and preferences of older women, and the effects of psychosocial intervention is proposed."
3395040,"The Residency Program in Social Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center is a collaborative, integrated training program for primary care pediatricians, internists, and family physicians within one interdisciplinary organization. Since 1970 we have trained more than 200 physicians, prepared them for board certification in their specialty, emphasized the psychosocial aspects and social determinants of health and illness, and shared a faculty, curriculum, and commitment to provide medical care for inner-city, underserved populations. We discuss the program's history and curriculum, administrative and academic structure, shared ""cross-track"" faculty units (psychosocial; social medicine; and research, education, and evaluation), and graduates' practice outcomes. The interdisciplinary character of the Residency Program in Social Medicine helps physicians successfully serve the underserved and exemplifies that interdisciplinary medical education succeeds when interdisciplinary health care teams are organized for optimal patient care. Only the federal government has the perspective and power to foster more interdisciplinary collaboration and strengthen primary care education in a period of shrinking resources."
6667732,"An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
11297008,"BACKGROUND: With the introduction of the new consensus on 30 minutes of moderate physical activity preferably on all days of the week, exercise implemented into daily activities is promoted whereas structured activity programs lose importance. Activity levels of most older people don't come up with current recommendations. Therefore strategies to enhance attendance of older adults in physical activities should be developed. Group programs may be more effective in changing exercise behaviour of older adults than non-supervised physical activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in level of activity and psychosocial determinants of physical activity between seniors involved in an exercise class and seniors not engaged in any organised physical activity. METHODS: Seventy-five elderly who were currently involved in structured exercise classes and 75 elderly who did not participate in any organised physical activity during the previous year were recruited in senior citizens' centres and were asked to fill out a questionnaire. RESULTS: Subjects involved in an exercise program had higher levels of activity and reported more social influences and higher self-efficacy compared to the respondents practising on an individual basis. No differences were found in perceived barriers or benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Exercising in a group program gives the opportunity to accumulate some extra physical activity and positively affects the level of activity outside the program. Stimulating older adults to join a structured activity program in the company of family or friends in order to enhance supporting social influences and perceived competence could be an important intervention strategy."
16464928,"This article outlines reasons why psychologists should concern themselves with media processes, noting how media are central to contemporary life and heavily implicated in the construction of shared understandings of health. We contend that the present research focus is substantially medicalized, privileging the investigation and framing of certain topics, such as the portrayal of health professionals, medical practices, specific diseases and lifestyle-orientated interventions, and restricting attention to social determinants of health as appropriate topics for investigation. We propose an extended agenda for media health research to include structural health concerns, such as crime, poverty, homelessness and housing and social capital."
12474412,"The economic analysis of efficiency of investment in health care and health at large by means of cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness techniques is the subject of implementation work in a number of countries. Poland's integration with the countries of the European Union justifies the need to understand and to use economic analyses. Unfortunately, these activities encounter many methodological and executive barriers. The investments in workers' health are not only investments in health care and the improvement of working conditions, but also in compensations, including financial ones, resulting from adverse effects of factors influencing the health of working population. The financial reporting system that exists in Poland does not ensure the possibility of full presentation of the aggregated data on the financing of activities for workers' health and diminishing of the adverse effects of factors present in the work environment. The information on the outcome of the investments in workers' health come from different sources, which means that it applies to different groups subjected to the analysis. The problem lies not only in the assessment of profitability of health investments but also in the social problem of the division of the resultant costs and benefits among various branches of the national economy. Therefore, the analyses involving mutual relations between individual sectors that invest in workers' health and those that bear consequences is essential in the terms of economic analyses. The authors present the determinants of economic evaluation in regard to health of working population in Poland."
15595508,"Research on the social determinants of health has increasingly sought to understand the relative importance of different features of socioeconomic status. Much of the ensuing debate has wavered between education and income, with recent research leaning increasingly toward income. This research has not, however, consistently explored interactions between different features of socioeconomic status and, in trying to understand the independent effects of different components of socioeconomic status, may have missed important features of socioeconomic position. With an eye toward examining how features of socioeconomic status combine and coalesce, this paper examines variation in the income-health association by level of education. Theories derived both from medical sociology and health economics suggest synergistic interactions between income and education, but they are unclear as to the direction and magnitude of these interactions. Results from two large and nationally representative data sets (the 1996-1997 Community Tracking Study and the 1972-2000 General Social Survey) indicate that the positive relationship between income and health varies substantially in both its strength and shape by level of education. Education improves health, and its effects are larger at lower levels of income. Moreover, education reduces the strength and curvature of the income-health relationship. Consequently, those with more education have better health for all levels of income, and fewer income-based disparities exist among the well educated than among the less well educated. The linear ""gradient"" relationship between income and health is, thus, more characteristic of groups with higher levels of education. Additional analyses indicate that these interactions existed in the United States in each of the last three decades. The results are discussed in light of theory regarding the perpetuation of health disparities, as well as current debates regarding the apparent incompatibility of distributive versus aggregative goals in health policy."
11264268,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of self-rated health to a measure of physical status, based on a professional rating of the individual's health from a strictly physical point of view. METHODS: A random selection of 407 people over the age of 20 from the north-western catchment area of greater Stockholm were invited in 1995 to a physical examination, including a self-report questionnaire with questions about self-rated health, lifestyle, psychosocial factors and quality of life. A measure of physical health on a 5-point graded scale was constructed using the information from the records of the physical examination as a base. RESULTS: Self-rated health and the professional ratings of health coincided in approximately 60% of the cases. There were a relatively large number of cases where the ratings were contradictory. The correlation between the scales was 0.45. Comparison between the two ratings with respect to association with potential determinants showed that physical factors naturally explained most of the variances in physical health, whereas social and mental well-being and somatic conditions (women) were the most important explanatory variables for self-rated health. Irrespective of whether they had ""favourable"" or ""unfavourable"" health, those with ""poor"" self-rated health also had perceived lower social and mental well-being, less appreciation, more somatic conditions (women) and worse coping abilities (men). CONCLUSIONS: With mental, psychosocial and social problems becoming more pronounced in sickness patterns for primary care patients, self-rated health could be a helpful device, especially when time resources for consultations are short. This measure could also give a more global view of the patient's situation when effectivity and rationality can be a threat to a holistic view of the patient."
4034814,"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration."
18694188,"Since the widespread use of the Internet, few studies have examined health information seeking in France. A web-based survey was conducted to understand how and why French people use the Internet for health information seeking. SES and psychosocial characteristics, health status, illness perception, and characteristics of web-based searches were assessed and studied using the ehealth literacy concept. We do not demonstrate that Internet is used instead of general practitioner or the healthcare system."
10901120,"OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study was to demonstrate the relevance of testing indices concerning the psychosocial work environment by item bias or differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. Especially when the work environment for different groups is compared, this kind of construct validation is important. As exogenous variables gender, age, and occupational group were selected. METHODS: Data were taken from a cross-sectional study of Danish employees aged 19-59 years (N=5940). The study was carried out in 1990 and followed-up in 1995. RESULTS: Item bias was demonstrated in all indices when analyzed in relation to gender, age, and occupational groups of the total population. Item bias was much weaker or disappeared as the population was divided into main occupational groups and analyzed in relation to the same exogenous variables. CONCLUSIONS: For a heterogeneous group of employees, gender, age, and occupational status are significant determinants of the response pattern in relation to indices of the psychosocial work environment. It was concluded that, if the psychosocial work environment for different groups is to be compared, indices should always be tested for item bias in relation to the exogenous variables included in the final analyses. Indices should only be used if there is no item bias. If such indices cannot be constructed, it is suggested that researchers either concentrate on constructing indices that are valid in subgroups or report results based on single-item analyses."
2705972,This paper discusses the basic directions of research carried out in Poland during the years 1981-86 within the Polish Academy of Science project 06.7. The subject matter concerns: individual and situational determinants of human functioning in stress conditions; functioning of a human in extreme conditions; and load imposition through activities requiring risk-taking decisions.
15117117,"The first aim of the present study was to assess the validity of self-reported information concerning previous cancer. The second aim was to investigate determinants for under- and over-reporting of cancer. The Malmo Diet and Cancer Study is a prospective cohort study including 28,098 subjects. A questionnaire assessed lifestyle and medical conditions, e.g. previous cancer (yes/no). Cancer follow-up was made using the Swedish Cancer Registry (SCR). Questionnaire information concerning previous cancer was considered as test, and SCR information as golden standard (any tumour in the SCR, and specific sites were investigated). The validity analysis assessed agreement, sensitivity and specificity. Under- and over-reporting were studied in relation to lifestyle and socio-demographic factors. Sensitivity of the questionnaire in relation to malignant tumours was 0.82. It was 0.53 when cancer in situ of the breast and uterine cervix together with benign lesions of the urinary bladder and the nervous system were included in the cancer definition. Under- and over-reporting (in relation to malignant tumours) were more common among women and old people. Obesity, size of household, place of birth, smoking, social participation, educational level, type of employment, alcohol consumption and poor well-being was associated with under- or over-reporting in relation to at least one of the studied endpoints in either men or women. We conclude that there was a considerable disagreement between self-reported information and cancer registry data."
3232413,"With the aging of populations in developing countries there is both a demographic and an epidemiological transition which affects the impact of chronic degenerative diseases on the health status of the populations. Demographic transition takes place in countries where there are effective programmes of disease control which allow for survival during the early years of childhood and adolescence. This results in an increase in life expectancy which places larger proportions of the population in the age range (60 years and older) in which chronic degenerative diseases become the major determinants of health status. Epidemiological transition in diseases may also be brought about by shifts in social and economic patterns which favour detrimental changes in risk factors for the chronic degenerative diseases. Such changes may include health-related behaviour which augments dietary consumption of fats and alcohol, increases obesity, increases smoking and decreases physical activity. Such changes in risk-factor levels increase the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases which manifest themselves at later ages, and for which early preventive actions could be cost-effective. In order to illustrate the impact of both demographic and risk-factor effects, analyses are made of the impact of increases in life expectancy on cause-specific mortality in both developing and developed countries. It is shown that there is great similarity in the effect of major noncommunicable diseases on the life expectancy of adults in both developed and developing countries. The major differences are seen to be in the proportions of deaths expected from such diseases as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cirrhosis; but not in the distribution of age at death which is the better measure of disease impact. Demographic analyses, computing indirect estimates of mortality, also demonstrate that there are currently more chronic disease deaths in developing than developed countries and that as expectation of life increases in developing countries the global chronic disease burden will be greatly concentrated in the developing countries. Analyses of risk-factor reduction by feasible intervention strategies, e.g. smoking cessation campaigns, treatment of high blood pressure, using relationships between risk factors and diseases established in longitudinal studies carried out in developed countries, point out that the effect of risk-factor control in long-living populations can be hidden by the dependency of risk factors and various related causes of death, e.g. smoking has an impact on lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, but at different ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
2762442,"To isolate and quantify possible determinants of any increased prevalence of depressive disorders in women we studied a select group of men and women, initially similar in terms of a number of putative social determinants of depression, and reviewed the sample five years later when social role diversity was anticipated. We used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) to generate DSM-III and RDC diagnoses to estimate lifetime depressive disorders, and established (via corroborative reports) the likely accuracy of those data. Despite lifetime depression being a relatively common experience, no significant sex differences in depressive episodes were demonstrated, suggesting the possible irrelevance of biological factors in determining any sex difference. As there was not major social role divergence over the five year study, we interpret the lack of a sex difference as a consequence, and suggest that findings support the view that social factors are of key relevance in determining any female preponderance in depression described in general population studies."
19740880,"In sexually dimorphic and polygynous mammals, sexual selection often favours large males with well-developed weaponry, as these secondary sexual characters confer advantages in intrasexual competition and are often preferred by females. Little is known, however, about the effects of sexually selected paternal traits on offspring phenotype in wild mammals, especially when considering that shared phenotypic traits and selection can also differ greatly between genders. Here, we conducted molecular parentage analyses in a long-term study population of mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), an ungulate exhibiting high sexual dimorphism in mass, to first assess the determinants of yearly reproductive success (YRS) in males. We then examined the effects of paternal characteristics on offspring mass at 1 year of age. Paternity was highly skewed, with 9 per cent of 57 males siring 51 per cent of 96 offspring assigned over 12 years. Male YRS increased with age until apparent reproductive senescence at 9 years, but mass was a stronger determinant of siring success than age, horn length or social rank. Mass of sons increased with paternal mass, but the mass of daughters was negatively related to that of their father, a finding consistent with recent theory on intralocus sexual conflict. Because early differences in mass persisted to early adulthood, sex-specific effects of paternal mass can have important fitness consequences, as adult mass is positively linked with reproduction in both sexes. Divergent father-offspring phenotypic correlations may partly explain the maintenance of sexual dimorphism in mountain goats and the large variance observed for this homologous trait within each gender in polygynous mammals."
6849845,"Between 1969 and 1980 1443 patients with vesicovaginal fistulas were operated on in Ahmadu Bello University Hospital in Northern Nigeria. They have been studied in relation to their obstetric, social and environmental background. The preventable nature of the lesion was explored particularly with respect to age, parity and obstructed labour, and to traditional practices including 'gishiri cutting', which alone accounts for 13% of all the fistulas. Vesicovaginal fistulas are still a major cause for concern in many developing countries; measures for prevention include universal education and improved status of women in society as well as improved and accessible medical services."
3392764,"This paper presents part of a longitudinal study carried out in the three towns of Khartoum Province in the period December 1983 to April 1985. It was attempting to determine the duration of satisfactory breast-feeding in healthy breast-fed infants of mothers attending maternal and child health centres in the three towns; Khartoum, Khartoum-North and Omdurman. The main objective of the present paper is to compare samples from the three towns in terms of the factors affecting weight gain. Four hundred and thirty-nine infants were recruited at birth and home visited every 2 weeks. At each visit weight was measured and it was recorded whether any supplements had been given and whether the child had been ill. Length was measured every 4 weeks. There were significant differences between the samples from the three towns in attained weights and weight increments. Weight gains were lowest in the Khartoum North sample in the first 3 months, but from 3 to 6 months were highest, almost equalling the NCHS reference. In the Khartoum and Omdurman samples growth from 0 to 3 months exceeded the reference but from 3 to 6 months was less than the reference. Fifty per cent of infants were supplemented by 13 weeks in the Omdurman sample; the median time of supplementation in the other two samples was 17 weeks. Only in Khartoum did delaying supplementation seem to benefit growth. Infections were most common among the Omdurman sample.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
16195472,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress (PD) and its determinants in under-privileged women in the outskirts of Beirut, Lebanon. A cross-sectional survey of 1,869 ever-married women aged 15-59 was carried out. PD levels were determined using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (Appendix). Health status, living conditions, social support, and physical symptoms as reported by women were recorded. Logistic regression was used to test the independent effect of each variable on PD. 46.6% of women had PD. Psychologically distressed women had more children, less education, lower income, less social support, an uncomfortable relationship with their husband, participated in the labor force and were more likely to reside in a predominantly Moslem community. Reporting a health or living problem were significant predictors of PD. The presence of limb, back and stomach pain, and headache were associated with PD. Compared to similar populations in other countries, our sample had a high prevalence of mental distress."
16449588,"In 1975, New York City experienced a fiscal crisis rooted in long-term political and economic changes in the city. Budget and policy decisions designed to alleviate this fiscal crisis contributed to the subsequent epidemics of tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and homicide in New York City. Because these conditions share underlying social determinants, we consider them a syndemic, i.e., all 3 combined to create an excess disease burden on the population. Cuts in services; the dismantling of health, public safety, and social service infrastructures; and the deterioration of living conditions for vulnerable populations contributed to the amplification of these health conditions over 2 decades. We estimate that the costs incurred in controlling these epidemics exceeded 50 billion US dollars (in 2004 dollars); in contrast, the overall budgetary saving during the fiscal crisis was 10 billion US dollars. This history has implications for public health professionals who must respond to current perceptions of local fiscal crises."
14618606,"The clinical disciplines have witnessed a rapidly growing literature on the conceptualization and measurement of coping and on the role of coping in confronting stressful life circumstances and maintaining adaptive functioning. This literature has spawned a diversity of concepts and contrasting perspectives on the determinants and effects of coping. To address this complexity, we comment on dispositional and contextual perspectives on the coping process, describe the domains of coping styles and coping skills, and review some measures of these constructs. Next, we present a conceptual framework that integrates key aspects of these constructs and use the framework to guide a selective review of the linkages between personal and social resources, coping skills, and adaptive functioning. We then consider applications of the framework to clinical practice."
3232579,"Self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans are examined in relation to sex role orientations of late adolescents. Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys."
17159594,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate, patterns and predictors of HIV disclosure in the French Antilles and French Guiana. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a 15% random sample (n=398) of the hospital caseload in hospitals providing HIV care. Determinants of disclosure to a steady partner and other members of the individual's social network were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: From the time of diagnosis, 84.6% of those in a couple (n=173) disclosed their HIV-positive status to their steady partner, 55.6% disclosed to others, and 30.3% did not tell their status to anyone. Disclosure within a steady partnership was less likely among non-French individuals [Haitians: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.72; other nationalities: AOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.68]; and among those diagnosed with HIV after 1997 (AOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.86). Determinants of disclosure to others were found to be sex (women: AOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.24-3.36), age at diagnosis (>or=50 versus<30 years: AOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90), nationality (Haitians versus French: AOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.77), transmission route (non-sexual versus sexual: AOR 3.38, 95% CI 1.12-10.23) and hospital inpatients (hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients: AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.17-3.37). After disclosing, social and emotional support from confidants was common and discrimination was infrequent. CONCLUSION: One third of PLWHA had kept their HIV status secret. Interventions targeting the general population and social institutions, and support for PLWHA by healthcare staff are needed to improve the situation."
15199000,"While policy makers argue for a greater share of health resources to go to health promotion, action is stalled by, among other things, the perception that little is known about which interventions offer the best health returns. Additionally, what is missing is any sense of what the economic literature in health promotion looks like overall. Where is the economic evidence plentiful and where is it scant? The project described here compiled a census of economic evaluations in health promotion. Studies were classified according to a four-part typology that documented the strategic intent of the intervention, the risk factor being addressed, the population most affected and the setting in which the intervention took place. Since 1990, there have been over 400 economic evaluations of health-promoting interventions in the peer review and grey literatures. Of these, 90% address biological or behavioral determinants of health. Relatively little is known about the economics of population health advocacy or interventions to tackle the social and economic determinants of health. Initiatives are in place to increase the availability of economic evidence. Research is also needed into how to support decision makers' use of imperfect, incomplete and uncertain information."
16390363,"OBJECTIVE: Presentations of selective findings coming from the Zurich Adolescent Psychology and Psychopathology Study with two major aims: i) the study of the prevalence, course, and correlates of mental disorders in adolescence, and ii) the study of the determinants and processes of mental disorders in adolescence. METHOD: A representative sample of n = 1964 children and adolescents was studied in the canton of Zurich in 1994. Additional waves of data collection took place in 1997 and 2000/2001. Mean ages at these three assessments were 13, 16, and 20 years. Each wave contained a two-stage procedure of assessment with screening by questionnaires and consecutive interviewing. The main constructs used were general and specific measures of psychopathology, life events, coping styles, self-related cognitions, and quality of the social network. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of any mental disorder in school-age at the time of assessment was 22.5% fitting into a transcultural range of 18-26% based on DSM-III-R criteria. Furthermore, the derivation and validation of a four-group adolescent drinker typology was demonstrated. Additionally, the prevalence and continuity of functional-somatic symptoms from adolescence to young adulthood was shown. Another piece of the research tested for the identification of risk, compensatory, vulnerability, and protective factors influencing behaviour problems and found remarkably different frequencies across the four types of moderating factors. CONCLUSION: The presented findings provide further understanding of the developmental psychology and psychopathology of adolescence and the service, intervention, and prevention needs of this age-group."
18922241,"INTRODUCTION: Anhedonia is defined as the loss of the capacity to feel pleasure and there is no consensus with its relationship with depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, no study has investigated the problematic of anhedonia in the context of HIV-infection, which concern a lot of patients with depressive symptoms. Depressive symptomatology presents a major challenge in the management of HIV-infection due to its central role in clinical progression. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to disentangle relationship between determinants of anhedonia, depression and anxiety in order to optimise mental management of HIV infection. METHOD: In 2003, a face-to-face survey (ANRS-EN12-VESPA) was conducted among patients selected in a random stratified sample of 102 French hospital departments delivering HIV care. Eligible respondents were HIV-infected outpatients, aged 18 or older living in France and diagnosed for at least six months. Among solicited patients, 2932 agreed to participate (response rate: 59%) and data about anhedonia, anxiety and depression are available for 1427 patients. The face-to-face gathered information on sociodemographic characteristics, such as education level, gender, partner, children, financial situation or housing and also psychosocial and sociobehavioural characteristics, such as drug use. Self-reported side effects of treatment were also available. ASSESSMENT TOOLS: Anxiety and depression were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale. Physical anhedonia was assessed using the French version of the Chapman scale. Three regression models were used to identify factors associated with anhedonia, anxiety and depression among demographic, psychosocial and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Factors independently associated with anhedonia were older age (>50), lower education level, unemployment and men HIV contaminated by heterosexual relation or injecting drug use. Women, with lower education level, unemployment, without steady partner, with a detectable viral load and who reported side effect of HAART presented more frequently anxiety. Unemployment, uncomfortable housing, no social support from friends, self-reported side effect and lipodystrophy were independently associated with depression. CONCLUSION: Our results underline the multiplicity of factors associated with mental disorders related to depression. These results can be explained by the fact that the anxiety and anhedonia are two cardinal symptoms of depression. Determinants of anhedonia and anxiety reported in this study may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in the context of HIV infection in order to optimize long-term psychological follow up of concerned patients."
19589479,"Outcome disparity associated with race or ethnicity in the United States has been observed in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The underlying reasons for such disparity are not known. In the United States, an optimal study of health care disparity by race or ethnicity involves consideration of both biologic and psychosocial determinants, which requires an adequately powered, prospective cohort study design. To better characterize the nature and quantify the magnitude of the many impediments relevant to conducting a successful prospective study involving racial or ethnic minorities in HCT, we conducted a feasibility study to help guide planning of a larger scale outcome and disparity study in HCT. The primary questions to be addressed in the study were: (1) can we establish a racially or ethnically diverse patient sample that will respond to a survey focused on sociodemographic, economic, health insurance, cultural, spiritual, and religious well-being, and social support information? (2) What is the retention rate in the study over time? (3) What is the quality of the data collected from the patients over time? The challenges we faced in conducting this multicenter feasibility study are summarized in this report. Despite the difficulty in conducting disparity studies in racial and ethnic minorities, such studies are essential to ensure that people of all ethnic and racial backgrounds have the best chance possible of benefiting from HCT."
17824939,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study to identify the determinants of physical activity (PA) in patients with venous leg ulcers to develop recommendations for behavioural interventions aimed at enhancing physical activity. BACKGROUND: Physical activity promotes wound healing and prevents the recurrence of wounds in venous patients with leg ulcers. Many patients with leg ulcers, however, have a sedentary lifestyle. METHOD: A random sample of 25 patients from two clinics were interviewed in 2003 using a combination of prestructured and open-ended questions. All these patients were being treated at an outpatient dermatology clinic and had a leg ulcer with venous or mixed aetiology at the time of the interview or in the month prior to the interview. FINDINGS: Only nine of the 25 patients (36%) reported sufficient levels of moderate strenuous physical activity, defined as 30 minutes a day on at least 5 days a week. The results show limited knowledge about the relationship between physical activity and leg ulceration, and low self-efficacy for increasing physical activity. In addition, multi-morbidity, pain and social support were identified as main determinants of physical activity. CONCLUSION: Suggestions for improving physical activity levels include influencing knowledge, beliefs and self-efficacy. Patient's individual physical limitations, pain, adequate footwear and social support should be taken into account. Programmes offered by specialized dermatology nurses to stimulate physical activity might fulfil patient needs and help enhance physical activity levels."
3354493,"In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking."
2784327,"A survey of all registered deaths which occurred during 1981-1983 in women of reproductive age was carried out in Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause."
17488897,"We used geographic information systems and a spatial analysis approach to explore the pattern of Ross River virus (RRV) incidence in Brisbane, Australia. Climate, vegetation and socioeconomic data in 2001 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Brisbane City Council and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Information on the RRV cases was obtained from the Queensland Department of Health. Spatial and multiple negative binomial regression models were used to identify the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of RRV transmission. The results show that RRV activity was primarily concentrated in the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern regions in Brisbane. Multiple negative binomial regression models showed that the spatial pattern of RRV disease in Brisbane seemed to be determined by a combination of local ecologic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors."

17279404,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the different practice profiles of general practitioners (GPs) in order to test the hypothesis of heterogeneity in physician behaviour. DATA: For the year 2000, 4,660 GPs from two regions in France. VARIABLES: volume and structure of the physicians' medical activity, income level, personal characteristics, socioeconomic and geographical environment, characteristics of their patients. METHODS: A cluster analysis to identify different practice profiles and a regression analysis to display the determinants of the physicians' activity. RESULTS: Four different homogeneous groups can be identified, each one associating a physician's level of activity to his socioeconomic status. The level and the intensity of medical activity depend on individual factors, patients' characteristics as well as the socioeconomic context. CONCLUSIONS: There is no uniformity in the way GPs practice medicine. An immediate consequence is that any cost-containment measure that is applied uniformly to all GPs inevitably results in different outcomes according to the physicians' category type."
15770290,"In health care today, scientific and technological frontiers are expanding at unprecedented rates, even as economic and financial pressures shrink profit margins, intensify competition, and constrain the funds available for investment. Therefore, the world today has more economic, and social opportunities for people than 10 or 100 years since globalization has created a new ground somewhat characterized by rapid economic transformation, deregulation of national markets by new trade regimes, amazing transport, electronic communication possibilities and high turnover of foreign investment and capital flow as well as skilled labor. These trends can easily mask great inequalities in developing countries such as importation and spreading of infectious and non-communicable diseases; miniaturization of movement of medical technology; health sector trades management driven by economics without consideration to the social and health aspects and its effects, increasing health inequalities and their economic and social burden creation; multinational companies' cheap labor employment promotion in widening income differentials; and others. As a matter of fact, all these factors are major determinants of ill health. Health authorities of developing countries have to strengthen their regulatory framework in order to ensure that national health systems derive maximum benefit in terms of equity, quality and efficiency, while reducing potential social cost to a minimum generated risky side of globalization."
6684973,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts."
6736597,"This article analyzes and criticizes the "" technocratic "" view of occupational health and safety policies, which sees the values of the personnel in ""post-industrial"" regulatory agencies as the most important determinant of those policies. It takes an alternate position, which explains occupational health and safety policies as primarily resulting from the different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor), and from the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It shows how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies explains Swedish occupational health and safety policies better than a mere analysis of the regulators' views. And it concludes that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to those in the U.S.--as the "" technocratic "" theorists assume--but rather offer more protection to the workers than U.S. policies do. This situation is a result of labor having more power in Sweden than it has in the U.S. The different class formations and class behavior in the two societies are compared, and the implications of this comparison for occupational health and safety policies are discussed."
3182366,"A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers."
4047963,"In 1982 Costa Rica had an infant mortality of 18 per 1000 live births and a life expectancy at birth of 76 years for women and 72 years for men. In the evolution of infant health in Costa Rica two paradigms were identified. One developed in the decades before 1970 and the other during the 1970s. The necessity of conceptualizing a third new paradigm compatible with health needs of the present and the immediate future is recognized. The first or ""malnutrition paradigm"" was orthodox in its derivation; it identified the lack of food as the underlying base for the major health problems and placed its emphasis on institutional medicine. The paradigm was influenced by foreign schools of nutrition and pediatrics and led to the development of an infrastructure for the delivery of medical services and the programs for food distribution. The ""infectious disease paradigm"" recognized infectious diseases as the main determinants of morbidity, mortality and malnutrition in childhood. The strategies derived from such a revolutionary paradigm aimed at the control and eradication of infectious diseases, and they resulted in a rapid improvement of child nutrition and health. However, the infectious disease paradigm does not seem to reduce infant mortality below the present level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
19069053,"Student level data on participation in classroom discourse and student effort on assignments in 117 middle school English classrooms are used to investigate the social determinants of student engagement in classroom instruction. Social identity theories of race, social class, and attachment to school, and research in the social psychology of achievement motivation both suggest differential levels of student engagement among diverse student groups. Using multilevel models, the author investigates the relationship between classroom context and students' levels of engagement. Levels of engagement among black and low SES students are mostly insensitive to classroom context, suggesting there is little collective action directed at fostering anti-school norms among these student groups. However, consistent with research in the social psychology of achievement motivation, students who begin class with weaker reading and writing skills are less likely to be engaged, setting the stage for a cycle of reduced achievement growth."

In addition, emigration of single persons after 1850 was inversely related to nuptiality."" (SUMMARY IN FRE)"
18562877,"OBJECTIVE: To examine determinants of quality of care provided by pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) in tertiary European centers. METHODS: Analysis of questionnaires was sent to directors of PEDs. Questionnaires were sent through the pediatric research group of the European Society for Emergency Medicine. Three major descriptive categories were included in a 28-point questionnaire: institution's pediatric inpatient capabilities, scope of services, and medical staff education and structure. RESULTS: Sixty-five questionnaires were completed in full. Fifty-three tertiary medical centers from 14 countries were included in the study. In 86.8% of these institutions, the PED is separated from the adult emergency department; 91% have a pediatric intensive care unit, and 72% have an in-patient pediatric trauma service. Eighty-eight percent of the PEDs have incorporated triage protocols. Social service was not available in 17% of the departments. Sedation for painful procedures is provided by the staff in 77% of the PEDs. Only 24% of the PED medical directors have been formally trained in pediatric emergency medicine. In 17% of the departments, there is a 24-hour 7-day residents' coverage with no attending pediatrician or pediatric emergency medicine-trained physician. CONCLUSIONS: According to this pilot study, the basic services provided by tertiary PEDs in Europe appear to be appropriate. Physicians training level and staffing may not be adequate to achieve optimal patient outcome."
18372875,"Health promotion first entered the South African health system in 1990. Today, Health Promotion is a Directorate located within the Social Sector Cluster (SSC) within Primary Health Care (PHC), District and Development operations which falls under the Deputy Director General for Health Service Delivery in the National Department of Health (DoH). The first significant piece of new policy for health promotion in South Africa appeared in the African National Congress (ANC) health policy document, health care services including reproductive health care. At the moment, health promotion service delivery is the responsibility of the national, provincial and local governments with provincial and local governments mainly implementing and the National Health Promotion Directorate offering support. Funding for health promotion activities comes from the Department of Health budget allocation by the National Treasury. One major problem for Health Promotion development is infrastructure. There is significant community participation in South Africa including health promotion policy and strategy document development. Health Promotion research and evaluation is limited. The National Department of Health considers the settings approach to be crucial in driving the progress of health promotion. There are very few trained health promotion specialists either capable or in the position to inform politicians and opinion leaders about the relationship between health and social determinants, and the evidence of effectiveness of health promotion action. Mechanisms for demonstrating evidence of health promotion effectiveness in terms of health, social, economic and political impact are lacking and occupational standards for health promotion education and training are needed."
6684973,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts."
3130744,"In a longitudinal pilot study on the course of the PCB concentration in human milk during six months of lactation, some important PCB determinants could be studied in 23 women and their infants. PCB values were within the range of those found in the literature. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the association of the mean PCB concentration over the first half year of lactation with maternal parameters, such as age, height, weight, previous lactation period, education, occupation, residence, smoking, drinking and dietary habits as well as the infant parameters gestational age, birthweight and weight gain in the first six months of life. Since the PCB concentration on fat basis and the fat content of the milk were strongly inversely related, statistical analyses were carried out both on fat and on milk basis. In univariate analyses the PCB concentration on fat basis was most strongly associated with pre- versus post-pregnancy weight gain, age and occupation. After multiple regression analysis PCB concentration on fat basis remained significantly associated with weight gain changes and remained borderline (p less than 0.10) significantly related with occupation. The pre-pregnancy Quetelet Index of the mother (height/weight) and the estimated PCB content of the diet (primarily fish) were strongly correlated with the PCB concentration on milk basis. Only the Quetelet Index remained significantly related after multiple regression analysis."
2723595,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."

7057173,"This descriptive study employed semistructured interviewing and questionnaire administration to delineate the sociocultural determinants of the help-seeking process in 48 psychiatric patients. The help-seeking process is considered in two stages. The first stage starts from the recognition of initial symptoms and ends in the first contact with a mental health professional. The second stage is defined as that time between the first contact and actual participation in a planned treatment program. In both stages, patients typically go through phases of lay consultation, nonpsychiatric professional consultation, and referral. The multiple steps which are usually involved in help seeking often result in significant delay of both mental health contact and treatment. The help-seeking process was found to correlate strongly with ethnicity. Both Asians and Blacks showed more extended family involvement, and the involvement of key family members tended to be persistent and intensive in Asians. Ethnicity was also associated with the length of delay, with Asians showing the longest delay and Caucasians the least. These ethnic differences were also reflected in help-seeking pathway assignment using Lin's criteria. Although modernity and parochialism, as measured by the level of modernization and the cohesiveness of the social network system of the subjects, were also found to be correlated with delay, they appeared to exert an influence independent from that of ethnicity."

The first section will discuss: (1) the concept of culture, (2) hierarchical levels of human behavior determinants, (3) the cultural variability continuum, and (4) the concept of self. The second section will discuss: (1) epidemiology, (2) culture and clinical phenomenology in severe disorders, and (3) culture as an etiological determinant. The paper closes with a discussion of some conclusions and suggestions for future research."
2637716,"This article is published as a tribute to Professor Thomas McKeown, the eminent epidemiologist, who died in 1988 aged 75. In it the author urges that the spread of services comprising primary health care be arranged in strict order of priority. Since improvements in nutrition have a particularly profound effect on health they should be the primary aim of developing countries."
16996670,"This study investigates the geography of racial disparities in low birthweight in New York City by focusing on racial residential segregation and its effect on the risk of low birthweight among African-American infants and mothers. This cross-sectional multilevel analysis uses birth records at the individual level (n=96,882) and racial isolation indices at the census tract or neighborhood level (n=2095) to measure their independent and cross-level effects on low birthweight. This study found that residential segregation and neighborhood poverty operate at different scales to increase the risk of low birthweight. At the neighborhood scale residential segregation is positively and significantly associated with low birthweight, after controlling for individual-level risk factors and neighborhood poverty. Residential segregation explains neighborhood variation in low birthweight means and race effects across census tracts, which cannot be accounted for by neighborhood poverty alone. At the individual scale-increasing levels of residential segregation does not significantly reduce or exacerbate individual-level risk factors for low birthweight; whereas increasing levels of neighborhood poverty significantly eliminates the race effect and reduces the protective effect of being foreign-born on low birthweight, after controlling for other individual-level risk factors and residential segregation. These findings are contradictory to previous health research that shows protective mechanisms associated with ethnic density in local areas. It is likely that structural factors underlying residential segregation, i.e., racial isolation, impose additional stressors on African-American women that may offset or disguise positive attributes associated with ethnic density. However, as poverty is concentrated within these neighborhoods, differences between races in low birthweight cease to exist. This study demonstrates that residential segregation and neighborhood poverty are important determinants of racial disparity in low birthweight in New York City."
12342575,"Many studies have shown that schooling levels of husband and wife are important determinants of household behavior in developing countries. This article asks how the schooling levels of husband and wife come to be associated with each other through the marriage market. The Kiefer-Neumann model of labor market search is adapted to marital search, the aim being to explain both the positive sorting on educational levels for spouses, and the positive relationship between female schooling and age at 1st marriage. World Fertility Survey data for Indonesia, Korea, and Malaysia are employed in the analyses."
19655628,"Global warming, the depletion of the world'snatural resources, and excessive consumer consumption in developed countries are determinants reshaping the way we live our everyday lives. These factors are rapidly giving rise to new ecological paradigms of environmental stewardship and in healthcare environments that express sustainable theories and practices. This has given rise to a systematic system for promoting and assessing the energy performance and efficiency of healthcare facilities known as Leadership in Energy Efficient Environmental Design (LEED), and a parallel certification program, the Green Guide for Heath Care. These developments are examined in direct relation to the functions of managerial ethics. A series of ten sustainability-based ethical dilemmas are presented. Each is examined in relation to the need to inculcate in future healthcare administrators a critical understanding and appreciation of the need to reposition contemporary healthcare organizations at the center--as leading civic participants and role models in relation to the emerging movement towards carbon neutrality in the healthcare industry."
6701728,"This article, which is based on data from the Social Security Administration's 1978 Survey of Survivor Families With Children, examines the continuity of health care coverage held by families headed by widows from the time of the husband's death to the interview. The data are presented by duration of widowhood and kind of coverage the family had before the husband died. Over this period, it was found that new kinds of coverage, such as the widow's job-related health insurance or directly purchased protection, often replaced the former coverage. At the time of the interview, about three-fourths of the families had coverage, including government assistance such as Medicaid. Whether or not the young survivor families had coverage was affected by the widow's current employment status and by family income. Premiums varied by type of policy: those with individual policies paid more (and received less extensive coverage) than did those with group policies. Compared with the general population, the widows and their children were in poorer health, generally used physician services less, and had somewhat higher expenditures for health care."
19635735,"Few prospective studies of smoking initiation have investigated a wide range of time-varying and invariant predictor variables at the individual and contextual levels concurrently. In this study (1999-2005), 877 Canadian students (mean age = 12.7 years) who had never smoked at baseline completed self-report questionnaires on cigarette smoking and 32 predictor variables in 20 survey cycles during secondary school. Height and weight were measured in survey cycles 1, 12, and 19. School administrators completed questionnaires on school tobacco control policies/activities, and trained observers collected data on access to tobacco products in commercial establishments near schools. Younger age, single-parent family status, smoking by parents, siblings, friends, and school staff, stress, impulsivity, lower self-esteem, feeling a need to smoke, not doing well at school, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, alcohol use, use of other tobacco products, and attending a smoking-tolerant school were independent determinants of smoking initiation. Independent determinants of daily smoking onset among initiators of nondaily smoking included smoking by siblings and friends, feeling a need to smoke, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, use of other tobacco products, and self-perceived mental and physical addiction. Adolescent tobacco control programs should address multiple individual and contextual-level risk factors. Strategies that address nicotine dependence symptoms are also needed for adolescents who have already initiated smoking."
19967219,"This study analyzes meanings that health workers attribute to DOTS and points out alternatives that contribute to its performance. After the Research Ethics Committee approved the project, a semi-structured interview was applied to 15 health workers from the central region of the city of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil between August and December 2004. This study used hermeneutic-dialectic reference and the theory of social determinants of the health-disease process. DOTS contributes to treatment adherence and promotes interfacing in encounters and conversations between workers and users at the institutional and territorial levels, which permits identifying health needs and implementing appropriate interventions. One of the main challenges to its implementation is to become a space that enables grasping, decoding and reconstructing meanings in relation to the health-disease process including the treatment and life projects of patients with tuberculosis."
15098428,"Despite significant debate about the efficacy, ideology, and ethics of the method, condom social marketing (CSM) has become the dominant approach to AIDS education in many sub-Saharan African countries. However, critics have charged that social marketing (SM) distracts from the structural determinants of health-related behavior and excludes genuine community participation. This article argues that the diffusion of SM techniques in Africa is not driven by demonstrated efficacy but is attributable to the promotion of privatization and free markets in the structural adjustment era across the region. The CSM experience in a central Mozambican community reveals the dangers of using the method at the expense of community dialogue and participation to confront the AIDS epidemic. The advertising campaign developed to sell condoms has clashed with Pentecostal and Independent Churches, now a majority of the population, that have expanded rapidly across the region spreading a contrasting message about sexuality and risky behavior."
6802782,"Health care systems throughout the world are being scrutinized because of their growing cost in relations to national wealth. At the same time, techniques for evaluating health care with respect to appropriateness, quality and resource allocation are being developed. These techniques are multifactorial since they must relate to all aspects of health care including: characteristics of the population being served; available health care resources; measures of the process and utilization of care; measures of health care outcomes; peer review, including quality assessment of health care providers; consumer attitudes, knowledge, and compliance; care provided for ""tracer"" or sample conditions; and economic cost-benefit studies. Evaluation in health care assumes that a health care system and the providers of health care within that system are responsible and accountable for the health status of the population. It must, however, recognize that health services are not the sole determinants of health status; social, economic and cultural factors also play key roles. A comprehensive approach to evaluation in health care is outlined in this review. Many of the components that are available in the Israeli health care system are described; others that remain to be developed are discussed. Evaluation is an integral part of a comprehensive health care system; the components of evaluation must be built into any national system. As long as rationality is expected of health care, evaluation is an essential element of the overall system."
2710760,"The purpose of this study was to explore the associations between several social learning theory variables and self-reported vigorous exercise and to consider the implications for exercise promotion. A random sample of adults in San Diego, California, was surveyed by mail. The 2,053 respondents (response rate, 43.4%) overrepresented Caucasian, affluent, and well-educated groups. A model of 24 variables accounted for 0.27 of the variance in exercise, and results strongly supported social learning theory. The strongest correlates were self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in the ability to exercise in specific situations), perceived barriers to exercise, modeling, dietary habits, support from friends, and age. Smoking was inversely associated with exercise in men only. We encourage researchers to conduct intervention trials to test the hypotheses generated in this study."
11071843,"BACKGROUND: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine: (a) the effect of two physical activity modes on changes in subjective well-being (SWB) over the course of a 12-month period in older, formerly sedentary adults (N = 174, M age = 65.5 years) and (b) the role played by physical activity participation and social support in changes in SWB over time. METHOD: Participants were randomized into either an aerobic activity group or a stretching and toning group. Structural equation modeling was employed to conduct multiple sample latent growth curve analyses of individual growth in measures of SWB (happiness, satisfaction with life, and loneliness) over time. RESULTS: A curvilinear growth pattern was revealed with well-being significantly improving over the course of the intervention followed by significant declines at the 6-month follow-up. Subsequent structural analyses were conducted showing that frequency of exercise participation was a significant predictor of improvement in satisfaction with life, whereas social relations were related to increases in satisfaction with life and reductions in loneliness. Improvements in social relations and exercise frequency also helped to buffer the declines in satisfaction with life at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that social relations integral to the exercise environment are significant determinants of subjective well-being in older adults. Findings are discussed in terms of how physical activity environments might be structured to maximize improvements in more global well-being constructs such as satisfaction with life."
10790939,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which socio-demographic factors, health-related behaviours and physical health conditions are associated with non-drinking, binge drinking and hazardous/harmful drinking in young Australian women. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the baseline survey of 14,762 young women (aged 18-23 years) enrolled in the Women's Health Australia study in 1996. Associations between a range of drinking patterns and socio-demographic factors, health-related behaviours and health conditions were examined. RESULTS: Half the women were 'low intake' drinkers, a third 'rarely drank' and 9% were non-drinkers; however, 70% reported binge drinking with one-quarter of the binge drinkers doing so at least weekly. Non-drinkers were more likely than drinkers to be married, pregnant, non-smokers, born in non-English speaking countries, to live in the Northern Territory, and to have lower levels of education, employment, and private health insurance. 'Low intake/binge weekly' drinkers (12%) and 'hazardous/harmful' drinkers (5%) were more likely than 'low risk' drinkers to be unmarried; to live in shared accommodation, alone or with their parents; to live in rural or remote areas; to have ever had any sexually transmitted infection; to be current smokers or ex-smokers and to have used unhealthy weight-control practices. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm findings from other countries about the importance of social conditions as determinants of alcohol consumption by young women. IMPLICATIONS: Health promotion to reduce young women's alcohol consumption needs to be carefully targeted to take account of their demographies, living environments and beliefs."
6875802,"An experiment was conducted to test the proposition that alcohol is consumed as a function of the quality of past performances and the individual's level of private self-consciousness. One hundred and twenty male subjects were randomly given success or failure feedback on an intellectual task. They then participated in a separate ""wine-tasting"" experiment in which they were allowed to regulate alcohol consumption. As predicted, high self-conscious subjects who had received failure feedback drank significantly more wine than did high self-conscious subjects who received success feedback. Consumption by low self-conscious subjects fell between these extremes and did not vary as a function of success and failure. Additional data indicated that these results were mediated by differential sensitivity to the positive or negative implications of success/failure by high and low self-conscious subjects. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for theoretical accounts of the psychological antecedents of alcohol consumption."
17176242,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Food insecurity, now listed among the social determinants of health, compromises the health and well-being of affected Australians. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of food insecurity within an urban population of social disadvantage in readiness for a local health promotion response. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in three disadvantaged locations of south-western Sydney. Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using both the 16-item US Household Food Security Survey Module and the single-item question previously used in national Australian health surveys. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between food insecurity and socio-demographic characteristics of the households. RESULTS: The 16-item US tool yielded a significantly higher food insecurity prevalence (21.9%, 95% CI 20.0-23.8) than the single-item Australian tool (15.8%, 95% CI 14.1-17.5). Compared with the former, the single-item Australian tool has high specificity (96%) yet low sensitivity (56.9%). In our three sites, food insecurity was strongly and independently associated with household capacity to save money (AOR=5.05). Local fruit and vegetable production (83.8%), nutrition education (83.9%), transport to food outlets (81.5%) and better public transport overall (76.3%) were most highly rated by 'food insecure' households as useful future strategies. CONCLUSION: The higher sensitivity of the US 16-item food security survey module relative to the single-item Australian tool indicates its potential for use in future Australian surveys of food insecurity."
16162117,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life is a popular measure of outcomes and its widespread use has led to recent calls for a better understanding of the construct, emphasizing the need to build a substantial body of knowledge around what determines perceptions of life quality. Three widely reported and used conceptual principles are examined in this study. METHODS: Self-ratings of life quality and three likely determinants at an individual level (stress), an interactional level (social support) and a community level (neighbourhood belonging) were used. The study involved two groups of young adults from an urban community, one identified as having an intellectual disability (ID). RESULTS Young adults with ID rated their satisfaction with health significantly higher and intimacy and community involvement lower than the comparison group. Social support emerged as the strongest predictor of life satisfaction across both groups. CONCLUSION: The conceptual principles of subjective quality of life provide a useful framework to discuss findings and to stimulate further research."
2709190,"A longitudinal study of rural-urban migration from a low blood pressure community was completed in 1985. It is suggested that the rapid increase in blood pressure observed with acculturation in this study constitutes a new dynamic model for the early phase of human essential hypertension. Analysis of data derived from this study indicates that increases in dietary sodium, weight gain and sympathetic tone (possibly reflecting acute environmental stress) are important determinants of the early blood pressure rise. It is proposed that a defence reaction occurs in response to environmental stress which maintains or increases cardiorenal sympathetic outflow, thereby overriding the negative feedback inhibition of sympathetic activity which otherwise occurs when dietary sodium is suddenly increased. The antinatriuretic response results in an early volume-dependent rise in blood pressure. We also propose that variation in individual blood pressure responses to migration may be explained not only by quantum differences in the two environmental factors, but also by a genetically-determined failure of adaptation to the combined effects of these stimuli on renal tubular reabsorption of sodium."
19344503,"BACKGROUND: Few research projects have analyzed how social determinants of health impact cities in North Africa. The sustained growth in these countries has nevertheless proven to exacerbate health disparities and create many social and economic inequalities. This strategic analysis examines selected social determinants of health in a major urban centre of Tunisia, identifies the most influential stakeholders able to influence equity/inequity, and reviews the accomplishments and need for action to foster health equity. METHODS: This analysis was performed through a literature review and participatory research methods that included focus groups discussions and interview with key informants. RESULTS: Access to health care, changes in lifestyles, housing issues and gender-related inequities are prime, socially-determined elements that affect health in Ariana. CONCLUSION: Recognition of emerging health issues is needed along with improved inter and intrasectoral coordination among stakeholders. The community-participatory approach used in this paper proved to be a useful scoping technique for this setting. A similar methodology could be used by other researchers as a first step toward health equity action at a city level."
6738684,"Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance."
3120234,"This study was undertaken to determine the reliability of self-reported sexual behavior using the test and retest technique when used with self-reported sexual behavior. The subjects were 116 asymptomatic homosexual men who participated in another study (an examination of behavioral and demographic determinants of HIV antibody status). The subjects were asked to complete two questionnaires. The first contained demographic and sexual behavior questions. The second, administered an average of 6 weeks later, used a subset of the questions in the first questionnaire. The reliability of the test-retest procedure was measured by the Kappa statistic, which assesses the proportion of agreement between two data items, accounting for the amount of agreement expected by chance. The highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa was found with demographic information, smoking history, and sexual orientation. Self-reported sexual behaviors for the previous 6 months generally had the next highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa. Questions examining change over the previous 5 years had the lowest reliability. Behavior changes during the time between questionnaires, subjectivity of the answer categories, and social desirability of the answers are three factors that may result in a lack of reliability in this self-reported sexual behavior questionnaire. This raises methodological concerns about the measurement of behavioral risk factors for AIDS and the ability to assess meaningfully subjective reports of behavioral change."
6518143,"This paper investigates the range, structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of alcoholism. The different explicit medical and psychological theories are reviewed as are studies on lay beliefs about alcoholism and heavy drinking. After a number of interviews in which people were asked to list what they believed to be the major causes of alcoholism, 265 people completed a questionnaire in which they rated 30 explanations for their importance in explaining the causes of alcoholism. Females more than males believed alcoholics to be socially inadequate and anxious and that there was too much social pressure and not enough prohibitions against drinking. Middle-aged rather than younger or older people tended to explain alcoholism in terms of poor education, social and cultural pressures and biological or genetic mechanisms. However, there were few differences in the ratings of heavy, moderate, light and non-drinkers. Factor analysis revealed six factors labelled psychological stress, personal and social problems, psychoanalytic theories, sociocultural explanations, biological or genetic explanations and social desirability or pressure. The results are discussed in terms of the research on lay understandings of psychological and medical phenomena, and the relationship between explicit and implicit theories."
12279766,"""The past decade has witnessed a substantial contraction in the size of the Irishborn community in Britain. This paper uses shift share analysis to assess the extent to which job losses amongst the Irish in Britain over the years 1971-1977 may have induced return migration to Ireland.

28564235,"One component of sexual selection is sperm competition. It has been reasoned that the intensity of sperm competition may be reflected in the relative testicular sizes of animals. Among males residing in multimale breeding systems, testicular size is relatively larger than among males residing in unimale mating systems. Information on whether differences in testicular size within a species can account for differences in male reproductive success is unavailable for natural populations of primates. A population of six troops of savanna baboons in Kenya was surveyed for morphometric analysis, and one of these troops was the subject of extensive behavioral observations afterwards. Testicular weights could not be obtained, but measurements of linear dimensions were transformed into volumetric estimates. Male weight accounted for 30% of the variance in testicular volume. Neither body size nor testicular volume was associated with differences in male reproductive activity. The outcome of fights over access to females could not be related to male body size, and ejaculatory patterns of males were independent of testicle size. Both sperm competition and aggressive competition intensified during the four-day optimum conception period, but fights over access to consort females were infrequent. Among savanna baboons, the probability of an ejaculation resulting in a conception is fairly low, which may account for the infrequency of injurious fights. Although testicle size influences sperm production, it does not influence either the timing of mating or the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa, and both of these factors probably account for a substantial fraction of the variance in male baboon paternity. Sperm competition is an adjunct to agonistic competition as a mechanism affecting male baboon reproductive success. It is concluded that male reproductive success in baboons is affected more by social factors than by morphological traits associated with size."
11264431,"The compelling evidence linking small size at birth with later cardiovascular disease has renewed and amplified a clinical and scientific interest in the determinants of fetal growth. Although the effects of maternal nutrition on fetal growth have been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about the effects of maternofetal hypoxia. This study tested the hypothesis that in highland regions, high altitude rather than maternal economic status is associated with reduced and altered fetal growth by investigating the effects of high altitude versus economic status on birth weight and body shape at birth in Bolivia. Bolivia is geographically and socioeconomically unique. It contains several highland (>3500 m above sea level) and lowland (<500 m) cities that are inhabited by very economically divergent populations. Birth weight, body length, and head circumference were compared between a high- (n = 100) and low- (n = 100) income region of La Paz (3649 m; largest high-altitude city) and a high- (n = 100) and low- (n = 100) income region of Santa Cruz (437 m; largest low-altitude city). In addition, the frequency distribution across the continuum of birth weights was plotted for babies born from high- and low-income families in La Paz and Santa Cruz. Mean birth weights were lower in babies from La Paz than in babies from Santa Cruz in both high- and low-income groups. The cumulative frequency curve across all compiled birth weights was shifted to the left in babies from La Paz compared with those from Santa Cruz, regardless of economic status. The frequency of low birth weight (<2500 g) was higher in babies from La Paz than from Santa Cruz in both high- and low-income groups. In addition, at high altitude but not at low altitude, high income was associated with an increase in the head circumference:birth weight ratio. These findings suggest that high altitude rather than economic status is associated with low birth weight and altered body shape at birth in babies from Bolivia."
6505746,"This study investigates the delivery of all aspects of Primary Health Care (PHC) in a case study of one urban health centre in Maputo, Mozambique. Within the context of overall social and economic change, Mozambique has given priority to primary health care as the driving force in its newly developed National Health Service. The urban and rural health centres are intended to be the principal vehicles for PHC delivery, and in this study one of Maputo's recently opened health centres was investigated by observing all clinic sessions, interviewing all health centre workers and collecting data from health centre records. It was found that a dichotomy exists between the tasks ascribed to the health centre in the PHC framework, and the feasibility of their execution given existing personnel and material resources. This derives in part from lack of involvement of PHC practitioners in the organisation and planning of PHC, plus resource allocation which remains in favour of secondary and tertiary rather than primary care. Prevention is accorded priority in PHC theory, yet investigation showed that the major demand on the health centre is for curative care. The quality of both curative and preventive care was evaluated and the need for training in specialist diagnostic skills, and a more socially-based understanding of the determinants of health status and risk emerged, respectively for the groups of workers in the two sectors. The level of contact between the curative and preventive sectors was investigated as was the integration of the health centre into the health service as a whole. The problems arising in these areas must be viewed in the context of the very recent development of a National Health Service in a country where, previously, curative care was available only in urban areas and virtually no preventive programmes existed. This study shows that significant steps are being taken to develop a comprehensive PHC programme in Maputo. More important still will be the extension of this level of care provision to the country as a whole."
6701567,"This study deals with the relationship between social support and mental health. This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports. It is further suggested that sex roles may be important determinants of the availability and use of different support sources."
3817461,"The authors attempt to understand the nature of denial of illness by an examination of two patients with serious and disfiguring physical disorders who postponed medical treatment for over a decade. Both patients subsequently had dramatic negative reactions to the therapeutic efforts of physicians caring for them. Various social, experiential, and characterologic determinants are discussed. In addition, the authors argue that the illness served important organizing functions: it sheltered these patients from the exigencies of everyday life; it allowed them to defeat the physician's efforts to effect a cure; and, finally, the disfigured physical state appeared to correspond to their internalized defective self-image and self-esteem."
16848898,"BACKGROUND: Although there has been concern about the levels of carbon monoxide exposure, particularly among older people, little is known about COHb levels and their determinants in the general population. We examined these issues in a study of older British men. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 4252 men aged 60-79 years selected from one socially representative general practice in each of 24 British towns and who attended for examination between 1998 and 2000. Blood samples were measured for COHb and information on social, household and individual factors assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were based on 3603 men measured in or close to (< 10 miles) their place of residence. RESULTS: The COHb distribution was positively skewed. Geometric mean COHb level was 0.46% and the median 0.50%; 9.2% of men had a COHb level of 2.5% or more and 0.1% of subjects had a level of 7.5% or more. Factors which were independently related to mean COHb level included season (highest in autumn and winter), region (highest in Northern England), gas cooking (slight increase) and central heating (slight decrease) and active smoking, the strongest determinant. Mean COHb levels were more than ten times greater in men smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day (3.29%) compared with non-smokers (0.32%); almost all subjects with COHb levels of 2.5% and above were smokers (93%). Pipe and cigar smoking was associated with more modest increases in COHb level. Passive cigarette smoking exposure had no independent association with COHb after adjustment for other factors. Active smoking accounted for 41% of variance in COHb level and all factors together for 47%. CONCLUSION: An appreciable proportion of men have COHb levels of 2.5% or more at which symptomatic effects may occur, though very high levels are uncommon. The results confirm that smoking (particularly cigarette smoking) is the dominant influence on COHb levels."
11029135,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to predict and explain nurses' adherence to Universal Precautions (UPs) when performing venipunctures. METHODS: Data were gathered from 156 registered nurses working at a regional hospital. A self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial variables (intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived control, etc) was completed at baseline, and behavior was self-reported 3 months later. RESULTS: The regression of intention on the variables yielded an adjusted R(2) of 0.68, with perceived barriers (beta =.62, P <.001), social norm (beta =.17, P <.01), and personal normative belief (beta =.19, P <.01) being the significant variables. With respect to the 3-month follow-up, 28% of the variance associated with UPs adherence was explained by intention (beta =.37, P <.001) and perceived behavioral control (beta =.23, P <.05). Moreover, high (n = 116) and low intenders (n = 40) differed on several normative beliefs (P =.0003) and perceived barriers (P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that perception of control, assessed either globally or by means of a belief-based measure, is a key factor in adherence. Specifically, the perceived difficulties associated with adherence to UPs appear to be related to a nurse's training on UPs and to the existence of suboptimal working conditions."
