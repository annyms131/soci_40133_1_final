28130026,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Sex workers are disproportionately affected by HIV compared with the general population. Most studies of HIV risk among sex workers have focused on individual-level risk factors, with few studies assessing potential structural determinants of HIV risk. In this Article, we examine whether criminal laws around sex work are associated with HIV prevalence among female sex workers. METHOD: We estimate cross-sectional, ecological regression models with data from 27 European countries on HIV prevalence among sex workers from the European Centre for Disease Control; sex-work legislation from the US State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and country-specific legal documents; the rule of law and gross-domestic product per capita, adjusted for purchasing power, from the World Bank; and the prevalence of injecting drug use among sex workers. Although data from two countries include male sex workers, the numbers are so small that the findings here essentially pertain to prevalence in female sex workers. FINDINGS: Countries that have legalised some aspects of sex work (n=17) have significantly lower HIV prevalence among sex workers than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work (n=10; beta=-2.09, 95% CI -0.80 to -3.37; p=0.003), even after controlling for the level of economic development (beta=-1.86; p=0.038) and the proportion of sex workers who are injecting drug users (-1.93; p=0.026). We found that the relation between sex work policy and HIV among sex workers might be partly moderated by the effectiveness and fairness of enforcement, suggesting legalisation of some aspects of sex work could reduce HIV among sex workers to the greatest extent in countries where enforcement is fair and effective. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the legalisation of some aspects of sex work might help reduce HIV prevalence in this high-risk group, particularly in countries where the judiciary is effective and fair.

10281815,1,a,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious."
30616565,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The growth and development that occurs in early childhood has long-term implications, therefore understanding the relevant determinants is needed to inform early prevention and intervention. The objectives of the study were to examine: 1) the longitudinal associations of physical activity and sedentary behavior with social skills and 2) how physical activity and sedentary behavior track over three time-points. METHODS: Participants were from the Parents' Role in Establishing healthy Physical activity and Sedentary behavior habits (PREPS) project. A total of 251 eligible toddlers and their parents participated at baseline in 2014/15 (time 1; 1.6 +/- 0.2 years) and a sub-sample participated at 1-year (time 2; n = 79; 2.7 +/- 0.3 years) and 2-year (time 3; n = 77; 3.7 +/- 0.4 years) follow-ups. Sedentary time (</=25 counts/15 s), light-intensity physical activity (LPA; 26-419 counts/15 s), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA; >/=420/15 s) were objectively measured with wGT3X-BT ActiGraph accelerometers, and standardized for wear time. Parents reported their children's screen time (television/video, video/computer games) at all three time-points. Parents also reported on children's social skills using the Adaptive Social Behavior Inventory (ASBI) at time-points 2 and 3, and comply (e.g., cooperates; 10 items), express (e.g., joins play; 13 items), and disrupt (e.g., teases; 7 items) subscales were created by summing items. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were conducted to address objective one. Tracking coefficients (low: beta1 < 0.30; moderate: beta1 = 0.30-0.59; moderate-high: beta1 = 0.60-0.90; high: beta1 > 0.9) were conducted using GEE to address objective two. RESULTS: Across the study, screen time was negatively associated with express (b = - 0.068, 95%CI: -0.114, - 0.023) and comply (b = - 0.056; 95%CI: -0.094, - 0.018) scores and positively associated with disrupt scores (b = 0.004; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.006). Findings were similar for television/videos but less consistent for video/computer games. No associations were observed for physical activity. Screen time significantly tracked at moderate-high levels (beta1 = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.81), while all other behaviors tracked at moderate levels (beta1 = 0.35-0.49; p < 0.01) over the three time-points. CONCLUSIONS: Screen time was unfavorably associated with social skills across early childhood. Furthermore, all behaviors tracked at moderate to moderate-high levels from toddler to preschool ages. Therefore, promoting healthy physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns early in life, especially for screen time, may be important."
3714667,1,a,"Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in different socioeconomic and educational groups in Finland. The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers."
21562996,0,a,"HIV infection may result in stressful situations such as disclosure to others and could be a mediator between seropositivity status and psychiatric illness, depression, or anxiety. Several results have shown that anxiolytic use (mainly benzodiazepines [BDZ]) is highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals, but few studies have highlighted to what extent this use could be associated with HIV disclosure. A national cross-sectional survey representative of people living with HIV and AIDS in France enrolled 2932 individuals in 102 French HIV hospital departments. Face-to-face interviews and self-administered questions collected information about patients' experience with HIV and HIV care, including use of psychotropic drugs, social support, stigma, and disclosure of HIV status. We identified factors associated with regular BDZ use (i.e., more than once a week) using a weighted logistic regression model. Regular BDZ use and anxiety symptoms were reported by 16% and 29% of the patients, respectively. After multiple adjustment for known correlates of BDZ use and anxiety symptoms, individuals who had disclosed their HIV status to relatives or friends were found to be more likely (OR [95% CI] = 1.78 [1.02-3.09]) to regularly use BDZ. These results show both to what extent disclosure to others continues to be a stressful step in the course of HIV infection and that disclosure is something that could be identified by BDZ use. They also highlight the need for appropriate case management and psychiatric care to help patients manage the consequences of disclosure."
29936785,0,a,"Background: One of the malignant tumors is Breast Cancer (BC) that starts in the cells of breast. There is many models for survival analysis of patients such as Cox PH model, Parametric models etc. But some disease are that all of patients will not experience main event then usual survival model is inappropriate. In addition, In the presence of cured patients, if researcher can specify distribution of survival time, usually cure rate models are preferable to parametric models. Distribution of Survival time can be Weibull, Log normal, Logistic, Gamma and so. Comparison of Weibull, Log normal and Logistic distribution for finding the best distribution of survival time is purpose of this study. Material and Methods: Among 787 patients with BC by Cancer Research Center recognized and followed from 1985 until 2013. Variables stage of cancer, age at diagnosis, tumor size and Number of Removed Positive Lymph Nodes (NRPLN) for fitting Cure rate model were selected. The best model selected with DIC criteria. All analysis were performed using SAS 9.2. Results: Mean (SD) of age was 48.47 (11.49) years and Mean of survival time and Maximum follow up time was 326 and 55.12 months respectively. During following patients, 145 (18.4%) patients died from BC and others survived (censored). Also, 1-year, 5-year and 10-year survival rate was 94, 77 and 56 percent respectively. Log normal model with smaller DIC were selected and fitted. All of mentioned variables in the model were significant on cure rate. Conclusion: This study indicated that survival time of BC followed from Log normal distribution in the best way."
2573873,1,a,"Sociopharmacology is based on interdisciplinary research involving pharmacology, epidemiology, social medicine and sociology. It aims at finding out the social determinants of drug intake. How this goal is approached stepwise is shown in the case of the benzodiazepine group of active substances."
2649990,1,a,"A social epidemiological approach has been used to study social factors associated with chronic disease, as well as to promote community-oriented intervention programs to modify risk for cardiovascular disease. The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk."
3793442,1,a,"We analyze the ethical issues related to the physician's role in informing about, advising, rejecting, or performing a definitive birth control procedure (sterilization). We define a rational request for tubal ligation, the limited delaying (or facilitating) role that guidelines for deciding on ligation should have, the justifiable reasons for rejecting a request, and the physician's obligations and options. We also consider the need to supply adequate information, the implications of recommending a second-best treatment, and the pivotal place of the ""likelihood of regret"" in medical decision-making."
26321229,0,a,"PROBLEM: Excessive weight gain and physical inactivity in pregnancy have been identified as risk factors for negative health outcomes for mothers and fetuses, particularly among Aboriginal women. QUESTION: In this paper we engage with postcolonial feminist theory and critical discourse analysis to examine the question, ""how do urban Aboriginal women understand pregnancy-related weight gain and physical activity."" METHODS: We conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with 25 urban Aboriginal pregnant or postpartum women between the ages of 16 and 39 in Ottawa, Canada. FINDINGS: Three prominent discourses emerged: Aboriginal women have different pregnancies than non-Aboriginal women because Aboriginal women gain more weight and are more likely to develop gestational diabetes; Aboriginal women feel personally responsible for and shameful about excessive weight gain; finally, Aboriginal women need culturally safe pregnancy resources. DISCUSSION: Our results illuminate the complex and often paradoxical ways in which discourses around weight gain and physical activity are produced and taken-up by Aboriginal women and their healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we argue there is a lack of accessible and culturally safe resources for urban Aboriginal women, specifically concerning weight gain and physical activity in pregnancy. We recommend the development of resources that are created for/by/with Aboriginal women to better address that issues that urban Aboriginal women themselves identify as being of key importance."
23833635,0,a,"Trends and determinants of marriage payments have rarely been examined at the population level despite their plausible implications for the welfare of family and the distribution of wealth across families and generations. In this study, we analyze population-based data from the Vietnam Study of Family Change to document prevalence and directions of marriage payments in Vietnam from 1963 to 2000. We investigate the extent to which structural and policy transformations (particularly market reform and the socialist policy that banned brideprice) influenced the practice of marriage payments as well as estimate how societal changes indirectly impacted payments via their effects on population characteristics. Results indicate that marriage payments surged following market reform but also reveal more nuanced trends and regional differences during earlier years. While the socialist attempts to eradicate brideprice appear to have been moderately successful in the North prior to economic renovation the evidence suggests they were largely unsuccessful in the South. Results suggest that structural and policy change explained most of the observed variations in marriage payments and that changing characteristics of the individuals who married mattered relatively little. We interpret the reemergence of marriage payments as attesting to resilience of traditional values and the unraveling of the socialist agenda, especially in the North, but also as a reflection of economic prosperity associated with market reform."
6139036,1,a,"A community sample of older adults was investigated to test some of the current hypothesis about the etiology of depression in the elderly. Multiple regression analysis showed that cognitive disturbances (memory, concentration), previous depressive episodes, and somatic health problems accounted for most of the etiological variance. Other variables, like stressful life events, financial problems, social isolation, alcohol use, age, sex, and previous somatic illnesses are significant but their numerical values are very small. Etiological insignificant were the variables: physical activities, competency in daily living, and support by ones own children."
28514037,1,a,"Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084)."
3629664,1,a,"Data from a 1982 sample survey of 3,830 married women below age 50 in a district of Beijing City are applied to the Bongaarts model of the proximate determinants of fertility. A total fertility rate (TFR) of 0.75 births per woman is estimated from the model, compared with a TFR of 1.24 actually observed from the survey. The estimated TFR (0.75) results from the assumed total fecundity (TF) of 15.30 births per woman being inhibited by the indexes of the proximate determinants of fertility, most notably non-marriage (.280), contraception (.315), and induced abortion (.586). The effects of two other proximate determinants, lactational infecundability and spousal separation, were negligible. Comparative data from other countries confirm that the study area has very low levels of fertility and marriage, a very high prevalence of induced abortion, and a small effect of lactational infecundability. The extremely low level of fertility was, thus, achieved through a high level of induced abortion. Future research needs and policy implications associated with the study are discussed."
20357354,0,a,"There have been significant public health achievements in recent years; not only do people live longer and healthier lives, but there has also been a decline in communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and water-borne diseases, especially in developing countries like India. Although lifestylerelated problems are emerging globally, developing countries carry heavier burdens of poor health conditions, which is an issue of serious concern, in particular among marginalized populations. Reaching out to these groups is a global challenge, and particularly in India, where one-third of the population (between 250 and 300 million people) live in remote, difficult and vulnerable areas lacking basic amenities. In order to address the 'health for all' challenge, this Commentary advocates for the public, private and non-profit sectors to work together to implement innovative community-based approaches that address the various social determinants of health. The case of the Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI), a national NGO, is presented as an example of successful coordinated community and policy actions to improve health determinants in remote rural areas of India."
6984992,1,a,"The hypothesis that social indices and educational level of mother are potential sources of childhood malnutrition was tested in Kampumbu, Zambia. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, protein and albumin levels in children were studied in relation to malnutrition. Six hundred and fifty rural children (306 males and 344 females) aged one and fourteen years exposed to various types of diet and environmental factors were selected randomly. Data on economic status, diet environment and educational attainment as well as other demographic information were collected. The major epidemiological findings were that the difference in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by income) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis was significant (X2 = 4.1, P less than 0.025), and the relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Similarly, there was a very significant difference (X2 = 7.4, P less than 0.005) in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by house grades) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis. The estimated relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Other variables, including age, history of hookworm, were not found to be determinants of risk for malnutrition."
26499771,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is little evidence as to why or why not insurees decide to seek medical services. Steps prior to the entry of the insuree into the professional health care system have not been sufficiently examined and can only be partially described by secondary data of the statutory health insurance (SHI). We report the first investigation using case vignettes based on the generic health-related quality of life questionnaire EQ-5D as part of a choice study to assess insurees' stated preferences in health services utilization. METHODS: We invited 1500 randomly selected citizens (age 30 to 70 years) from the East German state of Saxony-Anhalt by postal mail to participate in the choice study. Attributes of the case vignettes involved in choice tasks were the five dimensions of the EQ-5D. We used multilevel mixed effects logit regression analysis with the dependent variables: preference to seek medical services (model 1) and preferred time until consultation (model 2) for the assessed case vignette. The EQ-5D attributes of the case vignettes and participant characteristics served as the independent variables. We also included the respondent's certainty of choosing from the choice set, and the order of questions of the questionnaire as control variables. RESULTS: Of the 1500 questionnaires 683 were evaluable (net response rate 48.0%). On the level of the case vignettes, problems in all five dimensions of the EQ-5D were statistically significant factors of the estimated likelihood to seek medical services (model 1). On the respondent level, there was a significant relationship between the preference for medical consultation for the assessed case vignette and the respondent's gender, age, educational level, the existence of a regular doctor, and the certainty of choosing from the choice set. Problems in four of the five dimensions of the EQ-5D (except anxiety/depression) of the case vignettes were significantly associated with the preferred time until consultation (model 2). On the respondent level, gender, educational level, the certainty of choosing from the choice set, and the order of questions of the questionnaire were significant determinants of the time until consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers a promising new approach for the national and cross-national study of preferences in health services utilization from the insurees' perspective."
30479982,0,a,"Background: Prevalence of F&V consumption in Namibia is not known. In this study we aimed to address this gap by using nationally representative data with the objectives of measuring the prevalence of adequate F&V consumption among adult men and women and their socio demographic determinants. Methods: This study is based on data from Namibia Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS2013). Sample population were 14 185 men and women aged between 15 and 49 years.Amount of fruit and vegetable consumption was measured by self-reported frequencies and was defined as adequate (at least 5 servings/day) according to World Health Organization (WHO)guidelines. Results: Overall, only 4.3% (3.8-4.9%) of the men and women reported consuming at least 5 servings of F&V a day, with the percentage being slightly higher among women (4.8%,95% CI=3.7-6.2) compared with men (4.2%, 95% CI=3.6-4.8). In the multivariable analysis,education level and household wealth status appeared to be the only factors associated with adequate F&V intake. Men and women who had primary level education had higher odds of eating at least 5 servings of F&V a day compared with those who had no education. Regarding wealth status, men and women from non-poor households had respectively 2.13 times(OR=2.13, 95% CI=1.01-4.48) and 2.2 times (OR=2.19, 95% CI=1.56-3.38) higher odds of eating at least 5 servings of F&V a day. Conclusion: Only a small proportion of the men and women consumed adequate amount of F&V on daily basis. Having primary level education and non-poor household wealth status were positively associated with adequate amount of F&V intake."
31381131,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to artificial tanning devices is carcinogenic to humans, and government regulations to restrict or ban indoor tanning appear to be increasing. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated changes in the international prevalence of indoor tanning among adolescents and adults after artificial tanning devices were classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2009. METHODS: Systematic searches in PubMed and Web of Science databases were undertaken. Overall, 43 studies reporting 'ever' or 'past-year' indoor tanning exposure after 2009 were identified. We used metaregression analysis to evaluate the prevalence of indoor tanning over time. Random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize the prevalence of indoor tanning in adolescents and adults according to sex, region and presence of age prohibitions. RESULTS: Global prevalence of indoor tanning in adolescents for 2013-2018 was 6.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-10.6], 70% lower than the 22.0% (95% CI 17.2-26.8) prevalence for 2007-2012. Among adults, the prevalence was 10.4% (95% CI 5.7-16.3) for 2013-2018, a decrease of 35% from 18.2% for 2007-2012. Since 2009, the overall past-year prevalence among adolescents was 6.7% (95% CI 4.4-9.6) and 12.5% (95% CI 9.5-15.6) among adults. The prevalence of tanning indoors in the past year was similar in North America (adults, 12.5%; adolescents, 7.6%) and Europe (adults, 11.1%; adolescents, 5.1%). In 2009, three countries had regulations restricting indoor tanning, compared with 26 countries today. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of indoor tanning has declined substantially and significantly in adolescents and adults since the 2009 IARC statement, reflecting the rise in regulations that limit this source of unnecessary exposure to carcinogenic ultraviolet radiation. What is already known about this topic? Indoor tanning is associated with an increased risk of melanoma. A meta-analysis of worldwide indoor tanning prevalence for 1986-2012 found a past-year prevalence of 18% in adolescents and 14% in adults, with higher prevalences during the period 2007-2012. Policies to regulate indoor tanning began to be implemented across the globe in 2009. Only one study carried out in the U.S.A. has evaluated the efficacy of such policies in reducing indoor tanning prevalence. What does this study add? For the period 2013-2018, we found indoor tanning prevalences of 6.7% in adolescents and 11.9% in adults. This implies a reduction in indoor tanning use of 70% in adolescents and 35% in adults during the last 10 years. Our study encourages policy makers to strengthen indoor tanning regulations that reduce sunbed use among the general population in order to produce maximum public health benefit."
26636498,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore possible environmental factors behind the regional differences in the incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: All of the patients diagnosed with IBD who were aged 0 to 14 years in Finland between 1987 and 2003 were identified from the Social Insurance Institution database. Finland was divided into squares of 250 x 250 m, and spatial variations of incidence rates were evaluated accordingly. The role of the environmental determinants (pediatric population density, agricultural industry, chemical contaminants of tap water and proximity to the sea or paper mills) in the geographic variations of the incidence rates was evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, the overall incidence of pediatric IBD was 6.5 of 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.1-6.9). The incidence in very sparsely populated areas (</=10 person-years per 250 x 250 m) was 9.2 of 100,000 (95% CI 6.3-13.1) and 5.6 of 100,000 (95% CI 4.8-6.4) in the districts with the highest population density (>800 person-years per 250 x 250 m). A nonsignificant trend toward the same direction was also seen for ulcerative colitis (trend P = 0.09). Chemical contaminant concentrations of tap water, residence near the seaside, or proximity to paper mills were not associated with the incidence of pediatric IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest higher incidence rates of pediatric IBD in the districts with low compared with high density of child population, but the differences cannot be explained by variations in the environmental exposures evaluated here."
7424839,1,a,"A stratified sample (race, sex, and social class) of 469 laymen from two North Carolina communities responded to a 190-item MMPI-based questionnaire with the degree of mental illness concern evoked by each item. The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance. Although laymen had roughly similar rank orderings for the 13 homogeneous clusters of items, blacks indicated greater concern over breakdowns in social orientation than whites, while the opposite pattern held for traditionally defined psychopathy (internal distresses). Upper-class concerns were, comparatively, with cognitive dysfunction, middle-class with moral and social responsibility, and lower-class with social inadequacies."
3538185,1,a,"Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity."
24896982,1,a,"An experimental model was constructed using seven postulates derived from the experimental results of Zayan (1974, 1975a,b,c, 1976). The model specifies the relative importance of several asymmetries in predicting aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus helleri . These asymmetries concern difference between duellists with respect to: prior residence in the tested area (vs intrusion); immediate social experiences of dominance or submission; social isolation; individual familiarity and recognition. The predictions of the general model were checked experimentally and confirmed; a multiple orthogonal regression accounted for about 97% of the variance in our experimental results. The basic experimental results serving as postulates were confirmed and could be generalized; a new synthetic and predictive model was formulated concerning the determinants of aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus ."
2807934,1,a,"A national sample of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged was created by merging the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey and its counterpart, the National Health Interview Survey for the same year. A weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might be useful in calculating home- and community-based long-term care clients' risk of institutionalization. A model containing patient characteristics, nursing home bed supply, and a climate variable correctly classified 98.2 percent of cases residing in nursing homes or the community. Physical dependency, mental disorder and degenerative disease, lack of spouse, being white, poverty, old age, unoccupied nursing home beds, and climate all appear to be determinants of institutional residency among the aged."
3232579,1,a,"Self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans are examined in relation to sex role orientations of late adolescents. Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys."
7380104,1,a,"The effects of social isolation on the behavior of juvenile domestic cats were assessed by rearing 4 male and 4 female infant kittens in each of the following rearing conditions: (1) mother-littermate; (2) mother-only; (3) brooder-littermate; and (4) brooder-only. They were then tested twice a week individually and twice a week socially from 2 to 6 1/2 months of age in a playroom, utilizing multiple categories of behavior. The mother-only-reared juveniles were hyperactive in both object play (when tested individually) and social play. The brooder-only-reared kittens displayed enhanced socially directed behavior and were generally hypergregarious, whereas the brooder-littermate-reared kittens displayed retarded social behavior. Observations indicated that littermate-deprived kittens did not learn social communication skills and that some prolonged separation effects existed for littermate-reared kittens. The results suggest that the determinants of social play are more complex than the determinants of object play."
31712820,0,a,"There is broad agreement that religion is a social determinant of health. In the article by Chen and VanderWeele (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(11):2355-2364), the authors took an outcome-wide approach to demonstrate associations between religious practices early in the life-course (regular service attendance and prayer/mediation) and a wide range of health endpoints and behaviors later on. Is religion a panacea? The study adds to the evidence that religious practices are correlated with a broad swath of health outcomes. However, more work is needed to translate that evidence into practicable advice for individuals and for society. The following tasks remain: (a) sharpening our understanding of which elements of religious practices promote health (specifically, is it service attendance, or prayer, or both? And could a non-religious person achieve the same benefit via regular participation in a secular group, like a choir?); and (b) improving our understanding of the different contexts in which religion is likely to have beneficial as well as potentially harmful effects."
6706795,1,a,"A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed. Smoking, use of drugs, sexual behavior, and drinking of alcoholic beverages at the age of 16 years was related to dropout from secondary school during the 2-year study period. The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed."
3434411,1,a,"This study is concerned with the effect of age, sex, social class, and quality of family interaction on the future orientation of adolescents aged 10-11, 14-15, and 17-19 years. Seventy-three girls and 75 boys were interviewed about their future hopes and fears. The content and extension of each aim and fear as well as the amount of planning, knowledge, and perceived locus of control involved was estimated from answers. The contents of aims and fears were closely related to the developmental tasks. Nearly half the subjects were afraid of war. The extension of subjects' future orientation decreased, whereas their knowledge about the future increased with age. The subjects from the higher social classes were oriented farther into the future than those from the lower classes. An interpretation emphasizing the importance of the principal developmental tasks on young people's future orientation is discussed."
3538185,1,a,"Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity."
26935846,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Malaria re-introduction is a challenge in elimination settings. To prevent re-introduction, receptivity, vulnerability, and health system capacity of foci should be monitored using appropriate tools. This study aimed to design an applicable model to monitor predicting factors of re-introduction of malaria in highly prone areas. METHODS: This exploratory, descriptive study was conducted in a pre-elimination setting with a high-risk of malaria transmission re-introduction. By using nominal group technique and literature review, a list of predicting indicators for malaria re-introduction and outbreak was defined. Accordingly, a checklist was developed and completed in the field for foci affected by re-introduction and for cleared-up foci as a control group, for a period of 12 weeks before re-introduction and for the same period in the previous year. Using field data and analytic hierarchical process (AHP), each variable and its sub-categories were weighted, and by calculating geometric means for each sub-category, score of corresponding cells of interaction matrices, lower and upper threshold of different risks strata, including low and mild risk of re-introduction and moderate and high risk of malaria outbreaks, were determined. The developed predictive model was calibrated through resampling with different sets of explanatory variables using R software. Sensitivity and specificity of the model were calculated based on new samples. RESULTS: Twenty explanatory predictive variables of malaria re-introduction were identified and a predictive model was developed. Unpermitted immigrants from endemic neighbouring countries were determined as a pivotal factor (AHP score: 0.181). Moreover, quality of population movement (0.114), following malaria transmission season (0.088), average daily minimum temperature in the previous 8 weeks (0.062), an outdoor resting shelter for vectors (0.045), and rainfall (0.042) were determined. Positive and negative predictive values of the model were 81.8 and 100 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduced a new, simple, yet reliable model to forecast malaria re-introduction and outbreaks eight weeks in advance in pre-elimination and elimination settings. The model incorporates comprehensive deterministic factors that can easily be measured in the field, thereby facilitating preventive measures."
28103072,0,a,"To systematically improve population health in the United States, community health records (CHRs) must be defined, developed, and implemented. Like electronic and personal health records, CHRs have both unique and overlapping information. CHRs contain data about communities, including the social, physical, and lifestyle determinants of health. These records will serve to complement electronic and personal health records to provide a more complete view of population health, allowing stakeholders to target community health and quality-of-life interventions in a data-driven and evidence-based manner, establishing the basis from which organizations can develop a systematic approach to improving community health. This commentary calls on the United States to conduct a set of consensus activities to define and implement CHRs."
6223881,1,a,"Social and psychological determinants of the time taken to return to work were investigated in a sample of male manual workers referred to an accident clinic with mostly minor industrial injuries. Patients who showed a rapid recovery relative to the severity of their injuries were more often married, had greater job satisfaction, were less likely to be receiving an income supplement from their employers, and blamed themselves more for their accidents. The findings also indicated that a poor recovery rate could be expected when the accident was due to some environmental fault or failure, and the implications for studies of compensation are discussed."
2641329,1,a,"Attributions of responsibility have been shown to be important determinants of illness behavior in adults. This study examines the salience of attributional judgements among adolescents with cancer. Patients and their parents were categorized according to their attributions of responsibility for the cause of and solution to the adolescent's health problems into one of four attributional models. Of the four possible models, only two were represented: the medical and compensatory. Only 37.5% of parent/child pairs were concordant for model choice. Patients whose attributions conformed to those of the compensatory model sought more information (F = 5.1, (P = .03), were satisfied with the information supplied (F = 3.5, P = .07), and expressed the belief that a greater percentage of prescribed medications needed to be taken if a cure was to result (F = 4.1, P = .05). Side effects were more often experienced by patients whose responsibility attributions exemplified the medical model (F = 5.09, P = .03). Model concordance did not relate to parent/child agreement on health-related beliefs, patient age, sex, or compliance measures (P greater than .05). No relationship was found between parent-child model concordance and patient's self-reported medication compliance. The present data do not support the notion that attributions of responsibility for cause and solution of cancer should be important targets of interventions designed to increase medication compliance among cancer patients."
2471142,1,a,"Rather than speaking broadly about the determinants of the nurse-patient relationship, as I did in my book, in this article I have focused more narrowly on psychiatric mental health nurses and their patients. I cited, as the chief influence on the context of the relationship between the two, the psychological changes concomitant with the stellar transition from the Piscean to the Aquarian Age and the burdens these changes impose on the psyche of the individual. I talked a bit about the paradoxical nature of the psyche and how it relates to paradoxical psychotherapeutic approaches. I mentioned win, win negotiations as being skills necessary for coping in the Aquarian Age. I also mentioned that our own value system, although absolute for us, is not necessarily binding on the other unless it is mutually agreed upon beforehand. In addition, I spoke about the possibility of many theories and methods, each equally valid and workable in the solution of a particular problem. I said our approach to the patient will depend on our role conception as psychotherapist, our typology, and concomitant with that, our model of psychological processes and the theoretical framework in which it is couched. I have stated what I consider the four key points for all of us to be aware of in order to negotiate the new psychology. We need to differentiate between needs, wants, and entitlement: we are entitled to our needs, but we are ultimately responsible for their fulfillment (which does not necessarily mean that we have to fulfill them ourselves). We need to be aware of the two-pronged aspect of every bit of communication; i.e., the simultaneous factual and directional message contained in each, and yet the selectivity of the tuning in by the receiver. We also need to be aware that any communication can imply a message about the object discussed or about one's subjective relation to it, as well as the confusion and rage that can be caused by ambiguities and the misunderstanding of which of the two has been meant. We have to learn to live with the fact that all of us have one area of our personality that is reasonably well adapted and another one that is still young and needs all our (and others') help that it can get.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6738684,1,a,"Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance."
6518143,1,a,"This paper investigates the range, structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of alcoholism. The different explicit medical and psychological theories are reviewed as are studies on lay beliefs about alcoholism and heavy drinking. After a number of interviews in which people were asked to list what they believed to be the major causes of alcoholism, 265 people completed a questionnaire in which they rated 30 explanations for their importance in explaining the causes of alcoholism. Females more than males believed alcoholics to be socially inadequate and anxious and that there was too much social pressure and not enough prohibitions against drinking. Middle-aged rather than younger or older people tended to explain alcoholism in terms of poor education, social and cultural pressures and biological or genetic mechanisms. However, there were few differences in the ratings of heavy, moderate, light and non-drinkers. Factor analysis revealed six factors labelled psychological stress, personal and social problems, psychoanalytic theories, sociocultural explanations, biological or genetic explanations and social desirability or pressure. The results are discussed in terms of the research on lay understandings of psychological and medical phenomena, and the relationship between explicit and implicit theories."
31927365,0,a,"Methylisothiazolinone (MI) and the mixture of methylchloroisothiazo notlinone/methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI, 3:1) are widespread biocides used in cosmetics, household products, paints or as disinfectant in air-conditioning systems. Exposure to these compounds has raised concerns due to their sensitizing potential, as rates of skin sensitization were reported to increase in the last decade. We have analyzed N-methylmalonamic acid (NMMA), a common metabolite of MI and MCI in 24-h urine samples of the German Environmental Specimen Bank collected from 480 participants (240 male/240 female) between the years 2000 and 2017. Using these data, we were able to calculate the overall daily intake of MI and/or MCI/MI (3:1) of the study participants and point out time trends. NMMA was determined in all urine samples investigated above the LOQ of 0.5 mug/L urine. Median and 95th percentile level of NMMA in all 24-h urine samples was 4.1 mug/g creatinine and 8.5 mug/g creatinine, respectively. This would correspond to a median and 95th percentile daily intake of 0.35 mug/kg bw and 0.71 mug/kg bw for exclusive uptake of MI and 0.64 mug/kg bw and 1.28 mug/kg bw for exclusive uptake of MCI/MI (3:1). We noted only slight variations over time for median exposures, but an increasing time trend in the 95th percentile exposure between 2006 and 2011 with a decrease in recent years, probably reflecting regulatory measures on MI and MCI/MI (3:1) in cosmetic products. Increasing knowledge on determinants of exposure to MI and/or MCI/MI (3:1) would be necessary to further lower exposure to these sensitizing compounds."

28445214,0,a,"Medical schools are increasingly called to include social responsibility in their mandates. As such, they are focusing their attention on the social determinants of health (SDOH) as key drivers in the health of the patients and communities they serve. However, underlying this emphasis on the SDOH is the assumption that teaching medical students about the SDOH will lead future physicians to take action to help achieve health equity. There is little evidence to support this belief. In many ways, the current approach to the SDOH within medical education positions them as ""facts to be known"" rather than as ""conditions to be challenged and changed."" Educators talk about poverty but not oppression, race but not racism, sex but not sexism, and homosexuality but not homophobia. The current approach to the SDOH may constrain or even incapacitate the ability of medical education to achieve the very goals it lauds, and in fact perpetuate inequity. In this article, the authors explore how ""critical consciousness"" and a recentering of the SDOH around justice and inequity can be used to deepen collective understanding of power, privilege, and the inequities embedded in social relationships in order to foster an active commitment to social justice among medical trainees. Rather than calling for minor curricular modifications, the authors argue that major structural and cultural transformations within medical education need to occur to make educational institutions truly socially responsible."
6542479,1,a,"Reproductive and agonistic behaviors in Siamese fighting fish were investigated in eight experiments, and some consequences and determinants of these sequences were isolated. First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior."
28886107,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Although the relationship between mortality and self-rated health has been demonstrated in sub-Saharan Africa, information in this area is rudimentary. In Senegal, no study has been undertaken comparing self-rated health between urban and rural areas. The objective of this study is therefore to compare self-rated health and its main predictors in Dakar and in a rural isolated area, Tessekere municipality, taking into account socio-demographic and economic factors, social relations, as well as measures of physical and mental health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was carried out in 2015 on a population sample of 1000 individuals living in Dakar and 500 individuals living in the municipality of Tessekere, constructed using the quota method. Self-rated health, health variables, psychosocial, sociodemographic and economic characteristics were collected during face-to-face interviews. Statistical analyses used were Chi-square tests and binary logistic regressions. RESULTS: Results show that self-rated health in Senegalese urban area (Dakar) is better than in rural area (Tessekere), but the determinants of self-rated health partly differ between these two environments. Age and gender play a fundamental role in self-rated health as much in Dakar as in Tessekere but diabetes and social support play a role in self-rated health only in urban environment, whereas economic well-being is associated to self-rated health only in rural area. CONCLUSION: The analyses carried out in these two environments show that despite the existence of common determinants (age, gender, stress), the determinants for formulating an answer to the question of self-rated health differ. People's social and cultural environments thus play a fundamental role in the process of rating one's health and, in the short and long term, in the mortality rate."
30968296,0,a,"A plethora of empirical work explored finance-income-environment nexus, aims to investigate high CO2 emissions determinants, over the last few couples of decades. The prior empirical work assist the idea that finance and income have diverse impacts on the environment. The lack of consensus on finance-income-environment nexus in the Central and Eastern European Countries in the perspective of Belt and Road Initiative need to be examined. Therefore, the present study explores the nexus between financial development, income level, and environmental quality for a panel of eighteen Central and Eastern European Countries, over the period of 1980-2016. The Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Regression, the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel casualty approaches are employed. The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis also investigated for both time series panel and country-wise. The Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Regression long-run panel results reveal that (i) financial development index and income negatively impact on environmental quality; (ii) energy consumption is the key determinant of CO2 emissions and reduces environmental quality; (iii) urbanization and trade both enhance environmental quality via reduction of carbon emissions; and (iv) the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis supported for the selected panel countries. The country-wise results depict that increase in environmental quality occurs due to increase in financial development (in four countries), income level (in five countries), trade (in five countries), and urbanization (in eight countries). However, the environmental quality decreases due to the increase in financial development (in six countries), income level (in eight countries), energy consumption (in twelve countries), trade (in six countries), and urbanization (in five countries). The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis supported for five Central and Eastern European Countries. Additionally, the causality results confirmed the presence of feedback relationships among income and environmental quality, and financial development and energy consumption. Thus, we conclude that income level and financial development are the main drivers behind high carbon dioxide emissions in CEECs. The finding of the study opens up new insight for appropriate policymaking."

7202850,1,a,"Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children."
27280000,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Human resources are the most strategic resource and the most significant input for health systems. Their behavior and motivation can strongly affect the overall performance of the health systems. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that affect motivation in frontline employees at teaching hospitals affiliated with Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU) in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015. The participants (nurses, physiotherapists, radiology and laboratory technicians, operating room and pharmacy staff) were 300 employees selected by the stratified random sampling method from two general and teaching hospitals. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire that consisted of 42 questions in the 7 domains of motivational factors. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and independent samples t-test by SPSS software, version 23. RESULTS: The findings indicated that working relationships (mean of 3.95) were the main determinant of job motivation of frontline employees. Job content (3.76) career development (3.75), social respect (3.75), and autonomy (3.30) were the next four affective factors. Recognition and remuneration had the least influence on the job motivation of frontline employees. The results of the Friedman test indicated that the difference between the mean scores of different dimensions was significant (chi(2) (6) = 607.00, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A hospital that seeks to engender increased motivation of its frontline employees should have in place a human resources strategy that includes facilitating communication between personnel and management, supporting employees in the community, and promoting social respect for health professions, providing educational opportunities and career development, development of appropriate promotional policies, employee participation in goal setting, facilitating a good working environment and job security, job enrichment, and delegation."
3989430,1,a,"The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats."
6814269,1,a,"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful."

26404963,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A large proportion of colorectal cancers are thought to be associated with unhealthy dietary and lifestyle exposures, particularly energy excess, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. It has been suggested that these processes stimulate the production of toxic reactive carbonyls from sugars such as glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde contributes to the production of a group of compounds known as glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end-products (glycer-AGEs), which may promote colorectal cancer through their proinflammatory and pro-oxidative properties. The objective of this study nested within a prospective cohort was to explore the association of circulating glycer-AGEs with risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 1,055 colorectal cancer cases (colon n = 659; rectal n = 396) were matchced (1:1) to control subjects. Circulating glycer-AGEs were measured by a competitive ELISA. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusting for potential confounding factors, including smoking, alcohol, physical activity, body mass index, and diabetes status. RESULTS: Elevated glycer-AGEs levels were not associated with colorectal cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quartile, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.82-1.49). Subgroup analyses showed possible divergence by anatomical subsites (OR for colon cancer, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57-1.22; OR for rectal cancer, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.19; Pheterogeneity = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, circulating glycer-AGEs were not associated with risk of colon cancer, but showed a positive association with the risk of rectal cancer. IMPACT: Further research is needed to clarify the role of toxic products of carbohydrate metabolism and energy excess in colorectal cancer development."
24327481,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed growing interest in determinants of suicide in South Korea. While much of the research has paid attention to the role of individual factors in explaining suicide mortality, another potentially important dimension of health inequality is geography. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To describe the geographical distribution of suicide rates in South Korea, and to examine to what extent the distribution is shaped by area deprivation. METHODS: Using 2004-2006 mortality data and 2005 population census data, the study first described the spatial mapping of age-standardised suicide rates and level of area deprivation across 250 districts in South Korea. A spatial lag model was also employed to examine the association between the two, taking into account the spatial dependence and interactions between neighbouring districts, as indicated by Moran's I and Geary' C statistics. In addition to level of area deprivation, population density, welfare spending, and rates of divorce, marriage and fertility at district-level were added to the model. RESULTS: The spatial mapping of suicide rates across 250 districts exhibited a different pattern between males and females. While the highest suicide rates tended to cluster in the north-east region of South Korea for males, no clear pattern was observed for females. On the other hand, the lowest suicide rates for both males and females were found in most districts of the capital city. The results of the spatial lag model revealed a significant association between suicide rates and area deprivation, particularly for male suicide. Compared to the least deprived area, there were about 12-13 more male suicide cases (per 100,000 males) in highly deprived areas. The association with area deprivation was less clear for females. Population density was negatively associated with suicide rates for both males and females. While suicide rates were in general positively associated with divorce rates and negatively associated with fertility rates, the coefficients of both were not significant in the model for females. DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS: The study highlighted substantial geographical variation in suicide rates across South Korea. Such variation can be largely explained by level of area deprivation, especially for males. The level of excess suicides (i.e. 12-13 per 100,000 males) in highly deprived areas was similar to the average suicide rates of OECD countries. Due to the paucity of individual-level data however, the study was unable to test whether or not these associations were independent of population composition. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: Prioritising development in relatively more deprived areas would potentially minimise resource barriers. Since such area-based approaches focus on a body with clear responsibility (i.e. local authority) and a greater relevance for local residents, programmes and services can be more effectively tailored to local needs and also more effectively delivered to local residents. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Alternative sources of data with individual-level data should be explored to strengthen the basis of the present findings, and also to examine the exact mechanism underlying the associations between suicide rates and area deprivation."
3729384,1,a,"This study evaluated methods for empirically identifying environmental determinants of aggressive and disruptive behavior in three developmentally delayed children. A variety of sessions conducted on an inpatient treatment unit were designed to stimulate contingencies maintaining aggression and disruption in the subjects' natural environments. The basic analog conditions included: instructional demands, contingent social disapproval, and structured play. In addition, variations of the three basic conditions were developed based on informal observation and parental reports of naturally occurring contingencies. Results showed considerable variability both between and within subjects. However, for each subject a specific analog condition was shown to produce relatively higher rates of aberrant behavior. Subsequently, behavioral treatments based on assessment results were successfully implemented with two of the subjects. Results are discussed in terms of the importance and practical limitations of conducting systematic assessment of aberrant repertoires in developmentally delayed clients."
28564267,1,a,"We have presented a formal model for the quantitative analysis of phylogenetic and specific effects on the distribution of trait values among species. Total trait values are divided into phylogenetic values, inherited from an ancestral species, and specific values, the result of independent evolution. This allows a quantitative assessment of the strength of the phylogenetic inertia, or burden, displayed by a character in a lineage, so that questions concerning the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints in evolution can be answered. The separation of phylogenetic from specific effects proposed here also allows phylogenetic factors to be explicitly included in cross-species comparative analyses of adaptation. This solves a long-standing problem in evolutionary comparative studies. Only species' specific values can provide information concerning the independent evolution of characters in a set of related species. Therefore, only correlations among specific values for traits may be used as evidence for adaptation in cross-species comparative analyses. The phylogenetic autocorrelation model was applied to a comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight among 44 primate species. In addition to sexual dimorphism in weight, mating system, habitat, diet, and size (weight itself) were included in the analysis. All of the traits, except diet, were substantially influenced by phylogenetic inertia. The comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight indicates that 50% of the variation among primate species is due to phylogeny. Size, or scaling, could account for a total of 36% of the variance, making it almost as important as phylogeny in determining the level of dimorphism displayed by a species. Habitat, mating system, and diet follow, accounting for minor amounts of variation. Thus, in attempting to explain why a particular modern primate species is very dimorphic compared to other primates, we would say first because its ancestor was more dimorphic than average, second because it is a relatively large species, and third because it is terrestrial, polygynous, and folivorous."
26117566,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The present study, taking a resource-oriented approach to mental health, aimed at investigating mental resilience and its determinants among undergraduate physiotherapy students using quantitative and qualitative tools. DESIGN: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey supplemented by 2 focus groups. SETTING: One university in Hungary. PARTICIPANTS: 130 physiotherapy students at years 1, 2, and 3. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sense of coherence, a measure of dynamic self-esteem, as well as social support from family and peers were used to assess mental well-being. A screening instrument for psychological morbidity and perceived stress were used as deficiency-oriented approaches. Student opinions were gathered on positive and negative determinants of mental health. RESULTS: Resilience was lower [mean difference 4.8 (95% CI -3.4; 13.1)], and the occurrence of psychological morbidity (32.5% vs. 0%) was higher among female compared to male students. However, the proportion of students fully supported by their peers was higher among females (63% vs. 37.5%). Female students, unlike their male counterparts, experienced higher stress compared to their peers in the general population. Social support declined as students progressed in their studies though this proved to be the most important protective factor for their mental well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Results were fed back to the course organizers recommending the implementation of an evidence-based method to improve social support as delineated by the Guide to Community Preventive Services of the US the outcomes of which are to be seen in the future."
30253343,0,a,"Montana, a large and rural U.S. state, has a motor vehicle fatality rate almost double the national average. For young adults, the alcohol-related motor vehicle fatality rate in the state is almost three times the national average. Yet little research has explored the underlying reasons that young people in rural areas drink and drive. Drawing from the theory of triadic influence (TTI) and a series of qualitative focus group discussions, the current study examined how aspects of the landscape and culture of rural America promote and hinder drinking and driving among young people. In 2015 and 2016, 72 young adults (36 females) aged 18-25 years old (mean age = 20.2) participated in 11 semi-structured focus groups in 8 rural counties in Montana. Discussions were transcribed, and two reviewers independently coded text segments. Themes were identified and an inductive explanatory model was created. The results demonstrated that aspects of the social context (e.g., peer pressure and parental modeling), rural cultural values (e.g., independence, stoicism, and social cohesion), and the legal and physical environment (e.g., minimal police presence, sparse population, and no alternative transportation) promoted drinking and driving. The results also identified salient protective factors in each of these domains. Our findings demonstrate the importance of examining underlying distal determinants of drinking and driving. Furthermore, they suggest that future research and interventions should consider the complex ways in which cultural values and environmental factors intersect to shape the risky health behaviors of rural populations."
2802928,1,a,"Using a subsample from the Copenhagen schizophrenia high-risk project, we examined the contributions of schizophrenic genetic liability and perinatal complications to computed tomographic (CT) measurements of ventricular enlargement and cortical and cerebellar abnormalities. A factor analysis of six CT measurements yielded two significant factors. One factor reflected multisite neural deficits as evidenced by abnormality of the cerebellar vermis and widening of the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures and cortical sulci. The other factor reflected periventricular damage as evidenced by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Because all of the subjects had schizophrenic mothers, the major source of genetic variation is contributed by the diagnostic status of their fathers. In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, it was determined that the multisite neural deficits factor was significantly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia (as measured by schizophrenia spectrum illness in the subjects' fathers) but was unrelated to pregnancy or delivery complications or to weight at birth. Periventricular damage was highly and significantly correlated with the number of complications suffered at delivery, but only among subjects with an elevated genetic risk. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the two types of CT abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect partially independent processes based on different combinations of genetic and perinatal influences."
3168446,1,a,"In order to disclose differences between users and non-users of oral contraceptives (OC), 620 women aged 15-54 were invited to participate in an in depth interview about sexual, contraceptive, and reproductive life events. Of the 585 women who participated, 459 were consecutive gynecological in- or outpatients, and 126 were selected from visitors in general practice. Data was analysed by multivariate test statistics. After correction for present age and social class, the duration of use of OC (DOC) among women 15-34 years of age correlated negatively to age at menarche and coital debut and positively to number of sexual partners, oral-genital sexual practice, and number of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Among women over 35, DOC was positively associated only to cigarette smoking. No correlation was found to coital frequency (whether earlier, present or during pregnancy or menstruation), number of births and abortions, or to social classification. In epidemiological research on benefits and risks of oral contraceptives, confounding influence of one or more variables is of crucial importance. The present findings point at sexual and life-style habits as potential confounders in the study of OC and associated diseases."
30476092,0,a,"Background: The economic crisis has induced detrimental socio-economic and health effects in Greece. This study aims to measure overall income-related health inequalities and examine their determinants, and to compare the respective within estimates for major subpopulations defined by citizenship (Greece, Albania, other countries) in Greece. Methods: Data for 1332 cases were collected from a cross-sectional observational survey (MIGHEAL) conducted at a national level in 2016. Income-related inequalities in poor subjective health, limiting long-standing illness, elevated depressive symptoms and non-communicable diseases were measured with the standard and Erreygers concentration indices. Decomposition analysis identified key factors explaining the inequalities. Results: Overall, significant inequalities favouring the better-off were established in all ill-health indicators, particularly in depression. Greek citizens were associated with consistent health inequalities, while, concerning the other groups, significant disparities were found only in depression for Albanians. Decomposition analyses identified socio-economic status, income in particular, as the main contributor to overall income-related health inequalities, followed by barriers to healthcare access, adverse family background and hazardous working conditions. Risk behaviours and discrimination were relatively less important, whereas area of residence was mainly reducing inequality. Citizens from Albania and other countries were found to be poorer, but with fewer health problems, hence, different citizenship decreased inequalities. Conclusion: Socio-economic health inequalities in Greece can be mitigated by means of appropriate multi-sectorial policy interventions, by focussing primarily on the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The overall inequality-producing mechanisms and the different health needs of ethnic groups should be taken into account when formulating such policies."
2614820,1,a,"Social and psychological variables are used to explain why young people become cigarette smokers, whereas biological factors have been virtually ignored as possible determinants of that behavior. In this study, salivary testosterone was positively associated with cigarette smoking among 201 subjects 12-14 years of age. This finding suggests that testosterone should be included in future considerations of adolescent cigarette smoking."
26904512,0,a,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections. Main virulence determinants of K. pneumoniae are pili, capsular polysaccharide, lipopolysaccharide, and siderophores. The histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) is a pleiotropic regulator found in several gram-negative pathogens. It has functions both as an architectural component of the nucleoid and as a global regulator of gene expression. We generated a Deltahns mutant and evaluated the role of the H-NS nucleoid protein on the virulence features of K. pneumoniae. A Deltahns mutant down-regulated the mrkA pilin gene and biofilm formation was affected. In contrast, capsule expression was derepressed in the absence of H-NS conferring a hypermucoviscous phenotype. Moreover, H-NS deficiency affected the K. pneumoniae adherence to epithelial cells such as A549 and HeLa cells. In infection experiments using RAW264.7 and THP-1 differentiated macrophages, the Deltahns mutant was less phagocytized than the wild-type strain. This phenotype was likely due to the low adherence to these phagocytic cells. Taken together, our data indicate that H-NS nucleoid protein is a crucial regulator of both T3P and CPS of K. pneumoniae."
2746717,1,a,"The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations."
28054430,0,a,"Over the last decade, the concept of the ""complex patient"" has not only been more widely used in multidisciplinary healthcare teams and across various healthcare disciplines, but it has also become more vacuous in meaning. The uptake of the concept of the ""complex patient"" spans across disciplines, such as medicine, nursing, and social work, with no consistent definition. We review the chronological evolution of this concept and its surrogate terms, namely ""comorbidity,"" ""multimorbidity,"" ""polypathology,"" ""dual diagnosis,"" and ""multiple chronic conditions."" Drawing on key principles of concept clarification, we highlight disciplinary usage in the literature published between 2005 and 2015 in health sciences, attending to overlaps and revealing nuances of the complex patient concept. Finally, we discuss the implications of this concept for practice, research, and theory."
31148748,0,a,"Owing to a shift in social attitudes and human rights standards, health inequities experienced by gender minorities are gaining an increasing spotlight globally. Transgender (trans) is an umbrella term used to describe individuals who have a dissimilar sex, gender identity and/or gender expression than what was designated at birth. Recently, studies have sought to identify health disparities and barriers to care among this population. While oncology-focused research remains limited, the social determinants of trans health elicits a significant impact on transgender people across the cancer continuum and, thus, requires further examination. The purpose of this paper is to explore the issue of trans health inequity in the context of Canadian cancer care highlighting current clinical practice, as well as gaps in research, provider education and health care policy. The paper will conclude with recommendations for policy development and a reflection on the oncology nurse's role in advocating for change."
3701582,1,a,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors."
23911764,0,a,"The protection of catchment areas for drinking water quality has become an increasingly disputed issue in Australia and internationally. This is particularly the case in regard to the growing demand for nature based and rural recreation. Currently the policy for the protection of drinking water in Western Australia is to enforce a 2 km exclusion zone with a much larger surrounding area with limited and prescribed access to recreators. The debate between recreators and water management agencies has been lively, culminating in a recent state government enquiry. This paper describes the second phase of a three phase study to develop a methodology for defensible policy formulation which accounts for the points of view of all stakeholders. We examine general community, active recreators and professionals' views on the current policy of catchment protection and five proposed alternatives using a social judgement theory approach. Key attitudinal determinants of the preferences for policies were identified. Overall the recreators did not support the current policy despite strong support from both the general community and the professional group. Nevertheless, it was evident that there was some support by the community for policies that would enable a slight relaxation of current recreational exclusion. It was also evident that there was a significant proportion of the general community who were dissatisfied with current recreational opportunities and that, in future, it may be less easy to police exclusion zones even if current policy is maintained. The potential for future integration of recreational and water source protection is discussed as well as the benefits of community research in understanding policy preferences in this regard."
2858150,1,a,"The validity of a questionnaire developed to assess negative attitudes towards drug therapy by relatives of schizophrenic patients is examined. The questionnaire items are tested against the statement: ""Patients should not take drugs, they can only be helped by good advice"". The prejudice of relatives of schizophrenics against drug therapy may have an effect on the patients' compliance to maintenance therapy and, subsequently, on their relapse rate. A number of factors, social and psychological, were examined as possible determinants of the negative attitudes of relatives. These factors include age, sex, profession, education, positive family history, and use of drugs among the relatives; mental state, residence, duration of illness, relapse rate and clinical features in the patients. Poor education of relatives correlated to negative attitudes towards drug therapy."
26234965,0,a,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to test the usefulness of social cognitive theory (SCT) in explaining breakfast consumption in a sample of primary male students. METHODS: Participants in this cross-sectional study were 358 male students (3rd, 4th and 5th grades) from eight public primary schools of Ilam city. Data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire based on components of SCT. Bivariate correlations and multiple logistic regression analysis using an Enter method were used to identify social cognitive correlates and determinants of breakfast consumption. RESULTS: A total of 358 participants ranging in age from 8-12 years (M=10.06) were studied. The result of the study showed that the SCT significantly predicted breakfast consumption. SCT variables explained 41.4% of the variance in breakfast consumption behaviors, though, self-regulation was found to be the strongest predictor of breakfast consumption behaviors. There was the strongest correlation between behaviors and self-regulation, (r=0.561; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings support the usefulness of SCT in explaining breakfast consumption behaviors. These results suggest an essential role for self-regulation, self-efficacy and social support in the breakfast consumption behaviors of primary male students."
2927118,1,a,"This article challenges the commonly held beliefs that there are few if any heavy drinkers among Asian-Americans and that different groups of Asians exhibit similar patterns of drinking. To explore these stereotypes, alcohol consumption patterns were compared in a survey of 298 Chinese, 295 Japanese and 280 Koreans in Los Angeles. Heavy drinking was found in each of the Asian groups. Gender specific logistic regression models were used to illustrate the differences in the drinking patterns of the Asian-American groups and to clarify the determinants of drinking. The greatest proportion of heavy drinking was found among the Japanese and the lowest among the Chinese. Having friends who drank was the only social factor consistently related to Asian drinking behavior."
28830654,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the social determinants associated with the overweight or obesity prevalence of 85 elementary schools during the 2010-11 academic year in a predominantly Hispanic school district. METHODS: A binomial logistic regression is used to analyze the aggregate overweight or obesity rate of a school by the percent of Hispanic students in each school, selected school and neighborhood characteristics, and its geographical location. RESULTS: The proportion of Hispanic enrollment more readily explains a school's aggregate overweight or obesity rate than social determinants or spatial location. Number of fast food establishments and the academic ranking of a school appear to slightly impact the aggregate prevalence rate. Spatial location of school is not a significant factor, controlling for other determinants. CONCLUSIONS: An elementary school's overall overweight or obesity rate provides a valuable health indicator to study the social determinants of obesity among Hispanics and other students within a local neighborhood."
22643014,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is limited knowledge as to whether obesity prevention interventions are able to produce change in the determinants hypothesized to precede change in energy balance-related behaviors in young people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multi-component intervention on a wide range of theoretically informed determinants of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB). Moderation effects of gender, weight status and parental education level and whether the perceived intervention dose received influenced the effects were also explored. METHODS: The HEIA study was a 20-month school-based, randomized controlled trial to promote healthy weight development. In total, 1418 11-year-olds participated at baseline and post-intervention assessment. Enjoyment, self-efficacy, perceived social support from parents, teachers and friends related to PA, perceived parental regulation of TV-viewing and computer/game-use and perceived social inclusion at schools were examined by covariance analyses to assess overall effects and moderation by gender, weight status and parental education, mid-way and post-intervention. Covariance analyses were also used to examine the role of intervention dose received on change in the determinants. RESULTS: At mid-way enjoyment (p = .03), perceived social support from teachers (p = .003) and self-efficacy (p = .05) were higher in the intervention group. Weight status moderated the effect on self-efficacy, with a positive effect observed among the normal weight only. At post-intervention results were sustained for social support from teachers (p = .001), while a negative effect was found for self-efficacy (p = .02). Weight status moderated the effect on enjoyment, with reduced enjoyment observed among the overweight. Moderation effects for parental education level were detected for perceived social support from parents and teachers. Finally, positive effects on several determinants were observed among those receiving a high as opposed to a low intervention dose. CONCLUSION: The intervention affected both psychological and social-environmental determinants. Results indicate that social support from teachers might be a potential mediator of PA change, and that overweight adolescents might be in need of specially targeted interventions to avoid reducing their enjoyment of PA. Further studies should continue to assess how intervention effectiveness is influenced by the participants' self-reported dose of intervention received."
20525270,0,a,"BACKGROUND: An important gap exists between research production and its utilization. Few studies have examined the factors affecting knowledge utilization in the field of child and family social services. METHODS: The objectives of the study are to describe knowledge utilization by child protection administrators and practitioners (N = 477) and to compare factors related to knowledge utilization by these two occupational groups. The study was conducted with an adapted version of the Questionnaire sur l'utilisation des connaissances (Knowledge Utilization Questionnaire). Factor analysis was used to collapse data collected on the questionnaire items. Factor score for each respondent served as independent variables in three separate multivariate regression analyses to explore variables likely to predict research-based knowledge utilization. RESULTS: A minority of respondents (18%) report using on a frequent basis research-based knowledge in their practice. Relational capital between researchers and users and perceived usefulness of research based knowledge were the two factors most strongly related to utilization. There was a specificity in the factors associated with knowledge utilization according to occupational groups in child protection organizations. Use of active knowledge transfer strategies was associated with knowledge utilization by practitioners, while knowledge dissemination efforts played a more significant role for administrators. CONCLUSION: These results encourage both the use of strategies differentiated according to users and the intensification of interactions between users and researchers to foster research knowledge utilization."
29251226,0,a,"The theory of fundamental causes is one of the more influential attempts to provide a theoretical infrastructure for the strong associations between indicators of socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation) and health. It maintains that people of higher socioeconomic status have greater access to flexible resources such as money, knowledge, prestige, power, and beneficial social connections that they can use to reduce their risks of morbidity and mortality and minimize the consequences of disease once it occurs. However, several key aspects of the theory remain underspecified, compromising its ability to provide truly compelling explanations for socioeconomic health inequalities. In particular, socioeconomic status is an assembly of indicators that do not necessarily cohere in a straightforward way, the flexible resources that disproportionately accrue to higher status people are not clearly defined, and the distinction between socioeconomic status and resources is ambiguous. I attempt to address these definitional issues by infusing fundamental cause theory with features of a well-known theory of socioeconomic stratification in the sociological literature-Pierre Bourdieu's theory of symbolic power."
6701728,1,a,"This article, which is based on data from the Social Security Administration's 1978 Survey of Survivor Families With Children, examines the continuity of health care coverage held by families headed by widows from the time of the husband's death to the interview. The data are presented by duration of widowhood and kind of coverage the family had before the husband died. Over this period, it was found that new kinds of coverage, such as the widow's job-related health insurance or directly purchased protection, often replaced the former coverage. At the time of the interview, about three-fourths of the families had coverage, including government assistance such as Medicaid. Whether or not the young survivor families had coverage was affected by the widow's current employment status and by family income. Premiums varied by type of policy: those with individual policies paid more (and received less extensive coverage) than did those with group policies. Compared with the general population, the widows and their children were in poorer health, generally used physician services less, and had somewhat higher expenditures for health care."
2785722,1,a,"In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact."
3237851,1,a,"The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2487128,1,a,"This report assesses current knowledge about the ecological determinants of child maltreatment and presents data from an aggregate study of co-variation between seven community characteristics and maltreatment rates. A review of these findings revealed literature in the early stages of development. Nothing is known about the ecology of sexual abuse, and studies of physical abuse and neglect have done little more than demonstrate co-variation between reported incidence and neighborhood population and housing characteristics. Study findings reveal that (a) five of the seven community characteristics are significant and independent correlates of neglect, and four are correlates of abuse; (b) the strongest predictors of both types of maltreatment are percentage of families with income less than 200% of poverty and percent of vacant housing; and (c) the pattern of co-variation between the two economic stress indicators and three inadequate social support indicators are consistent with the ecological hypothesis. Discussion focuses on interpretation of findings and recommendations for future research."
6481664,1,a,"Psychosocial outcome in terms of mental state, health preoccupation, leisure activity, avoidance behaviour, sexual activity and attitude towards life and the future one year after a myocardial infarction (MI) was studied in 177 consecutive male, able-bodied patients below 61 yr of age with a first MI. Questionnaires and a brief interview covered the psychological and social data while the somatic variables were recorded in a standardized medical examination. Emotional distress, self-reported symptoms, avoidance behaviour, overprotection, pessimism and a diminished sexual activity were frequent, indicating a poor adaptation. These disturbances were apparent two months after the MI and remained stable. Psychological factors were stronger determinants of maladjustment than smoking, angina pectoris and recorded somatic illness. Neither severity of the infarction nor social and demographic factors determined maladjustment. Intervention must take place early and be directed to psychological factors as well as to the cardiac condition."
29233722,0,a,"PURPOSE: Health and administrative systems are facing spatial clustering in chronic diseases such as diabetes. This study explores how geographic distribution of diabetes in the United States is associated with socioeconomic and built environment characteristics and health-relevant policies. METHODS: We compiled nationally representative county-level data from multiple data sources. We standardized characteristics to a mean = 0 and a SD = 1 and modeled county-level age-adjusted diagnosed diabetes incidence in 2013 using 2-level hierarchical linear regression. RESULTS: Incidence of age-standardized diagnosed diabetes in 2013 varied across U.S. counties (n = 3109), ranging from 310 to 2190 new cases/100,000, with an average of 856.4/100,000. Socioeconomic and health-related characteristics explained approximately 42% of the variation in diabetes incidence across counties. After accounting for other characteristics, counties with higher unemployment, higher poverty, and longer commutes had higher incidence rates than counties with lower levels. Counties with more exercise opportunities, access to healthy food, and primary care physicians had fewer diabetes cases. CONCLUSIONS: Features of the socioeconomic and built environment were associated with diabetes incidence; identifying the salient modifiable features of counties can inform targeted policies to reduce diabetes incidence."
2638678,1,a,"To identify the individual and household level variables associated with increased risk of mortality, 159 infant and 50 child deaths (cases) and equal number of age matched live infants and children (controls) and their families were studied in a rural area of Haryana. The social, economic, educational and environmental characteristics of the case and control families were similar. Increased risk of infant and child mortality was associated with maternal age less than 20 and more than 30 years, birth order 4th or higher, unclean cord care at the time of child birth, failure of breast feeding during the first 3 months of age, lack of immunizations, and previous infant or child death(s) in the family (Odds ratio greater than 2; P less than 0.05-0.01 by X2 test). An emphasis on the interventions directed at control of the above mentioned variables may prove most helpful in reducing infant and child mortality in a rural area."
3780230,1,a,"Socio-demographic characteristics, general lifestyle habits, reproductive and medical histories were compared of 328 women who had ever used oral contraceptives and 2306 never users from a case-control surveillance conducted in Northern Italy. Oral contraceptive use was positively and strongly related with the level of education and indicators of social class. The rate ratio of ever use (adjusted for age and diagnostic category) was 3.3 for women with 12 years of education or more compared with less than 7 years, and 3.0 for women of highest compared with lowest social class. The frequency of pill use was lower among never married women, and significantly elevated among smokers (rate ratio = 2.4 for heavy smokers). In contrast, no relation was evident between alcohol or coffee consumption and pill use. Likewise, ever users of oral contraceptives were not significantly different from women who had never used the pill with regard to major reproductive factors (parity and age at first pregnancy) or several medical variables of potential interest (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), with the only possible exclusion of obesity which was less frequent among pill users. Thus, this study indicates that the major determinants of the persistently low frequency of oral contraceptive use in this Northern Italian population are social rather than reproductive or medical factors. These findings have important implications for epidemiological research on oral contraceptive and disease in this population, and underline the importance of selection and screening of oral contraceptive users on the basis of knowledge of medical factors and lifestyle habits."
2801277,1,a,"This study investigated the relationships among family environment, demographic measures, the decisions made by unintentionally pregnant adolescents regarding postdelivery plans and the certainty with which these decisions were made. Subjects were 175 pregnant adolescents, ages 14 through 22, who intended to carry their pregnancies to term. Greater uncertainty was associated with living with both natural parents or with mother only. Higher levels of negative affect were related to lower levels of perceived family cohesion, independence, expressiveness, and intellectual-cultural orientation. Age, trimester of pregnancy, and family constellation also were related to levels of negative affect. Discriminant analysis revealed that subjects choosing adoption were more likely to be older and to be white than were those choosing to keep the child. They also tended to perceive higher levels of expressiveness and independence in their families. The implications of these findings for the delivery of services and for future research efforts in this area are discussed."
28554157,0,a,"Most research into the role of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of obesity has taken environment to mean behaviours such as exercise and diet. While interesting, this is somewhat at odds with research into the social determinants of obesity, in which the focus has shifted away from individuals and behaviours to the types of wider obesogenic environments in which individuals live, which influence and produce these behaviours. This study combines these two strands of research by investigating how the genetic influence on body mass index (BMI), used as a proxy for obesity, changes across different neighbourhood environments measured by levels of deprivation. Genetics are incorporated using a classical twin design with data from Twins UK, a longitudinal study of UK twins running since 1992. A multilevel modelling approach is taken to decompose variation between individuals into genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental components. Neighbourhood deprivation is found to be a statistically significant predictor of BMI after conditioning on individual characteristics, and a heritability of 0.75 is estimated for the entire sample. This heritability estimate is shown, however, to be higher in more deprived neighbourhoods and lower in less deprived ones, and this relationship is statistically significant. While this research cannot say anything directly about the mechanisms behind the relationship, it does highlight how the relative importance of genetic factors can vary across different social environments, and therefore the value of considering both genetic and social determinants of health simultaneously."
2916712,1,a,"The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery."
2508814,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that influence blood pressure in children. DESIGN: Cross sectional study of children aged 5.0-7.0 years who had blood pressure measurements and for whom parental questionnaires were completed. SETTING: School based survey. SUBJECTS: 3591 Children aged 5.0-7.5 years selected by stratified random sampling of primary schools in nine British towns (response rate 72%); 3591 were examined and their parental questionnaires were completed. Data were complete for birth rank in 3559, maternal age in 3542, maternal history of hypertension in 3524, and paternal history in 2633. RESULTS: Birth weight was inversely related to mean systolic blood pressure but only when standardised for current weight (weight standardised regression coefficient -1.83 mm Hg/kg (95% confidence interval -1.31 to -2.35). Mean diastolic pressure was similarly related to birth weight. Maternal age, birth rank, and a parental history of hypertension were all related to blood pressure. After standardisation for current weight a 10 year increase in maternal age was associated with a 1.0 mm Hg (0.4 to 1.6) rise in systolic pressure; first born children had systolic blood pressure on average 2.53 mm Hg (0.81 to 4.25) higher than those whose birth rank was greater than or equal to 4; and a maternal history of hypertension was associated with a systolic pressure on average 0.96 mm Hg (0.41 to 1.51) higher than in those with no such history. The effects described were largely independent of one another and of age and social class. The relation for birth rank was, however, closely related to that for family size. CONCLUSIONS: Influences acting in early life may be important determinants of blood pressure in the first decade. The relation between birth weight and blood pressure may reflect the rate of weight gain in infancy. The reasons for the relation with birth rank and maternal age are unknown; if confirmed they imply that delayed motherhood and smaller family size may be associated with higher blood pressure in offspring."
7376236,1,a,"Survey data from women in pregnancy risk in Venezuela and Kenya are used to examine the determinants of contraceptive intention, use, and the intention/use consistency. The five ranking determinants of contraceptive use are: intention to contracept, social support, accessibility, conjugal communication, and desire for additional children. All five determinants have direct and additive effects on contraception, but their relative impacts vary significantly between the two cultures. Contraceptive intention and use are highly consistent, while level of consistency varies significantly between the two samples and within each by various combinations of ranking variables and by parity.

In concentrating on the 'push' factors responsible for gross out-migration over the period 1966-71, the study considers aspects of several dimensions: spatial, economic, social, ethnic and demographic. However, in order to explore the ramifications of interaction between migration and these multifaceted factors, a model is construed which dwells not only on the forces responsible for out-migration, per se, but also on those capable of regulating rural economic structure and agricultural welfare."""
19596423,0,a,"The frequency of health care use is crucial for adolescent well-being and health systems. The present study was the first to test a set of variables in a representative sample of Greek adolescents in order to identify factors that predict health care use and contribute to improving health service planning. Questionnaires were administered to a random sample of adolescents (N=1 194) aged 11-18 years and their parents (N=973) in 2003. Data from 894 participants with full data were analyzed. Parents' education, adolescents' chronic health needs, physical well-being and emotional/behavioural problems as well as parent-child relationship were independent predictors of health care use, although some factors, such as gender, age, type of residence, family affluence, social support and parental health status that previous research identified as predictors were not confirmed. Beyond the need of health care, other factors also play an important role in the utilization of health services by adolescents and their families."
7208724,1,a,"A population of professional dance (N = 183) and modelling (N = 56) students, who by career choice must focus increased attention and control over their body shapes, was studied. Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. The influence of socio-cultural determinants are discussed within the context of anorexia nervosa as a multidetermined disorder."
28780876,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoking has a range of known and predictable adverse outcomes, and across the world sustained smoking reduction campaigns are targeted towards reducing individual and public risk and harm. Conversely, more than 87 million women, mostly in low- and middle-income countries, use smokeless tobacco, yet the research examining the effect of this form of tobacco exposure on women is remarkably scant. In central Australia, the chewing of wild <i>Nicotiana</i> spp., a tobacco plant, commonly known as <i>pituri</i> and <i>mingkulpa</i>, is practised by Aboriginal groups across a broad geographical area. Until recently, there had been no health research conducted on the effects of chewing <i>pituri. METHODS: This article reports on one component of a multidimensional <i>pituri</i> research agenda. A narrative approach utilising the methodology of the Learning Circle was used to interview three key senior central Australian Aboriginal women representative of three large geographical language groupings. The participants were selected by a regional Aboriginal women's organisation. With the assistance of interpreters, a semistructured interview, and specific trigger resources, participants provided responses to enable an understanding of the women's ethnobotanical <i>pituri</i> knowledge and practices around the use of <i>pituri</i> within the context of Aboriginal women's lives. Data were transcribed, and by using a constant comparison analysis, emergent themes were categorised. The draft findings and manuscript were translated into the participants' language and validated by the participants. RESULTS: Three themes around <i>pituri</i> emerged: (a) the plants, preparation and use; (b) individual health and wellbeing; and (c) family and community connectedness. The findings demonstrated similar participant ethnobotanical knowledge and practices across the geographical area. The participants clearly articulated the ethnopharmacological knowledge associated with mixing <i>pituri</i> with wood ash to facilitate the extraction of nicotine from <i>Nicotiana </i>spp., the results of which were biochemically verified. The participants catalogued the pleasurable and desired effects obtained from <i>pituri</i> use, the miscellaneous uses of <i>pituri</i>, as well as the adverse effects of <i>pituri</i> overdose and toxicity, the catalogue of which matched those of nicotine. The participants' overarching <i>pituri</i> theme was related to the inherent role <i>pituri</i> has in the connectiveness of people to family, friends and community. CONCLUSIONS: Central Australian Aboriginal women have a firmly established knowledge and understanding of the pharmacological principles related to the content of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. and the extraction of nicotine from the plant. Widespread use of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. as a chewing tobacco by Aboriginal populations in the southern, central and western desert regions of Australia is attested to by participants who assert that <i>everyone uses it</i>, with girls in these remote areas commencing use between 5 and 7 years of age. Central Australian Aboriginal people who chew <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. do not consider it to be a tobacco plant, and will strongly refute that they are tobacco users. Central Australian Aboriginal people do not consider that the Western health information regarding tobacco (as a smoked product) is applicable or aligned to their use of <i>pituri</i>. <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. users will deny tobacco use at health assessment. There is a requirement to develop and provide health information on a broader range of tobacco and nicotine products in ways that are considered credible by the Aboriginal population. Health messages around <i>pituri</i> use need to account for the dominant role that <i>pituri</i> occupies in the context of central Australian Aboriginal women's lives.<br /> Information for readers: A consultative organisation of Aboriginal women has as a strategic intent and operational agenda the improvement of Aboriginal women's and children's health across the research region. The group seeks opportunities to enhance their knowledge based on legitimate collaborative research; accordingly, they sought to participate in a range of research activities regarding the use of <i>pituri</i> and women's health outcomes. Of particular note, the group's participants chose to be identified by name in the publication of this research activity. In this article, the term 'Aboriginal' has been chosen by the central Australian women to refer to both themselves and the Aboriginal people in their communities; 'Indigenous' has been chosen to refer to the wider Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The term <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. is used when referring to the plants from a Western perspective; <i>pituri</i> is used when referring to the plants, the tobacco quid, and the practice of chewing from a general Aboriginal perspective; and <i>mingkulpa</i> is used when the participants are voicing their specific knowledge and practices."

30946983,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A tremendous number of girls in Yemen are still subjected to female genital cutting (FGC), which carries an increased risk of health complications and violates children's rights. This study describes the prevalence of FGC in four Yemeni provinces and investigates the determinants of FGC. METHODS: We analyzed data from women aged 15 to 49 years who responded to a sub-national household survey conducted in six rural districts of four Yemeni provinces in 2008-2009. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between individual and household socioeconomic factors and FGC practices and attitudes. RESULTS: The prevalence of women's FGC was 48% while daughters' FGC was 34%. Almost 45.8% of the women surveyed believe the FGC practice should discontinue. Higher odds of FGC practice and positive attitude towards it were associated with older age, family marriage, and lower tertiles of wealth and education indices. Early marriage was also associated with increased odds of FGC practice (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic indices and other individual factors associated with FGC are differing and complex. Younger generations of women are more likely to not have FGC and to express negative attitudes towards the tradition. Appropriate strategies to invest in girls' education and women's empowerment with effective engagement of religious and community leaders might support the change of attitudes and practice of FGC in the younger generation."
12340179,1,a,"Using a sociodemographic model of the determinants of illegitimacy rates, a multivariate regression analysis of annual change in age-specific Swedish illegitimacy rates is applied to the 1911-74 period. The proxy measure of change in sexual activity was significant for all age groups. Legitimation rates for out-of-wedlock conceived births were significant for all ages except teenagers, and the final predictor, women's status, was significant for all ages except women 35-44. Explained variance for annual change was highest among ages 20-24 (66%), 25-29 (66%), and 30-34 (63%) and lower among teens (34%) and women 35-44 (47%). These results support earlier research that used a sociodemographic model to explain post-World War II change in cross-national illegitimacy rates among 23 developed countries."
23316387,0,a,"Well-documented health research points to trans people's vulnerability to health inequities that are linked to deeply embedded structural and social determinants of health. Gender and work, as social determinants of health for trans people, both shape and are shaped by multiple factors such as support networks, social environments, income and social status, shelter, and personal health practices. There is a gap in the nursing literature in regards to research on work and health for diverse trans people and a virtual silence on the particular issues of trans-identified health providers. This qualitative study used comparative life history methodology and purposeful sampling to examine links among work, career, and health for transmen who are health providers. Semistructured interviews were completed with four Canadian transmen involved in health care professional and/or practice contexts with diverse professions, age, work, and transitioning experiences. Critical gender analysis showed that unique and gender-related critical events and influences shape continuities and discontinuities in their careerlives. This strength-based approach foregrounds how resilience and growth emerged through participants' articulation with everyday gender dynamics. These findings have implications for nursing research, education, and practice that include an understanding of how trans providers ""do transgender work"" and supporting them in that process."
6634993,1,a,"Previous experimentation led to a suggestion that pituitary-mediated metabolites present in female urine are important determinants of stimulus potency in eliciting 70 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations from adult male mice (Mus musculus). In the present experiment this hypothesis was reexamined, taking into account the prior experience of the male test subjects. Male mice were given social experience with either hypophysectomized females or intact, normal females and were then monitored for ultrasonic vocalizations to chemosensory stimuli from both. Results indicated that males (1) will emit ultrasonic vocalizations to urine from hypophysectomized females and (2) tend to preferentially emit ultrasound to stimuli from the type of female previously encountered during the social experience regimen. It is proposed that the previously reported lack of ultrasound emission by males to chemosignals from hypophysectomized females can be accounted for via straightforward associative learning mechanisms."
6656327,1,a,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension."
3788206,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."

30338603,0,a,"AIM: Working as a nurse, by its nature, causes a high degree of stress. Nurses are exposed to the higher levels of occupational, physical, and mental stresses in critical care units than the nurses in other units of a hospital. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of training for resilience on the intensive care unit nurses' occupational stress and resilience level. METHODS: This study is a quasi-experimental intervention study that was done by recruiting 30 nurses who were selected from critical care units of an educational hospital in Sari City, Iran, through convenience sampling between April 2015 and February 2016. The resilience training was provided in 5 sessions of 90 to 120 minutes. The pretest-posttest approach was used in this study, and the nurses completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Expanded Nursing Stress Scale, before and 2 weeks after the training program. RESULTS: The mean score of the occupational stress of the participants decreased significantly after the intervention (P = .001), and the mean score of resilience increased significantly after the intervention (P = .001). CONCLUSION: The results confirm the effectiveness of resilience training on occupational stress and resilience level of nurses working in the intensive care units."
6285155,1,a,"In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients."
29940906,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Tackling the social determinants of Tuberculosis (TB) through social protection is a key element of the post-2015 End TB Strategy. However, evidence informing policies are still scarce. Mathematical modelling has the potential to contribute to fill this knowledge gap, but existing models are inadequate. The S-PROTECT consortium aimed to develop an innovative mathematical modelling approach to better understand the role of social protection to improve TB care, prevention and control. METHODS: S-PROTECT used a three-steps approach: 1) the development of a conceptual framework; 2) the extraction from this framework of three high-priority mechanistic pathways amenable for modelling; 3) the development of a revised version of a standard TB transmission model able to capture the structure of these pathways. As a test case we used the Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP), the Brazilian conditional cash transfer scheme. RESULTS: Assessing one of these pathways, we estimated that BFP can reduce TB prevalence by 4% by improving households income and thus their nutritional status. When looking at the direct impact via malnutrition (not income mediated) the impact was 33%. This variation was due to limited data availability, uncertainties on data transformation and the pathway approach taken. These results are preliminary and only aim to serve as illustrative example of the methodological challenges encountered in this first modelling attempt, nonetheless they suggest the potential added value of integrating TB standard of care with social protection strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Results are to be confirmed with further analysis. However, by developing a generalizable modelling framework, S-PROTECT proved that the modelling of social protection is complex, but doable and allowed to draw the research road map for the future in this field."
3251009,1,a,"Trends in reported suicide rates were analysed for the ages 5-24 years in 21 selected European countries in 1970-74 and 1980-84. In children the precision of the rates was found to be low though there appeared to be a trend to increased suicide in boys. In adolescent and young adult males, however, there was a definite increase in suicide over the period studied, and this was much more marked than in females, in whom the rates had declined in eight countries. The Belgian situation was investigated in detail. Increases were most pronounced in 20-24 year-old males. Around 1981, about half of youth suicides were committed by firearms and medicaments, and these methods showed the largest increases in risk. The estimated under-reporting error diminished with increasing age and over the past ten years. It was larger in females, but did not bias the trends substantially. On the aggregated level, youth suicide was found most strongly associated with indicators of anomie and social isolation. The relevance of these findings in the search for determinants and for preventive strategies is discussed."
31524189,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Workers engaged in dairy farming are exposed to awkward and poor postures that may result in work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). OBJECTIVE: This study carried out ergonomic interventions in order to eliminate and reduce awkward postures in dairy farming. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study applied rapid entire body assessments (REBA) to evaluate the risks associated with each posture while performing the assigned tasks on a dairy farm in Iran to identify high and very high-risk tasks. A participatory ergonomics model was used that incorporated suggestions by dairy workers to design the used interventions. RESULTS: In the first intervention, by using an automatic transmission system for pouring milk, one high and one very high-risk task- pouring milk into a bucket and pouring milk from a bucket into a tank, respectively- were eliminated. In the second intervention, two high-risk tasks- filling corn containers and pouring corn into the milling machine- were eliminated by using a material conveying vacuum pump to transfer corn from the ground to the opening of the milling machine. In the third intervention, a simple and cheap holding device for the bag was designed to reduce the posture risk score from very high to medium. The fourth intervention involved the use of a shovel with a handle appropriate to the anthropometric characteristics of the workers that reduced the posture risk from very high to medium. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that applying participatory ergonomic principles along with low cost and simple designs with high performance resulted in significant reductions in postural risks pertaining to of musculoskeletal disorders on Iran dairy farms."
7155014,1,a,"Schizophrenia is a human behavioral variant with a 1% phenotypic population frequency. As the major ""mental illness"" affecting human beings, it has defied all previous attempts to explain, predict or prevent its devastating clinical manifestations. In addition to unidentified nongenetic determinants, schizophrenia has genetic determinants in the absence of known specific neuropathological or biochemical correlates found in other entities conceptualized as genetic diseases. The fitness of schizophrenics is 0.7 of nonschizophrenics, and a 1% phenotypic population frequency is difficult to explain by mutation rate alone. An ethological theory of schizophrenia has been developed in which the genetic determinant is the nocturnal character of a postulated polymorphic trait termed when active. The nongenetic determinant is simply a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light. According to the author's theory, a schizophrenic individual could be processing information while awake and exposed to light with a brain that is processing information as though he were asleep. The empirical data from which the theory is constructed are presented. THe theory is capable of explaining clinical schizophrenia within an ethological paradigm and makes several predictions, the most significant of which is that the absence of a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light should ameliorate the major symptoms of clinical schizophrenia in individuals who possess its genetic determinant."
24596868,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Elimination of suicide attempts is impossible, but they can be reduced dramatically by an organized planning. The present study aimed to survey the suicide trends in Fars province (Iran), during 2004-2009 to better understand the prevalence and status of suicide. METHODS: This survey was a cross-sectional study. The demographic data were collected from the civil status registry between 2004 and 2009. Suicide and suicide attempt data were collected of three sources including the affiliated hospitals of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, mortality data of Vice Chancellery of Health in Fars province and data from forensic medicine. Then, they were analyzed by Excel and SPSS. Chi-square and regression analyses were used for data analysis. RESULTS: During the study, 10671 people attempted suicide, of which 5697 (53%) were women and 4974 (47%) were men. Among them, 1047 people (9.8%) died, of which 363 (34%) were women and 679 (64%) were men. There was a significant relationship between gender and fatal suicide. The mean suicide attempt for both genders was 53 per 100,000 and 49, 57 for men and women, respectively. The trends in the incidence of Suicidal attempts were decreasing. CONCLUSION: Without implementing effective preventive measures, the health care system in Iran will face a further burden of fatal suicides among young people. Therefore; enhancing the primary health care and specialized mental health services for those with unsuccessful suicide attempts can effectively reduce the burden of suicide."
6644542,1,a,"Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition."
2705972,1,a,This paper discusses the basic directions of research carried out in Poland during the years 1981-86 within the Polish Academy of Science project 06.7. The subject matter concerns: individual and situational determinants of human functioning in stress conditions; functioning of a human in extreme conditions; and load imposition through activities requiring risk-taking decisions.
7100991,1,a,"Five hypothesis regarding the social psychological determinants of patient satisfaction were tested among patients attending the primary care clinics of a university medical center in Manhatten. The social psychological variables operationalized here were expectations, values, entitlement and perceived occurrences; the three dimensions of satisfaction studied were doctor conduct, convenience and general satisfaction. The social psychological variables together were found to explain only a small proportion of the variance in satisfaction, although their contribution varied with the dimension of satisfaction. Expectations consistantly explained most of the variance in satisfaction ratings; particularly noteworthy was the direct effect of prior expectations of the doctor's conduct on subsequent satisfaction with that dimension of the care received. Values had little independent effect on satisfaction, and the combination of values and expectations (their interaction) was unrelated to satisfaction. Feelings of entitlement were also unrelated to satisfaction ratings. There was some support for the discrepancy model, which holds that the greater the discrepancy between perceived occurrences and prior expectations the less the satisfaction. The importance of carrying out further methodological studies aimed at developing reliable measures of these constructs is stressed."
2916712,1,a,"The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery."
30379294,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of receipt of pensions and associated factors in a nationally representative sample of the Brazilian population aged 50 years and over. METHODS: We used data from 9,130 participants from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) baseline survey. The outcome variable was receipt of pensions from any source. The exploratory variables were age, gender, residence by region and by urban/rural area, household arrangements, schooling, household assets, perception of income sufficiency, age when started working, number of chronic diseases, and functional limitation. The analyses were based on the Poisson and binary logistic regressions. RESULTS: The prevalence of the receipt of pension was 54.3%. In the multivariate analysis, the following factors showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) associations with the outcome: age [Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 2.59 and 3.24 for 60-69 and 70 years], rural residence (PR = 1.23 ), residence in the Northeast, South and Southeast compared to the North (PR ranging from 1.18 to 1.23), living arrangements (PR = 1.07 and 1.15 for living with one person and living alone), perception of income sufficiency (PR = 1.08 and 1.15 for sometimes and always), functional limitation (PR = 1.13) and having 1 and >/= 2 chronic diseases (PR = 1,09 and 1,17). Negative association was observed for 5-8 years of education. No association between age when the individual started working and the outcome was observed. Younger participants (50-59 years old) with >/= 2 diseases or functional limitation were 31% and 63% more likely to receive pensions, respectively; the strength of these associations declined with age. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that health conditions are important determinants of early retirement. Discussions to increase age to the retirement cannot be separated from those on improvements in the health conditions of the Brazilian population."
3563565,1,a,"Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed."
25838552,0,a,"This study investigated sun protective behavior during snow sports and its psychosocial determinants. A longitudinal study was conducted among 418 Dutch adults who planned to go on a ski holiday. Participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire before and after their ski trip. In the baseline questionnaire several psychosocial factors were measured (i.e. knowledge, risk perception, worry, attitude, social influence, self-efficacy and intention). At follow-up, sunscreen use and frequency of sunburns were measured. The results showed that, despite their generally high intention, a substantial part of the respondents (40%) did not use sunscreen adequately during their ski holiday. Furthermore, one-fourth of the respondents reported at least one sunburn during their ski holiday. Men and younger respondents used sunscreen less frequently and were sunburnt more often. Sunscreen use was predicted by a positive attitude, high self-efficacy levels, high intention, high knowledge and high perceived risk. The background and psychosocial variables explained 32% of the total variance of sunscreen use. Suggestions for future research and interventions are discussed."
24079366,0,a,"PURPOSE: There has been a lack of comprehensive reviews targeting specific aspects of functioning and the difficulties faced by persons with alcohol dependence. The aim of the present review was to systematically compile the existing literature on activity limitations and participation restrictions as defined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in the context of alcohol dependence. METHODS: A database search (MEDLINE and PsychINFO) was performed for studies published in English (2005-2012), examining the activity limitations and participation restrictions in alcohol dependence. Using a standardised protocol, information about the studies' characteristics and data on activity limitations and participation restrictions, their evolution, onset, determinants and associations with other variables were extracted from the studies under review. RESULTS: A total of 211 difficulties in activities and participation in persons with alcohol dependence were extracted from 125 papers. The spectrum of studies was wide, and their overall quality was good. A common reason for the exclusion of studies was an inconclusive definition of alcohol dependence. Issues with interpersonal interactions, economic and professional life, dealing with aggression and legal problems were the most frequently reported difficulties. Problems with high-risk behaviours and in seeking appropriate treatment were also common. The most frequent determinants of the onset and evolution of the identified difficulties were factors pertaining to the course of alcohol dependence. These difficulties were rarely the studies' focus; therefore, the data on their underlying causes and courses were limited. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that alcohol dependence profoundly affects the family and social network of the afflicted person. The treatment of alcohol dependence can contribute to the alleviation of these associated difficulties. The ICF offers a new perspective on evaluating the wide range of difficulties encountered in the context of alcohol dependence. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Alcohol dependence profoundly affects the family and social network of the afflicted person. The most frequent difficulties in activities and participation have to do with interpersonal interactions, economic and work life, dealing with aggression and legal problems. Problems with high-risk behaviours and in seeking appropriate treatment are also common. Treatment targeted at reduction or cessation of alcohol use is effective in reducing these psychosocial difficulties. The ICF offers a structure for systematic evaluation of the wide range of difficulties encountered in alcohol dependence."
30706792,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The present study examined the efficacy of the walking program on biochemical parameters among the elderly women. METHODS: A total of one hundred elderly women participated in this randomized clinical trial study. The intervention group attended a 24-week walking exercise meeting five times per week. The control group continued with their routine activities. The subjects were assessed in Fasting blood glucose (FBS) and lipid profile before and after 12 and 24 weeks of the program. RESULTS: The mean age of the elderly participants in the study was 68.33 +/- 4.55 years. The results of repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant difference between the intervention and the control group in FBS, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after completing the program (for all p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The low-cost physical activity intervention could be effective for reducing chronic vascular disease risk factors among community-dwelling elderly women."
2928145,1,a,"Reward allocation in selected American universities was investigated using tenure receipt as the most valuable faculty reward. Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review."
7282978,1,a,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology."
2692802,1,a,"Our emphasis in the past has been on disease prevention rather than health promotion. This emphasis served us reasonably well when morbidity was high throughout society and when interventions at the community level were able to achieve massive reductions. It is not faring as well now that the major shared environmental determinants of disease have been controlled. The present situation calls for changes in individual health-related behaviour and individual clinical interventions to achieve comparable progress. As difficult to win as collective commitments to community-level interventions have been, compliance in a free society by often unmotivated persons in numerous individual instances of decision making in daily life is even more difficult. Health promotion offers the promise of a quantum leap in improving the health status of the community by participating in behaviour perceived as not only responsible but appropriate and desirable, providing positive reinforcement rather than anxiety-provoking caution. Favourable social trends, such as physical conditioning and dietary changes may be encouraged through media interventions. There are biological limitations to this approach, however. Many healthful practices confer little benefit on large groups of people and a few may be harmful to selected groups. Vigorous promotion of weight reduction and obesity control, for example, may lead to profound dissatisfaction with body image and to severely self-destructive behaviour among those prone to eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive eating. Health promotion activities may fit well with social trends but their adverse potential can be aggravated because failure to comply can be penalized by peer disapproval in a way that disease prevention strategies usually are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
29439740,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Inequality in life expectancy (ILE) is defined as inequality in the distribution of expected span of life-based on data from survival tables estimated using the Atkinson inequality index. ILE can be influenced by socio-ecological indicators including the Gini coefficient, secondary education, output per worker, and old age pension. This study examined the effects on ILE from a social ecology perspective. METHODS: This analysis is based on ILE data from 108 countries obtained from the United Nations Development Programme. Data on socio-ecological indicators were obtained from the United Nations database. The associations between socio-ecological indicators and ILE were assessed using correlation coefficients and multiple regression models. RESULTS: Significant correlations were evident between ILE and the following indicators from a socio-ecological perspective: Gini coefficient (GC: r = 0.335, p = 0.001) as an indicator of income inequality, female population with at least some secondary education (FSE: r = - 0.757, p = 0.001), male population with at least some secondary education (MSE: r = - 0.741, p = 0.001), output per worker as a measure of labor productivity (OPW: r = - 0.714, p = 0.001), and number of old age pension recipients (OPR: r = - 0.641, p = 0.001). In multivariate regression, the ILE predictors were higher GC and lower levels of FSE, MSE, OPW, and OPR (R(2) = 0.648, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Socio-ecological factors have an important effect on ILE. Policies that address ILE should consider targeted socio-ecological factors, such as the Gini coefficient of income inequality, that give a personal perspective of economic deprivation, attainment of at least a secondary education by both females and males that gives a social environment perspective, output per worker that indicates labor productivity, and the number of old age pension recipients that indicates social security from a public policy perspective."
23101733,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Korean immigrants have been identified as one of the most disadvantaged ethnic groups in terms of health insurance coverage and health care access in the U.S.A. Korean immigrants enjoyed access to primary and preventive care services in their home country. This study explores how Korean immigrants' health-seeking behaviors are reconstructed by contextualizing their health care experience and adaptation process in Hawaii. DESIGN: Face-to-face individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 recently arrived Korean immigrant adults in Hawaii, who were selected by a purposive sampling method. RESULTS: A diminution of seeking professional health care services after immigration was the prominent change in their health care behaviors. They delayed seeking primary care, underused preventive care, extended self-diagnosis and self-treatment, and practiced more treatment- and emergency-oriented care. New immigrants also adopted ethnic enclave health care and transnational health care as alternative strategies to meet their health care needs given the structural and cultural constraints. Sociocultural contexts of both home and host countries shaped the behavioral changes and adoption of alternative health care strategies, interplaying with an individual's characteristics. Lack of health insurance and unfamiliarity with the health care system were the most important factors in the decision whether to and when to seek professional health care, while the lack of English proficiency and cultural concerns were the major determinants of where to get health care. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that efforts should be concentrated to minimize structural barriers to health insurance and to improve health care access through policy interventions. Ethnic networks and ethnic media could be used as an effective informational reservoir for introducing various health care resources, disseminating information, and navigating new immigrants to the health system and services. Utilizing ethnic health care facilities and professionals would foster the promotion of immigrant health care without language and cultural challenges."
7145506,1,a,"The relationship between levels of moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care was investigated in a sample of 452 pediatricians. Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed. Institutional type accounted for 43% of the variation in mean activism scores whereas moral reasoning accounted for only 4%; however, because one could, a priori, expect institutional norms and customs to be powerful determinants of behavior, any additional, identifiable influence deserves attention. The structure of individuals' moral reasoning seems to be such an influence."
28466762,1,a,"Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces."
31968900,1,a,"Reproductive success in many mammals depends on synchrony between copulation and ovulation, which is insured by the phenomenon of heat in the female. Certain anthropoid primates including rhesus monkeys do not show heat but may copulate throughout the menstrual cycle, especially when pairs are isolated from conspecifics. In social groups, however, mating mostly occurs around midcycle. We wished to test the hypothesis that copulations are more closely linked to ovulation when males have simultaneous access to several females in different cycle phases. Artificial menstrual cycles were therefore induced by giving hormones to ovariectomized female rhesus monkeys observed in small social groups that each consisted of four females and one male. The cycles of two hormone-treated femlab in each group were either made to synchronize or be offset by 7-day increments so that the estradiol peak of one female occurred 7 days before, and 7 and 14 days after, the estradiol peak of the other. Radioimmunoassay of plasma samples (N = 224) confirmed the timing of the estradiol peaks. Results from eight unique male-female groups (4 males, 8 females, 16 male-female pairs, 718 tests) fully supported the hypothesis. Compared with synchronized cycles, the amplitudes of rhythmic changes in offset cycles were reduced for ejaculations made by males but greatly enhanced for ejaculations received by females. We propose that this socio-hormonal integration of behavior in the group is highly adaptive and enhances the reproductive success of both males and females."
3182366,1,a,"A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers."
3494378,1,a,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy."
30077153,0,a,"This study reports on the chemical composition of rainwater collected at three ground sites with varying degrees of pollution in Ahvaz, Iran, between January 2014 and February 2015. A total of 24 rainwater samples were analyzed for pH and concentrations of trace elements (Fe, Al, Pb, and Cd) and major ions (Na(+), NH4(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), HCO3(-), NO3(-), Cl(-) and SO4(2-)). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify sources of the measured species. The equivalent concentration of the components followed the order of Ca(2+) > SO4(2-) > HCO3(-) > NH4(+) > Cl(-) > Na(+) > NO3(-) > Mg(2+). The average pH of the rainwater samples was 6, and only three events exhibited acidic conditions below a pH of 5.6. The lowest and the highest average pH values were observed in the high traffic area (5.96) and industrial area (6.54), respectively. The highest and lowest Ca(2+) levels were observed in the industrial and high traffic areas, respectively. Na(+), Mg(2+), and SO4(2-) exhibited their highest and lowest concentrations in the industrial and high traffic areas, respectively. 70.36% of the total variance was due to anthropogenic species (Ca(2+), SO4(2-), Mg(2+), NO3(-), Cl(-)), soil particles (Cl(-), Na(+), and HCO3(-)), and biomass burning (NH4(+), pH). The results of this study show that local anthropogenic sources and Middle Eastern Dust (MED) storms affect the rainwater chemistry strongly, which the latter stems from the Arabian Peninsula, Kuwait, Iraq, and some parts of Iran."
30075782,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In Sweden asylum seekers are offered a voluntary health examination, free-of-charge (HE). The HE coverage is low. The organization and implementation of the HE involves collaboration between different agencies with different roles within the provision of health information and service. This study aimed to assess their perspectives on the barriers and facilitators regarding implementation of the HE, as well as on the purpose, content and value of the HE. METHOD: Thematic analysis of focus groups, individual and group interviews conducted between 2016 and 17 with 41 participants from various authorities and healthcare professionals involved in the delivery of HE in Stockholm. RESULTS: Suggestions were taken from interviewees of how to facilitate the uptake and delivery of HE through improved outreach to the target group with better collaboration, coordination and continuity between authorities. Apart from control of specific communicable diseases, the perceived ultimate goal of HE varied and was often vaguely formulated. Respondents desired better monitoring to assess the effects of HE and predict needs among asylum seekers. This included standardized procedures to promote equitable health care access and more explicit inclusion of mental health and other health dimensions in the HE. CONCLUSION: There are several possible avenues for improving HE coverage and uptake. However, ambiguity exists concerning the benefits of such efforts given the uncertainty of the value of HE. Lack of available data on health status, determinants of health and impact of HE among asylum seekers emerged as barriers preventing optimal approaches for the assessment of health needs. Implementation of standardized guidelines, procedures and documentation would aid the understanding. A more holistic approach beyond infectious diseases is necessary. This would only be useful if there is value in screening for such conditions. More research is required to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HE and related screening policies in Sweden."
27933235,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Thailand's Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) has improved healthcare access and utilization since its initial introduction in 2002. However, a substantial proportion of beneficiaries has utilized care outside the UCS boundaries. Because low utilization may be an indication of a policy gap between people's health needs and the services available to them, we investigated the patterns of health-seeking behavior and their social/contextual determinants among UCS beneficiaries in the year 2013. RESULTS: The study findings from the outpatient analysis showed that the use of designated facilities for care was significantly higher in low-income, unemployed, and chronic status groups. The findings from the inpatient analysis showed that the use of designated facilities for care was significantly higher in the low-income, older, and female groups. Particularly, for the low-income group, we found that they (1) had greater health care needs, (2) received a larger number of services from designated facilities, and (3) paid the least for both inpatient and outpatient services. CONCLUSIONS: This pro-poor impact indicated that the UCS could adequately respond to beneficiaries' needs in terms of vertical equity. However, we also found that a considerable proportion of beneficiaries utilized out-of-network services, which implied a lack of universal access to policy services from a horizontal equity point of view. Thus, the policy should continue expanding and diversifying its service benefits to strengthen horizontal equity. Particularly, private sector involvement for those who are employed as well as the increased unmet health needs of those in rural areas may be important policy priorities for that. Lastly, methodological issues such as severity adjustment and a detailed categorization of health-seeking behaviors need to be further considered for a better understanding of the policy impact."
26190561,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Various studies have found that direct support professionals (DSPs) play an important role in determining the degree to which people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are included in society. However, less research has been conducted on the psychological processes that may influence the behavioural intentions of DSPs to actually engage with and invest effort in supporting their clients' inclusion. Five possible psychological variables are identified in the literature: attitudes, social norms, experienced competencies, identity and meta-evaluation. In our research, we tested whether these processes influence the (intended) efforts DSPs make to facilitate their clients' inclusion. METHOD: A structured questionnaire was sent to 927 DSPs working in one of three different locations (an ordinary non-segregated setting, a reversed non-segregated setting and a residential facility). Of these, 336 DSPs completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Several variables revealed differences between the three locations, specifically in efforts to facilitate inclusion, attitudes, social norms, experienced competencies and professional identity. Looking at the overall means, we found (relatively) high scores for the experienced competencies, role identity and meta-evaluation. In contrast, the means were relatively negative regarding the DSPs' attitudes to inclusion and their assumed social norms. CONCLUSIONS: Direct support professionals' efforts to facilitate inclusion depend on their attitude towards inclusion, the experienced competencies, their role identity, the DSPs' meta-evaluation and, indirectly through attitudes, also on the assumed social norms of the relevant stakeholders. Organizations responsible for supporting people with ID and which may want their DSPs to make greater efforts to facilitate inclusion should pay attention to these psychological variables."
30552038,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The association between socioeconomic status (SES) and outcome after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is largely unknown. This study aimed to determine the influence of SES on postoperative survival after AAA repair. METHODS: Patients undergoing surgical treatment of AAA at a tertiary referral center between January 1993 and July 2013 were retrospectively collected. Thirty-day postoperative mortality and long-term mortality were documented through medical record review and the Michigan Social Security Death Index. SES was quantified using the neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), which is a standardized and reproducible index used in research that summarizes eight domains of socioeconomic deprivation and is based on census tracts derived from patients' individual addresses. The association between SES and survival was studied by univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 767 patients were included. The mean age was 73 years; 80% were male, 77% were white, and 20% were African American. There was no difference in SES of patients who underwent open vs endovascular repair of AAA (P = .489). The average NDI was -0.18 (minimum, -1.47; maximum, 2.35). After adjusting for the variables that were significant on univariable analysis (age, medical comorbidities, length of stay, and year of surgery), the association between NDI and long-term mortality was significant (P = .021; hazard ratio, 1.21 [1.05-1.37]). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term mortality after AAA repair is associated with SES. Further studies are required to assess which risk factors (behavioral, psychosocial) are responsible for this decreased long-term survival in low SES patients after AAA repair."
29580610,0,a,"Mental health has been included in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. However, uncertainty exists about the extent to which the major social determinants of mental disorders are addressed by these goals. The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the social determinants of mental disorders that is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, to use this framework to systematically review evidence regarding these social determinants, and to identify potential mechanisms and targets for interventions. We did a systematic review of reviews using a conceptual framework comprising demographic, economic, neighbourhood, environmental events, and social and culture domains. We included 289 articles in the final Review. This study sheds new light on how the Sustainable Development Goals are relevant for addressing the social determinants of mental disorders, and how these goals could be optimised to prevent mental disorders."
24578832,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Disability is more based on social, rather than medical aspects. Lack of attention and social support may impact on participation of people with physical disability in various aspects and their return to normal life in the society. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine perceived social support and related factors among physically disabled in the city of Tehran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study by using simple random sampling was conducted on 136 people with physically disabled who were covered by Welfare Organization of Tehran. The Norbeck social support questionnaire was used .Multiple linear regression analysis with the backward method was used to identify the adjusted association between perceived social support as dependent variable and demographic variables as independent variables. RESULTS: The present sample comprised of 68 (50%) male and 68 (50%) female with the mean age of 33 (SD = 8.9) years. Based on the results, mean of functional support was 135. 57 (SD = 98.77) and mean of structural support was 77.37 (SD = 52.37). Regression analysis model, demonstrates that variables of age and marital status remained in the model as significant predictors of functional support (P = 0.003, P = 0.004, respectively) and structural support (P = 0.002, P = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, participants in the study didn't have favorable status with respect to perceived social support (in all dimensions) from their social network members. While, social support as one of the social determinants of health, plays an important role in improving psychological conditions in people's lives; therefore, being aware of social support and designing effective interventions to improve it for the disabled is very important."
2650741,1,a,"Perinatal mortality in Belgium remains high compared with other countries of Western Europe, although a marked decrease was observed during the period from 1956 to 1984. Analysis of the death causes indicates that further progress is feasible. Social inequalities and geographic variation are persisting in spite of the long-established policy of social welfare and free access to health services. Most of the studies on perinatal mortality in Belgium are descriptive and based on data recorded in birth and infant death certificates. In the future, alternative sources of information should be used to analyze more precisely and to understand more clearly the interactions between the different determinants of perinatal mortality and to evaluate the impact of social and health services."
30031657,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyse the factors associated with the use of health services (emergency departments, admissions and primary care) in women survivors of breast cancer diagnosed or treated in four university hospitals of Barcelona (Spain) between 2003 and 2013, within the framework of the Cohort DAMA project. METHOD: Descriptive design nested in a mixed cohort (Cohort Dama). We obtained sociodemographic information and information on the use of health services through a questionnaire, and on the tumour from the clinical history. Logistic regression models were performed, calculating the odds ratio of the use of health services (emergency departments, hospital admissions and primary care) raw and adjusted (aOR) by diagnostic method, the characteristics of the tumour and of the women and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The presence of chronic diseases was associated with greater use of the three levels of care. A disadvantaged economic level increases the risk of use of emergency departments and primary care but not of hospital admissions, while a higher tumour stage is associated with a greater risk of admission. By age, those under 50 had a higher risk of using emergency departments and admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with the use of health services differ according to the level of care (aOR: 3.53 emergency departments, 1.67 admissions, 3.89 primary care) and treatment-derived complications (aOR: 1.35 emergency departments, 1.43 primary care). The presence of chronic disorders, younger age, disadvantaged social class, increases the risk of using services more than the tumour stage and treatment-derived complications. Neither the diagnostic method nor the survival time, nor the use of non-conventional therapies influence this."
28582810,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of lactobacillus supplementation on trends of breast milk antioxidant parameters. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: In an interventional study, 50 lactating women were randomly allocated to receive a daily supplement of lactobacillus (n=25) or a placebo (n=25) for 60 days. Daily dietary intake, anthropometric measures and breast milk antioxidant parameters were determined at the onset, and days 30 and 60 of the study. Repeated-measures ANOVA were performed to assess the change over time in the anthropometric and biochemical parameters between the two groups. The main effect of treatment was compared by using Bonferroni's procedure for CI adjustment. The significance level was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in breast milk total antioxidant capacity (TAC) between onset of study and day 30 (p=0.01) and day 60 (p=0.001) after lactobacillus supplementation; however, breast milk TAC level did not change significantly between days 30 and 60 (p=0.7). In the placebo group, breast milk TAC levels decreased significantly after 60 days (p=0.001). Breast milk malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased progressively during the study in the lactobacillus group (p=0.001); however, there was a significant increase in MDA with time in breast milk samples in the placebo group (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, lactobacillus supplementation for 60 days could significantly increase breast milk TAC and decrease breast milk MDA levels, compared with baseline; however, further studies are needed to confirm these results."
28192754,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the self-rated health trajectories of the Korean older population and revealed life-course factors that affect the trajectories over the life course. METHODS: Around 1000 older adults were randomly allocated by stratified multi-stage sampling based on the population census, and underwent face-to-face interviews. Self-rated health status, socioeconomic variables over the life course, and demographic variables were included in the analysis. A group-based trajectory model was used to investigate the association between self-rated health and explanatory variables. RESULTS: The enrolled men and women were divided into three groups by trajectory analysis, which showed marked differences in self-rated health trajectories from childhood to senescence. Among older men, those who experienced skipping meals in childhood and those with chronic disease conditions were more likely to be in the lower trajectory groups. Compared to the older men, the likelihood of being in the lower trajectory groups in older women was increased by experience of skipping meals, lower household income, housekeeping labor, receiving Basic Livelihood Security and chronic disease conditions. CONCLUSION: Various self-rated health trajectories of the Korean older population were identified, and differed according to socioeconomic variables during their life course. Therefore, socioeconomic variables during the life course should be monitored, and health policies directed at the elderly should focus on initial health status from the perspective of a life-course approach."
3874527,1,a,"Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values."
21644184,0,a,"This was an exploratory pilot study forming part of a programme of work to develop and trial an effective web-based intervention to reduce the risk of transmission of respiratory infections by promoting hand washing and other preventive behaviours in pandemic and non-pandemic contexts. The main purpose of this study was to confirm that the behavioural determinants we had identified from theory were related as predicted to intentions and to establish the validity of our measures of behavioural intentions. Participants (N = 84) completed a self-report web-delivered questionnaire measuring intentions to engage in hand washing and the hypothesised behavioural determinants of intentions, based on the theory of planned behaviour and protection motivation theory. In a factorial 2 x 2 design, half of the participants were first randomised to receive messages about potential negative consequences of pandemic flu (the ""high-threat"" condition) and half were assigned to receive ""coping"" messages describing the rationale and effectiveness of hand washing for reducing the risk of infection. A substantial proportion of variance in intentions was explained by measures of attitudes (instrumental and affective), social norms (descriptive and injunctive), perceived behavioural control (especially, access to hand gel) and perceived risk (in particular, the likelihood of catching pandemic flu). Our measures of intentions were sensitive to between-group differences, and although our design did not permit causal inference (particularly in view of selective dropout among those required to read most web pages), the pattern of differences was in the expected direction, that is, hand-washing intentions tended to be stronger in those receiving the high-threat message and coping messages. This study provided encouraging confirmation that our intervention development was proceeding correctly. Measures of intentions proved sensitive to group differences, and the behavioural determinants included in the study explained a substantial proportion of the variance in intentions. The study also provided useful indications that our high-threat message might increase hand-washing intentions, that providing hand gel might be beneficial and that it would be necessary to actively manage the risk of selective dropout in the intervention group."
2709190,1,a,"A longitudinal study of rural-urban migration from a low blood pressure community was completed in 1985. It is suggested that the rapid increase in blood pressure observed with acculturation in this study constitutes a new dynamic model for the early phase of human essential hypertension. Analysis of data derived from this study indicates that increases in dietary sodium, weight gain and sympathetic tone (possibly reflecting acute environmental stress) are important determinants of the early blood pressure rise. It is proposed that a defence reaction occurs in response to environmental stress which maintains or increases cardiorenal sympathetic outflow, thereby overriding the negative feedback inhibition of sympathetic activity which otherwise occurs when dietary sodium is suddenly increased. The antinatriuretic response results in an early volume-dependent rise in blood pressure. We also propose that variation in individual blood pressure responses to migration may be explained not only by quantum differences in the two environmental factors, but also by a genetically-determined failure of adaptation to the combined effects of these stimuli on renal tubular reabsorption of sodium."
30515652,0,a,"Achieving health equity requires addressing social determinants of health. Promoting health equity as it relates to cancer control is one of six priorities of the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP). This article describes recent activities implemented by three NCCCP awardees (North-west Portland Area Indian Health Board, Kansas, Michigan) and the CDC-funded National Behavior Health Network (NBHN), whose aim is to reduce health disparities among those with mental health and/or substance disorders. North-west Portland administered tribal surveys to help better understand tribal cancer-related risk factors, health behaviors, provide baseline data to support their cancer plan, and obtain resources for targeted interventions. Kansas established a health equity workgroup with a vision of addressing health equity through implementation and uptake of activities among all Kansans. Michigan provided trainings in health equity and social justice and developed health equity learning labs. As a result of the successful implementation of the NBHN's Community of Practice, individuals currently living with mental illness and/or substance disorders have had increased access to tobacco cessation and other cancer support services. These efforts and key opportunities for public health practitioners and their partners to increase engagement in cancer health equity are summarized in this article."
26688688,0,a,"Background. Healthcare system has needed to provide spiritual services, and one of the reasons for not addressing spirituality in this field is lack of training in this area. This study purpose is to explore and identify main requirements for designing this education, in Iran. Materials and Methods. This is a qualitative study with conventional content analysis method. 18 participants, who were main stakeholders in spirituality, medical education, and curriculum development, were selected by purposive sampling. Data were collected using semistructured interviews, which continued until data saturation. Results. Three main themes and their categories were extracted from analysis of data. The themes are (1) educational needs including clinical practice needs; (2) opportunities including rich background and backup, perceived clinical need, and right context of medical education for change; and (3) challenges including challenges in academic planning and barriers to implementation. Conclusion. All stakeholders acknowledged the need for addressing spirituality in formal medical education. It seems that implementation of such programs requires attention to facilitating factors and challenges proposed by those involved."

Our findings identify new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation with potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future."
31276017,0,a,"As individuals age, they witness a decline in physical health and functional capacities. The presence of one or more chronic illnesses challenges their quality of life and general well-being, thus, impacting their abilities to function physically, psychologically, and socially. We investigated reports of general well-being in older Black males with chronic illness(es) in a study of N = 145 participants, aged 35 to 63, and identified as Black/African American male. Participants responded to items assessing general well-being; ethnic identity; self-esteem; active coping; the presence of chronic illness(es); and additional demographic, social and ecological characteristics. Analyses of responses indicated that marital status (beta = -.17, p < .05), ethnic identity (beta = -.34, p = .00), self-esteem (beta = .22, p = .03) are significant determinants of general well-being in Black males with chronic illness(es). Data further showed active coping (beta = -.41 p = .09) to be negatively correlated with well-being. We discuss the implications of results for the understanding of health outcomes among this marginalized population."
31619204,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Neck and shoulder pain is relatively common among children and teenagers and has a negative impact on their physical and psychological health. This study was carried out to assess the prevalence of neck and shoulder pain among elementary school students, and to investigate the relationship between this pain and its risk factors. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 693 elementary school students aged 7 to 12 years from Hamadan city, located in western Iran, were selected through the multistage cluster random sampling method. Data were collected through interviews and questionnaires. For the social and psychological variables, the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used. For assessing each student's posture, an observational checklist, the Rapid Upper Limbs Assessment (RULA), was used. The data was analyzed using the unadjusted (univariate) and adjusted (multivariate) logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of the neck pain was slightly higher than that of shoulder pain. The prevalence reported over a month was 35.8 and 30.9% for neck and shoulder pain, respectively. The logistic regression analyses showed that, very high desk height (odds ratio (OR) =1.96, 95% confidence interval CI: 1.02-3.74), backward seat pan inclination (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.37-3.24), forward seat pan inclination (OR = 3.12, 95% CI:1.46-6.68), difficulty in viewing the board (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.10-5.84), too much homework (OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.49-4.51), RULA score at level III (OR = 2.88, 95% CI:1.64-5.05), and RULA score at level IV (OR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.72-5.63) increased the risk of neck pain independently. On the other hand, sitting on desk and seat (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39-0.91) and laying position for doing homework (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34-0.81) reduced the related risk. Very short desk height (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.26-4.61) and too much homework (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.10-3.42) increased the risk of shoulder pain. CONCLUSION: The elementary school students reported a high prevalence of shoulder and neck pain. This study found that improper sitting positions, as well as physical factors such as the school furniture, too much homework, and difficulty in viewing the classroom board, were associated with pain. Proper interventions considering the risk factors assessed in this study, are suggested."
3354493,1,a,"In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking."
7264477,1,a,"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered."
3175556,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to identify and rank potential determinants of respirator use among painters in the construction industry. As part of a health survey of union painters, 169 male spray painters were questioned about their own beliefs concerning the consequences of wearing cartridge respirators, as well as about the perceived attitudes of others in the workplace toward respirators. Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success."
10304496,1,a,The diverse factors associated with sexuality among adolescents and the specific issues related to contraception in this developmentally diverse group result in complexity in policy formation. The future of an adolescent may be determined solely on the basis of access to supportive physical and emotional services funded by public and private sector monies. The purpose of this paper is to briefly present contemporary and social policies regarding pregnant adolescent health care. Suggestions as to how these policies can be translated into public adolescent health models are provided. The strategies will be related to primary and secondary public policy interventions.
6706795,1,a,"A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed.

The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed."
25355234,0,a,"Suicide is a global public health problem and solutions to it can be found only through a global dialog. The suicide rate in Japan has been alarming, but Japan has made substantial efforts to reduce this rate, making prevention a high priority. This report reviews the developmental stages of a comprehensive policy of suicide prevention in Japan from 1998 to 2013. Our review suggests that suicide prevention activities were facilitated by the 2006 Basic Act for Suicide Prevention and the 2007 General Principles of Suicide Prevention Policy. Along with the establishment of a Special Fund program for local governments, the Basic Act and General Principles led to the development of a comprehensive and multi-sector approach to suicide prevention. Suicide rates in Japan, especially among middle-aged men, decreased consistently after 2009, suggesting that the initiatives were effective. Continuous monitoring is needed to evaluate Japan's suicide prevention policy."
4031402,1,a,"The study replicates and extends recent work on personality determinants of adjustment. Personality traits and adjustment criteria were selected for relevance to one type of real-life setting (public housing for the elderly that includes a senior center). Personality traits were measured by observer ratings; criteria, by self-report of respondents and perceptions of them by other residents and staff. In concurrent and longitudinal analyses controlling effects of competence and social status, personality traits accounted for significant and meaningful variance in all criteria, and the salience of particular traits varied across criteria. The results are consistent with earlier studies regarding the importance of extraversion and neuroticism to subjective well-being and suggest that they are relevant also to adjustment as perceived by others. The additional traits of congeniality, culture, and nosiness/gossip were related to both inner and outer adjustment measures in the type of situations studied."
30545614,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have been shown to be beneficial for inclusion in emergency department (ED) services; however, little has been done to assess these benefits with pharmacists having even wider scopes of practice, including limited prescribing authority. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of ED visits that can potentially be managed by pharmacists, the most prevalent conditions within these cases, and the factors associated with patients presenting with such cases to the ED. METHODS: This was a retrospective quantitative cohort study using administrative databases from 2010 to 2017. Among all unscheduled ED visits in Ontario, all visits with a Family Practice Sensitive Condition and Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale score of IV or V were identified, in addition to conditions that can be managed by pharmacists with expanded scope. Logistic regression was performed to identify determinants of having a potentially pharmacist-manageable condition. RESULTS: Of 34,550,020 ED visits identified, 12.4% (n=4,293,807) were considered FPSC with CTAS IV or V. Of these, 1,494,887 (34.8%) were for conditions considered to be potentially manageable by pharmacists, representing 4.3% of all ED visits. The most frequent diagnoses observed were: acute pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, rash and other nonspecific skin eruption, otitis externa, cough, acute sinusitis, and dermatitis. Female gender, having a family physician or presenting with a CTAS of IV were associated with higher odds of presenting to the ED, while increased age and income were associated with lower odds. CONCLUSIONS: Under an expanded scope, pharmacists could potentially have managed nearly 1.5 million cases presenting to the ED over the study period. The introduction of ED-based or community pharmacists practicing under an expanded scope may have a positive impact on overcrowding in EDs."
6738684,1,a,"Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance."
28503279,0,a,BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is an important cause of death and possibly transplant rejection in kidney transplant (KT) patients. This study was conducted to investigate the incidence and risk factors of CMV disease in kidney transplant patients. METHODS: All end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who underwent kidney transplantation during 1998-2014 and their donors were assessed. All samples were followed-up for approximately 70 months. CMV was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or PP65 antigen in peripheral blood leukocytes along with clinical manifestations. RESULTS: A total of 1450 cases participated in the current study. CMV was diagnosed in 178 out of 725 (24.6%) kidney recipients. The annual incidence of CMV disease was 4.2%. Patients older than 40 years had a higher incidence of CMV disease. The level of CMV disease incidence in the 41-60 age group was 4 fold compared to those under 20 of age group (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the incidence of CMV disease in our region is relatively low and also age more than 40 years and EBV infection are the important risk factors in kidney transplant patients. So care and monitoring of these patients are crucial in the first 5 months.
26630926,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Tackling inequalities in overweight, obesity and related determinants has become a top priority for the European research and policy agendas. Although it has been established that such inequalities accumulate from early childhood onward, they have not been studied extensively in children. The current article discusses the results of an explorative analysis for the identification of inequalities in behaviours and their determinants between groups with high and low socio-economic status. METHODS: This study is part of the Epode for the Promotion of Health Equity (EPHE) evaluation study, the overall aim of which is to assess the impact and sustainability of EPODE methodology to diminish inequalities in childhood obesity and overweight. Seven community-based programmes from different European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Portugal, Romania, The Netherlands) participate in the EPHE study. In each of the communities, children aged 6-8 years participated, resulting in a total sample of 1266 children and their families. A parental self-administrated questionnaire was disseminated in order to assess the socio-economic status of the household, selected energy balance-related behaviours (1. fruit and vegetable consumption; 2. soft drink/ fruit juices and water consumption; 3. screen time and 4. sleep duration) of the children and associated family environmental determinants. The Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson's chi-square test were used to test differences between the low and high education groups. The country-specific median was chosen as the cut-off point to determine the educational level, given the different average educational level in every country. RESULTS: Children with mothers of relatively high educational level consumed fruits and vegetables more frequently than their peers of low socio-economic status. The latter group of children had a higher intake of fruit juices and/or soft drinks and had higher screen time. Parental rules and home availability were consistently different between the two socio-economic groups in our study in all countries. However we did not find a common pattern for all behaviours and the variability across the countries was large. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are indicative of socio-economic inequalities in our samples, although the variability across the countries was large. The effectiveness of interventions aimed at chancing parental rules and behaviour on health inequalities should be studied."
3392764,1,a,"This paper presents part of a longitudinal study carried out in the three towns of Khartoum Province in the period December 1983 to April 1985. It was attempting to determine the duration of satisfactory breast-feeding in healthy breast-fed infants of mothers attending maternal and child health centres in the three towns; Khartoum, Khartoum-North and Omdurman. The main objective of the present paper is to compare samples from the three towns in terms of the factors affecting weight gain. Four hundred and thirty-nine infants were recruited at birth and home visited every 2 weeks. At each visit weight was measured and it was recorded whether any supplements had been given and whether the child had been ill. Length was measured every 4 weeks. There were significant differences between the samples from the three towns in attained weights and weight increments. Weight gains were lowest in the Khartoum North sample in the first 3 months, but from 3 to 6 months were highest, almost equalling the NCHS reference. In the Khartoum and Omdurman samples growth from 0 to 3 months exceeded the reference but from 3 to 6 months was less than the reference. Fifty per cent of infants were supplemented by 13 weeks in the Omdurman sample; the median time of supplementation in the other two samples was 17 weeks. Only in Khartoum did delaying supplementation seem to benefit growth. Infections were most common among the Omdurman sample.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
28558671,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Unintended pregnancies are a global public health concern and contribute significantly to adverse maternal and neonatal health, social and economic outcomes and increase the risks of maternal deaths and neonatal mortality. In countries like Pakistan where data for the unintended pregnancies is scarce, studies are required to estimate its accurate prevalence and predictors using more specific tools such as the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancies (LMUP). METHODS: We conducted a hospital based cross sectional survey in two tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan. We used a pre tested structured questionnaire to collect the data on socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive history, awareness and past experience with contraceptives and unintended pregnancies using six item the LMUP. We used Univariate and multivariate analysis to explore the association between unintended pregnancies and predictor variables and presented the association as adjusted odds ratios. We also evaluated the psychometric properties of the Urdu version of the LMUP. RESULTS: Amongst 3010 pregnant women, 1150 (38.2%) pregnancies were reported as unintended. In the multivariate analysis age < 20 years (AOR 3.5 1.1-6.5), being illiterate (AOR 1.9 1.1-3.4), living in a rural setting (1.7 1.2-2.3), having a pregnancy interval of = < 12 months (AOR 1.7 1.4-2.2), having a parity of >2 (AOR 1.4 1.2-1.8), having no knowledge about contraceptive methods (AOR 3.0 1.7-5.4) and never use of contraceptive methods (AOR 2.3 1.4-5.1) remained significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. The Urdu version of the LMUP scale was found to be acceptable, valid and reliable with the Cronbach's alpha of 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: This study explores a high prevalence of unintended pregnancies and important factors especially those related to family planning. Integrated national family program that provides contraceptive services especially the modern methods to women during pre-conception and post-partum would be beneficial in averting unintended pregnancies and their related adverse outcomes in Pakistan."
26760040,0,a,"Being a highly industrialized country with one of the highest male lung cancer mortality rates in Europe, Belgium is an interesting study area for lung cancer research. This study investigates geographical patterns in lung cancer mortality in Belgium. More specifically it probes into the contribution of individual as well as area-level characteristics to (sub-district patterns in) lung cancer mortality. Data from the 2001 census linked to register data from 2001-2011 are used, selecting all Belgian inhabitants aged 65+ at time of the census. Individual characteristics include education, housing status and home ownership. Urbanicity, unemployment rate, the percentage employed in mining and the percentage employed in other high-risk industries are included as sub-district characteristics. Regional variation in lung cancer mortality at sub-district level is estimated using directly age-standardized mortality rates. The association between lung cancer mortality and individual and area characteristics, and their impact on the variation of sub-district level is estimated using multilevel Poisson models. Significant sub-district variations in lung cancer mortality are observed. Individual characteristics explain a small share of this variation, while a large share is explained by sub-district characteristics. Individuals with a low socioeconomic status experience a higher lung cancer mortality risk. Among women, an association with lung cancer mortality is found for the sub-district characteristics urbanicity and unemployment rate, while for men lung cancer mortality was associated with the percentage employed in mining. Not just individual characteristics, but also area characteristics are thus important determinants of (regional differences in) lung cancer mortality."

Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves."""
20656515,0,a,"This study was conducted to investigate life satisfaction and employment status after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and to explain the associations between life satisfaction and demographic, disease-related, psychological, and personality characteristics. Subjects with SAH (n = 141) living at home 2-4 years after the SAH responded to a mailed questionnaire. Outcomes were life satisfaction, as measured with the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire 9 (LiSat-9), and employment status. Determinants in multiple regression analysis were demographic and SAH characteristics, subjective complaints (eg, mood disorder, fatigue, cognitive complaints), and personality characteristics (eg, neuroticism, passive coping style). Of the 141 subjects, 64 (46.7%) had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of V (good outcome) at discharge. Mean subject age was 51.4 +/- 12.3 years, and mean time after SAH was 36.1 +/- 7.9 months. Of the 88 subjects who were working at the time of the SAH, 54 (61.4%) returned to work, but only 31 (35.2%) resumed their work completely. The subjects were least satisfied with their vocational situation (51.9% satisfied) and sexual life (51.7%) and were most satisfied with their relationships (75.2%-88.7%) and self-care ability (88.6%). Age (beta value = 0.17), return to work after SAH (0.19), disability at hospital discharge (0.25), worsened mood (-0.37), and passive coping (-0.25) together accounted for 47.2% of the life satisfaction scores. Our data indicate that return to work is a major issue for individuals who survive an SAH. Not returning to work, disability, depression, and passive coping are associated with reduced life satisfaction. Thus, vocational reintegration after SAH merits more attention during rehabilitation."
3437081,1,a,"Although it is of both practical and theoretical importance very little work has been done on adolescents' knowledge of, and beliefs about, the economy. Two studies are reported in this paper--the first concerns the determinants of economic values in a population of 16-17 year old British schoolchildren, and the second concerns economic preferences and knowledge in a larger group of slightly older adolescents. By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on economic socialization."
31223296,0,a,"This article describes a replicable model of health literacy that promotes positive youth development. Now in its fifth year of implementation and run by Advance African Development, Inc., it is an integrated year-long, in-class, student-centered, technology-driven, and service-learning youth empowerment program. Forty-minute sessions are offered once a week to create health literate K-12 public school students able to use the Internet to obtain and understand health information, and to practice informed decision-making about their health. Data collected were qualitative and included student service learning projects to solve community health issues. Community engagement exposed students to problem-solving, collaborative and transformational leadership, and advocacy skills. Prior to the program, less than half of the students had heard of MedlinePlus, and those who had heard of it rarely could describe its purpose. Approximately 500 students and 10 teachers participated, and over 40 sessions were provided from August 2015 to June 2016."
3723341,1,a,"We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report."
30086752,0,a,"BACKGROUND: While it is increasingly recognized that social determinants influence the health of patients and populations, little is known about how doctors in the Eastern Mediterranean Region can help their patients with these issues. Our study aimed to identify common social challenges faced by patients in Eastern Mediterranean countries, to assess what doctors are already doing to address these challenges, and to identify barriers and facilitators for addressing the social causes of poor health in Eastern Mediterranean countries with shedding some light on how does this compare to a developed country like Canada. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative research study employing qualitative descriptive methodology. A purposeful sample as well as snowballing technique were used to recruit 18 physicians who were trained in Eastern Mediterranean countries but have since moved to Canada. Recruitment continued until data saturation was reached. A content analysis was carried out after transcribing the interviews. RESULTS: The main social challenges identified in clinical care in Eastern Mediterranean Regions include poverty, illiteracy, domestic violence, and food insecurity. Doctors attempted to help their patients by providing free medical services and free medications, establishing a donation box, and referring to social workers and support services, where available. Cultural constraints, lack of time, and unavailability of referral resources were often cited as important barriers. Our participants stated that Canada is generally better in dealing with the social challenges than their countries of origin. CONCLUSIONS: Most study participants expressed their willingness to help patients in dealing with social challenges, and shared their experiences of tackling such issues, though there were also important barriers reported that would need to be overcome. Participants suggested that better addressing social challenges in clinical care would require educating both health care providers and patients about the importance of discussing the patient's social environment as part of the health care encounter, as well as advocating for broader policy approaches by governments to address the underlying social problems."
26453175,0,a,"Sedentary behaviour (SB) has emerged as a potential risk factor for metabolic health in youth. Knowledge on the determinants of SB in youth is necessary to inform future intervention development to reduce SB. A systematic review was conducted to identify predictors and determinants of SB in youth. Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched, limiting to articles in English, published between January 2000 and May 2014. The search strategy was based on four key elements and their synonyms: (a) sedentary behaviour, (b) determinants, (c) types of sedentary behaviours, (d) types of determinants. The full protocol is available from PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2014:CRD42014009823). Cross-sectional studies were excluded. The analysis was guided by the socio-ecological model. 37 studies were selected out of 2654 identified papers from the systematic literature search. Most studies were conducted in Europe (n = 13), USA (n = 11), and Australia (n = 10). The study quality, using the Qualsyst tool, was high with a median of 82% (IQR: 74-91%). Multiple potential determinants were studied in only one or two studies. Determinants were found at the individual, interpersonal, environmental and policy level but few studies examined a comprehensive set of factors at different levels of influences. Evidence was found for age being positively associated with total SB, and weight status and baseline assessment of screen time being positively associated with screen time (at follow-up). A higher playground density and a higher availability of play and sports equipment at school were consistently related to an increased total SB, although these consistent findings come from single studies. Evidence was also reported for the presence of safe places to cross roads and lengthening morning and lunch breaks being associated with less total SB. Future interventions to decrease SB levels should especially target children with overweight or obesity and should start at a young age. However, since the relationship of many determinants with SB remains inconsistent, there is still a need for more longitudinal research on determinants of SB in youth."
29423760,0,a,"PURPOSE: The Caribbean population faces a growing burden of multiple non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs). Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women in the Caribbean. Given the substantial burden of NCDs across the region, cancer prevention and control strategies may need to be specifically tailored for people with multiple co-morbidities. Preventive screening, such as timely mammography, is essential but may be either facilitated or hampered by chronic disease control. The main objective of this study is to examine the relationship between a chronic disease and timely breast cancer screening. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional data analysis using baseline data from the Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network (ECHORN) Cohort Study-ECS. Our independent variables were presence of chronic diseases (hypertension or diabetes), defined as having been told by a clinical provider. Our dependent variable was timely screening mammography, as defined by receipt of mammography within the past 2 years. We examined bivariate and multivariate associations of covariates and timely screening mammography. RESULTS: In our sample (n = 841), 52% reported timely screening mammography. Among those with timely screening, 50.8% reported having hypertension, and 22.3% reported having diabetes. In our bivariate analyses, both diabetes and hypertension were associated with timely screening mammography. In partially adjusted models, we found that women with diabetes were significantly more likely to report timely screening mammography than women without diabetes. In our fully adjusted models, the association was no longer significant. Having a usual source of healthcare and a woman's island of residence were significantly associated with timely screening mammography (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found that half of eligible women received timely screening mammography. Diabetes and hypertension, though common, are not associated with timely screening mammography. Usual source of care remains an important factor to timely breast cancer screening."
25535600,0,a,"Native Hawaiians and other residents living in economically disadvantaged communities suffer disproportionately from many health conditions, especially chronic diseases. Reversing this trend requires a comprehensive approach encompassing more than just improvement in healthcare delivery. Indeed, societal changes at multiple levels must occur, including environmental, systems, and policy change, in order to bring about sustainable improvements in community health and wellness. A key strategy to accomplish these upstream changes is an increase in the capacity of community-based organizations to provide leadership in health advocacy, support community health promotion, prioritize resource allocation, and participate in community health research. In disadvantaged communities where health disparities are the most severe, community health centers (CHC) are well positioned to take a pivotal role in these efforts. This report is a case study to describe processes taking place at Hawai'i's largest CHC to build organizational capacity and bring about upstream changes that improve community health and wellness. Ongoing processes at the CHC include (1) Institutional: commitment to address health disparities, expand the CHC research infrastructure, and develop a comprehensive worksite wellness program (2) Collaborative: development of a network of community partners committed to the common goal of improving the health and wellness of community residents, and (3) Systems and Policy: activities to strengthen the CHC's and community's ability to influence systems changes and policies that reduce health disparities. Preliminary results are encouraging although the processes and timelines involved require a long-term commitment in order to affect tangible results that can be measured."
3426705,1,a,"An experiment was conducted in which 66 male subjects were given access to alcohol (20% vol.) and fruit juice to be mixed and tasted ad lib. A factorial design included social vs. solitary drinking conditions, laboratory vs. informal setting, and variable exposure to music. The amount of ethanol consumed (g/kg body weight) was used as an unobtrusive measure of preferred intake. The reciprocal relationship between mood and consumption was analyzed by LISREL. While euphoria has usually been perceived as a consequence of drinking, the only plausible fit to a LISREL model was obtained by assuming that the disposition to drink would be increased by positive mood changes occurring during the drinking session. An analogy between social drinking and adjunctive behaviour was supported, as alcohol consumption was directly affected by time-dependent environmental factors such as company and music. Since the presence of company also stimulated positive mood and alleviated boredom, consumption was precipitated by company indirectly as well as directly. These results emphasize the importance of direct as well as indirect environmental influences on spontaneous alcohol intake during social drinking."
28826295,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Health disparities persist among African Americans (AAs) and Latino adults with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this research was to use PhotoVoice to examine AAs and Latinos' daily experiences of managing diabetes. METHOD: An exploratory, descriptive study using PhotoVoice and focus groups was conducted over a 3-week period: Week 1 orientation session, Week 2 photo taking and returning cameras, and Week 3 focus group to share and discuss photos. RESULTS: Ten AAs and nine Latino adults were enrolled, forming four focus groups. Four categories emerged: (1) daily life living with type 2 diabetes mellitus, (2) negative and positive emotions, (3) supports and barriers, and (4) needs. The social determinants of health influencing diabetes self-care were observed in discussions and photos-this included the built environment to promote a healthy lifestyle, social support, and education. IMPLICATIONS: PhotoVoice promotes culturally congruent care to better understand AA and Latinos' experience living with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
31703734,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Antenatal care (ANC) services are critical for maternal health but Nigeria performs poorly in ANC utilisation compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to assess socioeconomic inequalities in ANC utilisation and the determinants of these inequalities in Nigeria. METHODS: The 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data with 18,559 women was used for analysis. The paper used concentration curves and indices for different measures of ANC utilisation (no ANC visit, 1-3 ANC visits, at least four ANC visits, and the number of ANC visits). A positive (or negative) concentration index means that the measure of ANC utilisation was concentrated on the richer (poorer) population compared to their poorer (richer) counterparts. The concentration indices were also decomposed using standard methodologies to examine the significant determinants of the socioeconomic inequalities in no ANC visit, at least four ANC visits, and the number of ANC visits. RESULTS: No ANC visit was disproportionately concentrated among the poor (concentration index (CI) = - 0.573), whereas at least four ANC visits (CI = 0.582) and a higher number of ANC visits (CI = 0.357) were disproportionately concentrated among the rich. While these results were consistent across all the geopolitical zones and rural and urban areas, the inequalities were more prevalent in the northern zones (which also have the highest incidence of poverty in the country) and the rural areas. The significant contributors to inequalities in ANC utilisation were the zone of residence, wealth, women's education (especially secondary) and employment, urban-rural residence, ethnicity, spousal education, and problems with obtaining permission to seek health care and distance to the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing wealth inequalities, enhancing literacy, employment and mitigating spatial impediments to health care use will reduce socioeconomic inequalities in ANC utilisation in Nigeria. These factors are the social determinants of health inequalities. Thus, a social determinants of health approach is needed to address socioeconomic inequalities in ANC coverage in Nigeria."

24585730,0,a,"Chronic diseases are a global problem, yet information on their determinants is generally scant in low- and middle-income countries. The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) aims to contribute relevant information regarding the development and progression of clinical and subclinical chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, in one such setting. At Visit 1, we enrolled 15 105 civil servants from predefined universities or research institutes. Baseline assessment (2008-10) included detailed interviews and measurements to assess social and biological determinants of health, as well as various clinical and subclinical conditions related to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mental health. A second visit of interviews and examinations is under way (2012-14) to enrich the assessment of cohort exposures and to detect initial incident events. Annual surveillance has been conducted since 2009 for the ascertainment of incident events. Biological samples (sera, plasma, urine and DNA) obtained at both visits have been placed in long-term storage. Baseline data are available for analyses, and collaboration via specific research proposals directed to study investigators is welcome."
3395696,1,a,"Specialization--the predisposition to violent behavior persisting over an extended period of time--is considered in relation to congenital factors, to determine whether such factors are contributory to this predisposition. Congenital factors include inherited characteristics and perinatal experiences. Evidence for inherited characteristics in criminal behavior is approached through family studies, the study of twins, and adoption studies. Of those three, adoption studies provide the most fertile ground for study. Predisposition toward criminal behavior is noted to be limited to property crime. The second congenital factor is the perinatal experience. Minor physical anomalies appear to be strongly related to hyperactivity and later criminal involvement, but only if the offender was reared in an unstable, nonintact family. Indices of perinatal problems relate to later violent crime, rather than to property crime, and may have as their basis some form of trauma occurring very early in life."

3529424,1,a,"Much of the research on the recent resurgence of malaria in Third World areas has focused on the problem of vector resistance arising out of the widespread use of pesticides in conjunction with the development of large-scale agricultural projects. Evidence from southern Africa, and particularly from Swaziland, where a resurgence of malaria has occurred in the absence of pesticide-resistant strains of Anopheles mosquitoes, suggests that changes in agroecosystems, labor utilization and settlement patterns, which are also associated with large-scale agricultural development, may play an equally important role in the resurgence of malaria. Renewed efforts to control malaria must, therefore, take account of the social and economic, as well as the biological determinants of this disease."
21639878,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the correlates of practicing physical activity during leisure time is important with regard to planning and designing public health strategies to increase beneficial behaviors among adult populations. Although the importance of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) is highlighted in many Western countries, there are not many publications on physical activity patterns, and even less on their correlates, in non-Western societies. The goal of this study was thus to explore the determinants influencing adults' leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in a city in southern Taiwan. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted in 2007, using a standardized questionnaire. Energy expenditure was dichotomized into two groups based on the recommended levels of moderate physical activity from LTPA: >/=10 or < 10 MET.hr.wk(-1). Logistic regression analyses were applied to the results. RESULTS: A total of 762 subjects with valid data took part in the study (mean age 53.8 +/- 13.8 years). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found the following results: Age was positively associated with LTPA. Adults with stronger perceived convenience of exercise facilities (OR = 2.04; 95%CI = 1.28-3.24) and past exercise experience in school (OR = 1.86; 95%CI= 1.19-2.91) participated in more LTPA. Subjects with more general social support (OR = 1.66;95%CI = 1.13-2.44), greater knowledge about the health benefits of exercise (OR = 1.85;95%CI = 1.25-2.74), more sports media consumption (OR = 1.94;95%CI = 1.26-2.98), and higher self-efficacy (OR = 3.99;95%CI = 2.67-5.97) were more likely to engage in LTPA. Further analysis comparing different sources of social support showed only social support from friends had a significant positive association (OR = 1.73;95%CI = 1.14-2.63) with increased LTPA. CONCLUSIONS: LTPA in southern city of Taiwan showed some unique associations with age, socioeconomic status and media consumption that are not commonly reported in the Western World and similar associations with regards to psychosocial correlates of LTPA participation. Further studies from developing countries are warranted to highlight culture-specific differences in physical activity participation."
31125906,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the role of social support on different aspects of health especially pregnancy and childbirth has been emphasized. Social support facilitates individual access to necessary resources during stressful periods of life like pregnancy and childbirth. Present evidence of effects of social support on birth experience is inconsistent, Therefore, this study aimed to determine the correlation between perceived social support in pregnant women and their childbirth experience. DESIGN: Analytic-cross sectional survey. SETTING: Al-Zahra maternity hospital in Rasht, Iran. PARTICIPANTS: 185 pregnant women who were in latent phase of labor entered the study and finally, 89.18% (n=165) completed the study. MEASUREMENTS: To measure perceived social support, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support was used at latent phase of labor and to measure childbirth experience, the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire was used within 2 h after childbirth until the mother was discharged. RESULTS: Mean score of perceived social support by significant others (4.18 +/- 0.79) was higher than other dimensions of social support. Total mean score of childbirth experience was 58.13 +/- 10.72 (score range: 22-88). Logistic regression results showed that support by significant others (P=0.042, OR = 1.56), gestational age (P=0.003, OR = 1.56) and mode of delivery (P=0.004, OR = 0.33) are predictor variables of childbirth experience. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Perceived social support by significant others (spouse) during pregnancy has an important effect on woman`s childbirth experience. Therefore, providing training programs for family especially for spouse in order to increase maternal support during pregnancy is recommended, which can lead to a positive childbirth experience."

26615080,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Climate change has myriad implications for the health of humans, our ecosystems, and the ecological processes that sustain them. Projections of rising greenhouse gas emissions suggest increasing direct and indirect burden of infectious and noninfectious disease, effects on food and water security, and other societal disruptions. As the effects of climate change cannot be isolated from social and ecological determinants of disease that will mitigate or exacerbate forecasted health outcomes, multidisciplinary collaboration is critically needed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article was to review the links between climate change and its upstream drivers (ie, processes leading to greenhouse gas emissions) and health outcomes, and identify existing opportunities to leverage more integrated global health and climate actions to prevent, prepare for, and respond to anthropogenic pressures. METHODS: We conducted a literature review of current and projected health outcomes associated with climate change, drawing on findings and our collective expertise to review opportunities for adaptation and mitigation across disciplines. FINDINGS: Health outcomes related to climate change affect a wide range of stakeholders, providing ready collaborative opportunities for interventions, which can be differentiated by addressing the upstream drivers leading to climate change or the downstream effects of climate change itself. CONCLUSIONS: Although health professionals are challenged with risks from climate change and its drivers, the adverse health outcomes cannot be resolved by the public health community alone. A phase change in global health is needed to move from a passive responder in partnership with other societal sectors to drive innovative alternatives. It is essential for global health to step outside of its traditional boundaries to engage with other stakeholders to develop policy and practical solutions to mitigate disease burden of climate change and its drivers; this will also yield compound benefits that help address other health, environmental, and societal challenges."

7282978,1,a,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology."

Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man."
30857931,0,a,"To increase vaccination coverage, it is essential to understand the vaccine decision-making process. High population coverage is required to obtain herd immunity and to protect vulnerable groups in terms of age (e.g. the very young) or health (e.g. immunodeficiency). Vaccine confidence and coverage in South Africa are relatively low, opening the window for sustained outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in a country facing one of the most severe HIV epidemics in the world. To capture the vaccine-related decision-making process in South Africa, we performed a discrete choice experiment with 1200 participants in December 2017. We asked for their preferences with respect to (1) vaccine effectiveness, (2) vaccine-preventable burden of disease, (3) accessibility of the vaccine in terms of co-payment and prescription requirements, (4) frequency of mild vaccine-related side-effects, (5) population vaccination coverage and (6) local vaccination coverage. We distinguished between decision-making for vaccines administered to the participant, and for vaccines administered to their youngest child. We analyzed the data for each of these groups using a panel mixed logit model and found similar results for decisions to vaccinate oneself or one's child. Vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute followed by population coverage and burden of disease. Local coverage and accessibility were also important determinants of vaccination behavior, but to a lesser extent. Regarding population and local coverage, we observed a positive effect on vaccine utility indicating the potential of peer influence. As such, social normative influence could be exploited to increase vaccination confidence and coverage. With respect to vaccine-preventable burden of the disease, the marginal utilities showed disease severity to be more important than frequency of disease. Policymakers and health care workers should stress the effectiveness of vaccines together with the severity of vaccine-preventable diseases."
30777496,0,a,"Background: With improving prognosis, the ability to return to work after cancer has become a realistic goal but only little is known regarding details such as sustainability, financial consequences, and potential determinants of return to work in long-term survivors in Germany. Methods: We studied return to work in a population-based sample of 1558 long-term cancer survivors, diagnosed in 1994-2004 with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer before age 60 (mean 50.1). Information regarding employment status and financial difficulties was obtained via mailed questionnaires from patients who were identified by six population-based cancer registries in Germany. Cumulative incidence of return to work was determined by time-to-event analysis with consideration of competing events. Chi(2) tests and multiple logistic regression modeling were employed to identify potential sociodemographic and clinical determinants of return to work. Results: Within a mean period since diagnosis of 8.3 years, 63% of all working-age cancer survivors initially returned to their old job and another 7% took up a new job. Seventeen percent were granted a disability pension, 6% were early retired (not cancer-related), 4% became unemployed, and 1% left the job market for other reasons. Resumption of work occurred within the first 2 years after diagnosis in 90% of all returnees. Cancer-related reduction of working hours was reported by 17% among all returnees and 6% quit their job due to cancer within 5 years past return to work. The probability of return to work was strongly related with age at diagnosis, tumor stage, education, and occupational class but did not differ with respect to the tumor site, gender nor marital status. Conclusions: Most long-term survivors after breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer of working-age are able to return to work. However, financial problems might arise due to a reduction in working hours. An additional provision of targeted interventions for high-risk groups should be discussed."

We examine educational differences across rural and urban regions and across gender as determinants of marriage. Results reveal that for rural women, increasing education (especially from the least educated to middle levels of education) decreases marriage chances. For urban women, increasing education does not affect their marriage chances, net of other factors. For the former, results are consistent with the broad East Asian cultural practice of women ""marrying up."" For the latter, we argue that modernizing forces (e.g., improvements in education) have reduced the incidence of this practice. We also find effects attributable to unique features of the Chinese institutional context, such as the rural/urban divide and effects of the household registration (Hukou) system."
21905760,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a growing worldwide problem, characterized by considerable ethnic variation and being particularly common in modernizing populations. Modernization is accompanied by a variety of stressful sociocultural changes that are believed to increase the risk of diabetes. Unfortunately, there is little accurate knowledge about impact of stress on the risk of diabetes in the US-Mexico border area. METHODS: Literature searches were performed in PubMed and Google Scholar to identify anthropological studies on stress and diabetes. Snowball and opportunistic sampling were used to expand the identified literature. In total, 30 anthropological studies were identified concerning the role of stress and modernization on diabetes among Indigenous peoples. This article reviews the available information regarding stress and diabetes in different populations from various anthropological perspectives. RESULTS: Four different concepts of stress were indentified: physiological, psychological, psychosocial and nutritional stress. Unlike physiological and nutritional theories of diabetes, psychological and psychosocial theories of stress and disease lack etiological specificity. No study addressed all four concepts of stress and few studies addressed more than two concepts. Most studies concerned nutritional stress and the developmental origins of diabetes. Most studies were conducted on the Pima Indians of Arizona and Mexico. All four stress concepts have some evidence as determinants of diabetes. CONCLUSION: These theoretical concepts and ethnographic results can provide the basis for developing comprehensive research protocols and public health intervention targeted at diabetes. A comprehensive view of stress can potentially explain the high prevalence of diabetes in developing countries and among Indigenous peoples. These results can be used to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing diabetes in the US-Mexico border region or similar areas, help identify at-risk individuals, and guide health education and promotion."
28406328,0,a,"Objective Previous studies have reported discrepancy effects of education and income on cardiovascular diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis was therefore conducted which aimed to summarize effects of education and income on cardiovascular diseases. Methods Studies were identified from Medline and Scopus until July 2016. Cohorts were eligible if they assessed associations between education/income and cardiovascular diseases, had at least one outcome including coronary artery diseases, cardiovascular events, strokes and cardiovascular deaths. A multivariate meta-analysis was applied to pool risk effects of these social determinants. Results Among 72 included cohorts, 39, 19, and 14 were studied in Europe, USA, and Asia. Pooled risk ratios of low and medium versus high education were 1.36 (95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.66) and 1.21 (1.06-1.40) for coronary artery diseases, 1.50 (1.17-1.92) and 1.27 (1.09-1.48) for cardiovascular events, 1.23 (1.06-1.43) and 1.17 (1.01-1.35) for strokes, and 1.39 (1.26-1.54) and 1.21 (1.12-1.30) for cardiovascular deaths. The effects of education on all cardiovascular diseases were still present in US and Europe settings, except in Asia this was present only for cardiovascular deaths. Effects of low and medium income versus high on these corresponding cardiovascular diseases were 1.49 (1.16-1.91) and 1.27 (1.10-1.47) for coronary artery diseases, 1.17 (0.96-1.44) and 1.05 (0.98-1.13) for cardiovascular events, 1.30 (0.99-1.72) and 1.24 (1.00-1.53) for strokes, and 1.76 (1.45-2.14) and 1.34 (1.17-1.54) for cardiovascular deaths.

7020985,1,a,"The association between reported alcohol intake and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration is examined in an effort to establish whether it was a cause-and-effect basis. A cross-sectional descriptive study of several populations reveals a strong and consistent dose-response pattern: Social drinkers have mean HDL cholesterol levels that are higher than those of teetotalers by as much as 33%. Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period. The evidence supports the conclusion that alcohol habits are probably one of the determinants of plasma HDL cholesterol level. A clarification of the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical medicine awaits future clinical efforts."
25254915,0,a,"In today's global society, infectious disease outbreaks can spread quickly across the world, fueled by the rapidity with which we travel across borders and continents. Historical accounts of influenza pandemics and contemporary reports on infectious diseases clearly demonstrate that poverty, inequality, and social determinants of health create conditions for the transmission of infectious diseases, and existing health disparities or inequalities can further contribute to unequal burdens of morbidity and mortality. Yet, to date, studies of influenza pandemic plans across multiple countries find little to no recognition of health inequalities or attempts to engage disadvantaged populations to explicitly address the differential impact of a pandemic on them. To meet the goals and objectives of the Global Health Security Agenda, we argue that international partners, from WHO to individual countries, must grapple with the social determinants of health and existing health inequalities and extend their vision to include these factors so that disease that may start among socially disadvantaged subpopulations does not go unnoticed and spread across borders. These efforts will require rethinking surveillance systems to include sociodemographic data; training local teams of researchers and community health workers who are able to not only analyze data to recognize risk factors for disease, but also use simulation methods to assess the impact of alternative policies on reducing disease; integrating social science disciplines to understand local context; and proactively anticipating shortfalls in availability of adequate healthcare resources, including vaccines. Without explicit attention to existing health inequalities and underlying social determinants of health, the Global Health Security Agenda is unlikely to succeed in its goals and objectives."

3559184,1,a,"Burnout among hospital-based nurses appears to be a serious problem affecting the delivery of health care. Findings from previous empirical research indicate that burnout among these nurses results from reactions to adversities inherent in the hospital work environment, and that burnout can lead nurses to change jobs and/or abandon the practice of nursing. This paper presents and discusses research findings on the effects of various aspects of the hospital work environment on burnout among nurses, and, in addition, evaluates the effects of social support in reducing and/or mitigating the relationship between negative aspects of the work environment and burnout. A multiple regression approach is employed to test the hypothesized model. The data were collected from a sample of nurses (n = 310) employed at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (FAMC), Aurora, Colorado. The major determinants of burnout were found to be low job enhancement (autonomy, task orientation, clarity, innovation, and physical comfort); work pressure; and lack of supervisor support, along with the interaction term involving the combined effects of job enhancement and supervisor support. These predictors, in conjunction with demographic and job-related variables explained 53% of the variance in emotional exhaustion, a central component of the burnout syndrome."
3227364,1,a,"Data from a general population sample of 621 healthy homosexual men are used to evaluate the social and emotional effects of HIV antibody status, clinical signs detected by medical examination, and subjectively perceived symptoms. Participants are unaware of their serologic status at the time of data collection, thus allowing the effects of the virus to be separated from reactions to the knowledge of serologic status. The data show that seropositivity for HIV is not associated with elevated levels of social or emotional impairment. Clinical signs lead to impairment in baseline data, but these effects do not persist at a second wave. This weakening suggests that the effects are mediated by psychological pathways rather than biologic ones. This suspicion is confirmed in further analyses, which show that the effects of clinical signs are mediated by subjectively perceived symptoms. These results show that neither social nor emotional impairment is likely to be a prodromal sign of HIV infection in otherwise healthy homosexual men. The substantial levels of distress found among these men is more directly influenced by psychological determinants than biologic ones. This suggests that physicians should be aware of the psychological toll imposed on gay men who develop health problems in the current atmosphere of uncertainty regarding risk of AIDS."
28633689,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To apply the Theory of Planned Behaviour to examine the relationship between the constructs of background factors and beliefs towards using policy, systems and environmental (PSE) strategies and reported use of PSE strategies to prevent obesity by a group of professional nutrition educators. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using self-reported survey. SETTING: Cooperative Extension in New York, USA. SUBJECTS: Nutrition educators (n 58); survey response rate 100 %. RESULTS: Nutrition educators' reported use of PSE strategies to prevent obesity were positively associated with background factors of their community networking and number of staff they managed, their belief of other people's expectations of them to make PSE changes and the belief that their communities were ready to use PSE strategies; and negatively associated with their belief that individual-level factors contributed to obesity. The relationships among these variables were complicated and their use of PSE strategies occurred only when they utilized their professional networks at a moderately high level (above mean of 5.3 on a scale of 1-7), given that their community was also ready to use PSE strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition educators' use of PSE strategies depends on several internal and external factors. Community networking needs to be emphasized as one of the most significant factors contributing to nutrition educators' work in this area. Organizational and community support should be in place in order to facilitate nutrition educators' effective use of PSE strategies."
6520656,1,a,"Smoking during pregnancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including fetal and neonatal death. These consequences are tragic in many ways, but perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they are preventable if the smoker ceases to smoke during pregnancy. Although in some instances the so-called constitutional hypothesis is difficult to disprove, the available evidence seems more than convincing that it is smoking itself, and not the smoker's unique constitution, that is responsible. Cessation from smoking is clearly advisable at any time, but more so during pregnancy when every cigarette affects both the smoker and her unborn child."
30158577,0,a,"PURPOSE: The aims of the study were to assess the magnitude and predictors of the unmet need for spectacles utilization and to quantify its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among rural Chinese adolescents. METHODS: This school-based survey of 2346 grade-7 students (mean age: 13.8 years) was conducted in Southwestern China in 2016. Spectacles need was defined as uncorrected visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or worse but correctable to 20/40 or better in the better-seeing eye, together with the presence of myopia of less than -0.5 diopters (D), hyperopia of more than +2.0 D, or astigmatism of more than 0.75 D in both eyes. The HRQOL was measured using self-reported versions of 23-item Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL 4.0). RESULTS: Among 579 (24.7%) adolescents with an uncorrected VA of 20/40 or less, 483 (83.4%) needed vision corrections and 172 (35.6%) used them. Higher parental education levels (odds ratio (OR) = 2.73; 95% CI, 1.29-5.77), negative attitude regarding spectacles (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.97), and poorer uncorrected VA (OR = 31.27; 95% CI, 3.76-260.23) were independent determinants for spectacles utilization. Adolescents not using spectacles had a lower HRQOL score compared to those using spectacles in terms of psychosocial health (65.91 vs. 70.59; P = 0.028), emotional health (56.85 vs. 63.24; P = 0.012), and social functioning (72.99 vs. 78.60; P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of spectacles utilization in rural China was low. Adolescents were not accustomed to use spectacles had a worse HRQOL score."
25617353,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Adverse health-related behaviours (HRBs) have been shown to co-occur in adolescents. Evidence lacks on factors associated with these co-occurring HRBs. The Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI) offers a route to categorize these determinants according to type (social, cultural and intrapersonal) and distance in the causal pathway (ultimate or distal). Our aims were to identify cultural, social and intrapersonal factors associated with co-occurring HRBs and to assess the relative importance of ultimate and distal factors for each cluster of co-occurring HRBs. METHODS: Respondents concerned a random sample of 898 adolescents aged 12-18 years, stratified by age, sex and educational level of head of household. Data were collected via face-to-face computer-assisted interviewing and internet questionnaires. Analyses were performed for young (12-15 years) and late (16-18 years) adolescents regarding two and three clusters of HRB, respectively. RESULTS: For each cluster of HRBs (e.g. smoking, delinquency), associated factors were found. These accounted for 27 to 57% of the total variance per cluster. Factors came in particular from the intrapersonal stream of the TTI at the ultimate level and the social stream at the distal level. Associations were strongest for parenting practices, risk behaviours of friends and parents and self-control. CONCLUSION: Results of this study confirm that it is possible to identify a selection of cultural, social and intrapersonal factors associated with co-occurring HRBs among adolescents."
3175556,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to identify and rank potential determinants of respirator use among painters in the construction industry. As part of a health survey of union painters, 169 male spray painters were questioned about their own beliefs concerning the consequences of wearing cartridge respirators, as well as about the perceived attitudes of others in the workplace toward respirators. Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success."
3964428,1,a,"Male and female juvenile rats were individually exposed to nonplayful juvenile social stimuli in a novel test of play-soliciting behavior to examine hormonal and experiential determinants of sex differences. In Experiment 1, neonatally androgenized females engaged in play soliciting at a level equal to that of male controls and greater than that of nonandrogenized female controls. In Experiment 2, males and females were reared in unisexual and bisexual groups in order to compare long-term sex-related social experience effects on juvenile play soliciting. Males exposed only to other young males engaged in greater play soliciting than males exposed to both sexes; females, in contrast, were unaffected by sex of cagemates. Within rearing conditions, however, males engaged in greater play soliciting than females. The combined results suggest that perinatal gonadal androgen exposure effects on social play are prepotent and contribute essentially to sex differences in the initiation of social play behavior."
19912448,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In addition to their more clinically evident abnormalities of social cognition, people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) manifest perturbations of attention and sensory perception which may offer insights into the underlying neural abnormalities. Similar autistic traits in ASC relatives without a diagnosis suggest a continuity between clinically affected and unaffected family members. METHODS: We applied fMRI in the context of a non-social task of visual attention in order to determine whether this continuity persists at the level of brain physiology. RESULTS: Both boys with ASC and clinically unaffected brothers of people with ASC were impaired at a visual divided-attention task demanding conjunction of attributes from rapidly and simultaneously presented, spatially disjoint stimuli and suppression of spatially intervening distractors. In addition, both groups in comparison to controls manifested atypical fronto-cerebellar activation as a function of distractor congruence, and the degree of this frontal atypicality correlated with psychometric measures of autistic traits in ASC and sibs. Despite these resemblances between the ASC and sib groups, an exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of correlations across brain regions revealed a decrease in overall functional correlation only in the ASC group and not in the sibs. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish a neurophysiological correlate of familial susceptibility to ASC, and suggest that whilst abnormal time courses of frontal activation may reflect processes permissive of autistic brain development, abnormal patterns of functional correlation across a wider array of brain regions may relate more closely to autism's determinants."
6285155,1,a,"In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients."
23448627,0,a,"Mental health refers to a diverse field where individuals can cope with daily stress, realize their potential and maintain a state of well-being. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the influence of mental health on general health, and in particular on cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors. Epidemiological research has focused on several psychosocial components including social determinants, comorbid psychiatric disorders, psychological stress, coping styles, social support, burden on the family, well-being, life satisfaction, personality and cognitive factors in connection with cardiovascular diseases. There is epidemiological research in India that integrates mental health with common cardiovascular diseases such as coronary health disease and stroke. Data from mental health research is sufficiently compelling to highlight the role of chronic stress, socioeconomic status and psychiatric disorders such as depression, substance use, social networks and support in relation to vulnerability to cardiovascular diseases. There are psychosocial consequences of cardiovascular diseases including deficits in the domains of life skills, coping skills and neurocognition, in addition to caregiver burden. The implications of bio-psychosocial models of assessments and interventions that target complex individual and contextual variables simultaneously on cardiovascular treatment outcomes have highlighted the importance of studying mental health in Indian settings. Integration of mental health into mainstream research is the need of the hour. A multidimensional approach to accomplish this is required including at the level of research conceptualization, discussions with key stakeholders, at the policy level, at the institutional level, and at the clinical and community level."
6382590,1,a,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females."
2723595,1,a,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."
3070761,1,a,"Medical compliance researchers have produced more than 4000 scientific papers in the past two decades, but their research into the determinants of non-compliance has been inconclusive. This paper argues that the popularity of compliance and the uncertainty over its determinants can be understood if compliance is analyzed as an ideology that assumes and justifies physician authority. I explore compliance as a problematic concept, looking at its assumptions and its influences on clinical practice. The concept of patient compliance has a social history linked to the struggle to create and maintain physician control over infant feeding technology earlier in this century. But while physicians were successful in that struggle, they have never exercised complete control over health care products. Compliance must be reconceptualized and its research reoriented if it is accurately to portray medication usage and related health behaviors outside the clinic."
3705997,1,a,Forty-five severely obese patients were treated with jaw fixation as a means of initiating weight loss. Patients who reported eating for consolation showed significantly greater difficulties in maintaining the achieved weight loss than the others. This finding constitutes further evidence of a relationship between obesity and depression. Low capacity to experience feelings of aggressiveness also seems to be linked to poor treatment results.
24272979,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Risk factors for postnatal depression (PND), one of the most pervasive complications of child bearing, are poorly understood in Africa. A recent systematic review of 31 studies found that the strongest predictors are social and economic disadvantage and gender-based factors; only six of these studies were community based, and almost all were in South Asia. METHODS: Cohort study nested within 4 weekly surveillance of all women of reproductive age to identify pregnancies and collect data on births and deaths in the Kintampo Health Research Centre study area of Ghana. Women were screened for depression during pregnancy and after birth using the Patient Health Questionnaire to ascertain DSM-IV major or minor depression. Information was collected on determinants relating to the mother, birth, and baby, which were examined using logistic regression; effect sizes reported as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand nine hundred and twenty nine women were screened both during pregnancy and after birth, of whom 13,360 (95.9%) had complete data on potential determinants. Two hundred and fifty five (3.8%, 95% CI: 3.5%, 4.1%) had PND. Antenatal depression (AND) was the strongest determinant accounting for 34.4% of PND cases. Other determinants were season of delivery, peripartum/postpartum complications, newborn ill health, still birth, or neonatal death. Common determinants were observed for onset and persistent depression. CONCLUSIONS: Although most AND resolves in this setting, more than a third of women with PND also had AND. Adverse birth- and baby-related outcomes are the other main determinants. We recommend that programs detect and treat depression during pregnancy and provide support to women with adverse birth outcomes."

2963022,1,a,"Research on attitudes toward the disabled generally has focused on adult perceptions of disabled adults, or children's attitudes toward peers. In view of changing social practices, such as mainstreaming in education and community integration of children with special needs, measures of adults' attitudes toward disabled children are needed. This paper reports on the development and validation of a 30-item self-report questionnaire assessing parental attitudes toward children with handicaps, and presents information concerning several determinants of parental attitudes. The measure is easy to use, reliable, and shows good evidence of construct validity. It detects differences among parents by gender, by parental education and occupational status, by cultural background of parents, by parental familiarity with a handicapped person, and by stimulus (physically disabled vs. mentally retarded child referent). Results are discussed in relation to determinants of parental attitudes toward handicaps. Potential applications of this measure for evaluation of teacher attitudes are suggested."
26818190,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a health issue that often occurs after serious disaster. Social factors, which can be disrupted by disaster, are important determinants of physical activity levels in everyday living. This study was designed to confirm the association between social factors and physical activity among elderly survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake. METHODS: From September 2011 to February 2012, 4316 males and females aged 65 or older participated in a health survey of Great East Japan Earthquake survivors. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with the dichotomous dependent variable of physical activity (high versus low) and working status, social network, and place of residence (one's own home versus elsewhere) as independent variables. RESULTS: Participants who had been displaced from their homes were more likely to have low physical activity (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI] for men: 1.37, 1.12 to 1.68; for women: 1.30, 1.09 to 1.55). Non-working status was significantly associated with low physical activity (men: 2.03, 1.65 to 2.49; women: 1.94, 1.60 to 2.34). Detriments to the social network were significantly associated with low physical activity (men: 1.71, 1.41 to 2.08; women: 1.79, 1.51 to 2.13). CONCLUSION: Place of residence and social factors were associated with physical activity levels in elderly survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake. The findings suggest a need for improvement of social factors to encourage increases in physical activity for elderly persons after disaster."
26613821,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of an educational program based on the PRECEDE model to improve sexual function among women with hysterectomy. METHODS: The present randomized trial, conducted in Iran during 2014, included 48 women with hysterectomy who were selected through convenience sampling and randomly divided into two equal groups. Women in the experimental group received an educational program based on constructs of the PRECEDE model. The control group received only routine interventions. Before the interventions, the women completed two questionnaires: one that measured the PRECEDE model constructs and the Rosen Female Sexual Function Index. The questionnaires were repeated 4 weeks after the intervention and the results were compared within and between groups. RESULTS: In each group, a significant improvement in sexual function was demonstrated after the intervention (P<0.001). The mean sexual function score increased to a greater extent in the experimental group (difference 16.95+/-6.33) than in the control group (difference 4.35+/-1.94; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings confirm the effectiveness of an educational program based on the PRECEDE model in terms of improving sexual function among women with hysterectomy.

6505746,1,a,"This study investigates the delivery of all aspects of Primary Health Care (PHC) in a case study of one urban health centre in Maputo, Mozambique. Within the context of overall social and economic change, Mozambique has given priority to primary health care as the driving force in its newly developed National Health Service. The urban and rural health centres are intended to be the principal vehicles for PHC delivery, and in this study one of Maputo's recently opened health centres was investigated by observing all clinic sessions, interviewing all health centre workers and collecting data from health centre records. It was found that a dichotomy exists between the tasks ascribed to the health centre in the PHC framework, and the feasibility of their execution given existing personnel and material resources. This derives in part from lack of involvement of PHC practitioners in the organisation and planning of PHC, plus resource allocation which remains in favour of secondary and tertiary rather than primary care. Prevention is accorded priority in PHC theory, yet investigation showed that the major demand on the health centre is for curative care. The quality of both curative and preventive care was evaluated and the need for training in specialist diagnostic skills, and a more socially-based understanding of the determinants of health status and risk emerged, respectively for the groups of workers in the two sectors. The level of contact between the curative and preventive sectors was investigated as was the integration of the health centre into the health service as a whole. The problems arising in these areas must be viewed in the context of the very recent development of a National Health Service in a country where, previously, curative care was available only in urban areas and virtually no preventive programmes existed. This study shows that significant steps are being taken to develop a comprehensive PHC programme in Maputo. More important still will be the extension of this level of care provision to the country as a whole."
25885537,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Addressing the social determinants of health (SDH) is identified as a role for local public health units (PHUs) in the province of Ontario. Despite this authorization to do so there is wide variation in PHU practice. In this article we consider the factors that shape local PHU action on the SDH through a critical realist analysis. METHODS: Interviews with Medical Officers of Health (MOHs) and lead staff from nine PHUs in Ontario identify the structures and powers that allow PHUs to address the SDH as well as the many factors that either activate or inhibit these structures and powers. RESULTS: We found that personal backgrounds and attitudes of MOHs and leading staff people as well as local jurisdictional characteristics shape whether and how PHUs carry out SDH-related activities. CONCLUSIONS: Action on the SDH is a result of a complex interplay of micro-, meso- and macro-level factors that requires recognition of the contested nature of public health, presence of Ministry of Health mandates, local jurisdictional characteristics, and politics. The most effective way to assure PHU action on the SDH is for the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to mandate such activities and develop accountability mechanisms that assure implementation."
31704765,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: African American (AA) women have reported hair maintenance as a barrier to regular exercise; however, to our knowledge, this study is the first to identify primary care provider thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge regarding hair as a barrier to increased physical activity among AA females. METHODS: A 13-question electronic survey was sent via email to 151 clinicians working within a department of family medicine's 8 ambulatory clinics within a large urban academic medical center. RESULTS: A total of 62 primary care clinicians completed the survey, which is a response rate of 41%. The vast majority of respondents (95%) sometimes/often engage in discussions with AA female patients regarding physical activity. However, 76% of respondents have never included a hairstyling or maintenance assessment in that discussion and only 34% noted being comfortable discussing this topic. Among a list of potential barriers to exercise, hair maintenance/scalp perspiration was rarely endorsed as important by clinicians. DISCUSSION: This study highlights a need for increased education among primary care providers regarding AA hair care and maintenance practices as a barrier to increased physical activity in AA women. If specific barriers to increasing healthy habits among AA women are to be addressed, there must be a baseline knowledge of hair care and maintenance barriers, an understanding of the strong influence of cultural norms and practices as it relates to physical activity and exercise, and an increased comfortability when engaging in difficult cross-cultural conversations to ultimately improve health outcomes in AA females."
3434411,1,a,"This study is concerned with the effect of age, sex, social class, and quality of family interaction on the future orientation of adolescents aged 10-11, 14-15, and 17-19 years. Seventy-three girls and 75 boys were interviewed about their future hopes and fears. The content and extension of each aim and fear as well as the amount of planning, knowledge, and perceived locus of control involved was estimated from answers. The contents of aims and fears were closely related to the developmental tasks. Nearly half the subjects were afraid of war. The extension of subjects' future orientation decreased, whereas their knowledge about the future increased with age. The subjects from the higher social classes were oriented farther into the future than those from the lower classes. An interpretation emphasizing the importance of the principal developmental tasks on young people's future orientation is discussed."
29433468,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major global public health problem with more than 800,000 incidents worldwide annually. Seventy-five percent of the global suicides occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pakistan is a LMIC where information on suicidal behavior is limited. The aim of the review is to map available literature on determinants, risk factors and other variables of suicidal behavior in Pakistan. METHOD: This study was based on Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework of scoping review, combining peer reviewed publications with grey literature. Ten databases including Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Cochrane Trials Register (CRG), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), National Library of Medicine Gateway (NLMG), ExcerptaMedica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE (PUBMED), PSYCHINFO, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (SCI) and Pakmedinet.com were searched from the beginning of their time frames until December 2016 using a combination of key terms. The inclusion criteria included studies of various study designs covering different aspects of suicidal behavior in English language. RESULTS: Six hundred and twenty three articles were initially retrieved from all ten databases. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts for relevance. One hundred and eighteen articles were read in full, out of which 11 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria. One hundred and ten articles, including two student theses and one report, were included in the final review. Most studies were descriptive in nature, with only three that used a case-control design. Majority of the studies were from urban areas, and addressed determinants rather than risk factors. Gender differences and age were predominantly reported, with more males committing suicide. Suicidal behavior was more common among individuals younger than 30 years of age. The three most common methods for suicides were hanging, poisoning and use of firearms. Mental illness as a risk factor for suicides was mentioned in only three studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first attempt to synthesize available literature on suicidal behavior in Pakistan. The evidence is limited, and calls for more robust analytical research designs, along with a focus on risk factors."
7112177,1,a,"Abortion rates in the United States have risen annually since the 1973 Supreme Court decision. The regions with the greatest rate increases are the Southern and Plains states; the lowest rate increases were in regions which had high abortion rates soon after abortion was legalized. While spatial contiguity appears to influence abortion rates, that is, states with high rates of abortion are clustered spatially, social and political influence are also evident. Ratification of the equal rights amendment, the seeking of abortion outside the state of residence, and the degree of urbanization within a state are variables which influenced U.S. abortion rates between 1973 and 1977."

3227366,1,a,"Self-evaluated health represents an important aspect of quality of life that may influence the rehabilitation process after a major illness. However, health is a multi-dimensional concept and relatively little is known about the determinants of, and the interrelationships between the separate aspects of health. In a prospective longitudinal study of myocaridal infarction (MI) patients, two indices of self-evaluated health, maximal physical ability (MPA) and perceived global health (PGH), were used. On the average, both ratings were clearly reduced compared with pre-MI levels even as long as 3-5 yr after the MI. Females and older patients indicated lower MPA before and after the MI, whereas PGH was not related to any sociodemographic variable. The severity of the MI appeared to be of relatively limited importance for self-evaluated health. Heart-related symptoms before and after the MI were more strongly related to lower MPA, whereas non-cardiac health problems and psychological distress more clearly influenced PGH. However, initial illness perceptions were of some importance for both health perceptions. The data suggest that to some extent self-evaluated health can be influenced by educational or psychological support in order to faccilitate readaption and recovery after a MI."
24602579,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Screening and management of the social determinants of health (SDH) are critical for child health promotion. We sought to evaluate the impact of a facilitated video curriculum on resident SDH screening competence, parental perceptions of resident practice, resident-initiated referrals to a medical-legal partnership (MLP), and formula distribution to food-insecure families. METHODS: This was a pre-post study with concurrent control performed at a large pediatric residency program. Second- and third-year residents were assigned to control and intervention groups on the basis of their continuity clinic day. The curriculum included videotaped vignettes of screening for SDH and a ""day in the life"" series of families describing the impact of intervention on their lives. Residents completed self-assessments on screening competence and resource knowledge. After a well-child encounter, families (3 per resident) assessed their level of trust and respect for the resident and the number of SDHs screened for. MLP referral rates and formula distribution were compared. RESULTS: The intervention group's self-assessed competence in screening for housing, benefits, and educational concerns was significantly higher compared to controls (each P </= .05). Parents' rating of trust and respect was high and did not differ between groups. Screening for each SDH was higher in the intervention group with domestic violence (odds ratio 2.16, 95% confidence interval 1.01-4.63) and depression (odds ratio 2.63, 95% confidence interval 1.15-5.99), reaching statistical significance. MLP referral rates increased (P = .06), and formula distribution (P = .02) reached statistical significance in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: This SDH video curriculum improved resident self-assessed screening competence, parental perception of screening, and both MLP referrals and formula distribution."

AIM: This study was done to identify the factors contributing to better coverage of maternal care services among the tribal women in Kerala and to study the reasons for remaining differences that exists in utilization of services between tribal and non-tribal pregnant women. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a descriptive cum qualitative study conducted in Thariode Gramapanchayat in the Wayanad district of Kerala. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among all women who had registered their pregnancies in the 5 sub-centres under CHC Thariode and had delivered between September 2009 and October 2010, equal numbers of tribal and non-tribal ante-natal women, 35 each were interviewed in-depth using a semi-structured questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS Version 16.0. Content analysis was done for qualitative data. RESULTS: The determinants of utilization in tribal women were general awareness, affordability, accessibility and quality of services along with motivation by health workers. Among tribal antenatal women, 85% utilized maternal health care facilities fully compared to 100% among non-tribal women. Lower levels of education and lack of transport facilities were prime factors contributing to under utilization by tribal women. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable, accessible and good quality of services in the public health system in Kerala and motivation by health workers were important contributing factors for better utilization of maternal care services."
27854526,0,a,"Counterfactual frameworks and statistical methods for supporting causal inference are powerful tools to clarify scientific questions and guide analyses in public health research. Counterfactual accounts of causation contrast what would happen to a population's health under alternative exposure scenarios. A long-standing debate in counterfactual theory relates to whether sex, race, and biological characteristics, including obesity, should be evaluated as causes, given that these variables do not directly correspond to clearly defined interventions. We argue that sex, race, and biological characteristics are important health determinants. Quantifying the overall health effects of these variables is often a natural starting point for disparities research. Subsequent assessments of biological or social pathways mediating those effects can facilitate the development of interventions designed to reduce disparities."
7202850,1,a,"Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children."
3686078,1,a,"Lifestyles of groups and individuals are significant determinants of the health status of a population. Behaviour with respect to such areas as alcohol, food, drugs, tobacco, physical exercise, etc., correlates with medical and social well-being and are thus on the agenda for modern health care. The present article reports a study of how such lifestyle habits, notably alcohol and tobacco consumption, are addressed in medical consultations. The results indicate that the areas of smoking and drinking are sensitive and that specific communicative strategies are used for introducing these topics and for eliciting information. Smoking habits are addressed in 75% of the consultations and alcohol habits in 30%. In most cases, the information exchanged is shallow and gives only a fragmentary picture of patients' habits. There is little evidence of attempts to influence patients' attitudes and behaviours and the physicians do not contextualise possible relationships between such lifestyle habits and health in the light of their medical knowledge. In this sense, a potentially very influential face-to-face encounter is not used as a vehicle for attempting to eliminate such significant causes of poor health."
3619566,1,a,"The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of the use of blood glucose tests by young diabetic children participating in a summer educational program. 425 children and adolescents with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were studied. The main source of the data was a questionnaire filled by the children and their parents about the use of urine and blood glucose tests during the 8 weeks before the camp and a questionnaire filled in by the Aide aux Jeunes Diabetiques (AJD) doctors about the practical knowledge of the management of the disease. The children were divided into 2 groups according to the level of their practical knowledge, ""good"" (n = 153) and ""less good"" (n = 272). In the whole group, the mean number of urine tests per day was 2.8, 75% of the children performing 3 tests per day and 4.3% not doing any urine tests. The number of blood tests is more variable; from 0 to 28 per week, with a mean of 5.6. In the group having ""good"" practical knowledge, the blood glucose tests were done 6 times per week, in connection with the number of hypoglycemia at home (p less than 0.01), the number of daily insulin injections (p less than 0.01) and the number of insulin supplements (p less than 0.05); there was a partial substitution between blood and urine tests. In the group having ""less good"" practical knowledge, the number of blood tests was 4 per week; it was not statistically different, but it was performed in the absence of detectable reasons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
28971692,0,a,"It is important to consider health inequities when exploring the extent to which school food programs may contribute to the stigmatization and social exclusion of families experiencing food insecurity. As part of a broader school-based project, this paper considers evidence derived from a secondary analysis of research in Nova Scotia (NS). In the original research, interviews were conducted with key stakeholders involved in supporting health promotion activities across NS elementary schools. For this article, data were re-examined using tenets of critical discourse analysis to evaluate if school practices were addressing the root social issues by identifying patterns in language and institutional norms. Our findings suggested that further illumination of programs may be needed to ensure that they do not contribute to the stigmatization and social exclusion of families experiencing food insecurity. Nutrition professionals are in a position to engage families experiencing food insecurity in policy action that will shift from a focus on individual determinants towards the social-structural conditions that underlie the complex issue of food insecurity."
22852076,0,a,"Aims and Objectives. This paper provides an overview of the applicability of the PRECEDE-PROCEED Model to the development of targeted nursing led chronic illness interventions. Background. Changing health care practice is a complex and dynamic process that requires consideration of social, political, economic, and organisational factors. An understanding of the characteristics of the target population, health professionals, and organizations plus identification of the determinants for change are also required. Synthesizing this data to guide the development of an effective intervention is a challenging process. The PRECEDE-PROCEED Model has been used in global health care settings to guide the identification, planning, implementation, and evaluation of various health improvement initiatives. Design. Using a reflective case study approach, this paper examines the applicability of the PRECEDE-PROCEED Model to the development of targeted chronic care improvement interventions for two distinct Australian populations: a rapidly expanding and aging rural population with unmet palliative care needs and a disadvantaged urban community at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Results. The PRECEDE-PROCEED Model approach demonstrated utility across diverse health settings in a systematic planning process. In environments characterized by increasing health care needs, limited resources, and growing community expectations, adopting planning tools such as PRECEDE-PROCEED Model at a local level can facilitate the development of the most effective interventions. Relevance to Clinical Practice. The PRECEDE-PROCEED Model is a strong theoretical model that guides the development of realistic nursing led interventions with the best chance of being successful in existing health care environments."
31446632,0,a,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Problematic alcohol consumption (PAC) affects one-third of homeless Australians, and it is expected that the rates will increase as the population ages. However, current policy does not recognise the importance of this problem. The aim of this narrative review was to examine the social determinants and other risk factors contributing to PAC in homeless Australians, the barriers to receiving help and possible solutions for the Australian context. METHODS: PubMed and PsycINFO databases and Australian government websites were examined for the keywords ""alcohol"" and ""homeless,"" and pertinent articles were selected for inclusion and for citation tracking of further relevant articles. RESULTS: The causes of PAC in homeless Australians are multifactorial, and multidirectional, and include risk factors such as low socio-economic status, mental illness and having experienced trauma. There is significant stigma associated with both homelessness and PAC, which further isolates this group. Current policies to address PAC in the homeless are inadequate; however, there are a range of possible programs to reduce PAC in this group, and international harm reduction strategies have also shown success in improving outcomes for this group. CONCLUSION: There are numerous social risk factors that influence the development of PAC in the homeless. The introduction of harm reduction strategies, programs to enhance motivation and personal skills, as well as better mental health treatment, would all fill important gaps in services for homeless Australians with PAC. SO WHAT?: Health professionals can be advised that there are many social determinants that influence PAC in homeless Australians. There are important structural barriers to providing this marginalised group with the services they require; however, there is scope for the introduction of new programs, including harm reduction strategies, to meet the fundamental needs of this group."
24456203,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has fairly good coverage but very low utilization of health care services. Emergency medical care services require fast, correct and curious services to clients as they present with acute problems. In Ethiopia and Gondar in particular, the quality of emergency medical care has not been studied. The main aim of this study was to assess the disease profile and patients' satisfaction in Gondar University Referral Hospital (GURH). METHODS: A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted among patients visiting GURH for emergency care. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of University of Gondar. Patients were selected by systematic random sampling, using patient flow list in the day and night emergency services. Data were collected using a standard Press Ganey questionnaire by BSc health science graduates. Data were entered in to Epi Info 3.5.3 software and exported to SPSS version 20.0 for windows for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 963 patients (response rate = 96.8%) were studied. The mean (+ s.d.) age of patients was 28.4 (+17.9) years. The overall satisfaction using the mean score indicates that 498 (51.7%) 95%CI: (48.4% - 54.9%) were satisfied with the service, the providers and the facility suitability whereas 465(48.3%) 95%CI: (45.1%- 51.6%) were not satisfied. Seven hundred and six (73.3%) 95%CI: 70.4%-76.1%, patients reported that they have been discriminated or treated badly during the service provision in the hospital. OPD site visited (p < 0.0001), visiting days of the week (P < 0.049), medical condition on arrival (P < 0.0001), degree of confidence in the hospital (AOR = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.1, 3.1), reported discrimination/bad treatment of patients with service (AOR = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.2, 0.7), were significantly associated determinants of patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Non-communicable disease emergencies like injuries and cardiovascular diseases are common. There is a low level of patient satisfaction related to lack of confidence in the hospital for treatment, discrimination towards patient care, and under and delayed treatment of patients who were not in serious medical conditions. Hospitals shall prepare themselves to address the increasing challenge of non-communicable disease emergencies. It is important to revise the service delivery in the emergency department to improve staff courtesy and politeness, commitment, reduce discrimination and bad treatment and proper triage of emergencies at all points of care to increase patient satisfaction giving emphasis to earlier working days."
31189640,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the degree of non-attendance of medical appointments, as well as to identify the social reasons behind the missed appointments, at an inner-city primary care clinic. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and survey. SETTING: Inner-city clinic in Saskatoon, Sask, serving a primarily low-income and First Nations population. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with appointments in the clinic between January 2016 and June 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of non-attended clinic appointments and the reasons for missed appointments. RESULTS: Of the 1976 booked appointments during the study period, 487 (24.6%) appointments were not attended. Among the patients with walk-in appointments, 123 (15.5%) of them left the clinic before seeing a physician. New patients had a high rate of non-attendance (44.4% did not show up to appointments). Among those who did not attend an appointment, 19.9% of them missed more than 1 appointment; 77.8% of missed appointments were made more than a week in advance of the appointment, and 51.7% of those who missed an appointment saw a physician at the clinic at a later date (18.5 days later on average). The most common reasons for non-attendance were forgetting the appointment or feeling too sick to attend. Social determinants such as transportation were also found to play a role in non-attendance. Most survey participants stated that a telephone call reminder would aid them in keeping their appointments. CONCLUSION: Non-attendance is a multifactorial issue that causes a considerable waste of resources, limits the provision of preventive care, and negatively affects patient health. As forgetting was found to be a frequent cause of missed appointments, introducing a telephone reminder system might be an affordable and effective first measure to address non-attendance. Factors associated with poverty and other social determinants of health also affect attendance and are more challenging to address."

24046215,0,a,"Asthma is an important public health problem in urban Latin America. This study aimed to analyze the role of socioeconomic and environmental factors as potential determinants of asthma symptoms prevalence in children from Latin American (LA) urban centers. We selected 31 LA urban centers with complete data, and an ecological analysis was performed. According to our theoretical framework, the explanatory variables were classified in three levels: distal, intermediate, and proximate. The association between variables in the three levels and prevalence of asthma symptoms was examined by bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis weighed by sample size. In a second stage, we fitted several linear regression models introducing sequentially the variables according to the predefined hierarchy. In the final hierarchical model Gini Index, crowding, sanitation, variation in infant mortality rates and homicide rates, explained great part of the variance in asthma prevalence between centers (R(2) = 75.0 %). We found a strong association between socioeconomic and environmental variables and prevalence of asthma symptoms in LA urban children, and according to our hierarchical framework and the results found we suggest that social inequalities (measured by the Gini Index) is a central determinant to explain high prevalence of asthma in LA."
27210851,0,a,"Strengthening training (ST) and whole body vibration training (WBV) alone may improve symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. In this study, we investigated the effect of adding WBV training to quadriceps and hamstring muscles strengthening training on functional activity, pain, quality of life and muscle strength in patients with knee osteoarthritis. 28 volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups; 1) quadriceps and hamstring muscles strengthening training (ST group, 13 patients) and 2) quadriceps and hamstring muscles strengthening training along with WBV training (ST + WBV group, 15 patients). The treatment protocol for both groups involved 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. All measurements were performed before and after intervention. The measurements included: pain by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS), quality of life by means of the WOMAC scale, functional activity by the 2 min walking test (2MWT), time up & go test (TUGT) and 50-foot walking test (50FWT) and the muscle peak torque (MPT), total work (TW) and muscle power (MP) as muscle performance of quadriceps and hamstring muscles by an Isokinetic Biodex machine. After intervention, the comparison of mean changes between two groups showed improvement in the WBV + ST group in terms of 2MWT, MPT, TW and MP variables (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the experimental groups in term of pain, quality of life, TUGT and 50FWT. These results suggest that adding whole body vibration training to strengthening training may provide better treatment effects for patients with knee osteoarthritis."

6143404,1,a,"This paper uses a national probability sample to examine major correlates of drug use among American adults. Demographic correlates of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana, tranquilizer, sleeping pill and stimulant use are explained in terms of a self medication or coping perspective of drug use. Two analysis procedures are used. In the first, respondents were asked to list strategies they use when they have problems. These responses are 'broken down' by drug use categories or 'taking pills'. In the second procedure, attempts are made to interpret the correlations between age, sex, marital status, education and drug use by introducing variables which measure how respondents were experiencing fundamental aspects of their lives (role stress items) and mental health variables. A substantial portion of the variance in drug use that is explained by demographic variables appears to operate through social role and mental health variables, that is, these latter variables interpret the demographic/drug use relationships in a way that is consistent with a coping perspective. The authors conclude that these data and this analysis provided cautious support for a coping perspective."

26650382,0,a,"HIV is uncommon in most US counties but travels quickly through vulnerable communities when it strikes. Tracking behavior through social media may provide an unobtrusive, naturalistic means of predicting HIV outbreaks and understanding the behavioral and psychological factors that increase communities' risk. General action goals, or the motivation to engage in cognitive and motor activity, may support protective health behavior (e.g., using condoms) or encourage activity indiscriminately (e.g., risky sex), resulting in mixed health effects. We explored these opposing hypotheses by regressing county-level HIV prevalence on action language (e.g., work, plan) in over 150 million tweets mapped to US counties. Controlling for demographic and structural predictors of HIV, more active language was associated with lower HIV rates. By leveraging language used on social media to improve existing predictive models of geographic variation in HIV, future targeted HIV-prevention interventions may have a better chance of reaching high-risk communities before outbreaks occur."
3494378,1,a,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy."

25413492,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between intermediary social determinants, namely social support and social network with dental caries in adolescents. METHODS: An adapted version of the WHO social determinants of health conceptual framework was used to organize structural and intermediary social determinants of dental caries into six blocks including perceived social support and number of social networks. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a representative sample of 542 students between 12 and 14 years of age in public schools located in the city of Dourados, Brazil in 2012. The outcome variables were caries experience (DMFT >/= 1) and current dental caries (component D of DMFT >/= 1) recorded by a calibrated dentist. Individual interviews were performed to collect data on perceived social support and numbers of social networks from family and friends and covariates. Multivariate Poisson regressions using hierarchical models were conducted. RESULTS: The prevalence of adolescents with caries experience and current dental caries was 55.2% and 32.1%, respectively. Adolescents with low numbers of social networks and low levels of social support from family (PR 1.47; 95% CI = 1.01-2.14) were more likely to have DMFT >/= 1. Current dental caries was associated with low numbers of social networks and low levels of social support from family (PR 2.26; 95% CI = 1.15-4.44). CONCLUSION: Social support and social network were influential psychosocial factors to dental caries in adolescents. This finding requires confirmation in other countries but potentially has implications for programmes to promote oral health."
6541496,1,a,"The effects of two methoxyindoles, melatonin (MEL) and 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTL), on partner investigation and other aspects of pair behaviour in the open field, were observed on male and female mice of the albino TO, and the pigmented C57BL/6 strains. Both indole derivatives are major secretory products of rodent (and human) pineal glands. They were administered by i.p. injection (100 micrograms/kg) to both members of the pair 1 h before each 10 min open field exposure. The testing took place on 3 consecutive days. There were no significant differences in behaviour over days, and group means were used in subsequent data analysis (MANOVA and Dunnet's test). Males, more socially active than the females in both strains, responded to MEL by a reduction in contact time; 5-MTL had the same effect on C57 males (TO males showed no change). Females, on the other hand, did not respond to MEL, and increased their social contact seeking after 5-MTL. There was no consistent effect of either indole on locomotion, and erratic (TO strain only) effects on defaecation. The data are discussed in terms of possible actions of pineal indoles on determinants of social behaviour."
2649990,1,a,"A social epidemiological approach has been used to study social factors associated with chronic disease, as well as to promote community-oriented intervention programs to modify risk for cardiovascular disease. The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk."
20933194,0,a,"PURPOSE: Macroeconomic improvements have been posited as an explanation of the decline in the Black preterm birth rate during the 1990s. This study assessed whether decreasing unemployment explained the decline in preterm, low birth weight births (PT-LBW) for Black women. METHODS: United States singleton births to non-Hispanic Black women ages 18 and over, conceived between 1990 and 2001, were pooled to examine PT-LBW trends by level of social advantage (approximated by education and marital status). The impact of the state-level unemployment rate in the first and second trimester of pregnancy was evaluated in multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: During the 1990s, PT-LBW declined 11% among disadvantaged (unmarried, less than high school educated) Black women. Although the unemployment rate and PT-LBW were positively related, decreases in unemployment did not explain the decline in PT-LBW. Instead, improvements in prenatal care utilization and smoking behavior largely accounted for the temporal trend. CONCLUSIONS: Macroeconomic improvements, measured by unemployment, only marginally contributed to the Black PT-LBW trend in the 1990s. To effect further reductions, future studies should investigate other possible determinants of the proximate behavioral changes that did explain the trend (e.g., Earned Income Tax Credit expansions, increased, cigarette taxes/smoking legislation)."
29914119,0,a,"The interoceanic highway (IOH) in Madre de Dios, Peru has driven dramatic change in the Peruvian Amazon basin. We conducted a mixed methods study to examine the impact of these changes on the subjective well-being (SWB) of four communities on the IOH. Themes that emerged qualitatively included changing health threats, environmental degradation, and the impact of increased migration. To achieve a higher level of SWB, respondents emphasized the need for higher incomes, opportunities to learn new skills, and a better education for their children. Potential threats to SWB included marital problems and poorer health. Quantitative analyses suggested that social support and a sense of security impacted reported SWB scores based on life satisfaction, and the impact of income on life satisfaction was mediated by food security. Although long-term residents felt that specific determinants of SWB had both increased (food variety, transport and access to work) and decreased (access to natural resources and hunting), the majority reported that their lives had improved overall. Health had been affected by the IOH in both negative ways (increased dengue and road accidents) and positive ways (improved access to health services). Our results suggest that the rapidly-changing communities near the IOH link well-being to health, income, community, and the environment."
21267367,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Only a limited proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders attend the healthcare facilities, and that too when the condition becomes severe. Treatment from unqualified medical practitioners and faith healers is a common practice, and is attributable to the delay in proper treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to understand the pathway of care adopted by psychiatric patients and its relationship with the socio-demographic determinants in the study population. The subjects were selected from urban specialty psychiatric hospitals and interviewed using a pre-tested, semi-structured interview schedule. The data was analyzed using SPSS v10.0 software. The Chi square test, T test, and Kruskall Wallis Test were used, as needed. RESULTS: A total of 295 patients (203 males) were included in this study. The majority of the patients (45%) were suffering from Bipolar affective disorders (45%), followed by schizophrenia (36%). The majority, 203 (68%), were from the rural area, with 94 patients being illiterate. The mean distance traveled for treatment was 249 km. The majority of these (69%) had first contacted faith healers and a qualified psychiatrist was the first contacted person for only 9.2% of the patients. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of psychiatric patients do not attend any health facility due to a lack of awareness about treatment services, the distance, and due to the fear of the stigma associated with treatment. The psychiatric patients first seek the help of various sources prior to attending a psychiatric health facility. The pathway adopted by these patients need to be kept in mind at the time of preparation of the mental health program."
25881160,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A life course perspective recognizes influences of socially patterned exposures on oral health across the life span. This study assessed the influence of early and later life social conditions on tooth loss and oral impacts on daily performances (OIDP) of people aged 65 and 70 years. Whether social inequalities in oral health changed after the usual age of retirement was also examined. In accordance with ""the latent effect life course model"", it was hypothesized that adverse early-life social conditions increase the risk of subsequent tooth loss and impaired OIDP, independent of later-life social conditions. METHODS: Data were obtained from two cohorts studies conducted in Sweden and Norway. The 2007 and 2012 waves of the surveys were used for the present study. Early-life social conditions were measured in terms of gender, education and country of birth, and later-life social conditions were assessed by working status, marital status and size of social network. Logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to analyse the data. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to adjust estimates for missing responses and loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Early-life social conditions contributed to tooth loss and OIDP in each survey year and both countries independent of later-life social conditions. Lower education correlated positively with tooth loss, but did not influence OIDP. Foreign country of birth correlated positively with oral impacts in Sweden only. Later-life social conditions were the strongest predictors of tooth loss and OIDP across survey years and countries. GEE revealed significant interactions between social network and survey year, and between marital status and survey year on tooth loss. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the latent effect life course model in that early and later life social conditions had independent effects on tooth loss and OIDP among the elderly in Norway and Sweden. Between age 65 and 70, inequalities in tooth loss related to marital status declined, and inequalities related to social network increased."
3435040,1,a,"A cohort of 1163 pregnant women in two small towns in South Wales, UK, was identified and followed until the children born to them were five years of age. Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers. There effects decreased with age but there were still residual effects at age five years."
6584748,1,a,"Maori mortality is compared with that of other New Zealanders aged 15-64 in the period 1974 to 1978.

Of the remaining excess, an estimated 15% is linked with cigarette smoking, 10% with alcohol consumption (excluding accidental cause of deaths), 5% with obesity and 17% was due to accidents. However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris. It is recommended that resources should be allocated so that Maori people can be employed to maintain contact with Maori patients with these diseases in order to improve health services utilisation and compliance with therapy. While it was not possible to determine socio-economic status for females from national mortality data, other findings were similar to those found for males except that mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease also contributed to the Maori excess."
7326949,1,a,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points."
22824498,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of tuberculosis has been shown to influence health seeking behaviour; and urban slum dwellers are at a higher risk of acquiring tuberculosis than the general population. The study aim was to assess knowledge of tuberculosis and identify the associated socio-demographic determinants, in order to inform tailored interventions for advocacy, communication and social mobilisation in three urban-slum communities of Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 1361 adults between April and October 2011. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of potential determinants of tuberculosis (TB) knowledge were estimated by multivariable ordinal logistic regression using Stata 11.2 software. RESULTS: We found low knowledge of TB cause (26.7%); symptoms (46.8%), transmission (54.3%), prevention (34%) and free treatment (35%). Knowledge about TB treatment (69.4) and cure (85.1) was relatively high. Independent determinants of poor knowledge of TB in the multivariable analysis included (aOR, 95% CI) lack of formal education (0.56; 0.38 - 0.83, P = 0.004), unemployment (0.67; 0.49 - 0.90, P = 0.010) and never testing for HIV (0.69; 0.51 - 0.92, P < 0.012). Whilst, older age (1.73; 1.30 - 2.29, P < 0.001) and residing in Lira (2.02; 1.50 - 2.72, P < 0.001) were independent determinants of higher knowledge of TB. CONCLUSION: This study revealed deficiencies in the public health knowledge about TB symptoms, diagnosis and treatment among urban-slum dwellers in Uganda. Tuberculosis control programmes in similar settings should consider innovative strategies for TB education, advocacy, communication and social mobilisation to reach the youth, unemployed and less-educated; as well as those who have never tested for HIV."
10287174,1,a,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
31856209,0,a,"Nearly half of all deaths among children under five (U5) years in low- and middle-income countries are a result of under nutrition. This study examined the relationship between maternal employment and nutrition status of U5 children in Uganda using the 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) data. We used a weighted sample of 3531 children U5 years born to working women age 15-49. Chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between maternal employment and nutritional outcomes while adjusting for other explanatory factors. Results show that children whose mothers had secondary education had lower odds of stunting and underweight compared with children whose mothers had no formal education. Children who had normal birth weight had lower odds of stunting, wasting and being underweight compared with children with low birth weight. Children whose mothers engaged in agriculture and manual work had higher odds of stunting compared with those whose mothers engaged in professional work. Additionally, children whose mothers were employed by nonfamily members had higher odds of wasting and being underweight compared with children whose mothers were employed by family members. Other determinants of child nutritional status included region, age of the mother, and age and sex of the child. Interventions aimed at improving the nutritional status of children of employed women should promote breastfeeding and flexible conditions in workplaces, target those of low socio-economic status and promote feeding programs and mosquito net use for both mothers and children."
3169388,1,a,"A prospective study was carried out on 133 neurologically deviant infants, 205 with mild abnormalities and 230 normal newborns to compare behavioural and cognitive development with neonatal and nine-year-old neurological condition. Overtly handicapped children were excluded. Major determinants of school failure were the severity of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) and social class. Main risk factors for distractable and clumsy behaviour were MND classification and male sex; for troublesome behaviour male sex and interval complications after two years of age; and for timid behaviour, family adversity. Definite neonatal neurological deviancy contributed both directly and by its association with MND to problems in behaviour and scholastic abilities. Mild neonatal neurological abnormalities and adverse obstetrical events contributed only indirectly to behavioural and learning problems. Preterm birth (less than 34 weeks) was the sole obstetric variable directly related to some of the outcome variables. The difference between home and school perception of the children's behaviour is emphasized."
21862532,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the trend in the association between socioeconomic status and sex and median age at death from cystic fibrosis in England and Wales, over the past 50 years. DESIGN: Series of annual cross sectional studies of all registered deaths with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in England and Wales, from 1959 to 2008. METHODS: We obtained national mortality data for cystic fibrosis from the Office for National Statistics. From 1959 to 2000, the Registrar General's Social Class coded socioeconomic status as manual or non-manual. From 2001 onwards, the National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification was implemented and socioeconomic status was split into three groups: professional and managerial, intermediate, and routine and manual. We calculated median age at death for every study year. We calculated the effects of sex and socioeconomic status on the odds of death above the median age at death for every study decade using logistic regression. RESULTS: From 1959 to 2008, 6750 deaths were attributed to cystic fibrosis in England and Wales. Males were more likely to die above the annual median age at death than females (from 1959 to 1999, adjusted odds ratio for socioeconomic status 1.28, 95% confidence intervals 1.13 to 1.45; from 2000 to 2008, 1.57, 1.18 to 2.08). Individuals in the highest socioeconomic class were also more likely to die above the median age of death than those in the lowest socioeconomic class (from 1959 to 2000, adjusted odds ratio for sex 2.50, 2.16 to 2.90; from 2001 to 2008, 1.89, 1.20 to 2.97). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic status and sex remain strong determinants of survival from cystic fibrosis in England and Wales, and the magnitude of these effects does not appear to have substantially reduced over time."
28659703,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Hajj pilgrimage, in Saudi Arabia, is one of the world's largest religious mass gatherings. We have similar mass gathering scenarios in India such as the Amarnath Yatra and Kumbh. A unique combination of physical, physiological, and psychological factors makes this pilgrimage a very stressful milieu. We studied the emergence of psychopathology and its determinants, in this adverse environment in mass gathering situation, in Indian pilgrims on Hajj 2016. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study analyzing the mental morbidity in 1.36 lakh Indian pilgrims during Hajj 2016, using SPSS software version 19. RESULTS: Totally 182 patients reported psychological problems. Twenty-two patients (12%) required admission. Twelve (6.8%) pilgrims reported a past history of a mental illness. One hundred and sixty-five (93.2%) patients never had any mental symptoms earlier in life. The most common illnesses seen were stress related (45.7%) followed by psychosis (9.8%), insomnia (7.3%), and mood disorders (5.6%). The most common symptoms recorded were apprehension (45%), sleep (55%), anxiety (41%), and fear of being lost (27%). Psychotropics were prescribed for 46% of pilgrims. All patients completed their Hajj successfully and returned to India. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative stress causes full spectrum of mental decompensation, and prompt healing is aided by simple nonpharmacological measures including social support and counseling in compatible sociolinguistic milieu."
3862402,1,a,"Analysis of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption patterns recorded in pregnancy could not detect a harmful effect of alcohol at levels below 2 glasses a day. Total abstainers fared very slightly worse than those who drank occasionally.

There was evidence of an interaction between smoking and adverse social and parity factors in low birth-weight."
28869693,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), assess its influence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with TB. METHODS: In this prospective study, eligible patients at three primary healthcare centres in urban slum region of south Delhi, India, underwent blood glucose screening at treatment initiation. HRQoL scores were determined by conducting face-to-face interviews using Dhingra and Rajpal (DR-12) scale at pre-treatment, end of intensive phase and end of the treatment. RESULTS: In 316 patients, the overall DM prevalence was 15.8%, of whom 9.5% were known to have diabetes, and 6.3% were diagnosed at TB treatment initiation. DM was more common among patients of older age (P < 0.001), with higher BMI (P < 0.001), with PTB (P = 0.02) and with poor psychological status. HRQoL was significantly poor in the socio-psychological & exercise adaptation domain in patients with DM >50 years of age at each visit. Older age, poor literacy, loss in workdays, alcohol use and socio-economic status significantly predict poor HRQoL scores in patients with DM. Uncontrolled DM patients demonstrated poor HRQoL at the end of the intensive phase (P = 0.04) of treatment and at its completion (P = 0.03) compared to those with controlled DM. CONCLUSION: Addressing screening measures and glycaemic control along with social determinants such as literacy level and alcohol consumption could be an important means of improving the HRQoL of TB with DM patients."
3182366,1,a,"A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers."
30188344,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors are key determinants of health after upper extremity injuries. However, a systematic review is needed to understand which psychosocial factors are most consistently associated with disability and how the language, conceptualization, and types of measures used to assess disability impact these associations in upper extremity injuries. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What factors are most consistently associated with disability after upper extremity injuries in adults? (2) What are the trends in types of outcome measures and conceptualization of disability in patients' upper extremity injuries? METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases (PubMED, OVIDSP, PsycInfo, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science) between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2016, using terms related to the ""upper extremity"", ""outcome measurement"", and ""impairment, psychological, social or symptomatic"" variables. We included all studies involving adult patients with any musculoskeletal injury and excluded those that did not use patient-reported outcome measures. We identified and screened 9339 studies. Of these, we retained 41 studies that involved conditions ranging from fractures to soft tissue injuries in various regions of the arm. We conducted quality assessment using a 10-item validated checklist and a five-tier strength of evidence assessment. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria and registered the review before performing our search (PROSPERO: CRD42017054048). None of the authors received any funding to perform this work. RESULTS: Disability after upper extremity injury was most consistently associated with depression (21 cohorts), catastrophic thinking (13 cohorts), anxiety (11 cohorts), pain self-efficacy (eight cohorts), and pain interference (seven cohorts). Social and demographic factors were also associated with disability. Measures of impairment such as ROM and injury severity were least associated with disability. There has been a gradual increase in use of region or condition-specific patient-reported outcome measures and measures of psychological, social, and symptomatic factors over a period since the introduction of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) around 2000. Approximately 17% of studies (n = 454 of 2628) had instances of unclear, conflicting, or inappropriate terminology and 11% of studies (n = 257 of 2628) involved misrepresentations of outcome measures related to disability. CONCLUSIONS: Psychologic and social factors are most consistently associated with disability than factors related to impairment. Further research involving the assessment of depression, anxiety, and coping strategies in cohorts with specific injuries may support decision-making regarding the provision of emotional support and psychologic therapies during recovery. Using the WHO ICF framework to conceptualize disability is key in increasing strength of evidence and allowing accurate comparisons of research in this field. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study."

3992291,1,a,"The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed."

Particular attention is paid to pre-term infants and the biological roots of parenting."
29180552,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although treatment for new back pain is heavily guideline driven, deviations occur frequently. Neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) may contribute to these deviations. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether nSES is associated with type of treatment provided for patients seeking treatment for new back pain in primary care clinics. METHODS: This retrospective cohort was conducted in academic internal and family medicine practices. Data were examined from the Primary Care Patient Data Registry. Eligibility criteria included age >/=18 years, free of HIV and cancer, and presenting to primary care with a new diagnosis of back pain, resulting in1646 patients included. Patients' nSES was determined using ZIP code and calculating a validated index of 7 census-tract variables. Multinomial logistic regression was used to measure the association between nSES and 3 treatment outcomes compared with no pharmacologic management. Outcomes included opioid prescription, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID)/muscle relaxant prescription, or combined opioid/nonopioid treatment within 90 days of initial presentation. Covariates included age, sex, race, high clinic utilization (HCU), depression, anxiety, substance use, obesity, comorbidities, smoking, number of pain conditions, and physical therapy (PT) referral. RESULTS: The cohort was 67.9% female with an average age of 55.72 years (Standard Error [SE] = 0.387). Compared with no pharmacologic treatment, individuals in the low nSES group had 63% higher odds of receiving an opioid only compared with the high nSES group (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 2.62). There was no significant association between nSES and odds of nonopioid or combined treatment compared with no pharmacotherapy (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.50), (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.78), respectively. Covariates associated with increased odds of opioid only included HCU, ever smoker, and increasing comorbidity index. PT referral was associated with NSAID/muscle relaxant only, and increasing age and comorbidity index were inversely associated with odds of NSAID/muscle relaxant only. Finally, covariates associated with increased odds of receiving both therapies included high clinic utilizusation, ever smoking, and PT referral. CONCLUSIONS: These data characterize a possible association between low nSES and increased risk of receiving an opioid only when being treated for new back pain. This may be evidence that patients of low nSES are at increased risk of receiving guideline-noncompliant treatment for new back pain."
25158032,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: A large and growing proportion of the world's population rely on shared sanitation facilities that have historically been excluded from international targets due to concerns about acceptability, hygiene and access. In connection with a proposed change in such policy, we undertook this study to describe the prevalence and scope of households that report relying on shared sanitation and to characterise them in terms of selected socio-economic and demographic covariates. METHODS: We extracted data from the most recent national household surveys of 84 low- and middle-income countries from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. We describe the prevalence of shared sanitation and explore associations between specified covariates and reliance on shared sanitation using log-binomial regression. RESULTS: While household reliance on any type of shared sanitation is relatively rare in Europe (2.5%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (7.7%), it is not uncommon in the Americas (14.2%), Western Pacific (16.4%) and South-East Asia (31.3%), and it is most prevalent in Africa (44.6%) where many shared facilities do not meet the definition of 'improved' even if they were not shared (17.7%). Overall, shared sanitation is more common in urban (28.6%) than in rural settings (25.9%), even after adjusting for wealth. While results vary geographically, people who rely on shared sanitation tend to be poorer, reside in urban areas and live in households with more young children and headed by people with no formal education. Data from 21 countries suggest that most sharing is with neighbours and other acquaintances (82.0%) rather than the public. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of shared sanitation identified from these data suggest potential confounders that may explain the apparent increased health risk from sharing and should be considered in any policy recommendation. Both geographic and demographic heterogeneity indicate the need for further research to support a change in policies."

For this sample of 1,224 persons aged 60 years or older, having nonkin advisers, membership in clubs, or contacts with other community agencies and availability of transportation, education, and moderate-size kin networks predicted service awareness. Lack of available kin, the presence of large kin networks, having kin confidants, and being old, poor, and female, or black inhibited service awareness."
19795458,0,a,"Minimizing delays that may occur along the cancer care pathway requires an understanding of their determinants. Few studies on childhood cancers have been published on the factors that influence the time it takes for patients to get a first medical consultation (patient delay) and treatment (health care system [HCS] delay) once cancer symptoms have been recognized. Our objective was to assess factors related to disease, patient and HCS on patient and HCS delay for children and adolescents with leukemias and lymphomas in Canada. A prospective cohort study was conducted on subjects enrolled in the Treatment and Outcomes Surveillance program of the Canadian Childhood Cancer Surveillance and Control Program, a national surveillance program. We studied 963 leukemia and 397 lymphoma patients who were less than 19-years old at diagnosis in 1995-2000. Logistic regression models were used to measure the associations between candidate predictive factors and delays. Age was positively associated with patient delay for both leukemia and lymphoma patients, but not with HCS delay. Patients first seen in a hospital emergency room had a lower risk of HCS delay than patients first seen by a general practitioner. Cancer subtype was associated with patient delay for leukemia patients, and HCS delay for lymphoma patients. Longer patient delay was associated with a lower risk of long HCS delay for both cancers. Factors related to the patients, their disease and the HCS may exert different influences on varying segments of the care pathway of leukemia and lymphoma patients."
23704847,0,a,"Social determinants of health are the conditions in which individuals are born, grow, live, work, and age. Increasingly, they are being recognized for their relationship to the soaring incidence of Type 2 diabetes in the US, as well as the opportunities they present for us to counter it. Many current Type 2 diabetes interventions focus on biologic and behavioral factors, such as symptoms, diet, and physical activity. However, it is equally important to address the influence of physical and social environments, which may include low income, employment insecurity, low educational attainment, and poor living conditions, on health outcomes. Section 4302 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 offers an opportunity to improve data collection and policy development to more effectively identify populations at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes and to proactively refer them to appropriate social support services that may ultimately support reduction of health disparities. Expanding the scope of this legislation to include data that incorporate social determinants would improve the ability of clinicians and health systems to engage and to treat patients with chronic conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, while expanding policymakers' ability to conform to the legislation's intent of shaping efforts to reduce chronic conditions nationwide."
3714667,1,a,"Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in different socioeconomic and educational groups in Finland. The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers."
3724364,1,a,"The male C57BL/6 mice used in this study were the offspring either of untreated or lead treated (0.1% lead acetate (PbAc) instead of drinking water) parents. Offspring of lead treated parents were reared on 0.1% PbAc until weaning, and also given 0.5% PbAc to drink for 3 weeks prior to testing (Pb2 group). Offspring of untreated parents were either given 0.5% PbAc to drink (Pb1 group) or maintained on tap water throughout (Control group). Control (C) and lead treated mice were subdivided according to single- or group-housing; no confrontation (""unfought"") or confrontation with a trained aggressor mouse (""defeated""). All the mice were then given a hot-plate pain test, in which paw-lick and escape latencies were recorded. In untreated mice, latencies were reduced after defeat. This effect was not seen in lead treated animals. Lead treatment increased latencies in most instances relative to the appropriate control group. The paw-lick latencies were less consistently affected than the escape latencies. Escape latencies, with one exception, were longer in the Pb2 group than in the Pb1 group. Treatment with naloxone of single-housed C and Pb2 was without effect, except for Pb2 treated undefeated mice: here, naloxone abolished the analgesic effect of lead treatment. Lead-induced analgesia is discussed in terms of central mechanisms of pain reception."

23286930,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Minority ethnic groups are often assumed to exchange higher levels of informal support than the majority population, despite evidence that controlling for socioeconomic and health inequalities eliminates differences. Using a unique data set from England and Wales, we examined instrumental support across ethnic groups in mid and later life. METHOD: Employing data from the Home Office Citizenship Survey 2005 (N = 14,081), we investigated ethnic group differences in instrumental support among people aged 55 and older in England and Wales (n = 4,710). Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the determinants of support given and received, guided by the Andersen-Newman behavioral model. RESULTS: Compared with the White British group, the Indian group reported significantly higher odds (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-4.7) of receiving instrumental support from household members but significantly lower odds of giving support to relatives outside the household (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9). Three other ethnic groups (Pakistani and Bangladeshi, Mixed, Other) reported significantly lower odds in unadjusted findings, but when adjusted, ethnic group differences were no longer significant. DISCUSSION: Our analyses suggest few ethnic group differences in instrumental support once need and enabling factors were taken into account. Such findings are contrary to the belief that minority groups exchange more informal support and therefore have less need for formal services. The Andersen-Newman model is useful for guiding the analysis of support both given and received."
29239799,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Demographic, physical and psychological associations of successful aging (SA) have been evaluated, but occupational factors have not. Nor has SA been evaluated in a specific occupational group. The aims of this study were to examine the occupational associations of SA in older physicians, and to explore the concept of occupational SA. METHODS: Physicians aged 55+ years completed self-ratings of occupational and personal SA on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS; 1 being ""least successful"" and 10 ""most successful""). Associations between occupational and personal SA (defined as 8-10 on the VAS), respectively, and demographic and practice characteristics; health; social and financial resources; cognitive, emotional and motivational resources; work centrality; and anxiety about aging were examined. RESULTS: Rates of occupational SA (69.2%; 95% CI: 66.3-72.0) were significantly higher than personal SA (63.1%; 95% CI: 60.1-66.0) in the sample of 1,048 physicians. Occupational and personal SA were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.73, N = 1,041, p < 0.001). Personal SA was predicted by demographic (older age, female, international medical graduate, urban practice), physical (better self-rated health), psychological (less depression, better cognitive, emotional and motivational resources, and greater anxiety about aging), and occupational (higher work centrality, fewer practice adaptations and not intending to retire) factors. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational factors are central to physicians' self-conceptualization of SA. That greater work centrality, fewer work adaptations and less retirement planning were associated with personal SA suggests older physicians' sense of ""success"" is intertwined with continuing practice. There is a need for educating physicians to adapt to aging and retirement."
3705997,1,a,Forty-five severely obese patients were treated with jaw fixation as a means of initiating weight loss. Patients who reported eating for consolation showed significantly greater difficulties in maintaining the achieved weight loss than the others. This finding constitutes further evidence of a relationship between obesity and depression. Low capacity to experience feelings of aggressiveness also seems to be linked to poor treatment results.

Arteriographic cases (greater than or equal to 70% maximal stenosis) were compared with two control groups: arteriographic controls (entirely normal coronaries) and visitor controls. Findings suggest that there is a relation between exposure to both acute and chronic war events and coronary artery disease in this patient population. The reporting of exposure to acute war events was significantly higher in cases compared with both visitor controls (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.17-4.90) and arteriographic controls (OR = 2.8, 95% Cl 0.93-8.47). Crossing the ""green-lines"" that separate two belligerent sides, considered as an attribute of war-related chronic stress, was more frequent in cases compared with visitor controls (OR = 3.25, 95% Cl 1.54-6.89) and arteriographic controls (OR = 5.38, 95% Cl 1.65-17.6). The relation observed between wartime stress and coronary artery disease could not be explained by possible overreporting of stressful events in patients with suspected coronary artery disease or by an increase in clinical awareness for the disease for those under continuous stress. Adjusting for the effect of the well-established coronary artery disease risk factors did not alter the above findings."
30514272,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Society demands a university education grounded on ethical principles. Education in ethics values is responsibility of universities but will not be viable unless also adopted by directly responsible agents, the teachers who work with the students. For this reason, our primary research objective was to conduct an in-depth analysis of how Health Sciences students self-perceive the ethical dimension. METHODS: A mixed research methodology with two phases, qualitative and quantitative, allowed us to address our research question from two complementary viewpoints. Conversational interviews were conducted in an intentional and purposive sample to identify a wide range of discursive representations. A questionnaire was designed based on previous studies and the topics of qualitative research. The response format for the questionnaire followed a Likert scale and modulators such as sex, age, degree and the score of a social desirability test were examined. RESULTS: After 24 conversational interviews, three main thematic blocks (coinciding with the three subscales of the questionnaire) were identified: ""attitudes for harmony in human relations"", ""construction of the self"" and ""rules and regulations"". A total of 246 students completed a questionnaire with 39 items. The total scores ranged from 93 to 152 points, with an average score of 122.72 +/- 10.64 points. Responsibility, the basic rules of education and respect were perceived as the two most important values, whereas solidarity and social participation as the least important. Results showed a significant positive linear correlation between total score on the questionnaire and age and social desirability. Age was also a significant predictor for the total score and the subscale score ""rules and regulations"". The students responses seemed to be conditioned by the degree of social desirability that they present. CONCLUSIONS: The ad-hoc questionnaire captured the maintenance of high ethical values in our college undergraduate students, which may be directly related to enhanced social desirability. The scores obtained on the questionnaire were correlated with the students' age, which may indicate that values might tend to acquire progressively more importance as students grow older. Further research is warranted to delve deeper on the determinants of professionalism and ethical decision-making in college students."
30132381,0,a,"The quality of decision and assessment of risk are key determinants of successful sport performance. Athletes differ fundamentally in their decision-making ability according to their athletic expertise level. Moreover, given the influence of emotions on decision-making, it is likely that a trait reflecting emotional functioning, trait emotional intelligence, may also influence decision-making. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the respective contribution of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence to non-athletic decision-making. In total, 269 participants aged between 18 and 26 years with a range of athletic experience i.e. none (n = 71), novice (n = 54), amateur (n = 55), elite (n = 45) and super-elite (n = 44), completed the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Cambridge Gambling Task. Regression modelling indicated a significant positive relationship of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence with the quality of decision-making, and a negative relationship with deliberation time and risk-taking. Cognitive skills transfer may explain the higher decision-making scores associated with higher athletic expertise, while individuals with higher trait emotional intelligence may anticipate better the emotional consequences linked with a gambling task, which may help individuals make better decisions and take less risks."
3723341,1,a,"We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report."

30058744,0,a,"BACKGROUND: According to Florence Nightingale's hypothesis, the environment can play a central role in the healing of the patient's body and mind. The nurse should, therefore, strive to provide a healing and stress-reducing environment for patients about to undergo invasive procedures. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the effects of environmental factors on anxiety as experienced by patients in waiting rooms prior to coronary angiography. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 200 patients undergoing coronary angiography in an urban area of Iran were assigned randomly to the following intervention groups: (1) nature sounds; (2) nature sounds and daylight; (3) nature sounds, daylight, and colour enhancements; and (4) control. Portable monitors were used to measure the patients' physiological indices upon admission and 30 and 60 minutes thereafter. RESULTS: Patients who experienced environmental affecting interventions had significantly lower physiological indices of anxiety than the control group (P < 0.001). Some significance was demonstrated between the three interventions groups, with patients in the intervention group that experienced maximum environmental interventions demonstrating the most overall reduction in anxiety indices. CONCLUSION: Environmental factors were shown to have a positive effect on the indices of anxiety experienced by patients waiting for the procedure of coronary angiography; this is therefore an area of study and practice worthy of further development."
7031748,1,a,"Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes."
26355702,0,a,"Disease self-management is a critical component of maintaining clinical stability for patients with chronic illness. This is particularly evident in the context of heart failure (HF), which is the leading cause of hospitalization for older adults. HF self-management, commonly known as HF self-care, is often performed with the support of informal caregivers. However, little is known about how a HF dyad manages the patient's care together. The purpose of this study was to identify determinants of patient and caregiver contributions to HF self-care maintenance (daily adherence and symptom monitoring) and management (appropriate recognition and response to symptoms), utilizing an approach that controls for dyadic interdependence. This was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from 364 dyads of Italian HF patients and caregivers. Multilevel modeling was used to identify determinants of HF self-care within patient-caregiver dyads. Patients averaged 76.2 (SD = 10.7) years old, and a slight majority (56.9%) was male, whereas caregivers averaged 57.4 (SD = 14.6) years old, and about half (48.1%) were male. Most caregivers were adult children (48.4%) or spouses (32.7%) of patients. Both patients and caregivers reported low levels of HF maintenance and management behaviors. Significant individual and dyadic determinants of self-care maintenance and self-care management included gender, quality of life, comorbid burden, impaired ADLs, cognition, hospitalizations, HF duration, relationship type, relationship quality, and social support. These comprehensive dyadic models assist in elucidating the complex nature of patient-caregiver relationships and their influence on HF self-care, leading to more effective ways to intervene and optimize outcomes."
6656327,1,a,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension."
23375367,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The authors designed an instrument to measure objectively aspects of the built and food environments in urban areas, the EURO-PREVOB Community Questionnaire, within the EU-funded project 'Tackling the social and economic determinants of nutrition and physical activity for the prevention of obesity across Europe' (EURO-PREVOB). This paper describes its development, reliability, validity, feasibility and relevance to public health and obesity research. STUDY DESIGN: The Community Questionnaire is designed to measure key aspects of the food and built environments in urban areas of varying levels of affluence or deprivation, within different countries. The questionnaire assesses (1) the food environment and (2) the built environment. METHODS: Pilot tests of the EURO-PREVOB Community Questionnaire were conducted in five to 10 purposively sampled urban areas of different socio-economic status in each of Ankara, Brno, Marseille, Riga, and Sarajevo. Inter-rater reliability was compared between two pairs of fieldworkers in each city centre using three methods: inter-observer agreement (IOA), kappa statistics, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Data were collected successfully in all five cities. Overall reliability of the EURO-PREVOB Community Questionnaire was excellent (inter-observer agreement (IOA) > 0.87; intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)s > 0.91 and kappa statistics > 0.7. However, assessment of certain aspects of the quality of the built environment yielded slightly lower IOA coefficients than the quantitative aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The EURO-PREVOB Community Questionnaire was found to be a reliable and practical observational tool for measuring differences in community-level data on environmental factors that can impact on dietary intake and physical activity. The next step is to evaluate its predictive power by collecting behavioural and anthropometric data relevant to obesity and its determinants."
2629118,1,a,"The relationships between employment status and Type A behavior pattern have been investigated with data from the first MONICA Survey Augsburg, F.R.G., 1984/85 (MONICA = Monitoring of trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). Study population was a two-stage cluster sample of 5312 men and women, aged 25-64 (response 79.4%). Measurement instruments were interviews and a self-administered questionnaire. Type A was measured by the Framingham Type A behavior scale. In multiple logistic regression analyses. Type A behavior among men was studied as a function of various occupational positions [blue-collar, white-collar, civil (public) servants, self-employed], controlling for age, educational level, marital status, and interaction effects. In those analyses it was found that the occupational position 'self-employed' was the best predictor of Type A behavior (odds ratio 3.0 compared to blue-collar employees). Since most of the employed women were white-collar employees (a very homogeneous group) Type A behavior among women was studied as a function of full-time and part-time employment, with the same control variables as were included in the analyses for men. Taking into account the statistical significant interaction effect age by employment, it could be shown that the odds of being Type A for a 50 yr old woman was 3.5 compared to a housewife at the same age. In summary the findings show strong relationships between work situation and Type A behavior for both men and women. Especially the self-employed men have more Type A behavior patterns, so may have higher CHD risk."
3619566,1,a,"The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of the use of blood glucose tests by young diabetic children participating in a summer educational program. 425 children and adolescents with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were studied. The main source of the data was a questionnaire filled by the children and their parents about the use of urine and blood glucose tests during the 8 weeks before the camp and a questionnaire filled in by the Aide aux Jeunes Diabetiques (AJD) doctors about the practical knowledge of the management of the disease. The children were divided into 2 groups according to the level of their practical knowledge, ""good"" (n = 153) and ""less good"" (n = 272). In the whole group, the mean number of urine tests per day was 2.8, 75% of the children performing 3 tests per day and 4.3% not doing any urine tests. The number of blood tests is more variable; from 0 to 28 per week, with a mean of 5.6. In the group having ""good"" practical knowledge, the blood glucose tests were done 6 times per week, in connection with the number of hypoglycemia at home (p less than 0.01), the number of daily insulin injections (p less than 0.01) and the number of insulin supplements (p less than 0.05); there was a partial substitution between blood and urine tests. In the group having ""less good"" practical knowledge, the number of blood tests was 4 per week; it was not statistically different, but it was performed in the absence of detectable reasons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
23186253,0,a,"BACKGROUND: School dropout is a persisting problem with major socioeconomic consequences. Although poor health probably contributes to pathways leading to school dropout and health is likely negatively affected by dropout, these issues are relatively absent on the public health agenda. This emphasises the importance of integrative research aimed at identifying children at risk for school dropout at an early stage, discovering how socioeconomic status and gender affect health-related pathways that lead to dropout and developing a prevention tool that can be used in public health services for youth. METHODS/DESIGN: The SIODO study is a sequential mixed-methods study. A case-control study will be conducted among 18 to 24 year olds in the south of the Netherlands (n = 580). Data are currently being collected from compulsory education departments at municipalities (dropout data), regional public health services (developmental data from birth onwards) and an additional questionnaire has been sent to participants (e.g. personality data). Advanced analyses, including cluster and factor analyses, will be used to identify children at risk at an early stage. Using the quantitative data, we have planned individual interviews with participants and focus groups with important stakeholders such as parents, teachers and public health professionals. A thematic content analysis will be used to analyse the qualitative data. DISCUSSION: The SIODO study will use a life-course perspective, the ICF-CY model to group the determinants and a mixed-methods design. In this respect, the SIODO study is innovative because it both broadens and deepens the study of health-related determinants of school dropout. It examines how these determinants contribute to socioeconomic and gender differences in health and contributes to the development of a tool that can be used in public health practice to tackle the problem of school dropout at its roots."
27859423,0,a,"Nowadays, obesity is considered as a serious and growing global health problem. It is documented that the overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a series of noncommunicable diseases, and in recent years, the obesity-cancer link has received much attention. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including colon, breast, endometrium, liver, kidney, esophagus, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, and leukemia, and can also lead to poorer treatment. We review here the epidemiological and experimental evidences for the association between obesity and cancer. Specifically, we discuss potential mechanisms focusing how dysfunctional angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, interaction of proinflammatory cytokines, endocrine hormones, and adipokines including leptin, adiponectin insulin, growth factors, estrogen, and progesterone and strikingly, cell metabolism alteration in obesity participate in tumor development and progression, resistance to chemotherapy, and targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic and immune therapies."
30524986,0,a,"Background: Out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure directly impacts on poverty and household welfare, especially when there is a decline in healthcare financing. This study was aimed to describe the temporal pattern of OOP expenditures related to Iranian healthcare services during 1995-2014. Methods: For describing the trend of OOP spending in Iran, the database of the World Bank was mined for the period under study. Further, the trend analysis has been complemented by an exhaustive and comprehensive review of the extant literature. Results: From 1995 to 2014, out-of-pocket decreased from 53.59% to 47.8% of the total health expenditure, probably because of the different health reforms implemented throughout the years. However, out-of-pocket expenditure in Iran remains higher than the world average (roughly 3 times higher). Conclusion: It is an onus of the Iranian government to make serious attempts in order to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure, as well as to protect particularly poor and vulnerable subjects against catastrophic health expenditure. In order to ensure an equitable and affordable access to the healthcare system, decision- and policy-makers in Iran should implement a review of health care costs, insurance tariffs, and healthcare services packages covered by insurance organizations as well as introduce a progressive tax-based financing scheme as soon as possible."

20388645,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) can lead to significant intellectual and behavioural problems in later life. IUGR represents a frequent feature of pregnancies of opioid-dependent mothers (ODMs), the causes of which are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the independent risk factors for IUGR in ODMs. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We performed a retrospective study analysing maternal and neonatal parameters from pregnancies of ODM maintained on methadone (n=215). These were compared to smoking non-ODM and non-smoking non-ODM control groups matched for maternal age, gestational age at delivery, infant birth date and sex. Logistic regression analysis was performed on all parameters with the outcome of IUGR. RESULTS: Fifty-seven infants (27%) of ODMs showed IUGR. Compared to non-smoking non-ODMs, the risk of IUGR in non-smoking ODMs was almost four times higher (relative risk 3.48, 95% CI 1.70 to 7.14). Growth restriction was independent of the last maternal methadone dose and the cumulative methadone dose during pregnancy. In addition, whereas nicotine and female sex impacted on IUGR in non-ODMs (nicotine: OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.82 to 6.67; sex: OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.50), these parameters had no influence on IUGR in ODMs. Maternal body mass index (BMI) was identified as the only independent risk factor for IUGR in infants of ODMs (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: IUGR in pregnancies of ODM is related to maternal BMI rather than to opiate dosing, nicotine use or infant sex. BMI may itself be an indirect marker of several other genetic, nutritional and/or social determinants of IUGR."
6382590,1,a,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females."

2638678,1,a,"To identify the individual and household level variables associated with increased risk of mortality, 159 infant and 50 child deaths (cases) and equal number of age matched live infants and children (controls) and their families were studied in a rural area of Haryana. The social, economic, educational and environmental characteristics of the case and control families were similar. Increased risk of infant and child mortality was associated with maternal age less than 20 and more than 30 years, birth order 4th or higher, unclean cord care at the time of child birth, failure of breast feeding during the first 3 months of age, lack of immunizations, and previous infant or child death(s) in the family (Odds ratio greater than 2; P less than 0.05-0.01 by X2 test). An emphasis on the interventions directed at control of the above mentioned variables may prove most helpful in reducing infant and child mortality in a rural area."
31314793,0,a,"BACKGROUND: As population health and well-being are influenced by multiple factors that cut across sectoral boundaries, an intersectoral approach that acknowledges and leverages the multiple determinants, actors and sectors at play is increasingly seen as critical for achieving meaningful and lasting improvements. In this study, we utilize social network analysis (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the organizations working on maternal & child health (MCH) and water & sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a low-and middle-income countries. METHOD: An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24 organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH. RESULTS: Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points. Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout the network. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including challenges, practical considerations, and limitations."
2723595,1,a,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."
23106752,0,a,"BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disability (ID) experience health inequity compared with the general population, a key contributing factor being disparities in social determinants of health. The enactment of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) provides a platform for the progression and promotion of health and other interconnected rights to address barriers to the highest attainable standard of health for this populace. Rights can be brought to life through advocacy efforts. This paper explores the meaning, perceptions and experiences of advocacy by family members and paid support workers of adults with ID and locates the findings within a health and human rights discourse. METHODS: As part of a larger randomised controlled trial, 113 parents and 84 support workers of adults with ID completed a telephone interview that included open-ended questions about their understanding and experiences of advocacy. Thematic analysis was used to identify relevant themes. RESULTS: Five key themes were identified. The first underscored how advocacy to 'speak up' for the person with ID is integral to both parent and support worker roles. The second and third themes considered the contexts for advocacy efforts. Access to quality health care was a core concern, along with advocacy across other areas and sectors to address the person's wider psychosocial needs. The remaining themes highlighted the many dimensions to advocacy, including differences between parent and support worker views, with parental advocacy being an expression of 'caring' and support workers motivated by a 'duty of care' to protect the individual's 'rights'. CONCLUSION: Parent and support worker advocacy provides one means to address the social determinants of health and fulfilment of health rights of and for people with ID. Policy and practice in the context of governmental obligation under the CRPD should support advocacy and make health rights the reality not rhetoric for this group of men and women."
30992698,0,a,"Background and aim: Many health systems attempt to develop integrated and population health-oriented systems of care, but knowledge of strategies and interventions to support this effort is lacking. We aimed to identify specific redesign strategies and interventions, and to present evidence of their effectiveness. Method: A modified scoping review process was carried out. Fifteen relevant examples of integrated care organizations that incorporated a broad population health approach in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development described in 57 articles and reports were included in analysis. Results: Seven key redesign strategies and multiple redesign interventions have been identified and are described. Most commonly used redesign strategies included focusing on health and wellness, embracing intersectoral action and partnerships, addressing health in vulnerable groups, and addressing a wide range of determinants of health, including making improvements in health services. Redesign interventions included creative and innovative ways of addressing clinical and non-clinical issues such as establishing housing surgeries in primary care, establlishing vast social and provider networks to support patients with complex needs and also broadening of the scope of services, workforce redesign and other. Potential reductions in the utilization of care and costs could be derived by the wider adoption of these strategies and interventions. Conclusion: Development of integrated and population health-oriented systems of care requires the redesign of how services are organized and delivered, and how organizations and care systems operate. Combining integration of care with the population health approach can be supported by a set of cohesive strategies and interventions aimed at preventing disease, addressing social determinants of health and improving health equity at both population- and individual-level."
28617018,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The increased awareness of the financial impact associated with social determinants of health coincides with expectations of the Affordable Care Act (HR 3590) to improve care while reducing costs. The integration of behavioral health providers (BHPs) into primary care has demonstrated improved clinical outcomes. This study was designed with 2 aims, including the evaluation of the financial viability of an integrated care model in a rural setting and the demonstration of incorporating practice-based research into clinical work. METHOD: A rural health plan caring for 22,000 members funded a pilot project placing BHPs in 3 clinics to provide integrated care. Patient utilization of medical services for 6 months following BHP services was compared with baseline utilization. RESULTS: The BHPs treated 256 unique patients, with a total of 459 consultations. The percentage of patients receiving BHP services varied between clinics (Clinic A = 1.4%, Clinic B = 2.7%, and Clinic C = 3.9%). A between-clinic analysis showed differences in medical claims data between baseline and post-BH services. The overall effect sizes for reduced medical utilization for patients at clinics B and C were very large, Hedge's g = -2.31 and -4.79, respectively. Utilization of 4 of the services (emergency, lab, outpatient, and primary care) showed the large reductions in their costs. In contrast, the data for Clinic A showed no change. DISCUSSION: Patients receiving behavioral health services within the integrated care model may decrease utilization of medical services following treatment, resulting in cost offset. Potential reasons for variability between clinics are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record"

METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of baseline socio-demographic and clinical predictors of physical activity change in insufficiently active PHC patients who participated in a PA-promoting multi-centre randomized clinical trial conducted from October 2003 through March 2006. The primary outcome measure was the self-reported physical activity assessed with the 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR), at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months. Baseline covariates included sex, age, social class, anthropometric measures and other cardiovascular risk factors or associated diseases (Diabetes, HTA, tobacco use, etc.), and stage of readiness to change PA. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate longitudinal association of studied variables on PA change over the three follow-up measurements. RESULTS: A total of 3691 patients (85% of the 4317 recruited in the trial) with at least one follow-up measurement were included in the longitudinal analysis. At baseline, analysed patients (mean age: 50.6 years; 64.6% women) devoted 34.7 minutes and 2.36 metabolic equivalent hours per week (MET.h/week) to moderate and vigorous physical activity. Older age, male gender, higher social class, lower BMI, diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension, and measurement season were significant predictors of PA longitudinal change. The effect of baseline readiness to change on PA dose was modified by time, showing a positive gradient in favour of those with more readiness to change that increases significantly at 12 and 24 months (p-value interaction < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Identified baseline characteristics such as readiness to change and risk factors can guide physicians to prioritize time and intervention efforts for maximizing their impact on insufficiently active PHC patients."
31285976,0,a,"Although acute care facilities have not typically focused on resolving the psychosocial determinants of health, new models are emerging. This article provides details of the Ke Ku'una Na'au (KKN) Native Hawaiian Behavioral Health Initiative implemented in 2016 at The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawai'i. The program is focused on reducing hospital readmissions for socially and economically vulnerable Native Hawaiian adults and improving their health care outcomes after hospitalization. The program was piloted on 2 medical units to assist patients who identified as Native Hawaiian, were ages 18 and older, and living with chronic diseases, psychosocial needs, and/or behavioral health problems. The program model was developed using a team of Native Hawaiian community health workers referred to as navigators, who were supported by an advanced practice nurse and a project coordinator/social worker. Navigators met patients during their inpatient stay and then followed patients post discharge to support them across any array of interpersonal needs for at least 30 days post-discharge. Goals were to assist patients with attending a post-hospital follow-up appointment, facilitate implementation of the discharge plan, and address social determinants of health that were impacting access to care. In 2017, 338 patients received care from the KKN program, a number that has grown since that time. In 2015, the baseline readmission rate for Native Hawaiians on the 2 medical units was 16.6% (for 440 Native Hawaiian patients in total). In 2017, the readmission rate for Native Hawaiians patients on the two medical units was 12.6% (for 445 Native Hawaiian patients, inclusive of KKN patients) (P=.092). This decrease suggests that the KKN program has been successful at reducing readmissions for vulnerable patients and, thus, improving care for Native Hawaiians in the health system generally. The KKN program has offered relevant, culturally sensitive care meeting a complex, personalized array of needs for over 338 patients and has shown demonstrated success in its outcomes. This information will be useful to other acute care organizations considering similar programs."

Controlling and eradicating these diseases have remained a challenge because of the multitudes of social and environmental factors involved. However, a multi-sectoral and collective effort in dealing with these diseases has been shown to result in positive outcomes. This paper looks at the current situation of Malaria in Nepal and a population that is at high risk. It explains the impact that social and environmental determinants have on this target population. This review then critically examines the various possible public health interventions that could potentially help in the control of malaria in this high risk population, drawing from evidences and experiences reported from other countries with suggestions for adapting these interventions to the Nepali environment."
24302171,1,a,"Within our present health care system, there is a growing movement that argues that our perceptions of health and illness are in need of change. This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited."

30922399,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The current nationwide study, for the first time, aimed to assess and compare the trend of pre-hypertension and hypertension among urban and rural adolescents in Iran. METHODS: This study has been conducted in the framework of the National Surveys of Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases. To estimate pre-hypertension and hypertension prevalence among 9715 adolescents, aged 15-19 years, data collected in four repeated cross-sectional surveys (2007-2011) has been used. The prevalence trends of pre-hypertension and hypertension were examined across urban and rural areas of Iran. To calculate the adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of pre-hypertension and hypertension over cycles across area of residence and genders, a complex sample survey and multinomial logistic analysis were performed. RESULTS: Using the definition of pre-hypertension and hypertension presented by the seventh Joint National Committee (JNC-VII) for adolescents, after adjusting for confounders, the prevalence of pre-hypertension changed in both urban (boys:28.96% to 29.24% and girls:18.33% to 20.06%) and rural (boys 31.58% to 32.05% and girls 22.25% to 24.13%) areas over the study duration. Non-significant rising prevalence of hypertension was also observed in boys and girls of both regions (urban 12.76% to 15.04% and 8.02% to 9.06%; rural 9.95% to 11.79% and 10.35% to 11.60%, for boys and girls respectively). The adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of pre-hypertension (2.16; 95% CI 1.68-2.79 and 1.92, 95% CI 1.57-2.34, in urban and rural, respectively) and hypertension (2.40; 95% CI 1.65-3.51 and 1.82, 95% CI 1.36-2.45, in urban and rural, respectively) were higher in boys than girls. Comparing the adjusted PRs of pre-hypertension and hypertension in urban versus rural areas, in both genders, showed higher PRs of pre-hypertension in rural girls (1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.75). CONCLUSION: The current results showed high constant trends of pre-hypertension and hypertension in Iranian boys and girls, residing in both urban and rural areas."

This study is conducted to evaluate skin cancer coping of farmers in rural areas of Ilam city. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. Samples were collected by multistage random sampling. The required data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire from 248 farmers in rural areas of Ilam city. Questions were based on the protection motivation theory, and they were related to the subscales of response efficacy, self-efficacy, and response costs. Collected data were analyzed by SPSS software version 16. RESULTS: Results of this study indicated that efficacy and perceived self-efficacy in farmers were low and response cost was high. The efficacy and perceived self-efficacy were high in 18.1% and 4.8% of farmers, respectively, and only 4.4% of them had low response costs, in association with protective behaviors. Regarding coping appraisal status also results showed that 204 people of farmers (82.3%) were unacceptable, one person (0.4%) was in the borderline, and 43 people (17.3%) were acceptable. There was a statistically significant association between coping appraisal status and education level and also income amount (P < 0.001) but there was no statistically significant association between coping appraisal status and family size (P > 0.670). CONCLUSION: The founding proved that a coping appraisal is a beneficial approach for predicting cognitive determinants of skin cancer behavior among rural farmers. The most farmers have been the low level of coping appraisal (82.3% were unacceptable)."
6544459,1,a,"The purpose of the present investigation was to study dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status in the adult Danish population. The study group comprised 5151 persons (86.7% of the original sample) who were interviewed in order to determine living conditions. Questions on dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status were included. 61% of the adult Danish population in the age group 20-69 had regular dental visits. Dental visit habits varied according to urbanization, age, sex and social group. Among well off persons 85% had regular dental visits as opposed to only 40% in the disadvantaged social group. Well off persons and persons with regular dental visits more often claimed good dental health than persons in the disadvantaged social group and among the non-regular visitors. In the higher social group 13% reported to have removable dentures in contrast to 51% in the disadvantaged social group. To isolate determinants of dental visits a multiple dummy-regression analysis was performed. Nearly 50% of the variation in dental visit habits was explained by the variables: urbanization, sex, age, perceived dental health status, education, work in exhausting jobs, income, social background and perceived psychological problems. Efforts to bring a greater part of the adult population in Denmark in contact with the dental health service system should consider these findings."
22085142,1,a,"Abstract A sample survey of 2,012 married and single women aged 18-59 in Madrid was in part focused on causes of late marriage, which has for a long time been characteristic of Spain. It was found that age at marriage was not related to a variety of socio-economic measures, to parental restrictions on courtship, nor to birth order or number of siblings. Direct economic motivations appear to have affected length of courtship but scarcely age at marriage. Ages at marriage differ in different areas of Madrid, even when key demographic and social variables are controlled; and evidence from a sub-sample of interviews suggests that it may be a characteristic of different families. Along with clear evidence of normative patterns supporting long courtships and late marriages, such data point to the potential importance of sociological variables, and to the need for similar research on determinants of men's ages at marriage."
22382190,0,a,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Structural interventions have the capacity to improve the outcomes of HIV/AIDS interventions by changing the social, economic, political or environmental factors that determine risk and vulnerability. Marginalized groups face disproportionate barriers to health, and sex workers are among those at highest risk of HIV in India. Evidence in India and globally has shown that sex workers face violence in many forms ranging from verbal, psychological and emotional abuse to economic extortion, physical and sexual violence and this is directly linked to lower levels of condom use and higher levels of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the most critical determinants of HIV risk. We present here a case study of an intervention that mobilized sex workers to lead an HIV prevention response that addresses violence in their daily lives. METHODS: This study draws on ethnographic research and project monitoring data from a community-led structural intervention in Mysore, India, implemented by Ashodaya Samithi. Qualitative and quantitative data were used to characterize baseline conditions, community responses and subsequent outcomes related to violence. RESULTS: In 2004, the incidence of reported violence by sex workers was extremely high (> 8 incidents per sex worker, per year) but decreased by 84 per cent over 5 years. Violence by police and anti-social elements, initially most common, decreased substantially after a safe space was established for sex workers to meet and crisis management and advocacy were initiated with different stakeholders. Violence by clients, decreased after working with lodge owners to improve safety. However, initial increases in intimate partner violence were reported, and may be explained by two factors: (i) increased willingness to report such incidents; and (ii) increased violence as a reaction to sex workers' growing empowerment. Trafficking was addressed through the establishment of a self-regulatory board (SRB). The community's progressive response to violence was enabled by advancing community mobilization, ensuring community ownership of the intervention, and shifting structural vulnerabilities, whereby sex workers increasingly engaged key actors in support of a more enabling environment. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Ashodaya's community-led response to violence at multiple levels proved highly synergistic and effective in reducing structural violence."

Therefore, the current study aims to assess the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and their associated factors among youth in Kermanshah province of Iran. METHODS: The current study is a part of the first phase of Ravansar Cohort (a part of the PERSIAN Youth Cohort) including 2991 participants aged 15 to 34 from Ravansar district in western Iran. Enrollment and data collection for this phase were performed from end April 2015 to early April 2017. The data were gathered using structured interviews and national and international standard questionnaires. Data analysis was carried out using multinomial logistic regression and chi-square test. RESULTS: The prevalence of any psychiatric disorder among the selected population was 31.3%. Major depressive disorder (MDD) (21.6%), followed by generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (6.4%) and dysthymia (1.9%) were the most prevalent disorders among the study individuals. The prevalence of alcohol and opioid/stimulant use disorders was 4.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Moreover, there was significant relationship between location of residence (city or village) and marital status with prevalence of the disorders. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the current study, it can be concluded that the prevalence of mental and psychiatric disorders among the youth in Ravansar district, western Iran is relatively high and needs specific plans and interventions to control it."

3788206,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."

6148471,1,a,"A cohort of homosexual men at high risk of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was monitored to examine the relation between lifestyle, clinical conditions, T-lymphocyte subsets, and antibody to the AIDS-associated human retrovirus, human T-cell leukaemia virus III (HTLV-III). HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS."
28286813,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: In addition to the annual mortality rate, unintentional home injury may result in temporary or permanent disability and requires medical attention and continuous care in millions of children. This study aimed to explore features and risk factors of these injuries. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, demographic variables and epidemiologic pattern of home injuries among children under 5 years of age were collected via a population-based survey in seven main cities of Khuzestan province, southwest Iran, during September 2011 to December 2012. Developing a risk stratification model, independent risk factors of unintentional home injury were determined and put to multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULT: 2693 children with the mean age of 27.36 +/- 15.55 months (1 to 60) were evaluated (50.9% boy). 827 (30.7%) cases had a history of at least one home injury occurrence since birth to study time. The most common injury mechanisms were burning with 291 (38.4%) cases, falling with 214 (28.3%) and poisoning with 66 (8.7%) cases, respectively. The independent risk factors of unintentional home injury were age >/= 24 month (p<0.001), residency in Ahvaz city (p<0.001), mother's illiteracy (p<0.014), ethnicity (p<0.001), private housing (p=0.01), birth weight (p<0.001), and being the first child (p=0. 01). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve of the model designed by multivariate analysis were 53.5%, 84.8%, and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73- 0.77; P < 0.001, figure 1), respectively. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this study, 30.7% of the studied children were injured at least once since birth. Burning, falling, poisoning, swallowing objects, choking, and biting were the main home injury mechanisms. Age >/= 24 months, being the first child, living in a private house, being a resident of Ahvaz city, and having an illiterate mother were found to be risk factors of home injury."

This systematic review reports the findings from a meta-synthesis of qualitative data concerning the experiences and perceptions of iron supplementation among women of reproductive age and health service providers worldwide. Qualitative systematic review methods were used to conduct a search of published literature, define inclusion and exclusion criteria, appraise quality of studies and extract data on the use of iron supplementation among women of reproductive age. Coding, thematic analysis, reciprocal translation and line of argument synthesis were used to synthesize data. Twelve studies spanning 17 countries met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Seven domains emerged from the review: cultural norms and societal values including explanatory models and medical pluralism; political and socio-economic circumstances; education and communication; social organization and social relationships; health care access and supplement supply; food and nutrition availability; and adherence. In addition, 16 sub-domains are highlighted. Connecting review findings to a conceptual framework of social determinants of health highlights salient issues that policy makers must consider when adapting global iron supplementation recommendations to the local context."
28341220,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Social and behavioral factors play important roles in physical and mental health; however, they are not routinely assessed in the healthcare system. A brief panel of measures of social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDs) were recommended in a National Academy of Medicine report for use in electronic health records. Initial testing of the panel established feasibility of use and robustness of the measures. This study evaluates their convergent and divergent validity in relation to self-reported physical and mental health and social desirability bias. METHODS: Adults, aged >/=18 years, were recruited through Qualtrics online panel survey platform in 2015 (data analyzed in 2015-2016). Participants completed the (1) panel of SBD measures; (2) 12-Item Short Form Health Survey to assess associations with global physical and mental health; and (3) Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale short form to assess whether social desirability influenced associations between SBD measures and self-reported health. RESULTS: The sample included 513 participants (mean age, 47.9 [SD=14.2] years; 65.5% female). Several SBD domain measures were associated with physical and mental health. Adjusting for age, poorer physical and mental health were observed among participants reporting higher levels of financial resource strain, stress, depression, physical inactivity, current tobacco use, and a positive score for intimate partner violence. These associations remained significant after adjustment for social desirability bias. CONCLUSIONS: SBD domains were associated with global measures of physical and mental health and were not impacted by social desirability bias. The panel of SBD measures should now be tested in clinical settings."

Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing. It was concluded that visual novelty of the environment is the minimal condition for sustained death feigning by young chicks in the daylight hours."

26861932,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the association between health facility characteristics and other individual/household factors with a woman's likelihood of skilled birth attendance in north-central Afghanistan. METHODS: Data from a 2010 household survey of 6879 households in 9 provinces of Afghanistan were linked to routine facility data. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to assess determinants of skilled birth attendance. RESULTS: Women who reported having at least one antenatal visit with a skilled provider were 5.6 times more likely to give birth with a skilled attendant than those who did not. The odds of skilled birth attendance were 84% higher for literate women than those without literacy skills and 79% higher among women in the upper 2 wealth quintiles than women in the poorest quintile. This study did not show any direct linkages between facility characteristics and skilled birth attendance but provided insights into why studies assuming that women seek care at the nearest primary care facility may lead to misinterpretation of care-seeking patterns. Findings reveal a 36 percentage point gap between women who receive skilled antenatal care and those who received skilled birth care. Nearly 60% of women with a skilled attendant at their most recent birth bypassed the nearest primary care facility to give birth at a more distant primary care facility, hospital, or private clinic. Distance and transport barriers were reported as the most common reasons for home birth. DISCUSSION: Assumptions that women who give birth with a skilled attendant do so at the closest health facility may mask the importance of supply-side determinants of skilled birth attendance. More research based on actual utilization patterns, not assumed catchment areas, is needed to truly understand the factors influencing care-seeking decisions in both emergency and nonemergency situations and to adapt strategies to reduce preventable mortality and morbidity in Afghanistan."
3237851,1,a,"The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The analysis first focuses on differences between women who report numerical family size desires and those who report nonnumerical desires. Findings suggest that there are important differences between these two groups, but there is little variation in the actual number reported by those expressing numerical desires. Implications of these findings for survey design are discussed. In particular, the practice of forcing numerical responses by instructing interviewers to probe when women report nonnumerical desires is questioned."
19899050,0,a,"It is well-documented that the socio-economic status has an important influence on health. In all developed countries, health is closely correlated with income, education, and type of employment, as well as with several other social determinants. While data on this socio-economic health gradient have been available for decades, the moral questions surrounding social health inequalities have only recently been addressed within the field of public health ethics. The present article offers a brief overview of relevant data on social health inequalities and on some explanatory models from epidemiology, social medicine and related disciplines. The main part explores three influential normative accounts addressing the issue of health inequalities. Finally, an agenda for future work in the field of public health ethics and health inequalities is sketched, with particular attention to the German context."
2629118,1,a,"The relationships between employment status and Type A behavior pattern have been investigated with data from the first MONICA Survey Augsburg, F.R.G., 1984/85 (MONICA = Monitoring of trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). Study population was a two-stage cluster sample of 5312 men and women, aged 25-64 (response 79.4%). Measurement instruments were interviews and a self-administered questionnaire. Type A was measured by the Framingham Type A behavior scale. In multiple logistic regression analyses. Type A behavior among men was studied as a function of various occupational positions [blue-collar, white-collar, civil (public) servants, self-employed], controlling for age, educational level, marital status, and interaction effects. In those analyses it was found that the occupational position 'self-employed' was the best predictor of Type A behavior (odds ratio 3.0 compared to blue-collar employees). Since most of the employed women were white-collar employees (a very homogeneous group) Type A behavior among women was studied as a function of full-time and part-time employment, with the same control variables as were included in the analyses for men. Taking into account the statistical significant interaction effect age by employment, it could be shown that the odds of being Type A for a 50 yr old woman was 3.5 compared to a housewife at the same age. In summary the findings show strong relationships between work situation and Type A behavior for both men and women. Especially the self-employed men have more Type A behavior patterns, so may have higher CHD risk."

People with epilepsy, particularly women, living in economically weak countries are often ill equipped to handle the stigma that they experience at multiple levels. This paper offers a systematic review of the research on stigma from sociology and social psychology and details how stigma linked to epilepsy or similar conditions can result in stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination. We also briefly discuss the strategies that are most commonly utilized to mitigate stigma. Neurologists and other health care providers, social workers, support groups and policy makers working with epilepsy need to have a deep understanding of the social and cultural perceptions of epilepsy and the related stigma.

This paper reviews a number of practical interventions with demonstrated efficacy in enhancing patient adherence, including (1) improving patients' levels of information concerning the specifics of their regimens, reinforcing essential points with review, discussion, and written instruction, and emphasizing the importance of the therapeutic plan, (2) taking clinically appropriate steps to reduce the cost, complexity, duration, and amount of behavioral change required by the regimen and increasing the regimen's convenience through ""tailoring"" and other approaches, (3) obtaining a compliance-oriented history of the patient's prior experiences and present health beliefs and, where necessary, employing strategies to modify those perceptions likely to inhibit compliance, (4) improving levels of patient satisfaction, particularly with the provider-patient relationship, (5) arranging for the continued monitoring of the patient's subsequent compliance to treatment, (6) increasing staff awareness of the magnitude and determinants of the noncompliance phenomenon and attempting to develop an ""active influence orientation"" in each member of the health care team, (7) using such techniques as patient-provider contracts to involve the patient in therapeutic decisions and in the setting of treatment objectives and creating incentives (through rewards and reinforcements) for achieving these objectives, (8) arranging for as much continuity of provider (and other staff) as possible, (9) establishing methods of supervising the patient, including involvement of the patient's social support network, and (10) involving fully the assistance of all available health care providers, assigning specific roles and responsibilities for activities directed at improving adherence to treatment."
3223165,1,a,"Multi-dimensional investigation in the peculiarities, clinical course and possible mechanisms of neurotic disorders was performed in 115 patients. In order to study the further course of neurotic disorders and their determinants, as well as the issues of social rehabilitation and psychoprophylactic interferences, 56 patients were studied again after 6 to 8 years. For each of the symptom complexes investigated, the course had distinct features determined primarily by adaptation-compensatory capabilities of personality, and the ""system of psychological defense"". Most unfavorable was the course of hysterical disorders. Therapeutic policy in these patients should be grounded upon the psychotherapeutic measures aimed at finding the ways that would be psychologically adequate for changing the patients' attitudes and restoring their adaptation."
24307167,0,a,"Health literacy improves knowledge and builds skills to help individuals make appropriate decisions regarding their health. Over the past 20 years, several studies have described associations between health literacy and health outcomes. With respect to Romania, evidence is scarce on the level of health literacy, as well as on its determinants. Thus, the objectives of this study were to briefly screen functional health literacy levels in a sample of rural inhabitants, to assess the relationship between health literacy and reported health status, as well as to explore health literacy determinants within this population. Data were collected between September-November 2010, in four villages in Cluj County, Romania, using a cross-sectional survey. The mean age of respondents in the sample was 56 years, with roughly half of respondents being retired. The brief screening of health literacy suggested inadequate to marginal levels within the sample. Significant associations were observed between health literacy score and education, and self-perceived health status, whereas the relationship between health literacy and gender, and the presence of a chronic disease was not statistically significant. Limited health literacy has been shown to be common in people who rated their health as poor, those who attended only middle school, and individuals lacking basic information about their body. In order to minimize the adverse effects of low health literacy on health and health outcomes, efforts should be invested in identifying and addressing the health needs of adults with low and marginal health literacy, especially in underserved areas such as rural and remote settings, where access to health-related information is limited."

These findings suggest that contextual cues serve as determinants of drinking norms and that drinking behavior reflects individual variation in sensitivity to these cues."
3762472,1,a,"In 1983-1984, 4578 Perth primary and secondary schoolchildren were studied. The selected sample was broadly representative of the ethnic groups that make up the Perth population and of the different social ranks within that population. The age, sex, weight, height, country of birth of the child and the parents, and occupation of the father were recorded for each subject. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI) increased with age. Age and sex were the most important determinants of body size. However, children of lower social rank and those with a southern European background were over-represented among the overweight children (greater than the 90th centile for BMI), particularly in adolescence. Children with an Asian background who were 11 years of age and younger were over-represented among the underweight children (less than or equal to the 10th centile for BMI). Results from this study indicate a continuing, though small (1.5 cm to 1.6 cm), secular increase in height over the past 13 to 14 years."
30255113,0,a,"Background: Hepatitis C is now curable for most individuals, and national goals for elimination have been established. Transmission persists, however, particularly in nonurban regions affected by the opioid epidemic. To reach goals of elimination, barriers to treatment must be identified. Methods: In this open cohort of all individuals diagnosed with active hepatitis C from 2010 to 2016 at a large medical center, we identified patient and clinic characteristics associated with our primary outcome, sustained virologic response (SVR). We performed a subgroup analysis for those with documented substance misuse. Results: SVR was achieved in 1544 (41%) of 3790 people with active hepatitis C. In a multivariable Poisson regression model, SVR was more likely in individuals diagnosed outpatient (incident rate ratio [IRR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.0), living in close proximity to the medical center (IRR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), with private insurance (IRR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3), and with cirrhosis (IRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.5). Achieving SVR was less likely in those qualifying as indigent (IRR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9) and those with substance misuse (IRR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9). In the subgroup analysis of those with substance misuse, SVR rates were higher in those linked to the infectious diseases clinic, which has embedded support services, than those linked to the gastroenterology clinic, which does not (IRR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). Conclusions: Social determinants of health including proximity to care and poverty impacted achievement of SVR. Those with substance misuse, a high-priority population for treatment of hepatitis C, had better outcomes when receiving care in a clinic with embedded support services."
6892318,1,a,"This study examined the records of the North Carolina Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine which social, family, and child characteristics were most influential in the decision to place a child in foster care. These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care."
23249858,0,a,"Studies have revealed that relative poverty is associated with ill health, but the interpretations of this correlation vary. This article asks whether relative poverty among Norwegian adolescents is causally related to poor subjective health, i.e., self-reported somatic and mental symptoms. Data consist of interview responses from a sample of adolescents (N = 510) and their parents, combined with register data on the family's economic situation. Relatively poor adolescents had significantly worse subjective health than non-poor adolescents. Relatively poor adolescents also experienced many other social disadvantages, such as parental unemployment and parental ill health. Comparisons between the relatively poor and the non-poor adolescents, using propensity score matching, indicated a negative impact of relative poverty on the subjective health among those adolescents who lived in families with relatively few economic resources. The results suggest that there is a causal component in the association between relative poverty and the symptom burden of disadvantaged adolescents. Relative poverty is only one of many determinants of adolescents' subjective health, but its role should be acknowledged when policies for promoting adolescent health are designed."
31576083,0,a,"Context: Subfertility affects about 15% of couples worldwide. There are several factors that affect subfertility called social determinants of health (SDH): biological factors as age, ethnic origin, and body mass index; behavioral factors as alcohol intake, smoking, coffee, dietary restriction, physical activity, and psychological state; and contextual factors as education, work activity, and income level. Aims: The aim of the study is to evaluate the distribution's relevance of the SDH in subfertile women versus nonsubfertile women. Settings and Design: A prospective comparative study with two groups of women recruited over 1 year at hospital consultation: one group with subfertile women excluding women without a male partner or with a previous child and another one formed by primigravidae, excluding those receiving assisted reproduction techniques to become pregnant. Subjects and Methods: We compare the different factors between subfertile and nonsubfertile women one by one. Second, a multivariate analysis was conducted with logistic regression. In all cases, informed consent was obtained. Results: Regular physical exercise 3-4 times/week (odds ratio [OR]: 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15-0.71) or healthy food products such as fish 1-2 times/week (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17-0.95) were associated with nonsubfertile women. Conclusions: The distribution of SDH in natural fertility is not altogether homogeneous. Weight control by means of restricting calorie intake, greater consumption of healthy foods such as fish, regular physical exercise, and lower age are positively associated with fertility. Population-level intervention is possible to improve women's health, as these are modifiable factors. Ethnic origin can be considered as a relevant factor, as it may condition the distribution of other determinants."
27783739,0,a,"Objective:: to analyze the intimate partner violence in adolescence from the perspective of gender and generation. Method:: Quantitative, descriptive, and exploratory research. 111 adolescents participated in this study, with ages from 15 to 19 years old. Results:: We found that 91% of participants have perpetrated and 90.1% have undergone at least one of the natures of violence. The intimate partner violence in adolescence constitutes a form of gender violence, and gender constructions have determined the suffered and perpetrated aggressions, possibly also determining the naturalization and legitimization of such aggressions. The inequality of power between generations may determine greater vulnerability of youngsters to the phenomenon. Conclusion:: The historical and social construction of masculinity and femininity and the power inequalities set by these constructions converge with the power inequality between generations. Thus, gender and generation are determinants of intimate partner violence in adolescence, as well as of the vulnerability of adolescents to this phenomenon."

This enabled us to achieve a mean reduction of RTs for athletes eye-hand coordination of more than 10%, with high statistical significance. We explain how such an observed effect of Sensorimotor systems' plasticity causing reduced RT can last in practice for multiple days and even weeks in subjects, via a proof of principle. Its mathematical neural model can be forced outside a previous stable (but long) RT into a state leading to reduced eye-hand coordination RT, which is, again, in a stable neural state."
31747773,0,a,"Maternal education is widely regarded as a core social determinant of child mortality in low-income countries. In Myanmar, the evidence related to context-specific social determinants of health including maternal education is scarce, limiting grounds to advocate for a comprehensive health policy. Employing multivariate methods, the study analyzed the 2015-2016 Demographic Health Survey data exploring independent effect of maternal education on neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality. The study found that maternal education was not significantly associated with neonatal mortality as its effect was confounded by household wealth and geographic residence; however, it had independent effect on infant and under-5 mortality. Mothers with primary education had 23% reduction in the odds of under-5 mortality (P < .001); those with secondary level had 40% reduction (P < .001); and those at higher level had 62% reduction (P < .001). The study concluded that maternal education is a critical social determinant of childhood mortalities in Myanmar."
2723595,1,a,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."
3633877,1,a,"Value-expectancy theory proposed by Lewin states that motivation for behaviour is based on the probability that a given action or behaviour will achieve a valued or desired outcome. Becker and Maiman elaborated on this theory and developed a model to study compliance by considering the influence of sociobehavioural determinants in the inter-relationship of motivating and modifying factors which dictate human behaviour. The Becker-Maiman framework was used to determine factors which influence the use of the nursing care plan by staff nurses. From interviews with staff nurses, surveys of nurses attending workshops on NCPs and review of literature a model was developed for use in examining the nursing care planning behaviour of nurses."
2576262,1,a,"Historically, concerns about rapidly growing populations and resources that could not support them persuaded governments of developing countries to initiate family planning programs. Between the early 1960s and the early 1980s, the number of governments supporting these programs increased from 7 to approximately 120. Today, 52 governments in developing countries provide support to family planning programs because of the demographic rationale, and 65 governments do so because of human rights and health considerations: The effective use of family planning significantly diminishes infant, child, and maternal mortality and morbidity. Forty-five percent of married women of reproductive age worldwide are practicing contraception today; however, 69% do so in East Asia and only 11% in Africa. Female sterilization and use of intrauterine devices are the most popular methods in developing countries, and oral contraceptives and condoms, in developed countries. Of the 400 million women of reproductive age, 140 million (35%) are relying on family planning methods requiring male cooperation and less than 60 million (15%) are using oral contraceptives. More than half of these oral contraceptive users live in four countries: the United States, Brazil, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany. On the other hand, the percentage of currently married women, aged 15 to 19 years, who have never used any form of contraception is as high as 85% to 90% in Bangladesh, Sudan, and Pakistan. In many developing countries, there is a statistically significant correlation between women's use of contraception and years of education. Other important factors influencing contraceptive prevalence include the established or perceived side effects of currently available methods, the status of women, the political climate, and a number of behavioral and social determinants."
3989430,1,a,"The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats."
22915146,0,a,"Studies conducted in developing countries have noted associations between concurrent stunting, social-emotional problems and poor cognitive ability in young children. However, the relative contribution of these variables in Latin America is likely changing as undernutrition rates decline and prevalence of childhood obesity rises. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 106 normal-weight and 109 obese preschool children to compare the relative contribution of early nutrition, sociodemographic factors and psychosocial variables on cognitive development in normal-weight and obese preschool children in Chile. The study variables were categorized as: (1) socio-demographic (age, sex, birth order and socioeconomic) (2) early nutrition (maternal height, birth weight, birth length and height at 5 years) (3) psychosocial factors (maternal depression, social-emotional wellbeing and home space sufficiency). In order to assess determinants of cognitive development at 4-5 years we measured intelligence quotient (IQ); variability in normal children was mostly explained by socio-demographic characteristics (r(2) = 0.26), while in obese children early nutritional factors had a significant effect (r(2) = 0.12) beyond socio-demographic factors (r(2) = 0.19). Normal-weight children, who were first born, of slightly better SES and height Z score >1, had an IQ >/= 6 points greater than their counterparts (p < 0.05). Obese children who were first born with birth weight >4,000 g and low risk of socio-emotional problems had on average >/=5 IQ points greater than their peers (p < 0.05). We conclude that in Chile, a post-transitional country, IQ variability of normal children was mostly explained by socio-demographic characteristics; while in obese children, early nutrition also played a significant role."
2802928,1,a,"Using a subsample from the Copenhagen schizophrenia high-risk project, we examined the contributions of schizophrenic genetic liability and perinatal complications to computed tomographic (CT) measurements of ventricular enlargement and cortical and cerebellar abnormalities. A factor analysis of six CT measurements yielded two significant factors. One factor reflected multisite neural deficits as evidenced by abnormality of the cerebellar vermis and widening of the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures and cortical sulci. The other factor reflected periventricular damage as evidenced by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Because all of the subjects had schizophrenic mothers, the major source of genetic variation is contributed by the diagnostic status of their fathers. In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, it was determined that the multisite neural deficits factor was significantly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia (as measured by schizophrenia spectrum illness in the subjects' fathers) but was unrelated to pregnancy or delivery complications or to weight at birth. Periventricular damage was highly and significantly correlated with the number of complications suffered at delivery, but only among subjects with an elevated genetic risk. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the two types of CT abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect partially independent processes based on different combinations of genetic and perinatal influences."
22694988,0,a,"Perceived discrimination has been shown to be associated with health. However, it is uncertain whether discrimination based on geographical place of residence (geographically-based discrimination), such as Buraku or Nishinari discrimination in Japan, is associated with health. We conducted a cross-sectional study (response rate = 52.3%) from February to March 2009 in a Buraku district of Nishinari ward in Osaka city, one of the most deprived areas in Japan. We implemented sex-stratified and education-stratified multivariate regression models to examine the association between geographically-based discrimination and two mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms and diagnosis of mental illness) with adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, social relationships and lifestyle factors. A total of 1994 persons aged 25-79 years (928 men and 1066 women) living in the district were analyzed. In the fully-adjusted model, perceived geographically-based discrimination was significantly associated with depressive symptoms and diagnosis of mental illness. It was more strongly associated among men or highly educated people than among women or among less educated people. The effect of geographically-based discrimination on mental health is independent of socioeconomic status, social relationship and lifestyle factors. Geographically-based discrimination may be one of the social determinants of mental health."

3359393,1,a,"Parents who had been placed in an orphanage as children rated the behaviour of all their children who were between the ages of 6-18 years on a children's behaviour survey instrument. All families were intact and the parents had not requested professional help for marital problems. A significant number of relationships were found between parental background variables and higher reported levels of conflict with siblings and with parents, dependent-unassertive behaviour, and undemandingness in the children. Although sampling difficulties preclude generalization, the results suggest that repercussion of events in the lives of the first and second generation that are usually pathogenic may be seen in the third generation, even when the second generation may not be grossly adversely affected. These events most frequently related to individual differences in the third generation in the area of undercontrol of aggression directed toward parents and siblings."
28804583,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Low birth weight (LBW) is one of the major health problems worldwide. It is important to identify the factors that play a role in the incidence of this adverse pregnancy outcome. This study aimed to develop a tool to measure mothers' lifestyles during pregnancy with a view to the effects of social determinants on health and develop a correlation model of mothers' lifestyles with LBW. METHODS: This study was conducted using methodological and case-control designs in four stages by selecting 750 mothers with infants weighing less than 4000 g using multistage sampling. The questionnaire contained 160 items. Face, content, criterion, and construct validity were used to study the psychometrics of the instrument. RESULTS: After psychometrics, 132 items were approved in six domains. Test results indicated the utility and the high fitness of the model and reasonable relationships adjusted for variables based on conceptual models. Based on the correlation model of lifestyle, occupation (-0.263) and social relationships (0.248) had the greatest overall effect on birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: The review of lifestyle dimensions showed that all of the dimensions directly, indirectly, or both affected birth weight. Thus, given the importance and the role of lifestyle as a determinant affecting birth weight, attention, and training interventions are important to promote healthy lifestyles."
3730318,1,a,"This paper presents findings concerning variables expected to influence the motivation of persons caring for a dementing relative in the community to continue giving care and support. The variables examined in relation to 'preference for institutional care' were those previously examined in relation to supporters' psychological well-being (Gilhooly, 1984). The results indicate that factors within the relationship between supporter and the dependent dementing relative are important determinants of motivation to continue giving support. Other variables significantly associated with advocacy of institutional care included the age of the supporter, supporter's contacts with friends, satisfaction with help from relatives, another dependent relative, and whether or not the supporter was employed. Help from the services and supporters' well-being were not significantly correlated with ratings of preference for institutional care."
2525495,1,a,"In this epidemiological study the authors recorded the attitudes of children in Hamilton, Ontario, to physically disabled and mentally handicapped children. Univariate analyses confirmed the importance of female gender, friendship and contact with handicapped persons as determinants of more accepting attitudes. Type of disability and the presence or absence of disabled children in respondents' schools were not found to influence attitudes in a systematic manner. Correlations between attitudes and children's self-esteem or sociometric ratings were not significant, nor were parent-child attitude correlations. Maternal language of origin was found to influence children's attitudes, in favour of children of English-speaking mothers. These results are discussed with reference to their practical applications by community and educational systems seeking to foster integration of disabled children."
27588360,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether the score of self-reported medication adherence using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5) correlates with the serum level of antiepileptic medication, as well as whether the MARS-5 score can predict the quality of life (QoL) in patients with epilepsy. METHODS: A longitudinal study was carried out. The patients with epilepsy who were prescribed a minimum of one antiepileptic drug were recruited (n=807). Each participant completed a background information sheet and the MARS-5 at baseline, followed by the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) questionnaire at 18-month follow-up. In addition, the serum level of antiepileptic medications was measured at the follow-up. RESULTS: The MARS-5 score was negatively associated with the LSSS score (B=-0.089, SE=0.009, p<0.001) and positively correlated with the serum level of antiepileptic medications (B=3.200, SE=0.416, p<0.001), after adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics. The serum level of antiepileptic drugs was significantly correlated with the overall QOLIE-31 score (B=3.118, SE=1.417, p=0.03). The MARS-5 score was significantly correlated with the overall QOLIE-31 scores and all the scores in the subcategories. In addition, the MARS-5 score was in line with the correlation between the LSSS and QOLIE-31 scores (Z=4.20, p<0.001) and between serum antiepileptic medication levels and QOLIE-31 score (Z=3.98, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The MARS-5 score can predict the QoL in patients with epilepsy for up to 18months. Therefore, healthcare providers may predict the QoL and drug adherence using the MARS-5 score, in order to design personalized interventions."
2709190,1,a,"A longitudinal study of rural-urban migration from a low blood pressure community was completed in 1985. It is suggested that the rapid increase in blood pressure observed with acculturation in this study constitutes a new dynamic model for the early phase of human essential hypertension. Analysis of data derived from this study indicates that increases in dietary sodium, weight gain and sympathetic tone (possibly reflecting acute environmental stress) are important determinants of the early blood pressure rise. It is proposed that a defence reaction occurs in response to environmental stress which maintains or increases cardiorenal sympathetic outflow, thereby overriding the negative feedback inhibition of sympathetic activity which otherwise occurs when dietary sodium is suddenly increased. The antinatriuretic response results in an early volume-dependent rise in blood pressure. We also propose that variation in individual blood pressure responses to migration may be explained not only by quantum differences in the two environmental factors, but also by a genetically-determined failure of adaptation to the combined effects of these stimuli on renal tubular reabsorption of sodium."

3101100,1,a,"Offensive and defensive components of aggressive behavior were determined in resident and intruder mice. Withdrawal aggression was measured after the removal of a subcutaneous morphine pellet or after precipitation by naloxone in naive mice and after removal of a morphine pellet in mice with prior fighting experience. In naive mice, removal of a morphine pellet led to increases in attack bites and threats but naloxone-precipitated withdrawal led to decreases in these behaviors and to increases in defensive posturing, escape attempts and vocalizations. Prior fighting experience abolished the enhanced attack behaviors of resident mice following morphine pellet removal, but led to heightened defensive behavior in intruder mice. The behavior of intruder mice appeared more sensitive to naloxone administration than the behavior of resident mice; naloxone influenced not only intruder defensive behavior, but also other non-aggressive behaviors. The social role of the drug recipient and his prior history of aggressive behavior are important determinants of morphine and naloxone effects on aggression."
7458619,1,a,"Three parameters of social function-socialization in the home, socialization outside to the home, and hobbies and interests--were analyzed to determine social reintegration of long-term survivors of documented completed stroke, who had already achieved satisfactory levels of physical function as measured by the Kenny self-care evaluation. A significant proportion of survivors manifested social disability, despite complete physical restoration. Much of this disability cannot be accounted for by age, physical impairment or specific neurologic deficits. The distribution of functional disabilities documented suggests that psychosocial factors, as well as organic deficits, are major determinants."
27591445,0,a,"UNLABELLED: In Poland long-term care services are provided by skilled care and treatment facilities (ZOL) and nursing and care facilities (ZPO) both functioning within the health sector as well as by non-skilled nursing homes (DPS) situated in social care sector. Determinants of medical and nursing care provided by both sectors vary considerably in terms of organization (availability) and economic issues (costs of care). AIM: The aim of the study is to compare characteristics of residents in two types of long term care facilities (LTCFs) in Poland with a special focus on geriatric issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample comprised of 387 ZOL residents and 352 DPS residents living in 7 settings. Data was collected for 6 years period (2007-2013) using InterRAI-LTCF questionnaire. The data analysis was done with application of a Mann-Whitney U test, chisquare test and Fisher's exact test and using IBM SPSS Statistics 22. RESULTS: The DPS residents were significantly older than ZOL residents. Predominance of women (68,8%) in both LTCF types was observed. DPS residents significantly more often suffered from internal diseases: COPD (13,6% vs. 4,1%), overweight and obesity (56,1% vs. 34,9%), inflammatory polyarthropathies (4,0% vs. 0,8%), dorsopathies (8,9% vs. 1,3%), osteoporosis (7,1% vs. 1,6%), diseases of the digestive system (11,7% vs. 5,7%) and hyperplasia of prostate (4,3% vs. 0,5%). Among the residents living in ZOL more frequently were observed: significant cognitive impairment and impaired ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), as well as significantly higher prevalence of neurological diseases (stroke 31,0% vs. 9,1%) and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease or dementia in 53,0% vs. 28,4%), hip fracture (8,5% vs. 2,0%) and geriatric problems (i.e. pressure ulcers 12,2% vs. 4,2%, bladder incontinence 89,9% vs. 39,6%, bowel incontinence 83,9% vs. 26,1%, and underweight BMI<18,5 kg/m2 in 17,2% vs. 2,8%). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences between the ZOL and DPS residents in functional status and prevalence of diseases were observed. The results indicate considerable differences among the residents of different types of LTCFs, which should suggest physicians to adjust diagnostic and therapeutic approach in respect to those differences."
3434387,1,a,"Previous studies reveal that career guidance is usually based on a mixture of meritocratic criteria (academic ability and achievement) and nonmeritocratic considerations (students' SES and their social labeling by counselors). The present study argues that school counselors in affluent neighborhoods emphasize the meritocratic criteria, while those in poorer neighborhoods tend to focus on the more nonmeritocratic. This hypothesis is examined in a random sample of 210 male, primary school graduates from the 10 state schools of an Israeli town, 125 of whom are from schools in affluent neighborhoods, and 85 from schools in poorer neighborhoods. A path analysis of determinants of guidance to specific high school tracks shows that students' ethnicity and labeling as problematic directly affect guidance by counselors only in the poor neighborhoods. The effect of students' ""problems"" is due to their being labeled as problematic with respect to psychological or physical attributes rather than to behavioral problems at school. The findings are subsequently interpreted as reflecting a patronizing attitude toward lower status students by counselors. Additional studies which may further elaborate the determinants of guidance in poor versus affluent neighborhoods are proposed."
3720261,1,a,"These case histories illustrate how medical, psychosocial, cultural and economic factors affect the elderly with chronic arthritis. Physicians need to be aware of their patient's attitudes, concerns, support systems and goals resulting from a lifetime of experience, to provide the most appropriate and effective care. 'Images of future are usually only caricatures of the present' (Starr, 1982), but based on current demography, one can predict trends for the future. It is likely that the elderly of the future will be better off financially, better educated, healthier, more politically connected and strident, but their social support systems will be less effective. The last stems from trends such as declining birth rate, an increasingly mobile society, diminished importance of the nuclear family, and the diminishing attractiveness of professions involved with providing maintenance care. This suggests that the physician and nurse, being the primary gatekeepers for the care of and services for the elderly, must be even more attentive to the non-biological determinants of arthritis disability."
2925863,1,a,"Social support, family functioning, self-perceptions of appearance, school, behavior, athletics, and social competence, as well as daily hassles/microstressors, were investigated as determinants of general self-esteem in 41 children with congenital/acquired limb deficiencies. Classmate, parent, teacher, and friend social support all were significant predictors of self-esteem. Family conflict and organization were also significantly associated with self-esteem, as were microstressors. The overall model of significant predictor variables accounted for 66% of the variance in general self-esteem. General self-esteem also was significantly predictive of depressive symptomatology. The findings suggest a number of factors which are potentially modifiable and which might enhance general self-esteem in children with visible physical handicaps."
23057971,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study describes the design and implementation of a health impact assessment (HIA) conducted in 2010 of the regeneration project of San Fernando Street, the main avenue crossing the San Miguel-El Castillo neighborhood in Alcala de Guadaira (Seville, Spain). This project is part of the wider URBAN Plan aimed at the social, urban and economic regeneration of the city's historic center. METHODS: This experience followed the standard HIA stages and procedures. The review of published evidence was complemented with new qualitative information gathered by means of a participative workshop with the local population and interviews with social and health workers involved in the neighborhood. RESULTS: During the building stage of the project, the adverse impacts were related to a worsening of the air quality, increased noise pollution, mobility restrictions and a higher risk of accidents, particularly among older or disabled people. Once the building stage was finished, the health benefits were associated with significant improvements in physical accessibility and the population's access to health services and other goods and services. Other positive effects were the enhanced safety and attractiveness of the neighborhood and the new opportunities for socializing, social cohesion and increasing the community's self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first HIA experience in Andalusia whose results have been integrated into a formal cycle of decision making in the local community. This experience has provided new evidence of the potential of HIA and its applicability and acceptance at the municipal level and has has also facilitated a learning process and the piloting of new methods and tools associated with the HIA process."
30727975,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The significance of sanitation to safeguard human health is irrefutable and has important public health dimensions. Access to sanitation has been essential for human dignity, health and well-being. Despite 15 years of conjunctive efforts under the global action plans like Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 2.3 billion people have no access to improved sanitation facilities (flush latrine or pit latrine) and nearly 892 million of the total world's population is still practicing open defecation. METHODS: The study provides a systematic review of the published literature related to implications of open defecation that goes beyond the scope of addressing health outcomes by also investigating social outcomes associated with open defecation. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to frame the review, empirical studies focusing upon open defecation in women aged 13-50 in low and middle income countries were included in the review. Research papers included in the review were assessed for quality using appropriate critical appraisal tools. In total 9 articles were included in the review; 5 of these related to health effects and 4 related to social effects of open defecation. RESULTS: The review identified 4 overarching themes; Health Impacts of open defecation, Increased risk of sexual exploitation, Threat to women's privacy and dignity and Psychosocial stressors linked to open defecation, which clearly present a serious situation of poor sanitation in rural communities of Lower-Middle Income Countries (LMICs). The findings of the review identified that open defecation promotes poor health in women with long-term negative effects on their psychosocial well-being, however it is a poorly researched topic. CONCLUSION: The health and social needs of women and girls remain largely unmet and often side-lined in circumstances where toilets in homes are not available. Further research is critically required to comprehend the generalizability of effects of open defecation on girls and women. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD42019119946 . Registered 9 January 2019 ."
6656327,1,a,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension."

25981341,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Quantifying the clinical impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most important determinants for optimizing individual patient care. Useful clinical measures for MS can be evaluated from different perspectives. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: This cross-sectional study compared physical disability and functional status as assessed by a neurologist and by a patient and explored how they are associated with the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS: We collected data from 223 patients. One neurologist scored functional disability using the Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and patients evaluated their functional status using the Incapacity Status Scale (ISS). HRQoL was assessed using the Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS, MCS) of the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Multiple linear regressions were applied to analyze the data. RESULTS: Total EDSS and ISS scores correlated significantly (r = .67; p </= .001). Regression analyses showed that EDSS was significantly related to PCS, but not to MCS. After adding ISS into the analysis the association between EDSS and PCS became non-significant. ISS contributed significantly to the explained variance in both models. The final model explained 49% of the total variance for PCS and 15% for MCS. CONCLUSIONS: Functional disability as measured by a neurologist (EDSS) is associated with PCS, but not with MCS, whereas functional disability as measured by patients (ISS) is significantly associated with both HRQoL dimensions. Neurologists should target their attention more on patients' evaluations of their functional status in order to detect the most bothersome problems that are affecting a patient's quality of life."
3608944,1,a,"This study examined the cognitive structures underlying women's intentions to delay or not delay seeking medical care for a breast cancer symptom. Middle-aged women imagined that they had just discovered a particular change in their breast, and they completed a questionnaire that assessed variables specified by Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action with respect to two alternative courses of action: immediately calling the doctor (i.e., prompt behavior) and monitoring the breast change on one's own (i.e., delay behavior). Also assessed were variables external to the theory that were drawn from previous research on cancer delay. Results showed that intentions to delay were positively associated with having favorable attitudes toward delay and with perceived social pressure to delay; the attitudinal factor, however, was more influential than the social factor in determining intentions. Underlying favorable attitudes toward delay were beliefs that delay would be likely to result in maintaining control over and avoiding the disruption of one's own and others' lives but would be unlikely to result in negative health outcomes. No external variable was found to contribute to intentions to delay above and beyond attitudinal and normative considerations."
28334984,0,a,"Background: Guidance on how different disciplines from the natural, behavioural and social sciences can collaborate to resolve complex public health problems is lacking. This article presents a checklist to support researchers and principle investigators to develop and implement interdisciplinary collaborations. Methods: Fourteen individuals, representing 10 disciplines, participated in in-depth interviews to explore the strengths and challenges of working together on an interdisciplinary project to identify the determinants of substance use and gambling disorders, and to make recommendations for future interdisciplinary teams. Data were analysed thematically and a checklist was derived from insights offered by participants during interview and discussion among the authors on the implications of findings. Results: Participants identified 18 scientific, interactional and structural strengths and challenges of interdisciplinary research. These findings were used to develop an 18-item BASICS checklist to support future interdisciplinary collaborations. The five domains of the checklist are: (i) Blueprint, (ii) Attitudes, (iii) Staffing, (iv) Interactions and (v) Core Science. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary work has the potential to advance public health science but the numerous challenges should not be underestimated. Use of a checklist, such as BASICS, when planning and managing projects may help future collaborations to avoid some of the common pitfalls of interdisciplinary research."
31146718,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The burden of childhood and adult obesity disproportionally affects Hispanic and African-American populations in the US, and these groups as well as populations with lower income and education levels are disproportionately affected by environmental pollution. Pregnancy is a critical developmental period where maternal exposures may have significant impacts on infant and childhood growth as well as the future health of the mother. We initiated the ""Maternal And Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES)"" cohort study to address critical gaps in understanding the increased risk for childhood obesity and maternal obesity outcomes among minority and low-income women in urban Los Angeles. METHODS: The MADRES cohort is specifically examining whether pre- and postpartum environmental exposures, in addition to exposures to psychosocial and built environment stressors, lead to excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention in women and to perturbed infant growth trajectories and increased childhood obesity risk through altered psychological, behavioral and/or metabolic responses. The ongoing MADRES study is a prospective pregnancy cohort of 1000 predominantly lower-income, Hispanic women in Los Angeles, CA. Enrollment in the MADRES cohort is initiated prior to 30 weeks gestation from partner community health clinics in Los Angeles. Cohort participants are followed through their pregnancies, at birth, and during the infant's first year of life through a series of in-person visits with interviewer-administered questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and biospecimen collection as well as telephone interviews conducted with the mother. DISCUSSION: In this paper, we outline the study rationale and data collection protocol for the MADRES cohort, and we present a profile of demographic, health and exposure characteristics for 291 participants who have delivered their infants, out of 523 participants enrolled in the study from November 2015 to October 2018 from four community health clinics in Los Angeles. Results from the MADRES cohort could provide a powerful rationale for regulation of targeted chemical environmental components, better transportation and urban design policies, and clinical recommendations for stress-coping strategies and behavior to reduce lifelong obesity risk."

31664939,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Early, regular prenatal care utilization is an important strategy for improving maternal and infant health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to better understand contributing factors to disparate prenatal care utilization outcomes among women of different racial/ethnic and social status groups before, during, and after the Great Recession (December 2007-June 2009). METHODS: Data from 678,235 Washington (WA) and Florida (FL) birth certificates were linked to community and state characteristic data to carry out cross-sectional pooled time series analyses with institutional review board approval for human subjects' research. Predictors of on-time as compared to late or non-entry to prenatal care utilization (late/no prenatal care utilization) were identified and compared among pregnant women. Also explored was a simulated triadic relationship among time (within recession-related periods), social characteristics, and prenatal care utilization by clustering individual predictors into three scenarios representing low, average, and high degrees of social disadvantage. RESULTS: Individual and community indicators of need (e.g., maternal Medicaid enrollment, unemployment rate) increased during the Recession. Associations between late/no prenatal care utilization and individual-level characteristics (including disparate associations among race/ethnicity groups) did not shift greatly with young maternal age and having less than a high school education remaining the largest contributors to late/no prenatal care utilization. In contrast, individual maternal enrollment in a supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC) exhibited a protective association against late/no prenatal care utilization. The magnitude of association between community-level partisan voting patterns and expenditures on some maternal child health programs increased in non-beneficial directions. Simulated scenarios show a high combined impact on prenatal care utilization among women who have multiple disadvantages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a compelling picture of the important roles that individual characteristics-particularly low education and young age-play in late/no prenatal care utilization among pregnant women. Targeted outreach to individuals with high disadvantage characteristics, particularly those with multiple disadvantages, may help to increase first trimester entry to utilization of prenatal care. Finally, WIC may have played a valuable role in reducing late/no prenatal care utilization, and its effectiveness during the Great Recession as a policy-based approach to reducing late/no prenatal care utilization should be further explored."
31692574,0,a,"Purpose: This study represents the current epidemiological status of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) worldwide in the first three months of 2019. Patients and methods: Full details of the MERS-CoV cases available and published in the disease outbreak news on the WHO website were retrieved. Related details of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV were extracted and analyzed by standard statistical methods. Results: A total of 107 cases of MERS-CoV, including 18 deaths (overall case fatality rate (CFR), 16.8%; male-specific CFR was 17.5% [14/80] and female-specific CFR was 14.8% [4/27]) were reported to WHO from the National International Health Regulation Focal Points of Saudi Arabia and Oman. The overall mean age was 50+/-17 years and 80 patients (74.8%) were male. The average time from the onset of the symptoms to the first hospitalization was 3+/-3.3 days; from the first hospitalization to laboratory confirmation was 3.6+/-6.5 days; from the onset of symptom to death was 17.5+/-11.7 days; and the mean length of hospitalization for patients with MERS-CoV was 3.5+/-3.9 days. Males in comparison to females had a 1.5-fold increased chance (adjusted OR =1.5 [95% CI: 1.3-1.8]) of death related to MERS-CoV infection; 1.05 [95% CI: 1.1-3.3], 1.05 [95% CI: 1.2-2.8] and 1.06 [95% CI: 1.2-2.0] for those who had exposure to camels, camel milk consumption, and close contact with MERS-CoV cases, respectively. Health care workers had 2.4 fold [95% CI: 1.2-3.1] greater odds of death compared to other people. Conclusion: The knowledge obtained from this study can contribute to the development of a prevention program and early system warning against MERS-CoV infection."

Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves."""
12281022,1,a,"This paper analyzes the migration phenomenon within a framework that treats migration movements as continuous loops, from the country of origin to the destination and back. Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications."

21994088,0,a,"Human aggression/impulsivity-related traits have a complex background that is greatly influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors. The relationship between aggression and anxiety is regulated by highly conserved brain regions including amygdala, which controls neural circuits triggering defensive, aggressive, or avoidant behavioral models. The dysfunction of neural circuits responsible for emotional control was shown to represent an etiological factor of violent behavior. In addition to the amygdala, these circuits also involve the anterior cingulated cortex and regions of the prefrontal cortex. Excessive reactivity in the amygdala coupled with inadequate prefrontal regulation serves to increase the likelihood of aggressive behavior. Developmental alterations in prefrontal-subcortical circuitry as well as neuromodulatory and hormonal abnormality appear to play a role. Imbalance in testosterone/serotonin and testosterone/cortisol ratios (e.g., increased testosterone levels and reduced cortisol levels) increases the propensity toward aggression because of reduced activation of the neural circuitry of impulse control and self-regulation. Serotonin facilitates prefrontal inhibition, and thus insufficient serotonergic activity can enhance aggression. Genetic predisposition to aggression appears to be deeply affected by the polymorphic genetic variants of the serotoninergic system that influences serotonin levels in the central and peripheral nervous system, biological effects of this hormone, and rate of serotonin production, synaptic release and degradation. Among these variants, functional polymorphisms in the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) may be of particular importance due to the relationship between these polymorphic variants and anatomical changes in the limbic system of aggressive people. Furthermore, functional variants of MAOA and 5-HTT are capable of mediating the influence of environmental factors on aggression-related traits. In this review, we consider genetic determinants of human aggression, with special emphasis on genes involved in serotonin and dopamine metabolism and function."
3992291,1,a,"The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed."
27666269,0,a,"The health of children and adolescents of Armenia has been affected by various socioeconomic, environmental, educational, and behavioral factors, demonstrating trends typical for both developed and developing countries. Key issues to be addressed by Armenian pediatricians are child mortality, malnutrition, and growth failure in the early years and overweight in later years. The case of Armenia illustrates how countries in transition are currently tackling both ""old"" problems (mortality and malnutrition) and ""new"" emerging morbidities (chronic diseases and adolescent health problems) based on social and health determinants, but the financing of the health system is far from satisfactory. Lessons of Armenia indicate the need for more cooperation between general practitioners and pediatricians at a primary care level. In addition, a better balance between inpatient and outpatient care could be achieved, which is not yet the case. Nevertheless, the overall performance of the Armenian child health care system can be considered satisfactory when bearing in mind the limitation of resources. Among the successful factors are those inherited from the Soviet period health system, including key institutions such as rural health posts and health centers, city polyclinics, and hospitals. These institutions mostly meet the needs of Armenian children and families today."
3354493,1,a,"In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking."
27108079,0,a,"Universal health coverage (UHC) is at the heart of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Health service integration is seen by World Health Organization as an essential requirement to achieve UHC. However, to date the debate on service integration has focused on perceived benefits rather than empirical impact. We conducted a global review in a systematic manner searching for empirical outcomes of service integration experiments in UHC countries and those on the path to UHC. Sixty-seven articles and reports were found. We grouped results into a unique integration typology with six categories - medical staff from different disciplines; patients and medical staff; care package for one medical condition; care package for two or more medical conditions; specialist stand-alone services with GP services; community locations. We showed that it is possible to integrate services in different human development contexts delivering positive outcomes for patients and clinicians without incurring additional costs. However, the improved outcomes shown were incremental rather than radical and suggest that integration is likely to enhance already well established systems rather than fundamentally changing the outcomes of care."

This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact."
3629664,1,a,"Data from a 1982 sample survey of 3,830 married women below age 50 in a district of Beijing City are applied to the Bongaarts model of the proximate determinants of fertility. A total fertility rate (TFR) of 0.75 births per woman is estimated from the model, compared with a TFR of 1.24 actually observed from the survey. The estimated TFR (0.75) results from the assumed total fecundity (TF) of 15.30 births per woman being inhibited by the indexes of the proximate determinants of fertility, most notably non-marriage (.280), contraception (.315), and induced abortion (.586). The effects of two other proximate determinants, lactational infecundability and spousal separation, were negligible. Comparative data from other countries confirm that the study area has very low levels of fertility and marriage, a very high prevalence of induced abortion, and a small effect of lactational infecundability. The extremely low level of fertility was, thus, achieved through a high level of induced abortion. Future research needs and policy implications associated with the study are discussed."
3933036,1,a,"The hypothesis was examined that the interaction of ethanol with the conditions under which it is administered may determine whether either preference or aversion for the drug develops. In Experiment 1, eight groups of food-deprived rats received injections of ethanol (175-1,400 mg/kg) in one environment and were later offered a choice between that environment and a different one previously associated with saline injections. Another eight groups were treated identically, except that food was available in both the saline and ethanol-paired environments. The groups given the drug without food showed no preference or aversion at low doses (175-700 mg/kg), but showed aversion at higher doses (1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg). When food was available, there was an increased preference for the environment paired with the 500 mg/kg dose and reduced aversion at the 1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg doses. In Experiment 2, placing two rats together increased each rat's preference for the environment associated with the other animal. However, rats pretreated with 500 mg/kg ethanol before being placed together showed a reduced preference for the environment associated with the drug and the other animal. Controls never paired with another rat showed no preference or aversion at the same ethanol dose. Thus, ethanol may interact with conditions such as the presence of food or another animal to determine final effects that are unique to those conditions."
20522271,0,a,"This study examines the prevalence and determinants of adolescents' unintended pregnancy and induced abortion in Owerri, Nigeria. A pre-coded questionnaire was used to obtain information from 540 female adolescents of mean age 15.8 years. In addition, four FGDs were held with female adolescents in selected localities and in-depth interviews held with fifteen health-care service providers. Almost all the adolescents (99.8%) were Christians, with 70.3% being Catholics and 68.2% living with their parents. Over half (57.2%) of the adolescents had had sex. Contraceptives were rarely used owing to deep-seated cultural values. The data show that 31.6% of those who had ever had sex had an unintended pregnancy. Of these, 78.9% had recurrent pregnancies and 20.2% had an abortion. Of the latter, 41.8% had a recurrent abortion and 72.7% a post-abortion problem, for which 70.2% never sought treatment, increasing the risk of infertility in later life. The abortion seekers mostly went to patent medicine operators. A more acceptable and cost-effective contraceptive campaign involving use of local vernacular and traditional/local opinion leaders should be explored."
27628650,0,a,"BACKGROUND: An important health issue in urban areas is how changes arising from the regeneration of city-areas affect social determinants of health and equity. This paper examines the impacts attributable to a new fish market and to delays in the regeneration of a port area in a deteriorated region of the Bay of Pasaia (Spain). Potential differential impacts on local residents and socially vulnerable groups were evaluated to determine health inequalities. METHODS: An in-depth, prospective and concurrent Health-Impact-Assessment (HIA) focused on equity was conducted by the regional Public Health Department, following the Merseyside guidelines. Data from different sources was triangulated and impacts were identified using qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: The intervention area is characterised by poor social, environmental, and health indicators. The distinctness of the two projects generates contrasting health and inequality impacts: generally positive for the new fish market and negative for the port area. The former creates recreational spaces and improves urban quality and social cohesion. By contrast, inaction and stagnation of the project in the port area perpetuates deterioration, a lack of safety, and poor health, as well as increased social frustration. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to assessing the health impacts of both projects this HIA promoted intersectoral partnerships, boosted a holistic and positive view of health and incorporated health and equity into the political discourse. Community-level participatory action enabled public health institutions to respond to new urban planning challenges and responsibilities in a more democratic manner."

7143281,1,a,"Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae.

The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance. Although laymen had roughly similar rank orderings for the 13 homogeneous clusters of items, blacks indicated greater concern over breakdowns in social orientation than whites, while the opposite pattern held for traditionally defined psychopathy (internal distresses). Upper-class concerns were, comparatively, with cognitive dysfunction, middle-class with moral and social responsibility, and lower-class with social inadequacies."
30362506,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The objective was to estimate the frequency of visits to a dentist and to assess the impact of determinants on dental care utilisation among adults in the Republic of Srpska (RS), Bosnia and Herzegovina. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the 2010 National Health Survey performed in the RS. A total of 4,128 adults (>/=18 years) were interviewed in their homes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between demographic characteristics, socio-economic characteristics, health behaviours, self-rated health, self-reported noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and dental care utilisation. RESULTS: Only 20% of all respondents reported a visit to a dentist in the year preceding the interview. Younger respondents (OR = 0.97), women (OR = 1.30-1.39), urban dwellers (OR = 1.41-1.61), those who were employed (OR = 1.20) and those who self-reported NCDs (OR = 1.32-1.33) more frequently utilised dental services. The opposite was true for those in the low wealth index group (OR = 0.79), persons with a low (OR = 0.31) and middle (OR = 0.48) level of education and people who self-rated their health as average (OR = 0.76-0.80). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a low frequency of visits to a dentist, especially for preventive oral health care. It also confirmed demographic, socio-economic and health-related differences in dental-care utilisation in RS. To minimise those differences, systemic approaches aimed at increasing access to dental care could be an important step. Oral health-promotion policies need to be adopted in the RS."
6644542,1,a,"Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition."
2766211,1,a,"An increasing number of mothers of preschool children in Canada (either by choice or economic necessity) have entered the work force. It is estimated for example that 58-80% of mothers of preschool children are working. In Canada in 1986, 51.6% of women in the work force had children under the age of five (1). It is beyond the scope and intent of this paper to discuss the merits (or possible harm) of day care per se. The aim of this paper is to discuss aspects of the quality of day care, and how this might be improved by child psychiatrists being involved in day care centres and in their organization. Few would doubt that the emotional climate and the development of trusting relationships to significant others, in the first year of life, are essential determinants of the healthy personality. Hence the quality of the day care experience of small children is an essential area of study for the child psychiatrist which is as yet insufficiently recognized. This paper discusses what has been learned from the literature and from experience as a consultation-liaison child psychiatrist to a day care centre. A case example illustrates some of the important issues."

29851971,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The relative influence of prematurity vs. maternal social factors (socioeconomic status and education level) on academic performance has rarely been examined. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of prematurity and maternal social factors on academic performance from 3rd through 8th grade. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants born in 1998 at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The study sample included 58 extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, 23<28 weeks), 171 preterm (>/=28<34 weeks), 228 late preterm (>/=34<37 weeks), and 967 term ((>/=37<42 weeks) infants. Neonatal and maternal variables were collected including maternal insurance status (proxy measure for socioeconomic status) and education level. The primary outcomes were literacy and mathematics achievement-test scores from 3rd through 8th grade. Linear mixed models were used to identify significant predictors of academic performance. All two-way interactions between grade level, gestational-age (GA) groups, and social factors were tested for statistical significance. RESULTS: Prematurity, social factors, gender, race, gravidity, and Apgar score at one minute were critical determinants of academic performance. Favorable social factors were associated with a significant increase in both literacy and mathematic scores, while prematurity was associated with a significant decrease in mathematic scores. Examination of GA categories and social factors interaction suggested that the impact of social factors on test scores was similar for all GA groups. Furthermore, the impact of social factors varied from grade to grade for literacy, while the influence of either GA groups or social factors was constant across grades for mathematics. For example, an ELGAN with favorable social factors had a predicted literacy score 104.1 (P <.001), 98.2 (P <.001), and 76.4 (P <.01) points higher than an otherwise similar disadvantaged term infant at grades 3, 5, and 8, respectively. The difference in their predicted mathematic scores was 33.4 points for all grades (P <.05). CONCLUSION: While there were significant deficits in academic performance for ELGANs compared to PT, LPT, and term infants, the deficit could be offset by higher SES and better-educated mothers. These favorable social factors were critical to a child's academic achievement. The role of socioeconomic factors should be incorporated in discussions on outcome with families of preterm infants."
12281022,1,a,"This paper analyzes the migration phenomenon within a framework that treats migration movements as continuous loops, from the country of origin to the destination and back. Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications."
3701582,1,a,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors."
7145506,1,a,"The relationship between levels of moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care was investigated in a sample of 452 pediatricians. Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed. Institutional type accounted for 43% of the variation in mean activism scores whereas moral reasoning accounted for only 4%; however, because one could, a priori, expect institutional norms and customs to be powerful determinants of behavior, any additional, identifiable influence deserves attention. The structure of individuals' moral reasoning seems to be such an influence."

26694788,0,a,"AIM: Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency. The classic treatment for this condition is surgery but early diagnosis allows for non-surgical treatment. In recent years, intramuscular methotrexate has been considered, due to easy administration, its less invasive nature and low complications, but there are arguments about its effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate tubal patency after treatment of ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate and related factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 80 women with ectopic pregnancy who were admitted to Sanandaj Be'sat Hospital in 2014. Patients who had successful treatment for ectopic pregnancy with single or multiple doses of methotrexate 50 mL/m(2) were enrolled. Three to 6 months after treatment, the patients were evaluated for tubal patency by hysterosalpingography. Data were analyzed using spss, t-tests, chi(2) -test and logistic regression. RESULTS: The tubal patency rate after treatment of ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate was 75% in hysterosalpingography. The average size of the ectopic pregnancy mass of women with open fallopian tubes was 22.5 +/- 7.0 mm and for women with closed fallopian tubes it was 34.7 +/- 10.0 mm (P = 0.0001). beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels were 642.1 +/- 850.5 in women with open fallopian tubes and 3816.3 +/- 4487.3 for women with closed fallopian tubes (P = 0.0001). There was no significant correlation statistically between tubal patency with a history of stillbirth and number of pregnancies (P > 0.5). There was a statistically significant relation between tubal patency and the number of births and also methotrexate dose (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment of ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate is effective for saving tubal patency. Levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin-beta < 1745, the treatment regimen of methotrexate (single or multiple doses) and ectopic pregnancy mass size smaller than 33.5 mm are significant predictors of tubal patency."

23093718,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We examine the influence of social circumstances early in life on changes in cognitive function from young adulthood to middle age, and we explore the impact of birth characteristics, childhood activities, education and adult social class on the expected relationship. METHODS: A cohort of 11 532 men born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1953-7906, 10 246 and 2483 participants-had completed assessments of cognitive function at ages 12, 18 and 57 years, respectively. Linear regression was used to investigate the association of early-life characteristics with cognitive test scores at these ages and with score changes from early to mid-adulthood. RESULTS: The cognitive scores at age 57 years had high correlations with scores at ages 12 (r = 0.67) and 18 years (r = 0.70), and these two scores also showed bivariate correlation (r = 0.69). Having a father from the working class at birth was associated with lower cognitive function at ages 12, 18 and 57 years. The latter relation was attenuated when educational status at age 18 years and adult social class were adjusted for, while birth characteristics and childhood activities had minor influence. Having an unskilled father at birth, low education, few intellectual and many social activities in childhood as well as low adult social class were associated with decline in cognitive function. CONCLUSION: Adverse social circumstances early in life were associated with lower cognitive function at ages 12, 18 and 57 years, as well as with a decline between these ages. Educational status at age 18 years and adult social class seemed to account for most of the associations, whereas childhood activities were independent predictors that did not explain the social inequality."
28664253,0,a,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pervasive disparities in T2DM among minority adults are well-documented, and scholars have recently focused on the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in disparities. Yet, no research has summarized what is known about racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM. This review summarizes the current literature on racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM, discusses SDOH that are common among youth with T2DM, and introduces a conceptual model on the possible role of SDOH in youth-onset T2DM disparities. RECENT FINDINGS: Minority youth have disparities in the onset of T2DM, quality of life, and family burden. Low family income and parental education and high youth stress are common negative SDOH among families of youth with T2DM. No studies have examined the role of SDOH in racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM. Future research should examine whether SDOH contribute to disparities in T2DM prevalence and psychosocial outcomes among minority youth."
29439740,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Inequality in life expectancy (ILE) is defined as inequality in the distribution of expected span of life-based on data from survival tables estimated using the Atkinson inequality index. ILE can be influenced by socio-ecological indicators including the Gini coefficient, secondary education, output per worker, and old age pension. This study examined the effects on ILE from a social ecology perspective. METHODS: This analysis is based on ILE data from 108 countries obtained from the United Nations Development Programme. Data on socio-ecological indicators were obtained from the United Nations database. The associations between socio-ecological indicators and ILE were assessed using correlation coefficients and multiple regression models. RESULTS: Significant correlations were evident between ILE and the following indicators from a socio-ecological perspective: Gini coefficient (GC: r = 0.335, p = 0.001) as an indicator of income inequality, female population with at least some secondary education (FSE: r = - 0.757, p = 0.001), male population with at least some secondary education (MSE: r = - 0.741, p = 0.001), output per worker as a measure of labor productivity (OPW: r = - 0.714, p = 0.001), and number of old age pension recipients (OPR: r = - 0.641, p = 0.001). In multivariate regression, the ILE predictors were higher GC and lower levels of FSE, MSE, OPW, and OPR (R(2) = 0.648, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Socio-ecological factors have an important effect on ILE. Policies that address ILE should consider targeted socio-ecological factors, such as the Gini coefficient of income inequality, that give a personal perspective of economic deprivation, attainment of at least a secondary education by both females and males that gives a social environment perspective, output per worker that indicates labor productivity, and the number of old age pension recipients that indicates social security from a public policy perspective."
28605549,0,a,"Social, ecological, and climatic factors interact creating a heterogeneous matrix that determines the spatiotemporal distribution of mosquitoes and human risks of exposure to the diseases they transmit. We explore linkages between the social and institutional processes behind residential abandonment, urban ecology, and the interactions of socio-ecological processes with abiotic drivers of mosquito production. Specifically, we test the relative roles of infrastructure degradation and vegetation for explaining the presence of Aedes albopictus Skuse 1894 to better predict spatial heterogeneity in mosquito exposure risk within urban environments. We further examine how precipitation interacts with these socially underpinned biophysical variables. We use a hierarchical statistical modeling approach to assess how environmental and climatic conditions over 3 years influence mosquito ecology across a socioeconomic gradient in Baltimore, MD. We show that decaying infrastructure and vegetation are important determinants of Ae. albopictus infestation. We demonstrate that both precipitation and vegetation influence mosquito production in ways that are mediated by the level of infrastructural decay on a given block. Mosquitoes were more common on blocks with greater abandonment, but when precipitation was low, mosquitoes were more likely to be found in higher-income neighborhoods with managed container habitat. Likewise, although increased vegetation was a negative predictor of mosquito infestation, more vegetation on blocks with high abandonment was associated with the largest mosquito populations. These findings indicate that fine spatial scale modeling of mosquito habitat within urban areas is needed to more accurately target vector control."
23013288,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Experiencing positive consequences of one's physical activity is supposed to facilitate further activity. This motivational outcome might be generated by an increase in perceived self-efficacy. In addition to such a mediator effect, we examine whether this applies generally or only under conditions of volitional control. For this purpose, perceived action control was considered as a putative moderator. DESIGN AND METHOD: N = 193 students participated in a study with three measurement points in time. At baseline, positive experience with previous physical activity was measured as a predictor of physical activity. Two weeks later, self-efficacy and action control variables were assessed as putative mediator and moderator, respectively. After another 2 weeks, physical activity was measured as the outcome. A moderated mediation model was specified with baseline physical activity and sex as covariates. RESULTS: Self-efficacy was found to mediate between initial positive experience and later physical activity, and this mediation was moderated by action control. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' perceptions of positive experience were associated with their subsequent self-efficacy fostering physical activity. However, persons with low levels of action control did not translate positive experience into physical activity via self-efficacy. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Numerous studies have shown that exercise-specific self-efficacy predicts subsequent physical activity. Prior positive experience with physical activity is suggested to be associated with exercise-specific self-efficacy. Furthermore, action control was found to be beneficial for the maintenance of physical activity. What does this study add? This study unveils the mechanisms between these social-cognitive determinants: our longitudinal results suggest that the mediation of positive experience and subsequent physical activity via self-efficacy is moderated by action control. Persons with low levels of action control did not translate positive experience into physical activity via self-efficacy."

6736597,1,a,"This article analyzes and criticizes the "" technocratic "" view of occupational health and safety policies, which sees the values of the personnel in ""post-industrial"" regulatory agencies as the most important determinant of those policies. It takes an alternate position, which explains occupational health and safety policies as primarily resulting from the different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor), and from the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It shows how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies explains Swedish occupational health and safety policies better than a mere analysis of the regulators' views. And it concludes that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to those in the U.S.--as the "" technocratic "" theorists assume--but rather offer more protection to the workers than U.S. policies do. This situation is a result of labor having more power in Sweden than it has in the U.S. The different class formations and class behavior in the two societies are compared, and the implications of this comparison for occupational health and safety policies are discussed."
24066987,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the development and implementation of promotion of physical activity in a rural community by applying the principles of social marketing and to determine participation behaviour in a physical activity programme in a community setting. METHODS: The intervention targeted 485 people, 20-49 years of age, residents of Periakattupalayam and Rangareddipalayam villages, Tamil Nadu. This community-based participatory research was based on the principles of 'social marketing'. Health education by one-to-one counselling, written materials and community events were used to popularize moderate intensity physical activity (brisk walking for 30 minutes on 4 days/week). We formed 30 walking groups under four coordinators, in a home-based setting with professional supervision and guidance. A log of physical activity sessions for the 10-week intervention period was maintained in the form of group attendance record. Village leaders, self-help groups and youth clubs were involved in promoting physical activity. RESULTS: Of the 485 subjects, 265 people (54.6%) engaged in brisk walking >4 days a week, while 156 subjects (32.2%) performed walking on 1-4 days per week during the intervention. The drop-out rate was 13.2% (64 subjects). Age, occupation and educational status were important determinants of participation and adherence to the physical activity programme. CONCLUSION: Application of social marketing techniques in an intervention to promote physical activity was successful in a rural Indian community. Studying the determinants of adoption of a physical activity programme and addressing the barriers to behaviour change are essential for designing relevant policies and effective programmes."
25077079,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There has been an increase in institutional delivery rates in India in the recent years. However, in areas with high institutional delivery rates, most deliveries (>50%) occur in private institutions rather than in government facilities where zero expense delivery services are being provided. AIM: This study aimed to understand, from the community health volunteers' viewpoint, the reasons for underutilization of zero expense delivery services provided in government health facilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five Focused Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted among Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHAs) of a Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Dayalpur village, Haryana in December 2012. Participants were asked to articulate the possible reasons that they thought were responsible for expectant mothers not choosing to deliver in government health facilities. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants. RESULT: The commonly stated reasons for underutilization of government health facilities for delivery services were lack of quality care, abominable behaviour of hospital staff, poor transportation facilities, and frequent referrals to higher centres. CONCLUSION: This study reflected the necessity for new policies to make government health facilities friendlier and more easily accessible to clients and to make all government hospitals follow a minimum set of standards for providing quality care."

30869024,0,a,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF), an auto-immune response to a group A Streptococcus infection and precursor to rheumatic heart disease (RHD), remains endemic in many socio-economically disadvantaged settings. A Global Resolution on ARF and RHD was recently adopted at the 71st World Health Assembly where governments committed to improving efforts to prevent and control ARF and RHD. To inform these efforts, the objectives of this study were to examine associations between childhood ARF in the UK between 1958 and 1969 and a range of environmental and social factors. Of 17 416 children from the nationally representative birth cohort of the National Child Development Study, ARF was reported in 23 children during early childhood (between birth and the 7-year follow-up) and in 29 additional children during middle childhood (between the 7- and 11-year follow-ups). Risk factors associated with ARF in both early and middle childhood were: a large family size; attendance at a private nursery or class; a history of nephritis, kidney or urinary tract infections; and a history of throat or ear infections. Risk factors for ARF in early childhood alone were families with fathers in a professional or semi-professional occupation and families who moved out of their local neighbourhood. Risk factors in late childhood alone included overcrowding and free school meals. These data suggest that prevention strategies in ARF endemic settings may be enhanced by targeting, for example, new members entering a community and children in environments of close contact, such as a nursery or shared bedrooms."
7362431,1,a,"We present a cross-cultural exploration of the interrelationships among six concepts: achievement (ie, cultural attainment), aggression, psychological distress, competition, interpersonal intensity (strength of passionate attachments), and social synergy (patterned behavior that simultaneously benefits both individual and society). Of interest is the proposition that levels of achievement, aggression, and psychological distress are partly determined by corresponding levels of competition and interpersonal intensity; however, in the presence of high levels of social synergy, aggression and psychological distress are lowered without affecting the level of achievement. We have tested the implied linear relationships, using blind ratings (of five variables assessed from ethnographic extracts) obtained from ten cross-cultural scholars, and a Social Development Index (from Tatje and Naroll) to indicate achievement.

Identifying current status of the elderly is necessary to design educational intervention programs to improve their health and quality of life. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the lifestyle of the elderly in Islamshar (suburban of Tehran). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive - analytical study conducted among 480 elderly people over 60 years old referred to Islamshahr Health Center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences for a period of 12 months in 2012-2013. Data were collected through at two-part questionnaire including sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and healthy lifestyle instrument. Healthy lifestyle of the elderly was assessed using a 46 items self-report standard instrument with five subscales reflecting domains including exercise, nutrition, prevention, stress management, and social relationship. Finally, the data obtained were analyzed using the SPSS 18 software using an independent t-test, analysis of variance and ordinal logistic regression test at a significant level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: Mean score of total healthy lifestyle was 148.56 +/- 11.5. Men and women scored 151.95 +/- 11.15 and 145 +/- 10.32, respectively (P < 0.001). 76.2% of participants had moderately healthy lifestyle, and 23.8% had desirable healthy lifestyle.

6495362,1,a,"In Sri Lanka in 1975, the majority Sinhalese had a much higher use of contraception than either the Sri Lanka Tamils or the Moors. This study uses a national sample of women of childbearing age gathered by the Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey in 1975 to assess four possible reasons for differential contraceptive use: (1) differences in socioeconomic position; (2) cultural differences; (3) minority status; and (4) differential access to family planning services. The first three explanations focus on differences in the demand for contraception while the fourth explanation focuses on differences in the availability of contraceptives. The socioeconomic, cultural, and minority status hypotheses fail to explain the higher contraceptive use among the Sinhalese. The evidence is consistent with the idea that ethnic differences in contraceptive use were largely caused by differential access to family planning services."

The lowest ratings were given to the pension scheme and factors connected with remuneration. A highly statistically significant relationship was found between the job classification and the level of professional satisfaction (p < 0.001). Qualitative analysis of responses to the two open-ended questions supported Herzberg's Two-Factor theory: internal factors promoted satisfaction, whilst external ones caused dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Managers of nurses should strengthen the areas that contribute to higher employee satisfaction, particularly interpersonal relationships, by commendation and recognition of work effects."
25904944,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to detect low parasite and asymptomatic malaria infections by means of three malaria diagnostic tests, in a low transmission region of Minab district, Hormozgan Province, southern Iran. METHODS: Blood samples of 200 healthy volunteers from Bagh-e-Malek area were evaluated using microscopic, rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and nested-PCR to inspect malaria parasite. RESULTS: The results showed no Plasmodium parasite in subjects by means of microscopy and RDT. However, 3 P. vivax positive samples (1.5%) were discovered by Nested-PCR while microscopy and RDT missed the cases. CONCLUSION: Microscopy as the gold standard method and RDT correctly identified 98.5% of cases, and molecular analysis is sensitive and reliable, especially in the detection of ""asymptomatic"" infections for active case surveillance. Regarding the existence of asymptomatic malaria in endemic area of Hormozgan, Iran, nested-PCR could be considered as a sensitive tool to interrupt malaria transmission in the country, beside the microscopic and RDT methods."
7031748,1,a,"Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes."
24761239,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Menopause represents the end of women reproductive career and it is at this time they begin to manifest morbidities such as urinary incontinence. AIM: To document proximate determinants of sexual activity and urological morbidities of menopausal women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a community survey conducted among 254 menopausal women Mokola in Ibadan, Nigeria in 2008. Respondents were selected using cluster sampling technique. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to obtain information on their characteristics, pattern of urological and sexual activities. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariable tests were performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 15.0 (Chicago, IL USA) and statistical significance was set at P value less than 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of subjects was 60.3 (standard deviation = 10.2 years). About 33.5% (85/254) was still sexually active. About 68% (173/254) reported a reduction in sexual frequency since menopause while 31.5% (80/254) reported no change. The mean self-rated sexual performance score was 4.3 based on a numerical scale where 10 is the maximum obtainable. Significant predictors of reduction in sexual activity were age at menopause and education. Those between 45 and 49 years were less likely than those at 55 years or more (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21; 95% confidence interval OR = 0.05-0.87) while women with at least secondary education were thrice less likely than those with none to report a reduction in sexual activity after menopause. Less than a tenth reported urinary incontinence as a complaint. Urge incontinence was the most commonly reported followed by dysuria and stress incontinence. Less than a quarter of them had requested for a form of treatment. CONCLUSION: Sexual performance of Nigerian menopausal women is associated with age at menopause and education. Non-fistulous urinary incontinence is now being mentioned as a complaint contrary to the widely held view that it is part of the aging process. Therefore, awareness creation on management opportunities should be shared with them."
3965566,1,a,"Data from two national longitudinal studies of older workers were examined in order to compare the determinants and consequences of retirement for white and black men, and for poverty, marginal, and upper economic level men. The number of categories important in determining retirement was greater for white men than for black men and increased with increase in economic level. Retirement was found to have few consequences, being important mainly with respect to health and economic matters. Blacks and poverty level men were minimally affected by retirement, the impact of retirement probably being somewhat ameliorated by age-determined income maintenance programs and subsidies. Men at the marginal economic level were affected most adversely."
21503462,0,a,"Hospitalization rates for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions have been used to assess effectiveness of the first level of health care. From a critical analysis of related concepts, we discuss principles for selecting a list of codes and, taking the example of the Brazilian Family Health Program, propose a methodological pathway for identifying variables in order to inform statistical models of analysis. We argue that for the indicator to be comparable between regions, disease codes should be selected based on sensitivity and specificity principles, not on observed disease frequency. Rates of hospitalization will be determined, at a distal level, by the socio-economic environment and their effect on the social and demographic structure. Timely and effective care depends on the organization of health services, their availability and access barriers, which depend on the ways health and related technology are conceptualised and on their adherence to the biomedical model or to the Primary Health Care (PHC) principles; performance indicators of the health system will be the proximal determinants. This indicator is potentially useful for primary care evaluation. The historical reconstruction of PHC improves the analysis of the indicator variability."
21645393,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In the past years, cumulative evidence has convincingly demonstrated that the work environment is a critical determinant of workers' mental health. Nevertheless, much less attention has been dedicated towards understanding the pathways through which other pivotal life environments might also concomitantly intervene, along with the work environment, to bring about mental health outcomes in the workforce. The aim of this study consisted in conducting a systematic review examining the relative contribution of non-work determinants to the prediction of workers' mental health in order to bridge that gap in knowledge. METHODS: We searched electronic databases and bibliographies up to 2008 for observational longitudinal studies jointly investigating work and non-work determinants of workers' mental health. A narrative synthesis (MOOSE) was performed to synthesize data and provide an assessment of study conceptual and methodological quality. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected for evaluation. Seven of these were of relatively high methodological quality. Assessment of study conceptual quality yielded modest analytical breadth and depth in the ways studies conceptualized the non-work domain as defined by family, network and community/society-level indicators. We found evidence of moderate strength supporting a causal association between social support from the networks and workers' mental health, but insufficient evidence of specific indicator involvement for other analytical levels considered (i.e., family, community/society). CONCLUSIONS: Largely underinvestigated, non-work determinants are important to the prediction of workers' mental health. More longitudinal studies concomitantly investigating work and non-work determinants of workers' mental health are warranted to better inform healthy workplace research, intervention, and policy."
12280405,1,a,"An overview of the relationship between demographic factors and rural poverty in developing countries is presented. The author examines both the micro- and macro-level perspectives of this relationship and the determinants and consequences of population growth. The author notes the prospects for a rapid increase in the rural labor force and considers its implications for the agricultural production structure and the need for institutional change. Consideration is also given to the continuing demand for high fertility at the family level and the role of infant and child mortality in the poverty cycle. ""The paper concludes by drawing attention to the need for developing the mechanism for reconciliation of social and individual optima with respect to family size and population growth."" The need for rural development projects that take demographic factors into account is stressed as is the need for effective population programs. (summary in FRE, ITA)"
29455724,0,a,"Adolescent and young adult men do poorly on indicators of mental health evidenced by elevated rates of suicide, conduct disorder, substance use, and interpersonal violence relative to their female peers. Data on global health burden clearly demonstrate that young men have a markedly distinct health risk profile from young women, underscoring different prevention and intervention needs. Evidence indicates that boys disconnect from health-care services during adolescence, marking the beginning of a progression of health-care disengagement and associated barriers to care, including presenting to services differently, experiencing an inadequate or poorly attuned clinical response, and needing to overcome pervasive societal attitudes and self-stigma to access available services. This review synthesizes key themes related to mental ill health in adolescent boys and in young adult men. Key social determinants are discussed, including mental health literacy, self-stigma and shame, masculinity, nosology and diagnosis, and service acceptability. A call is made for focused development of policy, theory, and evaluation of targeted interventions for this population, including gender-synchronized service model reform and training of staff, including the e-health domain. Such progress is expected to yield significant social and economic benefits, including reduction to mental ill health and interpersonal violence displayed by adolescent boys and young adult men."
3435040,1,a,"A cohort of 1163 pregnant women in two small towns in South Wales, UK, was identified and followed until the children born to them were five years of age. Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers. There effects decreased with age but there were still residual effects at age five years."
30328020,0,a,"Given that there is a lack of instruments assessing internet-related addictions among Chinese population, this study aimed to validate the Chinese version of the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Scales- Short Form (IGDS-SF9), Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), and Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (SABAS) among Hong Kong university students. Participants aged between 17 and 30 years participated in the present study (n = 307; 32.4% males; mean [SD] age = 21.64 [8.11]). All the participants completed the IGDS-SF9, BSMAS, SABAS, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were used to examine the factorial structures and the unidimensionality for IGDS-SF9, BSMAS, and SABAS. CFAs demonstrated that the three scales were all unidimensional with satisfactory fit indices: comparative fit index = 0.969 to 0.992. In addition, the IGDS-SF9 and BSMAS were slightly modified based on the modification index in CFA. The Chinese IGDS-SF9, BSMAS, and SABAS are valid instruments to assess the addiction levels of internet-related activities for Hong Kong university students."
31813691,0,a,"Fetuses and young children are sensitive to even low levels of exposure to Hg, which can damage their brain and adversely affect their central nervous system and cognitive development. This study was conducted to determine the maternal and fetal mercury burden levels in mothers presenting to Shahidan Mobini Hospital for delivery. Eighty-nine mothers were included in this study and 360 samples were taken from their placental tissue and blood (maternal blood) as well as their umbilical cord tissue blood (infant blood). Findings revealed a significant strong correlation (r=0.890, p<0.001) in blood mercury between mothers and their infants. According to multiple linear regression analysis, there was a significant positive association between living in rural areas and the level of mercury in the placental tissue (beta=11.09, p<0.001). This positive association was also found in other samples. In addition, there was a significant association between maternal age and mercury level in the placental tissue (beta=5.56, p=0.049), placental blood (beta=11.67, p=0.003), umbilical cord tissue (beta=8.33, p=0.004) and umbilical cord blood (beta=9.51, p<0.001)."
29143960,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Among children with epilepsy, to develop and evaluate a model to predict emergency department (ED) use, an indicator of poor disease control and/or poor access to care. METHODS: We used electronic health record data from 2013 to predict ED use in 2014 at 2 centers, benchmarking predictive performance against machine learning algorithms. We evaluated algorithms by calculating the expected yearly ED visits among the 5% highest risk individuals. We estimated the breakeven cost per patient per year for an intervention that reduced ED visits by 10%. We estimated uncertainty via cross-validation and bootstrapping. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed multiple potential predictors of ED use (demographics, social determinants of health, comorbidities, insurance, disease severity, and prior health care utilization). A 3-variable model (prior ED use, insurance, number of antiepileptic drugs [AEDs]) performed as well as the best machine learning algorithm at one center (N = 2730; ED visits among top 5% highest risk, 3-variable model, mean = 2.9, interquartile range [IQR] = 2.7-3.1 vs Random Forest, mean = 2.9, IQR = 2.7-3.1), and superior at the second (N = 784; mean = 2.5, IQR = 2.2-2.9 vs mean = 1.9, IQR = 1.6-2.5). The per-patient-per-year breakeven point using this model to identify high-risk individuals was $958 (95% confidence interval [CI] = $568-$1390) at one center and $1086 (95% CI = $886-$1320) at the second. SIGNIFICANCE: Prior ED use, insurance status, and number of AEDs, taken together, predict future ED use for children with epilepsy. Our estimates suggest a program targeting high-risk children with epilepsy that reduced ED visits by 10% could spend approximately $1000 per patient per year and break even. Further work is indicated to develop and evaluate such programs."
31368213,0,a,"Cultural determinants of obesity prevalence have been little studied but could explain significant variations in body mass index (BMI) trajectories among countries. This ecological study quantified longitudinal associations between six dimensions of national culture and mean population BMI over 25 years. National mean male and female BMI data 1990 to 2014 provided dependent variables. National dimensions of culture (from the Hofstede database for up to 87 countries) were independent variables: Individualism, Uncertainty avoidance, Indulgence, Long-term orientation, Power distance, and Masculinity. Analyses used mixed models for repeated measures for each dimension of national culture with male and female adult BMI trajectories, controlling for confounders. A higher mean BMI was significantly associated with higher Individualism, Uncertainty avoidance, Indulgence, and Masculine orientation and with lower Power distance (males only) and lower Long-term orientation (males only). Overall, the national cultural dimensions explained 62.4% (males) and 53.5% (females) of the variance in mean BMI among countries. National cultural characteristics, especially Individualism and Uncertainty avoidance, are strongly related to obesity prevalence, explaining over half of the variance among countries. More research and theory development is needed to understand the pathways for these associations so that cultural contexts can be better accounted for in policies, social marketing messages, and community-based actions for obesity prevention."
2722362,1,a,"Social class (SC) conveys information about a child's potential lead exposure (PB) as well as other, independent determinants of cognition (IQ). Thus, depending on the way in which SC is handled in statistical analyses, the PB-IQ association may be either 'overadjusted' or 'underadjusted' for SC. Two assumptions that underlie the inclusion of SC in correlation/regression analyses of the PB-IQ relationship are: 1) SC is an interval scale and 2) the PB-IQ relationship is homogeneous in all social strata. Simulation analyses are presented to illustrate the impact that different values of the bivariate correlations PB-SC, IQ-SC, and PB-IQ have on the estimate of the PB-IQ adjusted for SC. Alternative approaches to addressing these issues are discussed."
25062077,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Previous literature has emphasized the importance of cost sharing, health literacy, socioeconomic status, cognitive function, disease burden, and polypharmacy as some of the determinants of medication adherence. Little research has been published examining disparities in adherence rates when comparing different regions of the United States. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of geography, socioeconomic status, and other demographic variables on medication adherence rates in a large national sample of Medicare Part D and commercially insured beneficiaries. METHODS: This study focused on users of oral antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and/or antilipidemic medications. Beneficiaries who had at least 2 antidiabetic, antihypertensive, or antilipidemic prescription fills in 2010, 2011, or 2012 and who were enrolled in a large commercial or Medicare Part D prescription drug plan for at least 80% of one of these years (9.6 months) were included in this study. Results were stratified by year and by benefit type. Logistic regression was used to test for the adherence differences among the 9 U.S. regions as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. Additional variables included in the model to control for population differences were age, gender, socioeconomic status, and yearly out-of-pocket medication expenses. RESULTS: After meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 379,533 beneficiaries were in the 2012 Medicare cohort, and 659,553 beneficiaries were in the 2012 commercial cohort. New England was statistically the most adherent geographic region in both cohorts (Medicare odds ratio [OR] = 1.512, CI = 1.399-1.635); commercial OR = 1.193, CI = 1.109-1.284). Younger age beneficiaries, lower income beneficiaries, and females were less adherent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the commercial and Medicare populations, geography, socioeconomic status, age, and gender all impact the likelihood of a beneficiary being adherent to chronic medications for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. While this study does not elucidate the specific factors (i.e., health literacy, disease severity) driving geographic and other differences in medication adherence observed between groups, it does highlight the limitations of quality metrics and wellness initiatives that assume relative homogeneity in beneficiary characteristics across the United States."
30132381,0,a,"The quality of decision and assessment of risk are key determinants of successful sport performance. Athletes differ fundamentally in their decision-making ability according to their athletic expertise level. Moreover, given the influence of emotions on decision-making, it is likely that a trait reflecting emotional functioning, trait emotional intelligence, may also influence decision-making. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the respective contribution of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence to non-athletic decision-making. In total, 269 participants aged between 18 and 26 years with a range of athletic experience i.e. none (n = 71), novice (n = 54), amateur (n = 55), elite (n = 45) and super-elite (n = 44), completed the Emotional Intelligence Scale and the Cambridge Gambling Task. Regression modelling indicated a significant positive relationship of athletic expertise and trait emotional intelligence with the quality of decision-making, and a negative relationship with deliberation time and risk-taking. Cognitive skills transfer may explain the higher decision-making scores associated with higher athletic expertise, while individuals with higher trait emotional intelligence may anticipate better the emotional consequences linked with a gambling task, which may help individuals make better decisions and take less risks."
26303453,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Marital satisfaction is one of the key factors affecting women's holistic health. AIM: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sexual health education on the quality of life in married women. METHODS: The present controlled clinical trial was conducted with a pretest-posttest design on a study population of 60 women (aged 20-45) admitted to select health centres affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Samples were selected through convenience sampling and randomly allocated to an intervention group (n=30) and a control group (n=30). The data collection tool was the WHOQOL completed by participants first in the pretest and then in the follow-up posttest (after 2 months). The intervention group received sexual health education, while no interventions were provided to the control group. Data were analysed in SPSS-16 using the paired t-test and the independent t-test. FINDINGS: Participants were matched in the two groups in terms of demographic variables such as age, occupation, age at marriage, duration of marriage, residential status and income level. At the baseline, no significant differences were observed between the intervention group (77.35+/-9.36) and the control group (75.64+/-8.32) in terms of the quality of life score (P=0.26). After the intervention, the quality of life score was 94.3+/-6.54 in the intervention group and 74.2+/-7.33 in the control group, making for a significant difference (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Based on the findings, sexual health education can help women improve their sexual health through promoting sexual and marital satisfaction and consequently improve their quality of life."

29930967,0,a,"Context: Care continuity during transitions between the hospital and home requires reliable communication between providers and settings and an understanding of social determinants that influence recovery. Case Description: The coordinating transitions intervention uses real time alerts, delivered directly to the primary care practice for complex chronically ill patients discharged from an acute care setting, to facilitate nurse care coordinator led telephone outreach. The intervention incorporates claims-based risk stratification to prioritize patients for follow-up and an assessment of social determinants of health using the Patient-centered Assessment Method (PCAM). Results from transitional care are stored and transmitted to qualified healthcare providers across the continuum. Findings: Reliance on tools that incorporated interoperability standards facilitated exchange of health information between the hospital and primary care. The PCAM was incorporated into both the clinical and informational workflow through the collaboration of clinical, industry, and academic partners. Health outcomes improved at the study practice over their baseline and in comparison with control practices and the regional Medicaid population. Major Themes: Current research supports the potential impact of systems approaches to care coordination in improving utilization value after discharge. The project demonstrated that flexibility in developing the informational and clinical workflow was critical in developing a solution that improved continuity during transitions. There is additional work needed in developing managerial continuity across settings such as shared comprehensive care plans. Conclusions: New clinical and informational workflows which incorporate social determinant of health data into standard practice transformed clinical practice and improved outcomes for patients."
4049019,1,a,"This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3300728,1,a,"Famines are sustained, extreme shortages of food among discrete populations sufficient to cause high rates of mortality. Signs and symptoms of prolonged food deprivation include loss of fat and subcutaneous tissue, depression, apathy, and weakness, which progress to immobility and death of the individual, often from superimposed respiratory or other infections. The social consequences of famines are disruption from mass migrations of people in search of food, breakdown of social behavior, abandonment of cooperative effort, loss of personal pride and sense of family ties, and finally a struggle for individual survival. Famines have been common ever since the development of agriculture made human settlements possible. Food shortages due to crop failures caused by natural disasters including poor weather, insect plagues, and plant diseases; crop destruction due to warfare; and enforced starvation as a political tool are by no means the only causative factors. Many of the worst famines have been due to poor distribution of existing food supplies, either because of inequities that result in a lack of purchasing power on the part of the poor or because of political interference with normal distribution or relief movements of food. Europe and Asia, which in the past experienced frequent severe famines, sometimes with deaths in the hundreds of thousands or millions, have now largely eliminated famines through social and technological change. However, in Africa, political and social factors have destroyed the capacity of many populations to survive drought-induced variations in local food supplies and prices. Thus, famines are due to varying combinations of inadequacy of food supplies for whatever reason and the inability of populations to acquire food because of poverty, civil disturbances, or political interference. Despite the role of natural causes, the conclusion is inescapable that modern famines, like most of those in history, are man-made."
6464823,1,a,"A sample of delinquent and nondelinquent male adolescents was assessed with respect to locus of control and intellectual achievement responsibility. Data were also gathered concerning age, family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and school grade. Results were subjected to a multivariate analysis and showed support for a multidimensional model of locus of control. There was no difference in expectancy of control for negative academic events between delinquents and nondelinquents. In general, birth order and delinquency were the two most important determinants of locus of control. Results are discussed in terms of previous literature on locus of control with particular consideration paid to expectations of control."
28944020,0,a,"Breeding dispersal is a key process of population structure and dynamics and is often triggered by an individual's breeding failure. In both colonial and territorial birds, reproductive success of conspecifics (RSc) can also lead individuals to change breeding sites after a failure on a site. Yet, few studies have simultaneously investigated the independent contribution of individual reproductive success (RSi) and of RSc on dispersal decision. Here, we develop a modeling framework to disentangle the effects of RSi and RSc on demographic parameters, while accounting for imperfect individual detection and other confounding factors such as age or dispersal behavior in the previous year. Using a 10-year capture-recapture dataset composed of 1,595 banded tree swallows, we assessed the effects of nonmanipulated RSi and RSc on female breeding dispersal in this semicolonial passerine. Dispersal was strongly driven by RSi, but not by RSc. Unsuccessful females were 9.5-2.5 times more likely to disperse than successful ones, depending if they had dispersed or not in the previous year, respectively. Unsuccessful females were also three times less likely to be detected than successful ones. Contrary to theoretical and empirical studies, RSc did not drive the decision to disperse but influenced the selection of the following breeding site once dispersal had been initiated. Because detection of individuals was driven by RSi, which was positively correlated to RSc, assuming a perfect detection as in previous studies may have lead us to conclude that RSc affected dispersal patterns, yet our approach corrected for this bias. Overall, our results suggest that the value and use of RSc as public information to guide dispersal decisions are likely dictated by multiple ecological determinants, such as landscape structure and extent, if this cue is indeed used."
28099479,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Patterns of person-to-person contacts relevant for infectious diseases transmission are still poorly quantified in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where socio-demographic structures and behavioral attitudes are expected to be different from those of more developed countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a diary-based survey on daily contacts and time-use of individuals of different ages in one rural and one peri-urban site of Manicaland, Zimbabwe. A total of 2,490 diaries were collected and used to derive age-structured contact matrices, to analyze time spent by individuals in different settings, and to identify the key determinants of individuals' mixing patterns. Overall 10.8 contacts per person/day were reported, with a significant difference between the peri-urban and the rural site (11.6 versus 10.2). A strong age-assortativeness characterized contacts of school-aged children, whereas the high proportion of extended families and the young population age-structure led to a significant intergenerational mixing at older ages. Individuals spent on average 67% of daytime at home, 2% at work, and 9% at school. Active participation in school and work resulted the key drivers of the number of contacts and, similarly, household size, class size, and time spent at work influenced the number of home, school, and work contacts, respectively. We found that the heterogeneous nature of home contacts is critical for an epidemic transmission chain. In particular, our results suggest that, during the initial phase of an epidemic, about 50% of infections are expected to occur among individuals younger than 12 years and less than 20% among individuals older than 35 years. CONCLUSIONS: With the current work, we have gathered data and information on the ways through which individuals in SSA interact, and on the factors that mostly facilitate this interaction. Monitoring these processes is critical to realistically predict the effects of interventions on infectious diseases dynamics."
23864907,0,a,"Recent epidemiological reports of associations between socioeconomic status and epigenetic markers that predict vulnerability to diseases are bringing to light substantial biological effects of social inequalities. Here, we start the discussion of the moral consequences of these findings. We firstly highlight their explanatory importance in the context of the research program on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) and the social determinants of health. In the second section, we review some theories of the moral status of health inequalities. Rather than a complete outline of the debate, we single out those theories that rest on the principle of equality of opportunity and analyze the consequences of DOHaD and epigenetics for these particular conceptions of justice. We argue that DOHaD and epigenetics reshape the conceptual distinction between natural and acquired traits on which these theories rely and might provide important policy tools to tackle unjust distributions of health."
25774370,0,a,"The number of sexual transmission of HIV is increasing globally. Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) issues and HIV/AIDS related problems are rooted in common grounds such as poverty, gender inequality, and social exclusion. As a result, international health organizations have suggested the integration of SRH services with HIV/AIDS services as a strategy to control HIV and to improve people's access to SRH services. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between reproductive health and HIV/AIDS services at policy-making level in Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI). This study was conducted in 2011-2 and was a rapid assessment based on guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Family Health International Association, and some other international organizations. In this rapid assessment we used different methods such as a review of literature and documents, visiting and interviewing professionals and experts in family health and HIV/AIDS programs, and experts working in some Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Overall, based on the results obtained in this study, in most cases there was not much linkage between HIV/AIDS policies and SRH policies in Iran. Since integration of HIV/AIDS services and SRH services is recommended as a model and an appropriate response to HIV epidemics worldwide, likewise to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Iran it is required to integrate HIV/AIDS and SRH services at all levels, particularly at the policy-making level."
24188299,0,a,"Measuring indicators of health status and demographics are essential in the population health approach. In Canada, sexual minority youth face increased risk for poor health outcomes in behavioral and mental health indicators, yet the health policy response has been severely lacking. The current population health approach exacerbates the social exclusion of a vulnerable, at-risk population. The authors examine health status through the social determinants of health to highlight the need for including sexual identity, attraction, and behavior in youth population health surveys. Additional interventions that address the social determinants of health are needed."
2558204,1,a,"To identify factors associated with the decision to consult with dyspepsia, patients with dyspepsia were identified from a postal survey in the community. A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour."
31263589,0,a,"Background: Sub-Saharan Africa has among the highest prevalence of teenage pregnancy in the world. Teenage mothers and their children are at risk to a host of medical, social and economic challenges. Adolescent pregnancy is a significant cost to the mother and newborn child, and also to their family and the wider society. Despite measures taken by some sub-Saharan nations to tackle the issue of adolescent pregnancy, the phenomenon remains a public health concern that is widespread throughout the region. Currently, there are few studies that examine the predictors of teenage pregnancy in the sub-Saharan region. The objective of the present study was to systematically review predictors of pregnancy among young people in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: A literature search was conducted using Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE electronic databases. Following duplicate removal, abstract and full-text screening, 15 studies were ultimately included in the final review. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesise the qualitative and quantitative findings. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. Results: Twenty-seven predictors of teenage pregnancy were identified and grouped into six themes (Partner and peer-related predictors; Sexual health knowledge, attitude and behaviour-related predictors; Parenting and family-related predictors; Economic, environmental and cultural predictors; Personal predictors; and Quality of healthcare services predictors). The most obvious predictors included sexual coercion and pressure from male partners, low or incorrect use of contraceptives, and poor parenting or low parental communication and support. Conclusion: This review emphasises that the large prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa is attributable to multiple predictors that our study was able to group into six themes. Policy changes and programmes must be implemented in sub-Saharan Africa to address these determinants in order to reduce adolescent pregnancy within the region."
24640712,0,a,"By using the method of factor analysis (principal component method) the determinants of disease in elderly and senile patients were searched with an estimate of their influence degree in the population of the North-West Russia. The data from medical records of 712 patients of both sexes aged 59 to 98 years were analyzed. The factor 1 proved to be associated with: marital status, living conditions, family relationships, bad habits, appearance, cough, diet, hearing and vision, laxatives, joint health, ability to move and sleep disturbances. Factor 2 combined diseases of older: cerebral stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, kidney disease, obesity, thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, lung disease, anemia, arthritis, osteoporosis, the number of surgeries and joint diseases. The factor 3 was found to self-association ability before and after admission to the assessment of the patients' mental state for MMSE test after admission. It is concluded that the development of age-related (especially the musculoskeletal system pathology) is associated with social characteristics and living conditions of patients, and treatment of the most age-related diseases requires consideration of comorbidity."
6737214,1,a,"This study examined Weiss' conceptualization of social and emotional loneliness. Using data from an extensive survey of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Iowa, we measured social and emotional loneliness, students' affective and behavioral reactions to loneliness, students' social relationships, and their judgments of the degree to which their relationships supply the six social provisions described by Weiss. As expected, we found differences in the subjective experiences of social and emotional loneliness, although both forms of loneliness were also characterized by a common core of experiences. The results generally supported Weiss's ideas concerning the determinants of social and emotional loneliness. Predictions concerning the affective and behavioral consequences associated with each type of loneliness, however, were only partly supported, although the two forms of loneliness were associated with different affective reactions and coping behaviors. The implications of these findings for Weiss's typology of loneliness are discussed."
12314663,1,a,"Dutch emigrant registration records for the nineteenth century are examined in an effort to shed light on the local circumstances of the Dutch emigration movement. ""Since nineteenth century emigration took place mostly through primary contacts this article will examine the newly established immigrant settlements as 'communities transplanted'...which directs our research to include local municipal records such as population censuses, population registers (which were supplemented after 1861 with registers of in- and out-migration), tax records, and records of vital events like marriage, birth and death registers. The quality and availability of these records vary from place to place, but generally speaking, in the case of the Netherlands, they are of high quality since population registration at the municipal level was required by law. The source of information for the local records are the population registers (Bevolkings Registers) which were originally constructed on the basis of information obtained from the 1850 population census...."""
31616199,0,a,"Purpose: Study habits have been the most important predictor of academic performance and play a special role in the academic achievement of students. The aim of this study was to investigate the status of study habits and its relationship with academic achievement in medical sciences students in Kermanshah-Iran. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 380 medical sciences students at Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences. The samples were randomly assigned to the study. The Palsane and Sharma study Habit Inventory was the tool used for data collection. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The mean of students' grade point average was 15.73+/-1.5 out of 20 and the mean of total status of study habits was 45.70+/-11.36 out of 90. The status of study habits in 81.3% of the students was at moderate level. There was a direct and significant relationship between study habits and academic achievement. Conclusion: The status of study habits was at moderate level for most students. Therefore, it is recommended to consider and assess students' study habits at the time of entry into university, in addition, specific training should be offered to students in order to help them learn or modify study habits to increase their academic achievements."
24473609,0,a,"The scope of this article is to analyze and describe the risk factors and determinants linked to 24 suicides in the city of Palmas in the state of Tocantins between 2006 and 2009. The psychological and psycho-social autopsy method was used in order to investigate the consummated suicides by interviewing family members. It contextualized the subjects' life characteristics to understand the family dynamics and the affective, social, economic and cultural background, based on the reconstruction of the history and personality of the individuals. The associated socio-economic factors were: being male, aged between 20 and 40, single, with mixed ethnicity and basic education. The major risk factors identified were: mental disorder, alcohol and other drug abuse, disturbed family relationship and a history of previous suicide attempts. An attempt was made to contextualize and reflect on some cases reported by family members, as well as on the response of the health care teams to the demands of the families. The need to implement prevention programs and to train the primary health care professionals was considered a priority."
20670346,0,a,"AIMS: This paper reviews a set of theories of behaviour change that are used outside the field of addiction and considers their relevance for this field. METHODS: Ten theories are reviewed in terms of (i) the main tenets of each theory, (ii) the implications of the theory for promoting change in addictive behaviours and (iii) studies in the field of addiction that have used the theory. An augmented feedback loop model based on Control Theory is used to organize the theories and to show how different interventions might achieve behaviour change. RESULTS: Briefly, each theory provided the following recommendations for intervention: Control Theory: prompt behavioural monitoring, Goal-Setting Theory: set specific and challenging goals, Model of Action Phases: form 'implementation intentions', Strength Model of Self-Control: bolster self-control resources, Social Cognition Models (Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Health Belief Model): modify relevant cognitions, Elaboration Likelihood Model: consider targets' motivation and ability to process information, Prototype Willingness Model: change perceptions of the prototypical person who engages in behaviour and Social Cognitive Theory: modify self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: There are a range of theories in the field of behaviour change that can be applied usefully to addiction, each one pointing to a different set of modifiable determinants and/or behaviour change techniques. Studies reporting interventions should describe theoretical basis, behaviour change techniques and mode of delivery accurately so that effective interventions can be understood and replicated."
29506400,0,a,"The increased availability of treatment has not reduced the prevalence of mental disorders, suggesting a need for a greater emphasis on prevention. With chronic physical diseases, successful prevention efforts have focused on reducing the big risk factors. If this approach is applied to mental disorders, the big risk factors are adverse childhood experiences, which have major effects on most classes of mental disorder across the lifespan. While the evidence base is limited, there is support for a number of interventions to reduce adverse childhood experiences, including an important role for mental health professionals. Taking action on adverse childhood experiences may be our best chance of emulating the success of public health action to prevent chronic physical diseases and thereby reduce the large global burden of mental disorders."
3071406,1,a,"In this presentation, physical appearance has been considered an inseparable part of daily human existence. Relevant aspects of research in social psychology on interpersonal attraction and personality theory stressing narcissistic vulnerability were reviewed. General systems theory was proposed as a theoretical framework from which to view the multifactorial aspects of the psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness. In support of this proposition, the contemporary use of systems thinking in medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family therapy, and the understanding of emotions was stressed. Emotional reactions to the evaluations of physical appearance by self and others were shown to be inevitable, involving appraisal and feedback processes affecting different systems in the person's life. The person's self-image and self-esteem were stressed as underlying determinants of outcome in health and in illness. Finally, we hope to have communicated our belief that in the present, as a way of integrating and summarizing the knowledge obtained in the specialized fields, systems thinking allows for more creative and successful treatment outcomes."
3384511,1,a,"Empirical data on Japanese American drinking behavior are scarce. The present study was a random sample (N = 295) of households in Los Angeles with Japanese surnames. Japanese Americans born in the United States tended to drink less than those born in Japan. The study also observed significant gender differences in Japanese American drinking behavior which were attributed to ascribed social roles. Other demographic and social determinants of drinking were examined through two logistic regression models. The first model predicted drinking (as opposed to abstaining), while the other distinguished heavy drinkers from those who drank alcohol in more moderate amounts. Potential reference groups (e.g., parents, friends, church groups, etc.) were often significant in predicting whether and how much a Japanese American drank."
30383204,0,a,"Although less well-recognized than for other infectious diseases, heterogeneity is a defining feature of tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology. To advance toward TB elimination, this heterogeneity must be better understood and addressed. Drivers of heterogeneity in TB epidemiology act at the level of the infectious host, organism, susceptible host, environment, and distal determinants. These effects may be amplified by social mixing patterns, while the variable latent period between infection and disease may mask heterogeneity in transmission. Reliance on notified cases may lead to misidentification of the most affected groups, as case detection is often poorest where prevalence is highest. Assuming that average rates apply across diverse groups and ignoring the effects of cohort selection may result in misunderstanding of the epidemic and the anticipated effects of control measures. Given this substantial heterogeneity, interventions targeting high-risk groups based on location, social determinants, or comorbidities could improve efficiency, but raise ethical and equity considerations."
6706795,1,a,"A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed. Smoking, use of drugs, sexual behavior, and drinking of alcoholic beverages at the age of 16 years was related to dropout from secondary school during the 2-year study period. The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed."
6684973,1,a,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts."
23034508,0,a,"In the United States, race and ethnicity are considered key social determinants of health because of their enduring association with social and economic opportunities and resources. An important policy and research concern is whether the U.S. is making progress toward reducing racial/ethnic inequalities in health. While race/ethnic disparities in infant and adult outcomes are well documented, less is known about patterns and trends by race/ethnicity among children. Our objective was to determine the patterns of and progress toward reducing racial/ethnic disparities in child health. Using nationally representative data from 1998 to 2009, we assessed 17 indicators of child health, including overall health status, disability, measures of specific illnesses, and indicators of the social and economic consequences of illnesses. We examined disparities across five race/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic other). We found important racial/ethnic disparities across nearly all of the indicators of health we examined, adjusting for socioeconomic status, nativity, and access to health care. Importantly, we found little evidence that racial/ethnic disparities in child health have changed over time. In fact, for certain illnesses such as asthma, black-white disparities grew significantly larger over time. In general, black children had the highest reported prevalence across the health indicators and Asian children had the lowest reported prevalence. Hispanic children tended to be more similar to whites compared to the other race/ethnic groups, but there was considerable variability in their relative standing."
2595827,1,a,"With the object of describing how their own health is experienced, the social circumstances and sexual behaviour in anti-HIV-positive homosexual and bisexual men, an anonymous questionnaire to be completed by the recipient was distributed in 1987 in connection with a placebo controlled investigation to assess the value of isoprinosin (Imunovir) in preventing the development of AIDS. 87% participated. Among the total of 85 participants, 78% considered that their health was good, 29% met family members and 75% friends at least once weekly. Fifty patients (65%) felt stressed in their daily lives which was definitely higher than in the normal population. All of the participants had altered their sexual behaviour in a manner which reduced the risk of HIV-transmission but 18 (21%) had had sexual behaviour known to transmit HIV within the past year. This behaviour occurred more frequently in young persons (p = 0.09) and in smokers (p = 0.03). In addition, no connection could be demonstrated between a series of possible determinants for this, which may, however, be due to the limited extent of the material. It is demonstrated that awareness that one is infected with HIV does not eliminate dangerous sexual behaviour in all cases."
10304496,1,a,The diverse factors associated with sexuality among adolescents and the specific issues related to contraception in this developmentally diverse group result in complexity in policy formation. The future of an adolescent may be determined solely on the basis of access to supportive physical and emotional services funded by public and private sector monies. The purpose of this paper is to briefly present contemporary and social policies regarding pregnant adolescent health care. Suggestions as to how these policies can be translated into public adolescent health models are provided. The strategies will be related to primary and secondary public policy interventions.
20603713,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Outpatient antibiotic consumption widely varies across Europe. The investigation of the causes of such variation may help to identify interventions that would improve the efficient use of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of socioeconomic determinants and the role played by information about bacterial resistance. METHODS: Comparable data on systemically administered antibiotics and socioeconomic determinants in 17 European countries were available between 2000 and 2005. We estimated an ad hoc econometric model by means of a hybrid log-log functional form and random effects generalised least squares regressions. Lagged values and the instrumental variable method were applied to address endogeneity of bacterial resistance and infections. Bacterial resistance was measured by the rate of penicillin non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (PNSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). RESULTS: The population income, demographic structure, density of general practitioners and their remuneration method appeared to be significant determinants of antibiotic consumption. Although countries with higher levels of bacterial resistance exhibited significantly higher levels of per capita antibiotic use, ceteris paribus, the responsiveness of antibiotic use to changes in bacterial resistance was relatively low (0.09-0.18). CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that socioeconomic factors should be taken into account while explaining differences in outpatient antibiotic use across countries. The impact of supply-side factors and incentives attached to payment schemes for physicians need to be considered in government interventions to reduce inequalities and improve effectiveness in antibiotic utilisation."
7031748,1,a,"Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes."
3714667,1,a,"Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in different socioeconomic and educational groups in Finland. The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers."
2489983,1,a,"The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods."

Especially the influence of characteristics of the delivery system (e.g. differences between urban and rural regions) and characteristics of users (e.g. social class) are investigated. In this article the conceptual frame of the study is described. The model is based on assumptions of the action-decision-theory. It structures the process of decision and action into four phases: the first two, perception and interpretation, are summarized as ""process of attention""; the subsequent ones, coping and evaluation, as ""process of acting"". The model describes the social system (the total of demographic, socio-structural and socio-economic variables) and the memory system (contained within the individual life history) as mediating factors influencing the decision to act."
6372134,1,a,"The multiple regression equation predicting lung function values for a study population of South African Blacks is compared with equations predicting normal values for Blacks elsewhere, and in almost all cases is found to predict higher values. This is so despite the study population's high prevalence of respiratory disease and long history of exposure to crocidolite asbestos dust. This anomalous finding is explored in terms of some problems with studies generating normal values. In particular, the confounding effect of social class status on ethnic determinants of lung function is considered. Low 'normal' values for Blacks reported from South Africa and elsewhere are examined. The disadvantages to workers of being evaluated in relation to low norms are discussed in terms of preventive medicine and workmen's compensation. The application of a universal standard for all is proposed."
28079622,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors have been shown to predict a poor disease course in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but whether this applies to job stress is currently unknown. We assessed the prevalence of job stress and its correlates in a large cohort of patients with IBD. METHODS: We included all adult, professionally active patients enrolled between 2006 and 2015 in the Swiss IBD Cohort. Job stress was measured through the self-report effort-reward imbalance ratio and overcommitment (OC) to work questionnaires. We used multiple linear regressions to assess association with sociodemographic, lifestyle, psychosocial, and disease-related factors. RESULTS: Altogether 1656 patients completed the questionnaires (905 Crohn's disease and 751 ulcerative colitis/IBD unclassified). Only 91 (5.7%) of patients had an effort-reward imbalance ratio >1. Effort-reward imbalance and OC scores were higher in full-time versus part-time employees (coef = 0.050, P = 0.002; coef = 0.906, P < 0.001) and among those absent from the workplace in the previous 3 months (coef = 0.049, P = 0.010; coef = 1.062, P < 0.001). Higher OC scores were associated with sex (women vs. men: coef = 0.568, P = 0.014), being in a relationship (coef = 0.805, P = 0.001), higher level of occupation (director vs. trainee: coef = 1.447, P < 0.001), and extraintestinal manifestations (coef = 0.623, P = 0.005). Patients hospitalized in the previous 12 months had lower OC scores (coef = 0.560, P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The average level of job stress seems to be remarkably low in patients with IBD from Switzerland. The clinician should turn attention especially to women, full-time employees with a high level of education, and patients with extraintestinal manifestations to identify those with the most vulnerability to suffer from job stress."
10281815,1,a,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious."
28680437,0,a,"The study of the molecular basis of tree diseases is lately receiving a renewed attention, especially with the emerging perception that pathogens require specific pathogenicity and virulence factors to successfully colonize woody hosts. Pathosystems involving woody plants are notoriously difficult to study, although the use of model bacterial strains together with genetically homogeneous micropropagated plant material is providing a significant impetus to our understanding of the molecular determinants leading to disease. The gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas savastanoi belongs to the intensively studied Pseudomonas syringae complex, and includes three pathogenic lineages causing tumorous overgrowths (knots) in diverse economically relevant trees and shrubs. As it occurs with many other bacteria, pathogenicity of P. savastanoi is dependent on a type III secretion system, which is accompanied by a core set of at least 20 effector genes shared among strains isolated from olive, oleander, and ash. The induction of knots of wild-type size requires that the pathogen maintains adequate levels of diverse metabolites, including the phytohormones indole-3-acetic acid and cytokinins, as well as cyclic-di-GMP, some of which can also regulate the expression of other pathogenicity and virulence genes and participate in bacterial competitiveness. In a remarkable example of social networking, quorum sensing molecules allow for the communication among P. savastanoi and other members of the knot microbiome, while at the same time are essential for tumor formation. Additionally, a distinguishing feature of bacteria from the P. syringae complex isolated from woody organs is the possession of a 15 kb genomic island (WHOP) carrying four operons and three other genes involved in degradation of phenolic compounds. Two of these operons mediate the catabolism of anthranilate and catechol and, together with another operon, are required for the induction of full-size tumors in woody hosts, but not in non-woody micropropagated plants. The use of transposon mutagenesis also uncovered a treasure trove of additional P. savastanoi genes affecting virulence and participating in diverse bacterial processes. Although there is still much to be learned on what makes a bacterium a successful pathogen of trees, we are already untying the knots."

The first section will discuss: (1) the concept of culture, (2) hierarchical levels of human behavior determinants, (3) the cultural variability continuum, and (4) the concept of self. The second section will discuss: (1) epidemiology, (2) culture and clinical phenomenology in severe disorders, and (3) culture as an etiological determinant. The paper closes with a discussion of some conclusions and suggestions for future research."
24301041,1,a,"In order to examine the relationships among social network structure, types of social support, and determinants of support satisfaction, an alternative method was used to score the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ). Factor analysis procedures suggested that college students' (N=198) social networks consisted of four groups: nuclear family, other family, friends, and others. Satisfaction with support was positively related to the proportion of the network occupied by nuclear family and negatively related to the proportion of friends in the network. Evidence was found for the presence of both support specialists and support generalists in the networks of the college students. These results are discussed from a developmental perspective with attention to the implications for interventions."
23561030,0,a,"BACKGROUND: China has made impressive progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for maternal and reproductive health, but ensuring that progress reaches all segments of the population remains a challenge for policy makers. The aim of this review is to map disadvantaged populations in terms of maternal health in China, and to explain the causes of these inequities to promote policy action. METHODS: We searched PUBMED, Popline, Proquest and WanFang and included primary studies conducted in mainland China. Experts were also contacted to identify additional studies. Disadvantaged populations in terms of MDG 5 and the reasons for this disadvantage explored by authors were identified and coded based on the conceptual framework developed by the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. RESULTS: In China, differences in maternal health service utilization and the maternal mortality ratio among different income groups, and among regions with different socio-economic development still exist, although these differences are narrowing. Groups with low levels of education and ethnic minorities utilize maternal health care less frequently and experience higher maternal mortality, although we could not determine whether these differences have changed in the last decade. Rural-to-urban migrants use maternal health care and contraception to a lower extent than permanent residents of cities, and differential maternal mortality shows a widening trend among these groups. Gender inequity also contributes to the disadvantaged position of women. Intermediary factors that explain these inequities include material circumstances such as long distances to health facilities for women living in remote areas, behavioral factors such as traditional beliefs that result in reduced care seeking among ethnic minorities, and health system determinants such as out-of-pocket payments posing financial barriers for the poor. CONCLUSIONS: Inequity in maternal health continues to be an issue worthy of greater programmatic and monitoring efforts in China."
28114853,0,a,"Household environmental health hazards or simply household health hazards (HHH) are pathogens and chemicals in the household that can cause health problems. In this study, we assess their effect on under-five mortality (U5MR) in 12 sub-Saharan African countries, using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Referring to the principal component analysis approach, we measure the HHH by the following indicators: source of water and its location, type of toilet facility, flooring material, type of wall, type of roof and type of cooking fuel. In an unadjusted multilevel discrete-time hazard model, we find that HHH affect positively child mortality in 9 of the 12 countries, whereas this effect presented itself only in 4 countries when controlling for other covariates. However, using a model with interaction between the child's age and HHH, we find it interesting that increasing levels of the HHH are consistently associated with increasing risk of death during 24-59 months after birth in eight countries. Future researches are needed to decipher the mechanisms behind these findings, whether explained by the accumulation of hazardous environment in early childhood, or frequent contact with noxious environments at a later stage of childhood, or both."
2529668,1,a,"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers."
3481909,1,a,"Problems with current definitions of mental retardation were recognized. Classification systems based on the behavioral capabilities of retarded persons were criticized since there are so many noncognitive determinants of performance. It was proposed that mental retardation be defined solely by IQ scores at least 2 SDs below the population mean. This suggestion was predicated on the view that the behavioral sciences currently have no better way to assess intellectual functioning. Etiology was seen as such a significant predictor of group differences that the organic, familial, and undifferentiated categories would be used in classification. Social adaptation and expected performance were seen as correlates of class membership rather than defining features of retardation, since they have no reliable method of measurement. Problems of labeling were discussed, but the practice was deemed useful if it leads to beneficial services and interventions."
2514523,1,a,"Contribution rates to the German statutory health insurance differ considerably between different sickness funds. While insurance benefits are largely standardized, these differences are widely regarded as a problem for the state's social policy. The health insurance bodies often offer hasty interpretations to justify the differences of contribution rates. These interpretations, however, cannot be checked on the basis of data from the annual reports of the health insurance. In reality, there is a number of determinants of the contribution rate which lie as well inside as outside the sphere of influence of the health insurance bodies. In order to estimate the respective impact of single determinants it is important to differentiate the health expenditures by age and sex of all insured persons (both the contribution paying members and their co-insured dependents). A further disentanglement of health expenditures into prices, quantities and structural components allows to identify the reasons of increases in health costs. This is also a necessary precondition for creating and implementing suitable measures that are directed to control health costs. At the same time, the improved information system of the statutory health insurance would contribute to a better understanding of the performance of the health system in general."

24469555,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The observation that features of the social environment, including family, school, and neighborhood characteristics, are associated with individual-level outcomes has spurred the development of dozens of multilevel or ecological theoretical frameworks in epidemiology, public health, psychology, and sociology, among other disciplines. Despite the widespread use of such theories in etiological, intervention, and policy studies, challenges remain in bridging multilevel theory and empirical research. METHODS: This paper set out to synthesize these challenges and provide specific examples of methodological and analytical strategies researchers are using to gain a more nuanced understanding of the social determinants of psychiatric disorders, with a focus on children's mental health. To accomplish this goal, we begin by describing multilevel theories, defining their core elements, and discussing what these theories suggest is needed in empirical work. In the second part, we outline the main challenges researchers face in translating multilevel theory into research. These challenges are presented for each stage of the research process. In the third section, we describe two methods being used as alternatives to traditional multilevel modeling techniques to better bridge multilevel theory and multilevel research. These are (1) multilevel factor analysis and multilevel structural equation modeling; and (2) dynamic systems approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Through its review of multilevel theory, assessment of existing strategies, and examination of emerging methodologies, this paper offers a framework to evaluate and guide empirical studies on the social determinants of child psychiatric disorders as well as health across the life course."

Such a monthly dataset permits more accurate estimations of events than using annual data, but its panel follows households for a short period. Then methods that control for both right- and left-censoring should be used. The results are as follows: households with zero income are not those with the lowest chances of exiting; changes in aggregate unemployment do not affect poverty duration; and increasing wages in the informal sector has a negative effect on poverty duration."
31730539,0,a,"Background Anxiety is the most common psychological reaction in women during labor. Similar to numerous other surgeries, postoperative pain is also reported following cesarean section (C-section). According to the (Gate) Control Theory, there is a relationship between pain and psychological problems such as anxiety. Accordingly, the present study aimed to compare the effect of aromatherapy using lavender and Damask rose essential oils on the level of anxiety and severity of pain following C-section. Methods This triple-group randomized clinical trial was performed on 90 mothers who visited Motahari Hospital of Jahrom, Iran, for C-section in 2017. The incidence and severity of pain and anxiety were measured and recorded for all three groups prior to intervention. The intervention groups underwent aromatherapy with lavender and Damask rose essential oils. Patients were asked to inhale cotton balls, separately stained with three drops of each essential oil at a distance of 10cm for 30mins. The severity of pain and anxiety was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) 5 min after the specified process, respectively. The control group underwent aromatherapy in a similar fashion with normal saline. Finally, data were analyzed using descriptive statistical indices and ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests in SPSS 21. Results There was no significant difference between the three groups in the mean severity of pain and anxiety before the intervention (p>0.05). The mean severity of pain and overt anxiety in the lavender and Damask rose aromatherapy groups was significantly different than the control group after the intervention (p<0.001). In addition, no significant difference was observed between the overt and overall anxiety levels of the two intervention groups after the intervention (p>0.05). Conclusions The findings suggested that inhalation aromatherapy can reduce the severity of overt anxiety and pain after C-section, with Damask rose essential oil showing a larger effect than lavender."
20352332,0,a,This study examines how aspects of coalition functioning predict a coalition's ability to promote high-quality implementation of evidence-based programs (EBPs). The study involved 62 Communities That Care (CTC) coalitions in Pennsylvania measured annually from 2003 to 2007. Findings indicate that the communities with higher levels of poverty and longer existing coalitions are related to lower support for high-quality EBP implementation. Several aspects of coalition functioning-including higher levels of funding; leadership strength; board efficiency; strong internal and external relationships; and fidelity to the CTC model-significantly predicted support for high-quality EBP implementation. Earlier measurements of coalition functioning (2003-2004 and 2005-2006) predicted EBP implementation (2007) more strongly than concurrent coalition assessments (2007). The discussion focuses on how coalitions and technical assistance providers can improve coalition support for the implementation of EBPs.
29490695,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Health disparities are a persistent problem in many high-income countries. Health policymakers recognize the need to develop systematic methods for documenting and tracking these disparities in order to reduce them. The experience of the U.S., which has a well-established health disparities monitoring infrastructure, provides useful insights for other countries. MAIN BODY: This article provides an in-depth review of health disparities monitoring in the U.S. Lessons of potential relevance for other countries include: 1) the integration of health disparities monitoring in population health surveillance, 2) the role of political commitment, 3) use of monitoring as a feedback loop to inform future directions, 4) use of monitoring to identify data gaps, 5) development of extensive cross-departmental cooperation, and 6) exploitation of digital tools for monitoring and reporting. Using Israel as a case in point, we provide a brief overview of the healthcare and health disparities landscape in Israel, and examine how the lessons from the U.S. experience might be applied in the Israeli context. CONCLUSION: The U.S. model of health disparities monitoring provides useful lessons for other countries with respect to documentation of health disparities and tracking of progress made towards their elimination. Given the persistence of health disparities both in the U.S. and Israel, there is a need for monitoring systems to expand beyond individual- and healthcare system-level factors, to incorporate social and environmental determinants of health as health indicators/outcomes."

The material is analyzed using game theory, a perspective which assumes that homosexual interaction exhibits qualities generally associated with games and can be analyzed utilizing concepts such as players, teams, rules, points, winning, and losing. The article also illustrates ways in which cultural determinants shape homosexual social organization in different western societies."

29635799,0,a,"The World Health Organization has identified universal health coverage (UHC) as a key approach in reducing equity gaps in a country, and the social health insurance (SHI) has been recommended as an important strategy toward it. This article aims to analyze the design, expected benefits and challenges of realizing the goals of UHC through the recently launched SHI in Nepal. On top of the earlier free health-care policy and several other vertical schemes, the SHI scheme was implemented in 2016 and has reached population coverage of 5% in the implemented districts in just within a year of implementation. However, to achieve UHC in Nepal, in addition to operationalizing the scheme, several other requirements must be dealt simultaneously such as efficient health-care delivery system, adequate human resources for health, a strong information system, improved transparency and accountability, and a balanced mix of the preventive, health promotion, curative, and rehabilitative services including actions to address the social determinants of health. The article notes that strong political commitment and persistent efforts are the key lessons learnt from countries achieving progressive UHC through SHI."

3669072,1,a,"This study employed multivariate analyses and structural modeling procedures to examine a model for the determinants of adherence to medical regimens. Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction."
6971053,1,a,"Extent and determinants of use of alcohol, marijuana, inhalants, and PCP were explored in a group of 339 Mexican American youths from the East Los Angeles Housing projects. Results from this study were compared to those from a similar survey carried out in the same area 2 years ago. Use of inhalants has declined markedly compared with prevalence reported in the previous report. However, use of alcohol and marijuana have increased across all age and sex cohorts. Prevalence of PCP use, explored for the first time in this report, was shown to be extremely high. Use of all drugs was generally predicted by age, sex, and number of peers reporting use. Self-concept factors, especially one's self-evaluation with respect to others, were also significant predictors to use of marijuana, inhalants, and PCP. However, alcohol use was not related to any self-concept factors. Language (Spanish-English) used both in the home and with peers was related to use of all substances studied. Limitations in the generalization of this study as a result of sampling problems are discussed."
2916712,1,a,"The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery."
26650034,0,a,"The availability of local support and care infrastructures at the place of residence is an important issue for the elderly living in rural areas. Spatial mobility can be seen as a strategy to cope with a lack of local care facilities. This study analyzes the preferences of older people living in long-term relationships concerning support and care arrangements. Furthermore, it is analyzed how far and under which circumstances older couples are willing to relocate their place of residence in response to regional care infrastructures. Using a quasi-experimental survey design, inhabitants of a small rural community aged over 50 years were interviewed and confronted with descriptions of fictitious situations with randomized options for moving residence. A Tobit model estimation method is applied to examine the determinants of older couples' care-related willingness to move their residence.The results show that most people prefer either the support of their own partner or outpatient care. Residential care is especially preferred by people aged 75 years and above, whereas new forms of support, such as senior cooperatives, are evaluated as attractive especially by younger age groups. Thus, information and advisory campaigns should address the target group in question even at an early stage in older peoples' life course. Care-related willingness to move home of couples aged 50 years and more is significantly determined by local provision of support and care infrastructures. The expansion of any care infrastructure at older peoples' place of residence can significantly reduce their willingness to move. In particular an increased availability of outpatient care is associated with a comparatively large reduction in couples' likelihood to move. In this way local commitment to rural areas can be sustained and rural depopulation can be prevented. At an alternative place of residence assisted living and residential care in particular can significantly enhance the willingness to relocate and can thus generate incentives to move for older couples."

29931374,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking is the biggest preventable cause of death and kills about seven million people annually. As smoking prevalence is falling in developed countries, tobacco businesses are turning to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to generate new tobacco markets. To prevent young people from initiating smoking and becoming regular smokers, it is important to understand the causes of susceptibility to smoking. In this study, we report a nationwide survey of the prevalence and risk factors of smoking susceptibility among students aged 12-20 years in The Gambia. METHODS: We used two-stage cluster random sampling to select students in secondary schools throughout The Gambia and questionnaire to collect data on demographic characteristics and indicators on susceptibility to initiating smoking. RESULTS: Among the total sample of 10289 students, 9831 (96%; 55.6% girls and 44.4% boys, aged 12-20 years) nonsmokers were included in the analysis. Of these, 3333 (33.9%) were found to be susceptible to smoking. Smoking susceptibility was more common among students attending grant-aided schools, non-Muslims, who had smoking allowed at home, had family members or friends who smoke, were sent to purchase cigarettes, had poor knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking, noticed point-of-sale tobacco advertisements, and who had positive attitudes towards smoking. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that susceptibility to smoking is common among students and associated with preventable exposures. Although based on cross-sectional data, these findings suggest that raising students' awareness of the harmful effects of smoking and reducing the prevalence of adult smoking, extending tobacco advertising restrictions to include point-of-sale, are all important to preventing the uptake of smoking among students. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to provide detailed data on smoking susceptibility and risk factors in a nationally representative sample of young people in The Gambia. Our findings show that susceptibility to smoking is relatively high and associated with preventable measures. Our results also identify an urgent need to broaden the ban on tobacco advertising to explicitly include point-of-sale advertisements. These findings provide valuable information for tobacco control policies and evidence to enable targeted intervention for young people most at risk of initiating smoking."
3060449,1,a,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement."
27232878,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Socially disadvantaged people have an increased need for medical care due to a higher burden of health problems and chronic diseases. In Germany, outpatient care is chiefly provided by office-based general practitioners and specialists in private practice. People are free to choose the physician they prefer. In this study, national data were used to examine differences in the use of outpatient medical care by socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: The analyses were based on data from 6,754 participants in the Robert Koch Institute's German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) aged between 18 and 69 years. The number of outpatient physician visits during the past twelve months was assessed for several medical specializations. SES was determined based on education, occupation, and income. Associations between SES and physician visits were analysed using logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression for count data. RESULTS: After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health indicators, outpatients with low SES had more contacts with general practitioners than outpatients with high SES (men: incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.46; women: IRR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.07-1.34). The use of specialists was lower in people with low SES than in those with high SES when sociodemographic factors and health indicators were adjusted for (men: odds ratio [OR] = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.51-0.91; women: OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.41-0.77). This applied particularly to specialists in internal medicine, dermatology, and gynaecology. The associations remained after additional adjustment for the type of health insurance and the regional density of office-based physicians. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that socially disadvantaged people are seen by general practitioners more often than the socially better-off, who are more likely to visit a medical specialist. These differences may be due to differences in patient preferences, physician factors, physician-patient interaction, and potential barriers to accessing specialist care."
28514037,1,a,"Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084)."
28466762,1,a,"Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces."
7246836,1,a,"This study examined the records of the North Carolina Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine which social, family, and child characteristics were most influential in the decision to place a child in foster care. These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care."
7180620,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to provide fundamental information about individual subject smoking behavior when the behavior is characterized as an event time-series. Each subject's smoking series revealed a characteristic inter-cigarette interval frequency distribution but there was little evidence of sequential dependencies in the series with respect to either successive intervals or successive events in time. Several subjects exhibited possible characteristic peaks or troughs during successive 2-hour periods, a finding which was in agreement with previous studies, but even in these subjects temporal patterning accounted for only a small proportion of the total variance. The implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for the future treatment of smoking data and for possible experimental approaches to the determinants of smoking are presented."
3989430,1,a,"The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats."
3359393,1,a,"Parents who had been placed in an orphanage as children rated the behaviour of all their children who were between the ages of 6-18 years on a children's behaviour survey instrument. All families were intact and the parents had not requested professional help for marital problems. A significant number of relationships were found between parental background variables and higher reported levels of conflict with siblings and with parents, dependent-unassertive behaviour, and undemandingness in the children. Although sampling difficulties preclude generalization, the results suggest that repercussion of events in the lives of the first and second generation that are usually pathogenic may be seen in the third generation, even when the second generation may not be grossly adversely affected. These events most frequently related to individual differences in the third generation in the area of undercontrol of aggression directed toward parents and siblings."
31640619,0,a,"BACKGROUND: No reliable and comprehensive study has been published on the incidence and epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran from 2008 to 2014, before pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and pentavalent vaccine (DTPw-Hep B-Hib (PRP-T) vaccine (pentavac) (adsorbed)) introduction. The present study aimed to portray the epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran from 2008 to 2014. METHODS: Data on meningitis cases aged from 1 day to 110 years were extracted from national notifiable diseases surveillance system from March 2008 to December 2014 in Iran. A total number of 48,006 cases of suspected meningitis were identified and 1468 cases of which met the criteria for diagnosis-confirmed meningitis. Of 1468 cases, 1352 patients were included in the study. RESULTS: The great number of cases reported from urban areas. Moreover, males were more predominant than females (58.51% vs. 33.81%) in total. The estimated annual incidence rate of meningitis varied from 0.28/100000 in 2008 to 0.09/100000 in 2014. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis were the most leading pathogens causing bacterial meningitis, accounted for 266(23.44%), 145(12.78%), 95(8.37%) of cases, respectively. Each of the three bacterial species showed a descending trend. The majority of infected subjects are children under five years. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the decreasing trend of meningitis and high percentage of cultures with negative results, according to World Health Organization recommendation PCV introduction into routine immunization is evident. Implementing an enhanced surveillance system to provide high quality data on epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran is necessary."
30397384,0,a,"Women's ability to access health care requires access to and control of resources as well as the ability to make personal health decisions. Female migrants may experience additional challenges in accessing health care due to marginalization and vulnerability resulting from both their gender and their migrant status. Rural-to-urban migrant women working in the informal sector, such as Ghana's head porters (kayayei), experience exclusion from the health system, risk of being uninsured, and poor health outcomes. Kayayei's survival needs (eg, food, water) and a need to provide for their families can mean that migrant kayayei avoid health care expenses for illnesses or injuries. To ensure equal access to health care for migrant and non-migrant populations, health insurance is crucial. Yet, improving access to health care and service uptake requires more than health insurance. Incorporating culturally appropriate care into the provision of health services, or even developing specific migrant-friendly health services, could improve health service uptake and health awareness among migrants. Public health systems should also take account of migrants' financial situations and priorities in the design and delivery of health services."

27965180,0,a,"Upstream interventions - e.g. housing programs and community health worker interventions- address socioeconomic and behavioral factors that influence health outcomes across diseases. Studying these types of interventions in clinical trials raises a methodological challenge: how should researchers measure the effect of an upstream intervention in a sample of patients with different diseases? This paper addresses this question using an illustrative protocol of a randomized controlled trial of collaborative-goal setting versus goal-setting plus community health worker support among patients multiple chronic diseases: diabetes, obesity, hypertension and tobacco dependence. At study enrollment, patients met with their primary care providers to select one of their chronic diseases to focus on during the study, and to collaboratively set a goal for that disease. Patients randomly assigned to a community health worker also received six months of support to address socioeconomic and behavioral barriers to chronic disease control. The primary hypothesis was that there would be differences in patients' selected chronic disease control as measured by HbA1c, body mass index, systolic blood pressure and cigarettes per day, between the goal-setting alone and community health worker support arms. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a stratum specific multivariate analysis of variance which allows all patients (regardless of their selected chronic disease) to be included in a single model for the primary outcome. Population health researchers can use this approach to measure clinical outcomes across diseases. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01900470."

Multiple surgical procedures and the risk of airway obstruction contribute to the devastating impact of this disease. Some children will go into remission after a few surgeries whereas others will require repeated interventions over several years. Further understanding of the risk factors associated with severity may contribute to tailored treatments. A retrospective study of cases diagnosed between January 1995 and December 2008 was conducted to study determinants of severe forms of juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Demographic and clinical variables were abstracted from children's medical charts and mothers' delivery charts. Viral factors (HPV genotyping and viral load) were studied from archived biopsies. Specific HLA class II alleles and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors genes were tested from saliva samples. Logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for severity. Overall, 31 pediatric cases of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis were identified. The only significant factor associated with severe forms of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis was the maternal history of condylomas during pregnancy (OR: 12.05 [P=0.05]). The analysis failed to identify risk factors that could be used clinically to identify recurrent respiratory papillomatosis cases likely to take a severe course. Although too early to determine, vaccination against the HPV types involved most commonly in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis may provide the best hope to prevent severe forms of this disease."
31434585,0,a,"Little is known about intimate partner abuse (IPA) among couples during pregnancy in Iran. This study aimed to compare the rates of IPA by pregnant women towards their husbands (perpetration), and women's experience of IPA from their husbands (victimization) and determine the predictors of the two behaviours. The cross-sectional study was conducted on 525 pregnant women at 24-30 weeks of gestation visiting governmental health care centres/posts in Tabriz, Iran, in 2014. The study sample was selected using random cluster sampling. The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) was used to assess IPA perpetration and victimization. The McNemar test was employed to compare the prevalences of IPA perpetration and victimization, and adjusted logistic regression was utilized to determine the socio-demographic predictors of overall IPA perpetration and victimization. The overall rates of women's reported abuse of their husbands (perpetration) and women's experience of abuse from their husbands (victimization) were 70% and 67%, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.086). The prevalence of psychological aggression perpetrated by women towards their husbands was significantly higher than that experienced by the women from their husbands (65% vs 58%, p<0.001). The prevalences of sexual coercion (15% vs 30%) and injury (8% vs 16%) perpetrated by women on their husbands were significantly lower those they experienced by the women from their husbands (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of perpetration of physical violence towards husbands by women (19%) and that experienced by women from their husbands (22%) (p=0.072). Women's and husbands' satisfaction with their own occupations were predictors of both perpetration and victimization of IPA. The observed high rates of IPA perpetration by, women and victimization of, women during pregnancy, and the significantly higher rate of violence towards women compared with that perpetrated by women, especially for sexual coercion and injury, require health policymakers and care providers to make serious efforts to identify such violence, and take appropriate measures to reduce it, during pregnancy in women in Iran."
29738659,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Objective. To reflect on the process of committing to participation in the implementation of a health strategic plan, using Participative Systematization of Social Experiences as a tool. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study was a qualitative research-intervention study, based on the Dialectical Methodological Conception approach. We designed and implemented a two-day workshop, six hours daily, using Systematization methodology with a Community Work Group (CWG). During the workshop, women systematized their experience, with compromise as axis of the process. Using Grounded Theory techniques, we applied micro-analysis to data in order to identify and strengthen categories that emerged during the systematization process. We completed open and axial coding. RESULTS: The CWG identified that commitment and participation itself is influenced by group dynamics and structural determinants. They also reconsidered the way they understood and exercised commitment and participation, and generated knowledge, empowering them to improve their future practice. CONCLUSIONS: Commitment and participation were determined by group dynamics and structural factors such as socioeconomic conditions and gender roles. These determinants must be visible and understood in order to generate proposals that are aimed at strengthening the participation and organization of groups."
29113320,0,a,"We performed exome-wide association studies to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms that either influence fasting plasma glucose level or blood hemoglobin A1c content or confer susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japanese. Exome-wide association studies were performed with the use of Illumina Human Exome-12 DNA Analysis or Infinium Exome-24 BeadChip arrays and with 11,729 or 8635 subjects for fasting plasma glucose level or blood hemoglobin A1c content, respectively, or with 14,023 subjects for type 2 diabetes mellitus (3573 cases, 10,450 controls). The relation of genotypes of 41,265 polymorphisms to fasting plasma glucose level or blood hemoglobin A1c content was examined by linear regression analysis. After Bonferroni's correction, 41 and 17 polymorphisms were significantly (P < 1.21 x 10(-6)) associated with fasting plasma glucose level or blood hemoglobin A1c content, respectively, with two polymorphisms (rs139421991, rs189305583) being associated with both. Examination of the relation of allele frequencies to type 2 diabetes mellitus with Fisher's exact test revealed that 87 polymorphisms were significantly (P < 1.21 x 10(-6)) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex showed that four polymorphisms (rs138313632, rs76974938, rs139012426, rs147317864) were significantly (P < 1.44 x 10(-4)) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with rs138313632 and rs139012426 also being associated with fasting plasma glucose and rs76974938 with blood hemoglobin A1c. Five polymorphisms-rs139421991 of CAT, rs189305583 of PDCL2, rs138313632 of RUFY1, rs139012426 of LOC100505549, and rs76974938 of C21orf59-may be novel determinants of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
31574897,0,a,"This study was designed to examine national trends and evaluate social determinants of health that were associated with the provision of dental services in emergency rooms in the United States between 2007 and 2014. A pooled cross-sectional database of emergency department (ED) visits combined the 2007-2014 waves of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. A total of 3,761,958 ED visits with dental conditions were extracted and the principal diagnosis was identified. A series of modified Poisson regression models were used to assess the relationship between patient sociodemographic factors and hospital characteristics, and the likelihood of visiting the ED for a nontraumatic dental reason. Unadjusted descriptive results indicated that there was no apparent increase in the percentage of patients who visited an ED with nontraumatic dental conditions (NTDCs) between 2007 and 2014. The greatest users of EDs for NTDCs were among those who were uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries relative to persons privately insured. ED visitors were more likely to reside in lower socioeconomic areas (when compared with visitors in the top quartile of the income distribution). Patients in all other age groups were more likely to seek care in an ED for NTDCs relative to those 65 years of age or older. Multiple strategies are required to reduce the use of EDs for routine dental care. This approach will require an interprofessional dialogue and solutions that reduce barriers to receiving dental care."
26347544,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The social context of poverty is consistently linked to Trichomonas vaginalis infection, yet few studies regarding T. vaginalis have been conducted exclusively among low-income individuals. We identified social determinants of health associated with prevalent T. vaginalis infection among homeless and unstably housed adult women. METHODS: Between April and October of 2010, we conducted cross-sectional T. vaginalis screening and behavioural interviews in an existing cohort of San Francisco homeless and unstably housed women. Data were analysed using multivariable logistical regression. RESULTS: Among 245 study participants, the median age was 47 years and 72% were of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity. T. vaginalis prevalence was 12%, compared to 3% in the general population, and 33% of infected individuals reported no gynaecological symptoms. In adjusted analysis, the odds of T. vaginalis infection were lower among persons older than 47 years, the population median (OR=0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.38), and higher among those reporting recent short-term homeless shelter stays (OR=5.36, 95% CI 1.57 to 18.26). Race and income did not reach levels of significance. Sensitivity analyses indicated that testing all women who report recent unprotected sex would identify more infections than testing those who report gynaecological symptoms (20/30 vs 10/30; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of T. vaginalis is high among homeless and unstably housed adult women, over one-third of infected individuals have no gynaecological symptoms, and correlates of infection differ from those reported in the general population. Targeted screening and treatment among impoverished women reporting recent unprotected sex, particularly young impoverished women and all women experiencing short-term homelessness, may reduce complications related to this treatable infection."
22894138,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We describe the study design and methods used in a 9-month pedometer-based worksite intervention called ""ASUKI Step"" conducted at the Karolinska Institutet (KI) in Stockholm, Sweden and Arizona State University (ASU) in the greater Phoenix area, Arizona. METHODS/DESIGN: ""ASUKI Step"" was based on the theory of social support and a quasi-experimental design was used for evaluation. Participants included 2,118 faculty, staff, and graduate students from ASU (n = 712) and KI (n = 1,406) who participated in teams of 3-4 persons. The intervention required participants to accumulate 10,000 steps each day for six months, with a 3-month follow-up period. Steps were recorded onto a study-specific website. Participants completed a website-delivered questionnaire four times to identify socio-demographic, health, psychosocial and environmental correlates of study participation. One person from each team at each university location was randomly selected to complete physical fitness testing to determine their anthropometric and cardiovascular health and to wear an accelerometer for one week. Study aims were: 1) to have a minimum of 400 employee participants from each university site reach a level of 10,000 steps per day on at least 100 days (3.5 months) during the trial period; 2) to have 70% of the employee participants from each university site maintain two or fewer inactive days per week, defined as a level of less than 3,000 steps per day; 3) to describe the socio-demographic, psychosocial, environmental and health-related determinants of success in the intervention; and 4) to evaluate the effects of a pedometer-based walking intervention in a university setting on changes in self-perceived health and stress level, sleep patterns, anthropometric measures and fitness.Incentives were given for compliance to the study protocol that included weekly raffles for participation prizes and a grand finale trip to Arizona or Sweden for teams with most days over 10,000 steps. DISCUSSION: ""ASUKI Step"" is designed to increase the number of days employees walk 10,000 steps and to reduce the number of days employees spend being inactive. The study also evaluates the intra- and interpersonal determinants for success in the intervention and in a sub-sample of the study, changes in physical fitness and body composition during the study.

12340179,1,a,"Using a sociodemographic model of the determinants of illegitimacy rates, a multivariate regression analysis of annual change in age-specific Swedish illegitimacy rates is applied to the 1911-74 period. The proxy measure of change in sexual activity was significant for all age groups. Legitimation rates for out-of-wedlock conceived births were significant for all ages except teenagers, and the final predictor, women's status, was significant for all ages except women 35-44. Explained variance for annual change was highest among ages 20-24 (66%), 25-29 (66%), and 30-34 (63%) and lower among teens (34%) and women 35-44 (47%). These results support earlier research that used a sociodemographic model to explain post-World War II change in cross-national illegitimacy rates among 23 developed countries."
30903484,0,a,"Black men are more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with White men. Despite advances in prevention and treatment strategies, disparities in prostate cancer among Black men persist. While research on the causes of higher incidence and mortality is ongoing, there is limited evidence in the existing literature that clearly speaks to the potential psychological or social factors that may contribute to disparities in prostate cancer incidence. Given the lack of attention to this issue, we review scientific evidence of the ways in which social factors, including socioeconomic status and racial segregation, as well as psychological factors, like depression and anxiety, are related to subsequent prostate cancer risk, which could occur through behavioral and biological processes. Our objective is to illuminate psychosocial factors and their context, using a racial disparity lens, which suggests opportunities for future research on the determinants of prostate cancer. Ultimately, we aim to contribute to a robust research agenda for the development of new prostate cancer prevention measures to reduce racial disparities."
22077172,1,a,"Summary In order to unravel the complex set of the determinants of fertility, we suggest that the child-bearing process be separated into a sequence of events and intervals. As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval. The strong effect of ethnicity is consistent with a cultural interpretation, but important qualifications are noted."
25852972,0,a,"PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of a physical activity (PA) intervention for young adult cancer survivors on changes in self-efficacy, social support, and self-monitoring and determined whether changes in these social cognitive theory constructs mediated the relationship between the intervention and changes in PA. METHODS: A 12-week randomized trial compared a Facebook-based intervention (FITNET) aimed at increasing moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA to a Facebook-based self-help comparison group. Young adult cancer survivors (N=86, aged 21-39) were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Self-report measures of PA and psychosocial variables were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: The FITNET group reported lower self-efficacy for sticking to exercise (mean change=-0.38; 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.12; p=0.025) and social support from friends on social networking websites (mean change=-0.47; 95% CI: -1.45 to 0.65; p=0.039) relative to the self-help comparison group over time. Changes in social support from friends on social networking websites partially mediated the intervention effects on moderate-to-vigorous PA (mean indirect effect=-22.4; 95% CI: -62.0 to -2.8) in the unexpected direction. Across both groups, social support from friends and self-monitoring were positively associated with changes in moderate-to-vigorous PA. CONCLUSION: The proposed mediators did not explain the positive effects of the FITNET intervention on mild PA. The lack of significant improvements in psychosocial constructs among FITNET participants may partly explain why the intervention did not increase moderate-to-vigorous PA relative to the self-help comparison group. Future PA interventions with young adult cancer survivors should examine targeting social support from friends and self-monitoring."
3776295,1,a,"The relevant aspects of the psychosocial situation of men in old age were listed using two different methods: Identification of contextual determinants of the male aging process. Reporting on empirically based evidence of the situation of elderly men. ad 1. The following contextual aspects of the male aging process were under consideration: generalized and personalized images of elderly men, subjective reports on ""male aging"", changing images of the male sex role and the aging role, male sex role typing across the life span, middle and late adulthood as relevant lifespan segments preceding old age, and sociodemographic and health statistics concerning the situation in which elderly men live. ad 2. The report on empirically based data on the psychosocial situation of old aged men included the following aspects: Social roles of men in old age, comparisons between elderly men and elderly women and between elderly and younger men, interindividual variability (classifications) among the group of old-aged men and early antecedents as ""predictors"" of life satisfaction in old age. Analyzing these different kinds of material, the importance of a differential approach to the multidimensionally determined situation of men in old age was stressed; on the other hand, it seemed to be possible to identify certain ""typical"" characteristics at least for the present cohorts of old-aged men (e.g. importance of the quality of marital life, significance of being free of stress, tendency of experiential integration etc.)."
31452595,0,a,"In dialogue with mainly western literature on determinants of religious mobility and the evidence on the transformative role of mass education in developing settings, we examine the relationship of educational attainment with religious reaffiliation and disaffiliation in the context of rural and small-town sub-Saharan Africa. Adapting western scholarship to the realities of that context, where most people do not complete primary school, we conceptualize both basic education and religious belonging as parts and expressions of profound societal transformations in the sub-continent. We use data from a survey of women aged 18-50 conducted in a predominantly Christian area in Mozambique to test this relationship from both the lifetime and dynamic perspectives. We find a strong positive association between educational level and the probability of church switching, with modest variations by denominational destination of and main reasons for reaffiliation. Disaffiliation is negatively related to schooling level. These findings are situated within a broader discourse on religion, development, and social change in the sub-Sahara."

3788206,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."
26607939,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies of the role of dietary factors in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) development have been limited, and no specific dietary factors have been consistently associated with EOC risk. OBJECTIVE: We used a nutrient-wide association study approach to systematically test the association between dietary factors and invasive EOC risk while accounting for multiple hypothesis testing by using the false discovery rate and evaluated the findings in an independent cohort. DESIGN: We assessed dietary intake amounts of 28 foods/food groups and 29 nutrients estimated by using dietary questionnaires in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study (n = 1095 cases). We selected 4 foods/nutrients that were statistically significantly associated with EOC risk when comparing the extreme quartiles of intake in the EPIC study (false discovery rate = 0.43) and evaluated these factors in the NLCS (Netherlands Cohort Study; n = 383 cases). Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs. RESULTS: None of the 4 dietary factors that were associated with EOC risk in the EPIC study (cholesterol, polyunsaturated and saturated fat, and bananas) were statistically significantly associated with EOC risk in the NLCS; however, in meta-analysis of the EPIC study and the NLCS, we observed a higher risk of EOC with a high than with a low intake of saturated fat (quartile 4 compared with quartile 1; overall HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.41). CONCLUSION: In the meta-analysis of both studies, there was a higher risk of EOC with a high than with a low intake of saturated fat."
31323739,0,a,"Resilience is widely accepted as the capacities implemented to manage climate change. Exploring how individual resilience can be enhanced to better prepare residents for natural disasters, such as urban flooding, is therefore necessary. Environmental cognitions that provide psychological and physiological benefits to people by adding motivation to interact with the place are factors influencing people's resilience-oriented behaviors but have largely been ignored in existing research. As such, this study establishes a framework for the concept of individual resilience to urban flooding. Gongming, a sub-district of Shenzhen, China, is considered the case area wherein individual resilience and its environmental determinants are evaluated. Through hierarchical linear modeling, the environmental determinants of individual resilience at the individual and community levels are identified. At the individual level, the main factors are a few green spaces, low quality of the built environment, mutual distrust and lack of well-being perceived by residents. At the community level, the results suggest that the social environment, particularly its gatedness, is pivotal to individual resilience. This study offers an approach for analyzing factors that limit individual resilience from the environmental perspective, thereby providing a basis for formulating corresponding policy recommendations to effectively improve resilience through urban planning."
20841128,1,a,"This article presents a multidimensional model of psychosocial determinants of health behavior for health promotion research and policy analysis. Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented."
27365954,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: People living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on myths, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. In the last decade, there has been an increase in individual literacy rate and increased access to technology in rural population. However, it is unclear if this has any effect on knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) attitude toward epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to evaluate KAP toward epilepsy. In addition, we also estimated the prevalence of stroke and epilepsy in rural South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 14-item questionnaire, we assessed KAP toward epilepsy and identified determinants of inappropriate attitudes toward people with epilepsy and 10-item questionnaires to assess the prevalence of epilepsy and stroke among 500 randomly selected populations in a Pattaravakkam village (Tamil Nadu, India). RESULTS: About 87.7% of the people had heard or read about epilepsy. Negative attitudes appeared to be reinforced by beliefs that epilepsy is hereditary (23.1%), kind of insanity (22.6%), or as contagious (12.0%). The knowledge about the clinical characteristics and first aid to a person during a seizure was 25.8%. About 36.5% of people think that society discriminates people with epilepsy. Moreover, our prevalence study showed that 8.7% people are suffering from epilepsy and 3.7% had stroke previously and at the day of survey, the stroke prevalence is 3.3%. CONCLUSION: Even with increased literacy, technology, and communication devices, the KAP of people toward epilepsy is relatively low. General public education campaigns and specific school education campaigns children should be encouraged to increase the KAP toward epilepsy. The prevalence and pattern of epilepsy and stroke is on the higher side in the village of Pattaravakkam. Future research regarding the value of targeted education in improving KAP will be worthwhile."
2710760,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to explore the associations between several social learning theory variables and self-reported vigorous exercise and to consider the implications for exercise promotion. A random sample of adults in San Diego, California, was surveyed by mail. The 2,053 respondents (response rate, 43.4%) overrepresented Caucasian, affluent, and well-educated groups. A model of 24 variables accounted for 0.27 of the variance in exercise, and results strongly supported social learning theory. The strongest correlates were self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in the ability to exercise in specific situations), perceived barriers to exercise, modeling, dietary habits, support from friends, and age. Smoking was inversely associated with exercise in men only. We encourage researchers to conduct intervention trials to test the hypotheses generated in this study."

2711410,1,a,"The proteins of venom reservoirs from 25 hymenopteran species from 21 genera were investigated with regard to their protein composition and immunological similarities. It was found that low mol. wt proteins and polypeptides are typical for the venoms of ants, social wasps and bees. Six species of ichneumonoid parasitic wasps lack these low mol. wt proteins. Except for bee venoms none of the low mol. wt proteins contain mannose. The venoms of ichneumonoid parasites and ants contained primarily acidic proteins, whereas those of social wasps and bees contained abundant neutral and basic proteins. Immunological analysis showed that a number of venom proteins from parasitic braconid (Chelonus) wasps shared conserved immunoreactive determinants with the venom proteins of higher Hymenoptera, including some not of parasitic habit. Implications of phylogenetic relationships among hymenopteran species are discussed."

24898593,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The Public Health Agency of Canada developed the Chronic Disease Indicator Framework (the Framework) with the goal of systematizing and enhancing chronic disease surveillance in Canada by providing the basis for consistent and reliable information on chronic diseases and their determinants. METHODS: Available national and international health indicators, frameworks and national health databases were reviewed to identify potential indicators. To make sure that a comprehensive and balanced set of indicators relevant to chronic disease prevention was included, a conceptual model with ""core domains"" for grouping eligible indicators was developed. Specific selection criteria were applied to identify key measures. Extensive consultations with a broad range of government partners, non-governmental organizations and public health practitioners were conducted to reach consensus and refine and validate the Framework. RESULTS: The Framework contains 41 indicators organized in a model comprised of 6 core domains: social and environmental determinants, early life / childhood risk and protective factors, behavioural risk and protective factors, risk conditions, disease prevention practices, and health outcomes/status. Also planned is an annual release of updated data on the proposed set of indicators, including national estimates, breakdowns by demographic and socioeconomic variables, and time trends. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the evidence related to chronic diseases and theirdeterminants is key to interpreting trends and crucial to the development of public health interventions. The Framework and its related products have the potential of becoming an indispensable tool for evidence-informed decision making in Canada."
27000198,0,a,"Poverty is one of the most significant social determinants of health, and as such, it is imperative that nurses have an understanding of the impact that living in poverty has upon one's life and health. A lack of such understanding will impede nurses from providing care that is patient centered, treats all patients fairly, and advocates for social justice. It is essential that nursing educators assure that poverty-related content and effective teaching strategies are used in nursing curricula in order to help students develop this understanding. Several poverty-simulation tools are available and may be able to assist with development of accurate knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Unfortunately, little evidence exists to evaluate most poverty simulation tools. This article will provide an introduction to several poverty-related simulation tools, discuss any related research that evaluates their effectiveness, and make recommendations for integration of such simulation tools into nursing curricula."
29542392,0,a,"Background Biofuels and other cooking fuels are used in households in low- and middle-income countries. Aim To investigate the impact of cooking fuels on lung function in children in urban and rural households in South-East Nigeria. Methods The multi-stage sampling method was used to enroll children exposed to cooking fuel in the communities. Lung function values FEV1, FVC and the FEV1/FVC ratio, were measured with ndd EasyOne(R) spirometer. Airflow limitation was determined with FEV1/FVC Z-score values at -1.64 as the lower limit of normal (LLN5). The Global Lung Function Initiative 2012 software was used to calculate the lung function indices. Results The median age (range) of the 912 children enrolled was 10.6 years (6-18). Altogether, 468 (51.6%) children lived in rural areas. Seven hundred and thirty-seven (80.7%) were directly exposed to cooking fuels (418/737, 56.5% in rural areas). Wood and kerosene were the dominant fuels in rural and urban households. The respective mean Z-scores of the exposed children in rural and urban were zFEV1 -0.62, FVC -0.21, FEV1/FVC -0.83 and zFEV1 -0.57, zFVC -0.14, FEV1/FVC -0.75. Few (5.2%, 38/737) of the children had airflow limitation. Most of them (60.5%, 25/38) lived in the rural community; the lowest FEV1/FVC Z-scores were those of exposed to a combination of fuels. Conclusion Exposure to cooking fuels affects lung function in children with airway limitation in a small proportion, Control measures are advocated to reduce the morbidity related to cooking fuels exposure."

The study population consisted of 154 spinal cord injured persons who were treated at our hospital between 1973 and 1979, and followed for seven years after injury. Demographic, social, and injury severity data were abstracted from each subject's hospital record. Motivation to work, employment history, and sources of postinjury financial support, were assessed by a vocational rehabilitation counselor. The study population was divided into four groups: persons continuously unemployed after injury, homemakers, students, and those employed at some time during the seven-year follow-up period. Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to develop a predictive model that ultimately included seven variables: gender, motivation to work, whether the patient's last job required ambulation, race, educational level, a functional ability score, and whether the patient had children. The model correctly classified 82% of those persons who were continuously unemployed, 100% of homemakers, 63% of students, and 72% of employed subjects. Overall, 79% of subjects were classified correctly. The most important classification errors were between the unemployed and employed groups. Seventeen percent of employed patients were incorrectly classified as unemployed, and 11% of unemployed patients were incorrectly classified as employed. Although there are other determinants of postinjury vocational status, individual potential can be assessed by means of a comparatively small set of predictor variables."

3730706,1,a,"The non-fatal deliberate taking of overdoses in Cork city during 1982 was investigated from records in the general hospitals. In one of the hospitals, those attending after an overdose were personally interviewed. For both sexes, the greatest incidence of overdoses was in the younger groups; for females, there was a seasonal variation. Those taking overdoses were grouped by electoral wards, and the social characteristics of these wards determined. The frequency varied greatly throughout the city; some wards, particularly in corporation northern estates and part of the city centre, showed a rate of up to three times the average; these areas were the most likely to show social deprivation."

26843783,0,a,"This article borrows from the intersectionality literature to investigate how legal status, labor market position, and family characteristics structure the labor supply of immigrant Latinas in Durham, NC, a new immigrant destination. The analysis takes a broad view of labor force participation, analyzing the predictors of whether or not women work; whether and how the barriers to work vary across occupations; and variation in hours and weeks worked among the employed. I also explicitly investigate the extent to which family constraints interact with other social characteristics, especially legal status, in shaping women's labor market position. Results highlight that immigrant Latinas experience multiple, interrelated constraints on employment owing to their position as low-skill workers in a labor market highly segregated by gender and nativity, to their status as members of a largely undocumented population, and as wives and mothers in an environment characterized by significant work-family conflict."

30800743,0,a,"Introduction: Social Contexts in Medicine (SCIM) is an 18-month program that connects medical students, patients, and physicians for a longitudinal learning experience. SCIM was developed for first- and second-year medical students and seeks to supplement students' biomedical education with practical experiences built around community and continuity. The program increases students' awareness of, and skills to address, social determinants of health via a seminar series, a home visit program, and a mentoring component. Methods: The program begins with a seminar series covering communication skills and the basics of social determinants of health, providing the foundation for successful home visits. Students are then paired with a patient for home visits to learn firsthand about the complex social factors that affect health and illness, patient participation in health care systems, and the doctor-patient relationship. In conjunction with the home visits, students obtain guidance from a physician mentor. Results: The SCIM program has been successful during its first 3 years at our institution. Analysis of changes in student attitudes using Crandall's Medical Student Attitudes Toward the Underserved survey has shown that SCIM students develop more positive attitudes toward the underserved than do their peers completing traditional clinic-based preceptorships. Additionally, in student surveys, the average response to the statement ""I learned something valuable I would not have otherwise learned in my classes"" has been 4.5 out of 5. Discussion: These findings suggest that the SCIM model contributes to medical education by broadening students' understanding about the influence of social factors on health and disease."
30427882,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the social, economic and demographic factors that determine low birth weight in the two Kassena Nankana districts of the Upper East region of Ghana. METHODS: Cross-sectional data was collected from January 2009 to December 2011 using the Navrongo Health and Demographic Surveillance System which monitors routine health and demographic outcomes in the study area. Data on foetal characteristics such as birth weight, and sex and maternal age, parity, maternal education, marital status, ethnicity, religious affiliation and socio-economic characteristics were collected and described. Tests of means, proportions and Chi-squares are employed in bivariate analysis, and adjusted logistic regression models fitted to control for potential confounding variables. All tests were two-sided and test of significance was set at p-value of < 0.05. RESULTS: There were 8,263 live births (44.9% females) with an overall average birth weight of 2.85 kg (2.9 kg for males and 2.8 kg for females). The average maternal age was 28 years, median parity 2, maternal literacy rate was about 70% and 83% of mothers were married. The prevalence of low birth weight was 13.8% 95%CI [13.10, 14.6] and more in female babies than in males (15.5% vs 12.2%; p<0.0001). Determinants of low birth-weight after controlling for confounding factors were sex of neonate (OR = 1.32, 95%CI [1.14,1.52]; p<0.0001), maternal age (p = 0.004), and mothers who are not married (OR = 1.44 [1.19, 1.74]; p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Female neonates in this population were likely to present with low birth weight and maternal factors such as younger age, lower socio-economic status and single parenthood were major determinants of low birth weight. Effective and adequate antenatal care should therefore target women with these risk factors."
23442574,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Disappointing results from clinical trials of disease-modifying interventions for Alzheimer's dementia (AD), along with reliable identification of modifiable risk factors in mid life from epidemiological studies, have contributed to calls to invest in risk-reduction interventions. It is also well known that AD-related pathological processes begin more than a decade before the development of clinical signs. These observations suggest that lifestyle interventions might be most effective when targeting non-symptomatic adults at risk of AD. To date, however, the few dementia risk-reduction programs available have targeted individual risk factors and/or were restricted to clinical settings. The current study describes the development of an evidence-based, theoretically-driven multidomain intervention to reduce AD risk in adults at risk. METHOD: The design of Body Brain Life (BBL) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a 12-week online AD risk-reduction intervention. Eligible participants with several modifiable risk factors on the Australian National University (ANU) AD Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) are randomly allocated to an online only group, an online and face-to-face group, or an active control group. We aim to recruit 180 participants, to undergo a comprehensive cognitive and physical assessment at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up assessment. The intervention comprises seven online modules (dementia literacy, risk factor education, engagement in physical, social, and cognitive lifestyles, nutrition, and health monitoring) designed using contemporary models of health behavior change. DISCUSSION: The BBL program is a novel online intervention to reduce the risk of AD in middle-aged adults at risk. The trial is currently under way. It is hypothesized that participants in the intervention arms will make lifestyle changes in several domains, and that this will lead to a reduction in their AD risk profile. We also expect to show that health behavior change is underpinned by changes in psychological determinants of behavior. If successful, the findings will contribute to the development of further dementia risk reduction interventions, and thus contribute to the urgent need to lower dementia risk factors in the population to alter future projections of disease prevalence. Longer follow-up of BBL participants and replications using large samples are required to examine whether reduction in AD risk factors will be associated with reduced prevalence.

26660049,0,a,"Consumer's attitudes to, and acceptance of, emerging technologies and their applications, are important determinants of their successful implementation and commercialisation. Understanding the range of socio-psychological, cultural and affective factors which may influence consumer responses to applications of nanotechnology will help ""fine-tune"" the development of consumer products in line with their expectations and preferences. This is particularly true of applications in the food area, where consumer concerns about technologies applied to food production may be elevated. This research applied systematic review methodology to synthesise current knowledge regarding societal acceptance or rejection of nanotechnology applied to agri-food production. The objective was to aggregate knowledge derived from different research areas to gain an overall picture of consumer responses to nanotechnology applied to food production. Relevant electronic databases of peer-reviewed literature were searched from the earliest date available, for peer-reviewed papers which reported primary empirical data on consumer and expert acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology, using a formal systematic review protocol. Inclusion criteria for papers to be included in the review were: empirical peer-reviewed papers written in English; a population sample of adults aged 18 years and over used in the research; a research focus on consumer and expert acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology; and research on attitudes towards, and willingness to pay for, different applications of agri-food nanotechnology. Two researchers independently appraised the papers using NVivo 10 QSR software. Studies examining consumer and expert acceptance were thematically analysed, and key information was collated. The results were synthesised in order to identify trends in information relevant to consumer acceptance of nanotechnology applied to food production. Eight key themes were identified from the 32 papers which were extracted from the literature. These themes were applied to understand the determinants of consumer acceptance of agri-food nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is more likely to be accepted by consumers when applied to development of novel packaging with distinct benefits rather than when integrated directly into agri-food products. Trust and confidence in agri-food nanotechnology and its governance need to be fostered through transparent regulation and development of societally beneficial impacts to increase consumer acceptance."
3775371,1,a,"Epidemiology has evolved from its historic origins as the study of major epidemics and vital statistics to a contemporary focus on the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in humans. This evolution reflects changes in the patterns of diseases and deaths that have occurred in our time and has placed new emphasis on preventing avoidable, premature deaths. Advances in clinical medicine, laboratory science, statistical and data handling methods, and in our basic understanding of the pathogenesis of disease have enabled epidemiologists to better examine causes of disease and to propose more effective strategies for prevention and control."
28192033,0,a,"In 2016, Keyes and Galea issued 9 foundational principles of population health science and invited further deliberations by specialists to advance the field. This article presents 7 foundational principles of population health policy whose intersection with health care, public health, preventive medicine, and now population health, presents unique challenges. These principles are in response to a number of overarching questions that have arisen in over a decade of the authors' collective practice in the public and private sectors, and having taught policy within programs of medicine, law, nursing, and public health at the graduate and executive levels. The principles address an audience of practitioners and policy makers, mindful of the pressing health care challenges of our time, including: rising health-related expenditures, an aging population, workforce shortages, health disparities, and a backdrop of inequities rooted in social determinants that have not been adequately translated into formal policies or practices among the key stakeholders in population health. These principles are meant to empower stakeholders-whether it is the planner or the practitioner, the decision maker or the dedicated caregiver-and inform the development of practical tools, research, and education."
23804585,0,a,"AIM: Response to stress can vary greatly between individuals. However, it remains unknown whether perceived impact of stress on health is associated with adverse health outcomes. We examined whether individuals who report that stress adversely affects their health are at increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with those who report that stress has no adverse health impact. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analyses are based on 7268 men and women (mean age: 49.5 years, interquartile range: 11 years) from the British Whitehall II cohort study. Over 18 years of follow-up, there were 352 coronary deaths or first non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) events. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, participants who reported at baseline that stress has affected their health 'a lot or extremely' had a 2.12 times higher (95% CI 1.52-2.98) risk of coronary death or incident non-fatal MI when compared with those who reported no effect of stress on their health. This association was attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjustment for biological, behavioural, and other psychological risk factors including perceived stress levels, and measures of social support; fully adjusted hazard ratio: 1.49 (95% CI 1.01-2.22). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort study, the perception that stress affects health, different from perceived stress levels, was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether disease risk can be reduced by increasing clinical attention to those who complain that stress greatly affects their health."
29510005,0,a,"The article presents analysis of social economic health determinants of parents of children with oncologic diseases. The evaluation of their satisfaction with accessibility of qualitative medical care was carried out. The questionnaire covered issues concerning medical social aspects of health and satisfaction with quality of medical care. the sampling included 284 parents of children with oncologic diseases receiving treatment in the profile departments of Krasnodar, Stavropol, Volgograd, Makhachkala, Grozny, Cherkessk, Nalchik and Astrakhan in August-September 2015. The parents answered to questionnaire independently. The filled questionnaires handed over to the responsible physician. The responsible physician was fully instructed how to proceed with survey. The study established that oncologic disease of child effects quality of life of parents in 33.2% of cases. The relationships within family deteriorate in 19.7% of cases. According opinion of parents, they have high level of literacy in health issues. Only every second parent trusts official medicine and certain percentage of respondents resorts to non-traditional care including psychic individuals and priests. The analysis of answers permitted to derive that hospitalization provides no difficulties though dissatisfaction with treatment costs and attitude of medical personnel remains.It is established that parents of children with oncologic diseases suffer from anxiety and depression on clinical and sub-clinical level that requires implementation of complex of measures of psychological support. The direct dependence is established concerning between presence of anxiety and depression and also presence of depression and physical indisposition of respondents."
30782175,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Operations of transnational corporations (TNCs) affect population health through production methods, shaping social determinants of health, or by influencing regulation of their activities. Research on community exposures to TNC practices and policies has been limited. Our research on extractive industries examined Rio Tinto in Australia and Southern Africa to test methods for assessing the health impacts of corporates in high and middle income jurisdictions with different regulatory frameworks. METHODS: We adapted existing Health Impact Assessment methods. Data identifying potential impacts were sourced through media analysis, document analysis, company literature and semi-structured interviews. The data were mapped against a corporate health impact assessment framework (CHIA) which included Rio Tinto's political and business practices; productions; and workforce, social, environmental and economic conditions. RESULTS: Both positive and detrimental aspects of Rio Tinto's operations were identified. Requirements imposed by Rio Tinto on its global supply chain are likely to have positive health impacts for workers. However, political lobbying and membership of representative organisations can influence government policy in ways that are unfavourable to health and equity. Positive impacts include provision of direct employment under decent working conditions, but countered by an increase in precariousness of employment. Commitments to upholding sustainable development principles are undermined by limited site remediation and other environmental impacts. Positive contributions are made to national and local economies but then undermined by business strategies that include tax minimisation. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that it is possible to undertake a CHIA on an extractive industry TNC. The different methods provided sufficient information to understand the need to strengthen regulations that are conducive to health; the opportunity for Rio Tinto to extend corporate responsibility initiatives and support their social licence to operate; and for civil society actors to inform their advocacy towards improving health and equity outcomes from TNC operations."
31415625,0,a,"Access to HIV/AIDS-related health services among transgender women living with HIV is still a major public health issue in many developing countries, and Indonesia is not an exception. However, reportedly compared to other settings in the country, transgender women in Yogyakarta have a good access to the HIV-related health services. This study aimed to explore perceptions among transgender women living with HIV, locally known as waria, of factors supportive of their access to the services in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative inquiry using in-depth interview method was conducted from December 2017 to February 2018 to collect the data from a selection of waria living with HIV (n = 29) recruited using both purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Data analysis employed a thematic approach which was guided by the framework analysis for qualitative data. The findings indicated several health service system-related determinants supportive of waria's access to HIV/AIDS-related health services. These included the availability of the services, the simplicity and convenience of accessibility to the services and the comfort felt by the participants while accessing the services. Health professionals' positive attitudes during healthcare provision, social relationships between waria and health professionals, proximity to healthcare facilities, free access to the services, and information sessions on HIV infection and prevention were also reported to enable participants' access to the services. These findings call to efforts and strengthening of HIV health service system to support and provide equal access to HIV/AIDS-related services including to all Indonesians living with HIV, but more so for transgender women and other high-risk groups such as sex workers and their clients and men who have sex with men."

6504868,1,a,"Preventive and therapeutic advances have brought life expectancy in the United States to well over 70 years and have shifted mortality causes from acute to chronic diseases, the determinants of which are genetics, lifestyle, the environment, and aging itself. Plausible approaches to chronic disease prevention are likely to increase longevity further, with some foreseeable effects on demographic and economic projections. Primarily, longevity advances would swell forecasts of population size, and would thus have to be met by production advances in order to maintain or improve living standards. This study, a restricted example, considers the probable demographic and economic consequences of a limited prevention program in the context of the Ford Motor Company, based on actual experience and certain expectations up to the year 2000. According to the results, prevention would reduce outlays for life insurance, disability, and health care, but would also generate the higher costs of extending pension plans. Undoubtedly, prevention will continue to be highly ranked in society's pursuit of happiness, and society must prepare to meet its effects with appropriate social and economic policies."
27485619,0,a,"We identify the socioeconomic determinants of three levels of antenatal care (ANC) visits (no, intermediate [1-3], and recommended [>/=4]) in Bangladesh using a behavior model framework for health care utilization. Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that different levels of visits had different determinants; for example, media exposure increased the likelihood of intermediate compared with no visits while desire for pregnancy increased the likelihood of recommended compared with intermediate visits. We therefore highlight that ANC policies or interventions should be target-group specific because determinants differ depending on level of ANC visits."
23681268,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics, driven by antibiotic consumption, imposes a major threat to the effective treatment of bacterial infections. In addition to reducing the amount of antibiotics prescribed, avoiding broad-spectrum antibiotics could extend the lifetime of the current arsenal of antibiotic substances. Therefore, we documented prescriber and patient characteristics associated with the choice between amoxicillin and broader-spectrum alternatives (co-amoxiclav or moxifloxacin) in recent years in Belgium. METHODS: Complete reimbursement claims data (2002-09) for antibiotic prescriptions in outpatient care, including patient and prescriber characteristics, were collected for both young children (1-5 years) and the adult population (30-60 years). A backwards selection procedure within generalized estimating equations retained the most relevant determinants. RESULTS: The age, gender and social category of the patient were found to be predictive of the extent to which amoxicillin was prescribed instead of the broader-spectrum alternatives, with female patients generally taking a higher proportion of amoxicillin than male patients. The age category of 40-44-year-old prescribers exhibited a preference for broad-spectrum antibiotics compared with both younger and older age groups. Significant interactions between the region and the prescriber's qualification (general practitioner or paediatrician) on the choice of antibiotic for children were found. CONCLUSIONS: Patient (age, gender and social category) and prescriber characteristics (age, gender, region and qualification) had an influence on whether amoxicillin or the alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed. These findings should help policy makers to better target future campaigns to promote prudent prescribing of antibiotics."
27614465,0,a,"Purpose The significant individual and societal burden of work disability could be reduced if supportive workplace strategies could be added to evidence-based clinical treatment and rehabilitation to improve return-to-work (RTW) and other disability outcomes. The goal of this article is to summarize existing research on workplace interventions to prevent disability, relate these to employer disability management practices, and recommend future research priorities. Methods The authors participated in a year-long collaboration that ultimately led to an invited 3-day conference, Improving Research of Employer Practices to Prevent Disability, held October 14-16, 2015, in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, USA. The collaboration included a topical review of the literature, group conference calls to identify key areas and challenges, drafting of initial documents, review of industry publications, and a conference presentation that included feedback from peer researchers and a question/answer session with an expert panel with direct employer experience. Results Evidence from randomized trials and other research designs has shown general support for job modification, RTW coordination, and organizational support, but evidence is still lacking for interventions at a more granular level. Grey literature reports focused mainly on job re-design and work organization. Panel feedback focused on organizational readiness and the beliefs and values of senior managers as critical factors in facilitating changes to disability management practices. While the scientific literature is focused on facilitating improved coping and reducing discomforts for individual workers, the employer-directed grey literature is focused on making group-level changes to policies and procedures. Conclusions Future research might better target employer practices by tying interventions to positive workplace influences and determinants, by developing more participatory interventions and research designs, and by designing interventions that address factors of organizational change."
6663350,1,a,"The epidemiological and clinical profile of Chronic Post-Traumatic Headache (CPTH) has been studied in 57 out of 130 consecutive patients hospitalized, following closed head injuries, at the Institute of Neurosurgery of the University of Milan. The incidence of CPTH has been 44%. Age of the patients ranged between 4 and 69 years. Clinical pictures included closed head injuries of different degree of severity: mild, moderate and severe. Time of onset, headache frequency, character, intensity, duration and associated symptoms showed a great degree of variability. However, chronic muscle contraction headache was the commonest clinical syndrome followed by migraine. Moderate correlations have been found between the severity of CPTH disturbance of consciousness, following the head trauma, and positive findings at CT scan. Moreover the comparison of personality profiles (MMPI) of CPTH (n=26) with a post-traumatic control group, without headache (n=17) showed higher scores on hypocondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales only in the severe CPTH group. Age of the patients, duration of unconsciousness, neurological deficits, course length and pending litigation or compensations were unrelated to the occurrence and outcome of CPTH. These findings suggest the importance of both physical and psychological determinants (social or emotional maladjustment) in the pathogenesis of CPTH."
24812563,0,a,"Background. Inconsistent data exist about the role of probiotics in the treatment of constipated children. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of probiotics in childhood constipation. Materials and Methods. In this placebo controlled trial, fifty-six children aged 4-12 years with constipation received randomly lactulose plus Protexin or lactulose plus placebo daily for four weeks. Stool frequency and consistency, abdominal pain, fecal incontinence, and weight gain were studied at the beginning, after the first week, and at the end of the 4th week in both groups. Results. Forty-eight patients completed the study. At the end of the fourth week, the frequency and consistency of defecation improved significantly (P = 0.042 and P = 0.049, resp.). At the end of the first week, fecal incontinence and abdominal pain improved significantly in intervention group (P = 0.030 and P = 0.017, resp.) but, at the end of the fourth week, this difference was not significant (P = 0.125 and P = 0.161, resp.). A significant weight gain was observed at the end of the 1st week in the treatment group. Conclusion. This study showed that probiotics had a positive role in increasing the frequency and improving the consistency at the end of 4th week."
19022434,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the probability of medical consultation for infertility during the course of a pregnancy attempt and to study its determinants. DESIGN: Pregnancy-based retrospective telephone survey analyzed with a discrete time Cox model. SETTING: Two rural counties in Brittany and Normandy, France. PATIENT(S): A random sample of 901 women from the general population aged 18-60 years reporting 1,460 pregnancy attempts resulting in a live birth between 1985 and 2000 (participation rate, 73%). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Probability of medical consultation for involuntary infertility cumulated over time. RESULT(S): The cumulative probability of medical consultation for involuntary infertility among nulligravid women was 45% after 12 months of involuntary infertility and 75% after 24 months. The probability of medical consultation at any time was half that for parous women (odds ratio 0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.6). More highly educated women were more likely to have sought medical help for infertility. Only 45% of women who had sought medical advice received infertility treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Our survival approach provides a description of infertility service use during the course of a pregnancy attempt, and confirms that parity and educational level are strong predictors of medical help-seeking behaviors."

22411393,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The intensive care of patients at home had probed important beneficialness for the patient and the Health System. There are very few experiences of this kind of care from the Public Hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To develop a social-sanitary analysis of the feasibility of the implementation of HPN on patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) from a Public Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients hospitalized between 1985-2009 were included. We analyzed: age, residual intestine length (RIL), time between de indication and the beginning of HPN, HPN duration, treatment modality and clinical outcome. Social determinants: home place, habitat conditions, employment conditions, educational level, social security and Low Socioeconomic Status (LSS). The group were divided in two: 1- patients with feasibility of HPN when it was prescribed; 2- patients without feasibility of HPN. RESULTS: 61 patients were included, RIL x: 21.7 +/- 11.6 cm. The HPN was feasible (G1) in 32 patients (52.4%) and no feasible (G2) in 29 (47.6%). The home treatment modality was in self-caring 25 (81%) and with nurses support 7 (19 %). The social determinants associated with the HPN feasibility were: more than one takecare (p 0.03), educational level (p 0.01), adequate habitat conditions (p 0.02) and Low Socioeconomis Status (LSS) (p 0.07). 17 patients reached intestinal adaptation (28%), 6 (10%) were transplanted, 19 (31%) died and 19 (31%) are actually on HPN. CONCLUSION: The HPN realized from the Public Hospital is feasible. Different social determinants were observed. The care of this group of patients must be done by an interdisciplinary group including general aspects of the child and the family."
4034814,1,a,"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration."

This study aimed to assess socio-demographic disparities in clinical- and self reported oral health status and a number of oral health behaviors. The extent to which oral health related behaviors might account for socio-demographic disparities in oral health status was also examined. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Kilwa district in 2008. One thousand seven hundred and forty five schoolchildren completed an interview and a full mouth clinical examination. Caries experience was recorded using WHO criteria, whilst type of treatment need was categorized using the ART approach. RESULTS: The majority of students were caries free (79.8%) and presented with a low need for dental treatment (89.3%). Compared to their counterparts in opposite groups, rural residents and those from less poor households presented more frequently with caries experience (DMT>0), high need for dental treatment and poor oral hygiene behavior, but were less likely to report poor oral health status. Stepwise logistic regressions revealed that social and behavioral variables varied systematically with caries experience, high need for dental treatment and poor self reported oral health. Socio-demographic disparities in oral health outcomes persisted after adjusting for oral health behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographic disparities in oral health outcomes and oral health behaviors do exist. Socio-demographic disparities in oral health outcomes were marginally accounted for by oral health behaviors. Developing policies and programs targeting both social and individual determinants of oral health should be an urgent public health strategy in Tanzania."
20670346,0,a,"AIMS: This paper reviews a set of theories of behaviour change that are used outside the field of addiction and considers their relevance for this field. METHODS: Ten theories are reviewed in terms of (i) the main tenets of each theory, (ii) the implications of the theory for promoting change in addictive behaviours and (iii) studies in the field of addiction that have used the theory. An augmented feedback loop model based on Control Theory is used to organize the theories and to show how different interventions might achieve behaviour change. RESULTS: Briefly, each theory provided the following recommendations for intervention: Control Theory: prompt behavioural monitoring, Goal-Setting Theory: set specific and challenging goals, Model of Action Phases: form 'implementation intentions', Strength Model of Self-Control: bolster self-control resources, Social Cognition Models (Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Health Belief Model): modify relevant cognitions, Elaboration Likelihood Model: consider targets' motivation and ability to process information, Prototype Willingness Model: change perceptions of the prototypical person who engages in behaviour and Social Cognitive Theory: modify self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: There are a range of theories in the field of behaviour change that can be applied usefully to addiction, each one pointing to a different set of modifiable determinants and/or behaviour change techniques. Studies reporting interventions should describe theoretical basis, behaviour change techniques and mode of delivery accurately so that effective interventions can be understood and replicated."
22868751,0,a,"CONTEXT The substantial changes in adolescent alcohol use prevalence over time suggest that population-level environmental factors are important determinants of use, yet the potential influence of such environmental factors is inadequately understood. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether adolescents in birth cohorts and/or time periods characterized by restrictive social norms toward alcohol were at decreased risk for alcohol use and binge drinking, controlling for individual attitudes (disapproval) toward use. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In 32 annual national surveys of US high school students, a total of 967 562 students contributed outcome data from 1976 through 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Frequency of past-year alcohol use and any instance of binge drinking (>/=5 drinks) in the past 2 weeks, analyzed using multilevel models clustering individuals within periods and birth cohorts. Period- and cohort-specific social norm scores (indicating the proportion disapproving of weekend binge drinking) were modeled as predictors, controlling for individual attitudes and demographic characteristics. RESULTS Individuals who matured in birth cohorts with more restrictive social norms were less likely to use alcohol compared with individuals who matured in cohorts with more permissive norms; each 5% increase in the cohort-specific disapproval was associated with a 12% decrease in the odds of past-year alcohol use (odds ratio = 0.88; 99% CI, 0.87-0.89). The effects of cohort-specific disapproval were notably stronger among white adolescents than nonwhite adolescents. CONCLUSIONS This study documents the importance of considering time-varying population-level risk factors in the study of adolescent alcohol use and indicates that, even after an individual's personal attitudes are accounted for, risk is shaped by cohort effects whereby the norms within the cohort contribute to the risk of adolescent alcohol use."
31764529,0,a,"BACKGROUND: American Indian elders have one of the lowest life expectancies in the United States. Disproportionate disease burden, socioeconomic disparities, and higher rates of violence across the lifespan are thought to contribute to higher rates of elder abuse. Elder abuse and higher rates of trauma exposure are linked with adverse outcomes. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines informed the methodology and assessment of the literature on elder abuse among American Indians. RESULTS: Of the nine studies published in the last 30 years, rates of elder abuse varied by study, location, and tribal affiliation from 4.3% to 45.9%. Large studies with comparison populations found higher rates for American Indians. There was a consensus for three risk factors: substance abuse, mental health problems, and caregiving issues. Importance of tribal norms, the notion of respect conferred to elders, and the concept of acculturation were major culturally relevant themes. Perceived tribal norms and strengths, for example, respect for elders, were at odds with abuse experiences, particularly financial exploitation and neglect. Historical trauma, shame, and fear impacted reporting. There was little consistency in study designs, most were qualitative or mixed methods, samples were small, there was no common measurement tool or time frame for abuse, and there was only one intervention study. IMPLICATIONS: High rates of abuse suggest healthcare providers should be encouraged to screen and intervene despite the lack of empirical evidence. Providers should not assume that traditional culturally ascribed strengths, such as honor and respect for elders, provide any degree of protection against elder abuse."
2558204,1,a,"To identify factors associated with the decision to consult with dyspepsia, patients with dyspepsia were identified from a postal survey in the community. A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour."
3874527,1,a,"Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values."
3232579,1,a,"Self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans are examined in relation to sex role orientations of late adolescents. Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys."
28837566,0,a,"The use of the Internet and social applications has many benefits for the elderly, but numerous investigations have shown that the elderly do not perceive online social networks as a friendly social environment. Therefore, TreeIt, a social application specifically designed for the elderly, was developed for this study. In the TreeIt application, seven mechanisms promoting social interaction were designed to allow older adults to use social networking sites (SNSs) to increase social connection, maintain the intensity of social connections and strengthen social experience. This study's main objective was to investigate how user interface design affects older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. Fourteen user interface evaluation heuristics proposed by Zhang et al. were adopted as the criteria to assess user interface usability and further grouped into three categories: system support, user interface design and navigation. The technology acceptance model was adopted to assess older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. One hundred and one elderly persons were enrolled in this study as subjects, and the results showed that all of the hypotheses proposed in this study were valid: system support and perceived usefulness had a significant effect on behavioral intention; user interface design and perceived ease of use were positively correlated with perceived usefulness; and navigation exerted an influence on perceived ease of use. The results of this study are valuable for the future development of social applications for the elderly."
2738317,1,a,"This study examined the personal and environmental factors related to the activity involvement of older people living in congregate residential settings. A sample of 1,428 residents in 42 such settings provided information about their activities, functioning, and background. Measures of facility features were also available. These data show that individuals are more likely to participate in facility-organized activities in settings where overall resident participation is greater, the average functioning of residents is lower, staffing is higher, and the program more structured. Participation in facility activities is not related to personal characteristics. In contrast, involvement in resident-initiated activities, both in the facility and in the community, is related to personal characteristics (being functionally intact, female, and better educated) and to facility features (larger size, lower staffing, greater autonomy and cohesiveness). The impact of some features varies depending on the functional capacity of the individual resident."
12315065,1,a,"The author develops the hypothesis that women from different population subgroups respond differently to economic and background influences when timing initial childbearing. Data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience and concern some 5,000 U.S. women followed from 1968 to 1978. ""Among all groups examined, age at first birth tends to increase as education levels increase, and married women with spouses present tend to be older than other women at first childbirth. Among whites, all economic influences considered--hourly pay rate, nonmarket income, and work during the year prior to childbearing--have a significant influence in deferring first childbirth, but family background does not. Among blacks, family background plays a significant role in determining age at first childbirth, but only one economic influence--the hourly pay rate--is significant."""
23144236,0,a,"Digital technologies are increasingly important as ways to gain access to most of the important social determinants of health including employment, housing, education and social networks. However, little is known about the impact of the new technologies on opportunities for health and well-being. This paper reports on a focus group study of the impact of these technologies on people from low socio-economic backgrounds. We use Bourdieu's theories of social inequities and the ways in which social, cultural and economic capitals interact to reinforce and reproduce inequities to examine the ways in which digital technologies are contributing to these processes. Six focus group discussions with 55 people were held to examine their access to and views about using digital technologies. These data are analysed in light of Bourdieu's theory to determine how people's existing capitals shape their access to and use of digital technologies and what the implications of exclusion from the technologies are likely to be for the social determinants of health. The paper concludes that some people are being caught in a vicious cycle whereby lack of digital access or the inability to make beneficial use reinforces and amplifies existing disadvantage including low levels of reading and writing literacy. The paper concludes with a consideration of actions health promoters could take to interrupt this cycle and so contribute to reducing health inequities."
3916715,1,a,"Health promotion has become an official health policy of this country, and it is being pursued through efforts to change individuals' health-related behavior. This approach is based on the assumption that it is in fact an individual's behavior that most directly determines his or her health status. But how good is the evidence that supports this assumption? Specifically, is the evidence sufficient for this assumption to outweigh the long-standing finding that social and economic conditions have a strong relationship to health status? The major support for the behavior approach derives from the coronary heart disease risk-factor studies and the Alameda County Study. In a series of reports over time, the relationship between individuals' health practices and their health status generally, as well as that between heart disease and cancer specifically, have been established by these studies. These observations, however, have not been confirmed when deliberate efforts have been made to change those practices. The evidence in support of the importance of social and economic conditions to health status has been documented through a long series of studies in this country, which have found a direct relationship between individuals' socioeconomic status and their health status. This relationship, however, has not in this country been tested by intervention. Only a few studies have examined the interrelationship between these two approaches to health promotion, but the evidence to date has failed to suggest that either one is the mediator of the other. We must, therefore, conclude that pursuing a policy of health promotion based on either approach to the exclusion of the other would indeed be short-sighted health policy."
30510896,0,a,"Through the application of science to public health practice, National Cancer Control Programmes provide the framework for the development of policies on cancer control, with the ultimate goal of reducing cancer morbidity and mortality, and improving quality of life. In the last decade, a substantial number of Member States in the European Union (EU) have formulated and/or updated their National Cancer Control Programmes, Plans or Strategies including primary prevention (health promotion and environmental protection), secondary prevention (screening and early detection), integrated care and organization of services, and palliative care as main elements. Although tobacco control and population-based screening policies are examples of best practices that are gradually being implemented in most of the EU countries, there are still large regional differences in cancer burden arising from the wide variety of social determinants and other epidemiological factors, along with gaps in the policy and practical articulation of cancer control within the health systems. On the other hand, few quantitative assessments are available with regard to evaluating the success or failure of the implementation of these programmes, especially in terms of reducing cancer incidence or mortality. An EU framework to better assess of the effectiveness of cancer prevention policies and the factors triggering shortfall in best practices implementation seems imperative."
6875802,1,a,"An experiment was conducted to test the proposition that alcohol is consumed as a function of the quality of past performances and the individual's level of private self-consciousness. One hundred and twenty male subjects were randomly given success or failure feedback on an intellectual task. They then participated in a separate ""wine-tasting"" experiment in which they were allowed to regulate alcohol consumption. As predicted, high self-conscious subjects who had received failure feedback drank significantly more wine than did high self-conscious subjects who received success feedback. Consumption by low self-conscious subjects fell between these extremes and did not vary as a function of success and failure. Additional data indicated that these results were mediated by differential sensitivity to the positive or negative implications of success/failure by high and low self-conscious subjects. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for theoretical accounts of the psychological antecedents of alcohol consumption."
26790411,0,a,"BACKGROUND: It is hard to convince people to participate in chlamydia screening programs outside the clinical setting. In two earlier studies (BMC Public Health. 2013;13:1091; J Med Internet Res. 2014;16(1):e24), we identified explicit and implicit determinants of chlamydia screening behavior and attempted, unsuccessfully, to improve participation rates by optimizing the recruitment letter. In the present study, we examined the links between a number of social-cognitive determinants (e.g., stereotypical beliefs about a person with chlamydia, intentions, changes in partner status), and self-reported chlamydia testing behavior six months after the initial study. METHODS: The present study is a follow-up to our first study (T0). We assessed self-reported testing behavior 6 months after the first measure by means of an online questionnaire (T1; N = 269). Furthermore, at T1, we measured the social-cognitive determinants in more detail, and explored the influence of stereotypical beliefs and any changes in partner status during this six month period. RESULTS: In total, 25 (9.1 %) of the participants tested for chlamydia at some point during the six months between baseline (T0) and follow up (T1). Testing behavior was influenced by testing intentions in combination with changes in risk behavior. The higher the participants' own numbers of partners ever, the higher they estimated the number of partners of the stereotypical person with chlamydia. Testing intentions were most strongly predicted by perceived norms and susceptibility, and having had multiple partners in the last 6 months (R(2) = .41). CONCLUSION: The most relevant determinants for testing intentions and behavior were susceptibility, subjective norms and changes in partner status. We found a systematic tendency for individuals to underestimate their own risk, especially the risk of inconsistent condom use. Future research should focus on more promising alternatives to population-based interventions, such as online interventions, screening in primary care, the rescreening of positives, and clinic-based interventions. This future research should also focus on making testing easier and reducing barriers to testing, as well as using social and sexual networks in order to reach more people."
2740928,1,a,"This study explored the roles of acculturation, urban-rural provenance and length of residence as determinants of the utilization pattern of first line health services by Moroccan, Turkish and Italian migrants in Belgium. Concurrently, utilization characteristics were recorded in Belgian reference patients. With increasing acculturation the demand for preventive care decreased, vague complaints became more prevalent, the delay before consulting for a curative problem shortened and the prognosis improved. There was no correlation between the occurrence of psychological problems and acculturation but, except for 15-44 year old female migrants, the rate of social problems was negatively associated with this study factor. Migrants with an urban background consulted earlier and presented more frequently vague complaints than migrants from rural provenance. We observed no significant influence of length of residence on utilization characteristics and only a marginal influence on morbidity pattern. Although acculturation seems to be a strong determinant of the migrant's utilization pattern of primary health care services, it does not consistently lead to a decrease of utilization differentials with the Belgian reference population. This may imply that there is a need for public health interventions targeted at ethnic minorities."
3053480,1,a,"The offense-defense dichotomy undeniably proved to be of heuristic interest in that it allowed relevant distinctions between specific behaviour patterns, to establish correlations between situations in which either ""offensive"" or ""defensive"" patterns are likely to be displayed, and to uncover differential drug effects on those distinct behavior patterns. But for a number of reasons, the author is led to conclude that even though the offense-defense dichotomy indeed helps in many instances to describe and to distinguish, it has rather limited potential really to explain in depth what it distinguishes at a phenomenological level of investigation."
31765027,0,a,"This study describes how incarcerated people understand: (a) Adverse experiences, mental health, and substance use disorders as determinants of incarceration, (b) the role of gender in impacting this understanding, and (c) strategies to prevent incarceration. Ecosocial theory provides a theoretical framework. Open-ended interviews were conducted (December 2016-January 2017) with recently incarcerated adults in Massachusetts state prisons. Participants described determinants of incarceration and incarceration prevention strategies. Interviews were coded thematically using inductive and deductive approaches. Thirty participants, evenly split by gender, reported themes across four levels: Society (lacking basic needs, discrimination), community (neighborhood factors), interpersonal (trauma), and individual (social isolation, mental health, substance use). However, there were variations in themes by gender. Proposed prevention strategies included early access to quality individualized cross-system services. In conclusion, findings highlight how investing in social and community building services could prevent incarceration. Policies can support these services by redirecting funding."
23687797,0,a,"Marital satisfaction is important for health and well-being, although determinants of satisfaction among older couples are unclear. Much of the marital literature has focused on the role of the spouse, in isolation from satisfaction with broader social relationships. We conducted separate semi-structured interviews with both members of n = 40 couples (mean age 76 years) to measure satisfaction with particular types of social networks (confidant, friend, children, other relatives) as well as levels of physical and psychological well-being. In order to account for the likely interdependence among observations within married couples, a series of multi-level models, culminating in a full actor-partner interdependence model, were fitted. Results indicate that an individual's own depressive symptoms were related to their levels of marital satisfaction, whereby higher scores on the depression scale predicted lower marital satisfaction scores for the individual. None of the individual's other variables (physical well-being, sociodemographic, or social network satisfaction), nor any of the spouse variables, were related to individual levels of marital satisfaction. These findings reinforce the importance of psychological well-being as influencing the quality of older couple relationships."
30763391,0,a,"Human toxoplasmosis, a protozoonosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii, has been described as a worldwide foodborne disease with important public health impact. Despite infection has reportedly varied due to differences in alimentary, cultural and hygienic habits and geographic region, social vulnerability influence on toxoplasmosis distribution remains to be fully established. Accordingly, the present study has aimed to assess T. gondii seroprevalence and factors associated to social vulnerability for infection in households of Ivaipora, southern Brazil, with 33.6% population making half minimum wage or less, ranked 1,055th in population (31,816 habitants), 1,406th in per capita income (U$ 211.80 per month) and 1,021st in HDI (0.764) out of 5,570 Brazilian cities. Serum samples and epidemiological questionnaires were obtained from citizen volunteers with official City Secretary of Health assistance in 2015 and 2016. In overall, serosurvey has revealed 526/715 (73.57%) positive samples for anti-T. gondii antibodies by Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test. Logistic regression has shown a significant increase associated to adults (p = 0.021) and elderly (p = 0.014) people, illiterates (p = 0.025), unemployment (p <0.001) and lack of household water tank (p = 0.039). On the other hand, sex (male or female), living area (urban or rural), yard hygiene, meat ingestion, sand or land contact, owning pets (dog, cat or both) were not significant variables of positivity for anti-T. gondii antibodies in the surveyed population. Although no significant spatial cluster was found, high intensity areas of seropositive individuals were located in the Kernel map where the suburban neighborhoods are located. In conclusion, socioeconomic vulnerability determinants may be associated to Toxoplasma gondii exposure. The increased risk due to illiteracy, adult or elderly age, unemployment and lack of household water tank were confirmed by multivariate analysis and the influence of low family income for seropositivity by the spatial analysis."
20510469,0,a,"The increase in life expectancy (LE) observed in Western societies, has resulted in a steep rise of older population. This stresses the importance of the research on aging, to better adequate health and social care organization and improve the quality of life (QoL). The aim of the EPEPP-1 (abbreviated from the Portuguese name: Estudo do Perfil de Envelhecimento da Populacao Portuguesa) study was to characterize the socio-demographic components of the elderly Portuguese population in order to disclose factors that could play a role in the aging process and in the elderly QoL. This observational descriptive study, was performed in 2672 individuals older than 54 years taking into account gender and the residence area (rural vs. urban). A questionnaire about social network (marital status, living alone, the hours spent alone, confidents), and social status (education, occupation) was applied. Social network score revealed significant age and gender trends, women and older people performing worst, but with no difference according to residence area. Almost a third was unmarried and spent eight or more hours per day alone, and a fifth lived alone. Social status revealed that being older female and resident in a rural area quoted worst in the prevalence of illiteracy and undifferentiated occupation. The authors concluded that social isolation, illiteracy and undifferentiated occupation are prevalent in Portuguese older population. Identification of further determinants of isolation, adjustment of procedures to be included in social networks and development of actions directed to education are important fields of intervention influencing the elderly QoL."

If effective coverage of these services is to be achieved then it is suggested that greater emphasis should be placed upon outreach and realistic social marketing."
31297879,0,a,"AIMS: To understand the epidemiology, progression, and predictive factors of urinary incontinence (UI) in community-dwelling Mexican adults aged >/= 50 by sex and UI subtypes (stress, urge, and mixed). METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal UI data in community-dwelling adults aged >/= 50 (7783 women and 5843 men) for the 2012 to 2015 period of the Mexican Health and Aging Study. We estimated mixed, stress, and urgency incontinence prevalence (2012); 2-year cumulative incidence and remissions (2015); and progression (2012-2015). A multivariate analysis was undertaken to evaluate the predictive factors for UI and its subtypes by sex. RESULTS: The prevalence of UI was higher (27.7%) for women (average age 65.9 +/- 9.5) than 12.5% men (average age 67.4 +/- 9.3) and increased with age in both sexes (26.7% in women 50 to 59, to 48.5% in >/= 90; and 6.8% in men 50 to 59, to 26.2% >/= 90). The most frequent UI subtypes were mixed in women and urge in men. The cumulative incidence of UI was higher in women (22.9%) than men (12.3%) while its remission was higher in men than women. Predictive factors for UI in both sexes were depressive symptoms, a higher number of concomitant diseases and a history of falls; while advanced age was a factor only for men. CONCLUSIONS: UI is a common health problem and its prevalence and severity increase with age. Addressing modifiable risk factors such as depression and falls could decrease the prevalence and incidence of UI and its subtypes. Further studies should also focus on the relationship between mixed UI and male mortality."
30540843,0,a,"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor health outcomes, underlining the significance of early identification and intervention. Currently, there is no validated tool to screen for ACEs exposure in childhood. To fill this gap, we designed and implemented a pediatric ACEs questionnaire in an urban pediatric Primary Care Clinic. Questionnaire items were selected and modified based on literature review of existing childhood adversity tools. Children twelve years and under were screened via caregiver report, using the developed instrument. Cognitive interviews were conducted with caregivers, health providers, and clinic staff to assess item interpretation, clarity, and English/Spanish language equivalency. Using a rapid cycle assessment, information gained from the interviews were used to iteratively change the instrument. Additional questions assessed acceptability of screening within primary care and preferences around administration. Twenty-eight (28) caregivers were administered the questionnaire. Cognitive interviews conducted among caregivers and among 16 health providers and clinic staff resulted in the changes in wording and addition of examples in the items to increase face validity. In the final instrument, no new items were added; however, two items were merged and one item was split into three separate items. While there was a high level of acceptability of the overall questionnaire, some caregivers reported discomfort with the sexual abuse, separation from caregiver, and community violence items. Preference for methods of administration were split between tablet and paper formats. The final Pediatric ACE and other Determinants of Health Questionnaire is a 17-item instrument with high face validity and acceptability for use within primary care settings. Further evaluation on the reliability and construct validity of the instrument is being conducted prior to wide implementation in pediatric practice."
3975667,1,a,"Attitudes of medical students towards the psychosocial aspects of illness is of serious concern to medical educators. It is thought that medical students are overwhelmingly disease-oriented and not sufficiently sensitive to the role of the psychological, emotional, sociological and economic factors in the etiology and management of illness. In the present study the ATSIM (Attitudes Towards Social Issues in Medicine) was presented to third year medical students and compared with their responses obtained 2 years previously when they were first year students. The data suggest that third year medical students have positive attitudes towards certain psychosocial issues (the importance of social factors as determinants of health or illness, the role of preventive medicine in maintaining health, the role of physician-patient interactions in patient care). These attitudes were positive during the students' first year and have been maintained during the course of medical school. These finding are contrary to previous studies which indicate a deterioration in attitudes during the course of medical school."
26060783,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Prioritizing women's health helps achievement of the 4(th) and 5(th) goals of Millennium Development Program. This study aimed to investigate association between social determinants of health and women's health of reproductive age. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study, using multi-stage sampling procedure was conducted on 770, 15 to 49-year-old women residing in any one of the 22 municipality zones across Tehran, Iran. Eligible women were interviewed at home with SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey) and socio-demographic questionnaires. Social determinants of health contains; ethnicity, education, job, income, and crowding index. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Multiple Linear Regression using SPSS-16. The threshold of P.V was considered 0.05. RESULTS: Overall, 770 women with mean age 33.9+/-9.3 years were interviewed. Majority of them were married (72.27%), housewives (62.2%), of Persian ethnicity (64.3%), and educated to high school level (43.8%). Age with dimensions of health except role emotional, mental health, and social functioning had significant association with B from -0.65 to -0.16.educational level with dimensions of health except role emotional andsocial functioning had significant association with B from 3.61 to 6.43 (P<0.05). Income with dimensions of health except role physical had significant association with B from -9.97 to -4.42. CONCLUSION: Reflection of unfavorable economic conditions and low education level on negative women' health experiences are alarming. Interaction between social determinants of health and health status must be considered in policymaking, and there is a need for policies that would enhance health of women in the low education and income brackets."
4035721,1,a,"This article examines the impact of development and population policies on fertility decline and regional variations in India during the 1970s. Indicators of development at the household level include female literacy and education, infant mortality, and poverty; at the village level they include availability of such social services as schools, medical facilities, and transportation and communication facilities. Multiple regression analysis of data aggregated at the state level demonstrates that conditions conducive to fertility decline include high adult female literacy and low infant mortality as indicators of social development, and high contraceptive use and, to a lesser extent, high female age at marriage as proximate determinants of fertility. There are reasons to believe that India's national family planning program contributed to the decline in fertility observed since the 1960s. The pace of fertility decline in the future will depend upon the pace of infant mortality decline, enhancement in female education, and improvements in family planning programs."
2661131,1,a,"Epidemic diseases move in grand cycles, accompanying changes in culture, social organization, and environment. Coronary heart disease (CHD), a mass disease of twentieth century industrialized society, has a predominantly environmental aetiology. Although the major biomedical risk factors appear to have been identified over the past 40 years of epidemiological research, we are not certain why CHD is now on the wane in most Western nations. In Australia, CHD death rates have, since 1968, declined much more in professional and white-collar men than in blue-collar men. Any substantial reduction in CHD rates will require a generalized population shift towards a lower CHD risk profile. Numerically, the greatest gains should come from reducing the CHD risk of the bulk of the population, who are currently at medium risk of CHD. Notions of risk need, in the first instance, to be based on up-to-date knowledge of biomedical risk factors and mechanisms in order to develop optimal intervention strategies. A population-based strategy can be achieved via community education and structural modification of the social environment. The latter approach will require public health research into broader questions of the social-environmental influences on population cardiovascular health: for example, research into the social, political, and economic determinants of national food and nutrition policies; and into the various environmental (including workplace) changes that will facilitate risk-lowering behaviour. Hopefully, intervention strategies in such areas, set within a community development context, will be developed within the incipient National Program for Better Health.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
28446253,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The present research aimed to investigate the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention that included motivational interviewing (MI) and psychoeducation in improving medication adherence (MA) among patients with bipolar disorder (BD). METHOD: A multicenter, cluster randomized, observer-blind, controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted in ten academic centers in Iran. Patients with BD were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EXP; n = 136) or the usual care group (UC; n = 134). The EXP group received five sessions of MI and psychoeducation together with their family members. The primary outcome measure was changes in scores on the Medication Adherence Rating Scale from baseline to 6 months post-intervention. Other outcome measures included serum levels of mood stabilizers, clinical symptoms, quality of life, as well as measures of intention, beliefs about medicine, perceived behavioral control, automaticity, action and coping planning, and adverse reactions. RESULTS: Medication adherence improved over time in both groups, but patients in the EXP group improved more (baseline score: 6.03; score at the sixth month: 9.55) than patients in the UC group (baseline score: 6.17; score at the sixth month: 6.67). In addition, patients in the EXP group showed greater improvement than patients in the UC group in almost all secondary outcomes 6 months following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Multifaceted interventions that include motivational-interviewing and psychoeducation can significantly improve MA and clinical and functional outcomes in patients with BD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial was registered with theClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT02241863) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02241863."
2808474,1,a,"The seasonality of births in the period 1871-1977 is studied in a rural north-western Spanish population. Based on a total sample of 11,695 birth registrations, temporal variation is analysed. For siblings, according to family reconstitution, the total family size, the legitimacy of the child, and birth order are considered. A coefficient of birth month dispersion is defined and estimated for each family. Intra-family variation is related to inter-family coefficients in order to determine whether the local seasonal pattern of births may be partly explained by family characteristics."
12282631,1,a,"This paper reviews recent new trends in population structure in the world and its major regions in order to access the determinants of those trends and explore issues regarding the recent and projected changes in the age structure of population and the relationships of those changes to social and economic development. In particular, the paper compares the change in age structure projected by the Population Division of the UN Secretariat in its most recent 3 series--namely, those completed in 1984, 1986, and 1988. By and large, the most recent UN assessment projects that a larger proportion of the world population will be aged 60 and over in 2000 and 2025 than was previously estimated. Those changes in projections can be observed for the world and for the more developed countries as a whole, and for the regions of Africa, Latin America, Northern America, East Asia, Europe, and Oceania. While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries."
7208724,1,a,"A population of professional dance (N = 183) and modelling (N = 56) students, who by career choice must focus increased attention and control over their body shapes, was studied. Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. The influence of socio-cultural determinants are discussed within the context of anorexia nervosa as a multidetermined disorder."
29619391,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Dynamic and static activities in dentistry cause musculoskeletal disorders, but dental students do not have sufficient awareness about the effects of ergonomic factors on their health. The aim of this study was to investigate ergonomic factors that cause pain muscle in dental students in Kerman Medical University, Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis study was carried out on dental students of the 3(rd), 4(th), 5(th), and 6(th) year, in clinical practice in the School of Dentistry, Kerman University of Medical Sciences. A convenient sample of 199 students who met the inclusion criteria was selected and those willing to participate signed an informed consent form. Data were collected by means of a structured questionnaire for ergonomic factors and the presence of pain. The variables evaluated were pain, affected zones, gender, postures, and work environment. RESULTS: The present research work reveals that over 69% of the dental students complained of pain in at least one part of their body. Most individuals suffered from hand and elbow (23%) and head (19%) pain. The clinical areas where more pain was found were endodontics and pedodontics. Furthermore, it was found that a high percentage of students usually worked with their legs slightly separated, with the sole of the feet resting on the stool when working. The presence of muscular pain was higher in males in this study. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant relationship with the final Rapid Entire Body Assessment score in different body parts and the participants' demographic data (sex, age, weight, height, sports, and smoking). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the students' sitting positions and working environments need to be improved and it seems more training is necessary in this field."
30740179,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is one of the most important self-care approaches to controlling complications of type 2 diabetes. According to Bandura's social theory, factors such as social support are effective factors in the incidence of the behaviour. AIM: This study aims to determine the level of physical activity, social support and their determinants. METHODS: This descriptive study was performed on 250 patients with type 2 diabetes by Cluster-Random Sampling method in Rafsanjan City. Data were collected using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Social Support Questionnaire for Sport, that their validity and reliability were confirmed. The results were analysed by t-test, ANOVA and logistic regression. RESULTS: This study showed that 46.8% of the patients were in the inactive group. Social support score for exercise was low in this group. The results indicated that social support and gender are predictors of physical activity, and with an increase in the social support score, the odds of having minimal physical activity increased 1.17 fold (OR = 1.167) and men were 4.18 times more likely to have minimal physical activity (OR = 4.183). CONCLUSION: Considering the low level of physical activity and social support in diabetic patients, and the effect of social support on the prediction of physical activity, interventions are recommended to increase social support in this group."
30603742,0,a,"Objective: To examine obesity and diabetes associations with United States hospital use and healthcare costs for African American women, to explore the relationship between co-morbidities of interest (obesity and diabetes) and hospital resources [length of stay (LOS) and costs]. Methods: A retrospective, correlation, quantitative analysis for lengths of hospital stay and cost among adult African American women categorized according to their weight status with type 2 diabetes. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data which contains the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used. Focused on 803,163 African American, female inpatients between the ages of 21 and 55 in the United States from 2008 to 2010. Researcher explored the relationship between individual health factors of interest (obesity and diabetes) and the effects on hospital LOS and healthcare costs. All statistical analysis will be performed using Stata v12. All inferential tests will be two-sided and will utilize a 95% significance level. Two separate multiple regressions will be used. Results: A total of 758,874 records were retained for analysis. The patients in the weighted population ranged in age from 21 to 55 years. The patient LOS ranged from 0 to 333 days. The patients had approximately 2 procedures on average, and presented with approximately 3 chronic conditions on average. The total charges (Cost) ranged from 106 to over 1 million US dollars. The size and direction of the relationship between LOS, healthcare costs and the independent variables of diabetes and obesity suggests that both LOS and health care cost decreased for African American female patients with diabetes or obesity. There is a statistically significant relationship between at least one of the individual health factors of interest (obesity and diabetes) and hospital LOS (F = 13,394.00, P < 0.0005, R (2) = 0.440) and hospital costs (F = 10,171.23, P < 0.0005, R (2) = 0.502). Conclusions: There is evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in health care quality in hospital treatment of African American patients. After accounting for social determinants and insurance statuses, African Americans may receive lower-quality care than the population at large. African Americans are admitted to the hospital, but services and LOS are shorter than the general population partially due to disparities in evaluating and offering treatment."
6684973,1,a,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts."
30611219,0,a,"BACKGROUND: HIV testing and counselling (HTC) is an essential component for HIV prevention and a critical entry point into the HIV continuum of care and treatment. Despite the importance of HTC for HIV control, access to HTC services among female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains suboptimal and little is known about factors influencing FSWs' access to HTC. Guided by the client-centred conceptual framework, we conducted a systematic review to understand the facilitators and barriers influencing FSWs in SSA to access HTC services. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, POPLINE and Web of Science databases for literature published between January 2000 and July 2017. References of relevant articles were also searched. We included primary studies of any design, conducted in SSA and published in the English language. Studies conducted in multi-sites inclusive of SSA were included only if data from sites in SSA were separately analysed and reported. Similarly, studies that included other subpopulations were only eligible if a separate analysis was done for FSWs. This review excluded papers published as systematic reviews, editorial comments and mathematical modelling. The protocol for this review is registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42017062203. RESULTS: This review shows that factors related to approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness of the services are crucial in influencing access to HTC services among FSWs in SSA. These factors were mediated by individual attributes such as HIV risk perceptions, awareness of the availability of HTC, and perceptions of the importance and quality of HTC services. The decision to utilise HTC was predominantly hampered by discriminatory social norms such as HIV stigma and criminalisation of sex work. CONCLUSIONS: FSWs' access to HTC is facilitated by multiple factors, including individual awareness of the availability of HTC services, and perceived quality of HTC especially with regard to assured confidentiality. Concerns about HIV stigma and fear about discrimination due to community intolerance of sex work acted as major barriers for FSWs to seek HTC services from the facilities offering health services to the general population."
3232413,1,a,"With the aging of populations in developing countries there is both a demographic and an epidemiological transition which affects the impact of chronic degenerative diseases on the health status of the populations. Demographic transition takes place in countries where there are effective programmes of disease control which allow for survival during the early years of childhood and adolescence. This results in an increase in life expectancy which places larger proportions of the population in the age range (60 years and older) in which chronic degenerative diseases become the major determinants of health status. Epidemiological transition in diseases may also be brought about by shifts in social and economic patterns which favour detrimental changes in risk factors for the chronic degenerative diseases. Such changes may include health-related behaviour which augments dietary consumption of fats and alcohol, increases obesity, increases smoking and decreases physical activity. Such changes in risk-factor levels increase the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases which manifest themselves at later ages, and for which early preventive actions could be cost-effective. In order to illustrate the impact of both demographic and risk-factor effects, analyses are made of the impact of increases in life expectancy on cause-specific mortality in both developing and developed countries. It is shown that there is great similarity in the effect of major noncommunicable diseases on the life expectancy of adults in both developed and developing countries. The major differences are seen to be in the proportions of deaths expected from such diseases as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cirrhosis; but not in the distribution of age at death which is the better measure of disease impact. Demographic analyses, computing indirect estimates of mortality, also demonstrate that there are currently more chronic disease deaths in developing than developed countries and that as expectation of life increases in developing countries the global chronic disease burden will be greatly concentrated in the developing countries. Analyses of risk-factor reduction by feasible intervention strategies, e.g. smoking cessation campaigns, treatment of high blood pressure, using relationships between risk factors and diseases established in longitudinal studies carried out in developed countries, point out that the effect of risk-factor control in long-living populations can be hidden by the dependency of risk factors and various related causes of death, e.g. smoking has an impact on lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, but at different ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
23452410,0,a,"BACKGROUND: African, Caribbean and other Black (ACB) people are a priority group for HIV prevention in Canada, but little is known about the epidemiology of HIV risk in this population. This paper helps fill the knowledge gap by: presenting service providers' and ACB people's perceptions about HIV risk in ACB populations; describing the distribution of HIV risk behaviours among ACB people according to markers of social status and position; and comparing results from these two analyses. METHODS: The Black, African and Caribbean Canadian Health (BLACCH) Study is a mixed methods study that used semi-structured interviews and a cross-sectional quantitative questionnaire to collect information about HIV and health from 188 ACB people in London, Ontario, Canada. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify interview themes, and weighted bivariate statistical analyses were performed on the quantitative data. Behaviours related to HIV risk were stratified by sex, poverty status, immigration experience and employment status. RESULTS: Community members perceived that they were at low risk for HIV and mainly focused on sexual risks. They called for more information about HIV in Canada and culturally appropriate HIV services. Service providers cited marital infidelity and cultural and religious attitudes about condoms as barriers to women protecting themselves. They mentioned cultural norms, beliefs about masculinity and underrepresentation of heterosexual ACB men at AIDS service organizations as barriers to men protecting themselves. There were few statistically significant differences in risk behaviours reported by men and women. Those living in poverty were more likely to abstain from sex (p = 0.006) and use condoms (p = 0.027) in the past year. Those living in Canada longer reported higher prevalences of forced sex (p < 0.001), mixing alcohol or drugs with sex (p = 0.001) and past STI diagnoses (p = 0.032). Stable employment was associated with higher prevalences of not using condoms in the past year (p = 0.005) and past STI diagnoses (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that perceptions about ACB people's HIV risk differ from actual risk, and those with higher social standing might be at greater risk. Furthermore, the social determinants of health are important factors in the epidemiology of HIV among ACB people."
29286227,0,a,"Introduction: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women throughout world, with incidence rates increasing in India. Improved survival in breast cancer patients has resulted in their quality of life (QOL) becoming an important issue. Identifying determinants for QOL may provide insights into how to improve their living conditions. This study aimed to assess socio-demographic and clinical factors, as well as the role of self-efficacy, in relation to QOL among women with breast cancer in rural India. Methods: A total of 208 female patients with infiltrating carcinoma of the breast participated in the study. A questionnaire was administered that included sections for socio-demographic characteristics, clinical stage of the cancer and patient delay in seeking health care. A standardized instrument to measure self-efficacy was applied. To assess QOL, the WHOQOL - BREF instrument was used. Results: The overall mean score for QOL was 59.3. For domain 1 (physical health) the mean score across all groups was 55.5, for psychological health 58.2, for social relationships 63.2 and for environmental factors, 60.4. The environmental domain in QOL was negatively associated with lower education. Being divorced/widowed/unmarried had a negative association with the psychological health and social relationship dimensions, whereas higher income was positively associated with QOL parameters such as psychology, social relationships and environmental factors. Self-efficacy was positively associated with all four domains of QOL. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated a moderate QOL in women with breast cancer in rural India. Young age, lack of education and being without a partner were negatively related to QOL, and employment as casual and industrial workers, high monthly family income and higher self-efficacy were positively associated with QOL. A comprehensive public health initiative is required, including social, financial and environmental support, that can provide better QOL for breast cancer survivors."
7239734,1,a,"Recent studies of job satisfaction, working conditions, and changes in the content of work indicate that problems of low productivity and dissatisfaction may be related to changes in the organization of work which have reduced the amount of autonomy and control which workers have over the labor process. At the same time, elements in the labor movement, which has traditionally focused almost exclusively on obtaining higher wages and greater benefits for union members, now seem to be directing their attention to issues of workplace democracy and worker control over the production process and company policies. The research reported here investigates the determinants of worker autonomy and of workers' desire for increased worker control over the workplace. This article describes what are viewed as the main hypotheses suggested by earlier research and reports the findings and new hypotheses derived from a preliminary analysis of data from the ISR National 1977 Quality of Employment Survey and pilot in-depth interviews with sixteen Baltimore workers."

28514037,1,a,"Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084)."
24778781,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The health of elderly population in the world has been an important issue in recent century and the use of appropriate or inappropriate medications is challenging among them. The purpose of this study was to assess the pattern of medication in elderly population in Amirkola, northern of Iran. METHODS: This study was conducted on 1534 elderly subjects who participated in Amirkola Health and Ageing Project (AHAP) in 2013. The number of drugs that was used regardless of their indication in terms of age, level of education, disease, cognitive or depression and social support were recorded and compared in both sexes. RESULTS: The mean number of drugs used in men and women was 2.1+/-2.45 and 3.59+/-2.75, respectively (P=0.000). Concurrent use of > 4 drugs was seen in 16.5% of men and in 35.12% of women (P=0.000). The difference for using the number of drugs was significant between sexes with low educational level, but was similar in educated individuals. The use of polypharmacy was associated with the number of concurrent diseases (r=0.58, P=000), cognitive status (r=0.065, P=0.012), social support (r=-0.1, P=0.008), and depression (r=0.273, P=0.000). CONCLUSION: The results show that the use of polypharmacy in the elderly population in Amirkola is relatively high and they need to be educated. Considering the other indices, this problem highly manifested more in the elderly women."
23626407,0,a,"The research on the determinants of mental health among refugees has been largely limited to traumatic events, but recent work has indicated that the daily hassles of living in refugee camps also play a large role. Using hierarchical linear modelling to account for refugees nested within camp blocks, this exploratory study attempted to model stress surrounding safety and acquiring basic needs and functional impairment among refugees from Darfur living in Chad, using individual-level demographics (e.g., gender, age, presence of a debilitating injury), structural factors (e.g., distance from block to distribution centre), and social ecological variables (e.g., percentage of single women within a block). We found that stress concerning safety concerns, daily hassles, and functional impairment were associated with several individual-level demographic factors (e.g., gender), but also with interactions between block-level and individual-level factors as well (e.g., injury and distance to distribution centre). Findings are discussed in terms of monitoring and evaluation of refugee services."
3669072,1,a,"This study employed multivariate analyses and structural modeling procedures to examine a model for the determinants of adherence to medical regimens. Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction."

Social Return on Investment is an evaluation framework that explores all aspects of change and expresses these in comparable terms. It combines qualitative narratives and quantitative measurements with a financial approach to enable outcomes that can otherwise be overlooked or undervalued to be incorporated appropriately.

24956548,0,a,"The social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work, and age and the systems put in place to deal with illness. These circumstances, in turn, are shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics. Reproductive health indicators and conditions that are germane to obstetricians and gynecologists vary across states and regions in the United States as well as within regions and states. The aim of this article is to illustrate this variation with the use of examples of gynecologic malignancies, sexually transmitted infections, teen birth rates, preterm birth rates, and infant mortality rates. Using the example of infant death, the difficulties in ""unpacking"" the construct of place will be discussed, and a special emphasis is placed on the interaction of race, place, and disparities in shaping perinatal outcomes. Finally, readily available and easy-to-use online data resources will be provided so that obstetricians and gynecologists will be able to assess geographic variation in health indicators and outcomes in their own localities."

30670400,0,a,"As a result of a large and compelling body of evidence documenting the impacts of social determinants, such as income and education, on health outcomes, health care systems are beginning to incorporate social and economic risk data into health care delivery decisions. But there is a risk that some of these efforts could worsen health and widen health inequities. We highlight 3 examples- including recent policy changes in Medicaid, social needs, informed risk prediction models, and advances in precision medicine-where the inclusion of social risk information threatens to reduce care quality or health care access for some groups of patients. A new dialog is needed about both the opportunities and potential consequences of bringing information about patients' social circumstances into a market-based health care system."
3292101,1,a,"Drugs ingested by a lactating mother would be expected to appear in human milk to some extent and be ingested by a breast-feeding infant. Drugs pass from maternal plasma into milk by passive diffusion and are distributed within the aqueous, protein and lipid phases of milk. Distribution into milk will be affected by physiochemical characteristics of the drug: acid-base characteristics, relative protein binding in plasma and milk, and lipid solubility, as well as milk composition. The milk-to-plasma concentration ratio is the most commonly quoted index of drug distribution into human milk. However, calculation of the daily infant dose of drug ingested in milk, and from this the dose in milk relative to the maternal dose on a weight-adjusted basis, is a more relevant indicator of infant exposure to a drug. This is particularly true for drugs with a high volume of distribution, for which only a small proportion of the mother's dose is contained within the plasma and available for distribution into milk. A better indication of infant exposure to a drug is the steady-state plasma drug concentration in a breast-feeding infant, the major determinants of which are the dose rate (via milk) and the oral availability and clearance in the infant. Although in neonates the rate of absorption may be different from adults, there is little evidence that its extent is significantly different. Clearance, however, is impaired in very young infants, particularly if premature. The decreased clearance would result in a proportional increase in steady-state plasma concentrations in the breast-feeding infant. Consideration of the dose ingested in milk and the approximate clearance in infants of different ages allows estimation of likely steady-state plasma concentrations in breast-feeding infants. From these considerations, recommendations regarding the safety of drugs during breast-feeding can be made. Drugs which are very toxic or have dose-independent toxicity should be considered separately. Recommendations regarding 'social' drugs such as nicotine, alcohol, caffeine and theobromine are particularly difficult, as doses are uncontrolled and vary variable."
24820057,0,a,"AIM: This study aimed to explore the early clinical experience of medical students following the adaptation of an Early Patient Contact curriculum from a European culture in Ireland to an Arab culture in Bahrain. METHODS: Medical students in Bahrain took part in an Early Patient Contact module modelled on a similar module from a partner medical school in Ireland. We used a qualitative approach employing thematic analysis of 54 student reflective logbooks. Particular attention was placed on reflections of cultural influences of experience in the course. RESULTS: Medical students undergoing this module received reported documented benefits of early clinical experience. However, students in Bahrain were exposed to cultural norms of the local Arab society including gender values, visiting the homes of strangers, language barriers and generous hospitality that led to additional challenges and learning for the medical students in acculturating to norms of the medical profession. CONCLUSION: Modules intended for curriculum adaptation between two cultures would be best served by a group of ""core"" learning outcomes with ""secondary"" outcomes culturally appropriate to each site. Within the context of the Arab culture, early clinical experience has the added benefit of allowing students to learn about both local and professional cultural norms, thereby facilitating integration of these two cultures."
2738616,1,a,"Studies of determinants of longevity in the elderly by means of a follow-up study are usually based on samples with a wide age range and some selectivity. This poses the problem of constructing a measure of longevity that: (1) will make subjects in the sample comparable regarding survival time, independent of their age and sex; (2) is suitable for long-term follow-up studies; (3) can be used to check the absence or presence of selectivity of the sample with regard to longevity; (4) improves the comparability of studies with different designs and sampling schemes; (5) can take the mortality development over time into account. An individual measure of survival time is presented that satisfies these requirements: the realized probability of dying (RPD). Its construction is described. The RPD is derived from population life tables based on age, year of birth, and sex. For each subject, the relative position on the survival curve within the birth cohort is determined. In an illustration, the RPD is applied to data from a 28-year follow-up study of the elderly in the Netherlands. A comparison is made with other survival measures commonly used in this type of study. It is concluded that the RPD is a powerful and valid measure of longevity in elderly subjects, and that it can be useful in the study of determinants of longevity."
29973244,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Inequities in maternal health services utilization constitute a major challenge in maternal mortality reduction in Ethiopia. We sought to assess magnitude, trends, and determinants of inequities in maternal health services utilization in Ethiopia from 2000 to 2016. METHODS: The study utilized data from the 2000 and 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys, which were done based on a cross sectional survey design. The wealth-related inequities were assessed by concentration curve and horizontal inequity indices. Trends in inequities were assessed by comparing the concentration indices of maternal health services utilization variables between the 2000 and 2016 surveys using Wagstaff two groups concentration indices comparison method. Finally, the inequities were decomposed into its contributing factors using Wagstaff method of analysis. RESULTS: Wealth-related inequities were significantly high in 2016: with horizontal inequities indices and residual regression error of antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care service utilization (- 0.09 and - 0.01), (- 0.06 and 0.01), and (- 0.11 and 0.0001), respectively. These indices increased significantly in 2016 when it is compared with the 2000 indices' with the respective concentration indices difference of - 0.05, 0.05, and - 0.07. The related all p-values were < 0.0001. The main determinants of inequities were low-economic status, illiteracy, rural residence, no occupation, and fewer accesses to mass media. CONCLUSIONS: In Ethiopia, maternal health services utilization inequities were significantly high and increased in 2016 compared to 2000. Women who are poor, rural resident, uneducated, unemployed, and fewer mass media exposed are the most disadvantaged. Targeting maternal health interventions for the underserved women is essential to reduce maternal mortality in the country."
3752917,1,a,"It is suggested that the observed difference in duration of pregnancy between Blacks and Whites is partly physiological since it is not entirely explained by social inequities alone. This study compares women with well-defined gestational periods seeking attention at the Antoine Beclere Maternity Clinic. Group A consists of French women of European ancestry, Group B, those born in the French Antilles of mixed ancestry, and Group C black African women with insignificant European admixture. When compared to Group A, within each socio-economic class, group B and C have shorter gestational periods. These differences persist after adjustment for socio-economic variables, so that other explanations should be considered, specifically genetic determinants."
17093748,1,a,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting."
24179279,0,a,"In Alameda County, California, significant health inequities by race/ethnicity, income, and place persist. Many of the county's low-income residents and residents of color live in communities that have faced historical and current disinvestment through public policies. This disinvestment affects community conditions such as access to economic opportunities, well-maintained and affordable housing, high-quality schools, healthy food, safe parks, and clean water and air. These community conditions greatly affect health. At the invitation of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies' national Place Matters initiative, Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson's Office and the Alameda County Public Health Department launched Alameda County Place Matters, an initiative that addresses community conditions through local policy change. We describe the initiative's creation, activities, policy successes, and best practices."
25212478,0,a,"The PATHS Data Resource is a unique database comprising data that follow individuals from the prenatal period to adulthood. The PATHS Resource was developed for conducting longitudinal epidemiological research into child health and health equity. It contains individual-level data on health, socioeconomic status, social services and education. Individuals' data are linkable across these domains, allowing researchers to follow children through childhood and across a variety of sectors. PATHS includes nearly all individuals that were born between 1984 and 2012 and registered with Manitoba's universal health insurance programme at some point during childhood. All PATHS data are anonymized. Key concepts, definitions and algorithms necessary to work with the PATHS Resource are freely accessible online and an interactive forum is available to new researchers working with these data. The PATHS Resource is one of the richest and most complete databases assembled for conducting longitudinal epidemiological research, incorporating many variables that address the social determinants of health and health equity. Interested researchers are encouraged to contact [mchp_access@cpe.umanitoba.ca] to obtain access to PATHS to use in their own programmes of research."
6338092,1,a,"Studies in age-related cognitive changes do not necessarily take into account the clinical and social phenomena associated with age that may have more effect on cognition than does psychologic senescence. Clinically inapparent biologic deterioration, drugs, mild dementia, and atypically presenting depression may influence cognition. Selection bias may skew the results of studies on the elderly when control groups are made up of undergraduates or of ""normal"" elderly whose normality is taken for granted rather than verified. The epiphenomena of aging, such as retirement, social isolation, and bereavement, which are not inherent in the aging process, influence cognition, as do labeling and learned helplessness. Laboratory-based tests of cognition may not sufficiently resemble real-life conditions to have validity. Future research will be shaped by how we conceptualize the relation between aging and intellectual function."
30903758,0,a,"Background The present study was conducted with the aim of investigating the prevalence of potentially beneficial and harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in intensive care units (ICUs). Methods The present cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in two ICUs in Shahr-e Kord city, Iran. The study sample was consisted of 300 patients. The Drug Interaction Facts reference text book [Tatro DS. Drug interaction facts. St Louis, MO: Walters Kluwer Health, 2010.] was used to determine the type and the frequency of the DDIs. Results The participants consisted of 189 patients men and 111 women. The mean age of patients was 44.2 +/- 24.6 years. Totally, 60.5% of patients had at least one drug-drug interaction in their profile. The total number of DDIs found was 663 (the mean of the total number of drug-drug interactions was 2.4 interactions per patient). Of all the 663 interactions, 574 were harmful and others were beneficial. In terms of starting time, 98 of the potential interactions were rapid and 565 of them were delayed. In terms of severity, 511 of the potential interactions were moderate. Some of the drugs in the patients' medical records including phenytoin, dopamine, ranitidine, corticosteroid, dopamine, heparin, midazolam, aspirin, magnesium, calcium gluconate, and antibiotics, the type of ventilation, the type of nutrition and the duration of hospital stay were among the factors that were associated with high risk of potential DDIs (p < 0.05). Conclusions The prevalence of potentially beneficial and harmful DDIs, especially harmful drug-drug interactions, is high in ICUs and it is necessary to reduce these interactions by implementing appropriate programs and interventions."
26300823,0,a,"Recent studies in late adolescents (age 17+) show that brain development may proceed till around the 25th year of age. This implies that study performance in higher education could be dependent upon the stage of brain maturation and neuropsychological development. Individual differences in development of neuropsychological skills may thus have a substantial influence on the outcome of the educational process. This hypothesis was evaluated in a large survey of 1760 first-year students at a University of Applied Sciences, of which 1332 are included in the current analyses. This was because of their fit within the age range we pre-set (17-20 years' old at start of studies). Student characteristics and three behavioral ratings of executive functioning (EF) were evaluated with regard to their influence on academic performance. Self-report measures were used: self-reported attention, planning, and self-control and self-monitoring. Results showed that students with better self-reported EF at the start of the first year of their studies obtained more study credits at the end of that year than students with a lower EF self-rating. The correlation between self-control and self-monitoring on the one hand, and study progress on the other, appeared to differ for male and female students and to be influenced by the level of prior education. The results of this large-scale study could have practical relevance. The profound individual differences between students may at least partly be a consequence of their stage of development as an adolescent. Students who show lower levels of attention control, planning, and self-control/self-monitoring can be expected to have a problem in study planning and study progress monitoring and hence study progress. The findings imply that interventions directed at the training of these (executive) functions should be developed and used in higher education in order to improve academic achievement, learning attitude, and motivation."
27345712,0,a,"Community health workers (CHWs) affiliated with community-based organisations are central to the implementation of primary health care in district health services in South Africa. Here, we explore factors that affect the provision of and access to care in two provinces - Gauteng and Eastern Cape. Drawing on narratives of care recipients and the CHWs who support them, we illustrate the complex issues surrounding health maintenance and primary care outreach in poor communities, and describe how the intimate interactions between providers and recipients work to build trust. In the study we report here, householders in Gauteng Province had poor access to health care and other services, complicating the impoverished circumstances of their everyday lives. The limited resources available to CHWs hindered their ability to meet householders' needs and for householders to benefit from existing services. CHWs in the Eastern Cape were better able to address the needs of poor householders because of the organisational support available to them. Based on an ethos of integrated and holistic care, this enabled the CHWs to address the recipients' context-related needs, and health and medical needs, while building greater levels of trust with their clients."
6285155,1,a,"In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients."
26022369,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Knowledge and effective interventions exist to address many current global health inequities. However, there is limited awareness, uptake, and use of knowledge to inform action to improve the health of disadvantaged populations. The gap between knowledge and action to improve health equity is of concern to health researchers and practitioners. This study identifies and critically examines the usefulness of existing knowledge to action models or frameworks for promoting health equity. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of existing literature to identify knowledge to action (KTA) models or frameworks and critiqued the models using a health equity support rubric. RESULTS: We identified forty-eight knowledge to action models or frameworks. Six models scored between eight and ten of a maximum 12 points on the health equity support rubric. These high scoring models or frameworks all mentioned equity-related concepts. Attention to multisectoral approaches was the factor most often lacking in the low scoring models. The concepts of knowledge brokering, integrative processes, such as those in some indigenous health research, and Ecohealth applied to KTA all emerged as promising areas. CONCLUSIONS: Existing knowledge to action models or frameworks can help guide knowledge translation to support action on the social determinants of health and health equity. There is a need to further test existing models or frameworks. This process should be informed by participatory and integrative research. There is room to develop more robust equity supporting models."
29932219,0,a,"Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Epidemiological studies using high-sensitivity assays for serum C-reactive protein have shown a consistent association between cardiovascular disease risk and serum C-reactive protein concentrations. C-reactive protein is a biomarker for inflammation, and has been established in clinical practice as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease events. There is evidence that serum C-reactive protein is an excellent biomarker of cardiovascular disease and is also an independent and strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events. Further characterization of the impact and influence of lifestyle exposures and genetic variation on the C-reactive protein response to cardiovascular disease events may have implications for the therapeutic approaches to reduce cardiovascular disease events. This review summarizes the studies that have examined the association between serum C-reactive protein and the risk of cardiovascular disease. We also discuss the impact of independent factors and C-reactive protein genetic polymorphisms on baseline plasma C-reactive protein levels."
31460576,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers around the world. One of the factors involved in the development of colorectal cancer is the changes in the normal flora of the intestine. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the mean copy number of Enterococcus faecalis in people with polyps and people with colorectal cancer has been evaluated in comparison with healthy controls. METHODS: In this study, 25 patients with colorectal cancer and 28 patients with intestinal polyps were selected and stool specimens were taken. In addition, 24 healthy individuals were selected as control group. Extraction of bacterial DNA from the stool sample were performed. The molecular methods of PCR for confirmation of standard strain and absolute Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) method were used to evaluate the number of Enterococcus faecalis in the studied groups. RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that the mean copy number of Enterococcus faecalis in patients with colorectal cancer was 11.2x109 per gram of stool, and in patients with polyps was 9.4x108 per gram of stool. In healthy people, this number was 9x108 per gram of stool. There was a significant difference between the implicit copy numbers in the three groups. (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Enterococcus faecalis in faecal flora of people with colorectal cancer was significantly higher than those with polyps and healthy people. This could potentially signify the ability of this bacterium to induce colorectal cancer. More studies are needed to prove this theory."
21885727,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The burden of disease in children with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis is unknown. Our study aimed to identify the determinants of quality of life (QOL) and parental mental health in this group of patients and their parents and to evaluate the effect of exacerbations on these parameters. METHODS: Parents of 69 children (median age 7 years) with non-CF bronchiectasis prospectively completed two questionnaires (parent-proxy cough-specific quality of life [PC-QOL] and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale [DASS]) at stable and exacerbation states. Data on clinical, investigational, and lung function parameters were also collected. RESULTS: During the stable state, the median interquartile range (IQR) PC-QOL score was 6.5 (5.3-6.9) and the DASS 21-item questionnaire score was 6 (0-20). Being of a young age correlated with a worse QOL (r(5) = 0.242, P = .04) but radiologic extent, lung function, underlying cause, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and chronic upper-airway disease did not influence these scores. Exacerbations caused significant worsening in the PC-QOL scores (median [IQR], 4.6 [3.8-5.4]; P = .001) and DASS scores (median [IQR], 22 [9-42]; P < .001; 38% with elevated anxiety, 54% with abnormal depression/stress scores during exacerbation). The presence of viral infection, hypoxia, and hospitalization did not influence the exacerbation PC-QOL and DASS scores. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant burden of disease, especially during exacerbation, on parents of children with bronchiectasis. Prevention, early detection, and appropriate treatment of exacerbations are likely to reduce psychologic morbidity in this group."
6419709,1,a,"This double-blind, controlled study of XYY and XXY men found in a birth cohort of 4,591 tall men born in Copenhagen assessed evidence of delinquent and aggressive behavior and explored the role of hormonal determinants in the behavioral and psychological differences noted among groups. Information from social records, a structured psychological interview, and projective tests did not support the notion that men with sex chromosome anomalies are particularly violent or aggressive. Hormonally, XYY men had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than matched control groups. In contrast, XXY men had higher levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin, but low concentrations of testosterone. There was a significantly positive relation among all subjects as well as XY controls alone between plasma testosterone level and evidence of criminal convictions. A proportionate increase in testosterone levels was noted when subjects were divided into nondelinquents, delinquents without violent convictions, and delinquents with violent convictions. The relation between testosterone level and criminal behavior was not reflected in measures of aggression derived from the psychological interview and projective tests. There was no specific evidence that testosterone is a mediating factor in the criminal behavior of XYY men."
6501638,1,a,"This study was concerned with the determinants of adults' beliefs in the economic socialization of children through the use of pocket money (allowances). Over 200 adults completed a questionnaire on their beliefs concerning, for instance, how much and how often children should be given pocket money, as well as such things as whether they should be encouraged to work for it, save it, etc. The independent variables included the subjects' age, sex, education, voting pattern, religion, occupation and whether or not they were parents. The results showed that whereas there were few age or sex differences, the socio-economic class of the adults, and the fact that they did or did not have children did discriminate between the responses of the subjects. Findings were discussed in terms of the literature of economic socialization."
24627748,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) on antiretroviral therapy has appreciably increased. However, psychosocial challenges pose a great threat to their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The aim of this study was to determine psychosocial factors influencing health-related quality of life of PLHA on antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling to select 226 PLHA at District hospital. Demographic information was collected using a semistructured questionnaire. HRQOL was assessed using WHOQOL-HIV Bref. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, CAGE scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were used. One-way ANOVA was applied. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in mean quality of life score with respect to level of anxiety in the physical (P < 0.001), psychological (P < 0.001), level of independence (P < 0.001), social relationships (P = 0.047), environment (P < 0.001), and spirituality domain (P < 0.001). Significant difference in mean quality of life score was observed with respect to level of depression in physical (P = 0.003), psychological (P = 0.036), level of independence (P = 0.017), social relationships (P = 0.019), and spirituality (P = 0.001). Friend support was positively associated with HRQOL in physical (P < 0.001), psychological (P < 0.001), level of independence (P = 0.013), social relationships (P < 0.001), environment (0.001), and spirituality domain (0.026). Family support was positively associated with HRQOL in physical (P = 0.001), psychological (P = 0.001), level of independence (P = 0.040), social relationships (P = 0.008), environment (0.001), and spirituality domain (0.026). A significant difference was observed with respect to affiliation to social organization in social relationships domain (P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial challenges including anxiety, depression, and social support impact upon all domains of HRQOL of PLHA."
3407490,1,a,"The influence of parental factors on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use has been examined previously, and findings have been contradictory. Previous studies, which found little relationship between parental norms and adolescent sexual activity, have been limited by their failure to recognize developmental differences in the relative weight of parent and peer influences between younger and older teens and by use of selected samples, resulting in a restriction of range. The current study differs in that it utilizes a clustered sample household survey of 329 males and females, aged 14 to 17, and 470 of their parents. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that parents' reported behavioral norms account for 5% of the variance in whether adolescents have had intercourse, and for 33% of the variance in use of contraception at last intercourse. The study suggests that while parents' normative beliefs have limited effect in the decision to become sexually active, they have considerable impact on later contraceptive use."
28086971,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is wide agreement that there is a lack of attention to health in municipal environmental policy-making, such as urban planning and regeneration. Explanations for this include differing professional norms between health and urban environment professionals, system complexity and limited evidence for causality between attributes of the built environment and health outcomes. Data from urban health indicator (UHI) tools are potentially a valuable form of evidence for local government policy and decision-makers. Although many UHI tools have been specifically developed to inform policy, there is poor understanding of how they are used. This study aims to identify the nature and characteristics of UHI tools and their use by municipal built environment policy and decision-makers. METHODS: Health and social sciences databases (ASSIA, Campbell Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, Social Policy and Practice and Web of Science Core Collection) will be searched for studies using UHI tools alongside hand-searching of key journals and citation searches of included studies. Advanced searches of practitioner websites and Google will also be used to find grey literature. Search results will be screened for UHI tools, and for studies which report on or evaluate the use of such tools. Data about UHI tools will be extracted to compile a census and taxonomy of existing tools based on their specific characteristics and purpose. In addition, qualitative and quantitative studies about the use of these tools will be appraised using quality appraisal tools produced by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and synthesised in order to gain insight into the perceptions, value and use of UHI tools in the municipal built environment policy and decision-making process. This review is not registered with PROSPERO. DISCUSSION: This systematic review focuses specifically on UHI tools that assess the physical environment's impact on health (such as transport, housing, air quality and greenspace). This study will help indicator producers understand whether this form of evidence is of value to built environment policy and decision-makers and how such tools should be tailored for this audience.

2928145,1,a,"Reward allocation in selected American universities was investigated using tenure receipt as the most valuable faculty reward. Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review."
2529668,1,a,"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers."
2943159,1,a,"The maladaptive behavior of 474 persons from a residential facility for mentally retarded individuals was investigated. Eleven independent variables pertaining to demographic and environmental characteristics were initially related to the frequency and topography of residents' maladaptive behavior. Multiple regression analysis revealed that maladaptive behaviors were related to sex, social age, chronological age, resident's time spent on outside activities, number of residents per direct-care staff member, presence of sensory handicaps, and ambulation. Results were related to existing literature and discussed in terms of their use for intervention efforts and differential assignment of resources."
24788113,0,a,"While a plethoric empirical literature addresses the relationship between socio-economic status and body weight, little is known about the influence of social class on nutritional outcomes, particularly in developing countries. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the analysis of the social determinants of adult body weight in urban China by taking into account the influence of social class. More specifically, we propose to analyse the position of the Chinese urban middle class in terms of being overweight or obese. The empirical investigations conducted as part of this research are based on a sample of 1320 households and 2841 adults from the China Health and Nutrition Survey for 2009. For the first step, we combine an economic approach and a sociological approach to identify social classes at household level. First, households with an annual per capita income between 10,000 Yuan and the 95th income percentile are considered as members of the middle class. Second, we strengthen the characterization of the middle class using information on education and employment. By applying clustering methods, we identify four groups: the elderly and inactive middle class, the old middle class, the lower middle class and the new middle class. For the second step, we implement an econometric analysis to assess the influence of social class on adult body mass index and on the probability of being overweight or obese. We use multinomial treatment regressions to deal with the endogeneity of the social class variable. Our results show that among the four subgroups of the urban middle class, the new middle class is the only one to be relatively well-protected against obesity. We suggest that this group plays a special role in adopting healthier food consumption habits and seems to be at a more advanced stage of the nutrition transition."
7333334,1,a,"This study was designed to obtain information potentially of value in understanding an modifying the impact of the social environment of the perceived quality of like among institutionalized aged persons. It was hypothesized that Person-Environment (P-E) congruence, as assessed by the Environmental Perception, Preference and Importance Scale (EPPIS), would be related to (1) sex integration/segregation makeup of the health related facility (HRF) living units, and (2) quantity of social interaction between staff and residents. Analysis of sex by unit sex-type interaction for 60 residents' Person-Environment (P-E) congruence scores revealed that elderly females on sex-integrated units reported a higher level of P-E congruence than those residing on female-only units; males on sex-integrated units, in contrast, reported a poorer level of P-E congruence than males on sex -segregated units. Furthermore, behavioral observations of staff-resident verbal interactions confirmed the hypothesis that residents living on units with high staff-resident interaction perceived the environments more congruent with their preferences than residents on units low in verbal interaction. The observed relationships between the P-E congruence measure, resident-staff interaction, and unit sex-type were taken as further support for the relevance and value of the EPPIS measure as a tool for assessing and improving the institutional milieu."
7424897,1,a,"The major epidemiologic characteristics of hepatitis A virus (NAV) infections in Greece were studied in a sample of 877 Air Force recruits, 19-25 years old coming from every geographic region of Greece. Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) were detected by solid phase radioimmunoassay in 83.8% of the recruits. Antibody frequency varied significantly in the various geographic regions of Greece and was inversely related to the size of the community. It was further shown that the prevalence of HAV infection was highly related to the recruit's social class and years of education as well as number of siblings and number of persons per room. These findings in accordance with previous reported data show that hepatitis A is hyperendemic and should be regarded as a childhood infection in Greece. Prevailing socioeconomic, hygienic living and housing conditions should be considered as the main epidemiologic determinants of HAV infections."
28129546,0,a,"Long workhours erode health, which the setting of maximum weekly hours aims to avert. This 48-h limit, and the evidence base to support it, has evolved from a workforce that was largely male, whose time in the labour force was enabled by women's domestic work and care giving. The gender composition of the workforce has now changed, and many women (as well as some men) combine care-giving with paid work, a change viewed as fundamental for gender equality. However, it raises questions on the suitability of the work time limit and the extent it is protective of health. We estimate workhour-mental health thresholds, testing if they vary for men and women due to gendered workloads and constraints on and off the job. Using six waves of data from a nationally representative sample of Australian adults (24-65 years), surveyed in the Household Income Labour Dynamics of Australia Survey (N = 3828 men; 4062 women), our study uses a longitudinal, simultaneous equation approach to address endogeneity. Averaging over the sample, we find an overall threshold of 39 h per week beyond which mental health declines. Separate curves then estimate thresholds for men and women, by high or low care and domestic time constraints, using stratified and pooled samples. We find gendered workhour-health limits (43.5 for men, 38 for women) which widen further once differences in resources on and off the job are considered. Only when time is 'unencumbered' and similar time constraints and contexts are assumed, do gender gaps narrow and thresholds approximate the 48-h limit. Our study reveals limits to contemporary workhour regulation which may be systematically disadvantaging women's health."
6929960,1,a,"An analysis is made of the contraceptive practice of 100 women prior to abortion. Half the women were not using any method during the month they became pregnant. Problems with the pill, risk-taking behaviour and fears of infertility, were the commonest reasons for non-use. In the 50 percent who were using a method, failure was most commonly due to human error and to the use of less reliable methods. Psychological and social factors were seen to be important determinants of behaviour. This study emphasises the need for remedial action."
28484352,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases was reported to be 3,500 per 100,000. And it is predicted that these numbers will increase in the near future. By removing the main factors responsible for non-communicable diseases, cardiovascular disease can be prevented by 80%. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the population attributable fraction for cardiovascular diseases' risk factors in Iran, USA and Spain. METHODS: This study was a comparative study and the population consisted of Iran, USA and Spain. The required information was collected from printed and electronic documentations and articles published in reliable databases, in the period 2007-2015. RESULTS: The cardiovascular diseases' Population Attributable Risk or Fraction for blood pressure was calculated to be 11.37%, 54% and 60%, diabetes 7.32%, 13% and 18%, and high cholesterol 6.85%, 13% and 20%, for Iran, USA and Spain respectively. Among risk factors, blood pressure was the most relevant factor to cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor for high blood pressure had a more population attributable fraction than other physiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. Hence, by implementing comprehensive health policies, educating healthy lifestyle, screening and finding related cases as well as conducting health promotion programs, these diseases can be prevented."
6706793,1,a,"Questionnaires addressing areas expected to relate to contraceptive use were completed by 230 female adolescents. Contraceptive use among the 130 sexually active subjects were predicted by a model composed of 12 scales assessing social permissiveness, costs and benefits of contraception, parent communication, boyfriend support, sex education and knowledge, attitudes about pregnancy and contraception, and access to contraception services. Scales from the predictive model which raise ideas for potential intervention strategies assessed parent communication, boyfriend support, and perceived costs and benefits related to contraception. Since there has been public concern that intervention programs for enhancing adolescent contraceptive use might also stimulate sexual activity, correlations were computed between the predictive scales and the measure of sexual experience among all 230 subjects. These data indicated that positive parent communication about sexuality and a perception of high benefits and low costs associated with contraceptive use were not positively correlated with sexual experience. Implications for the prevention of adolescent pregnancy are discussed with an emphasis on designing innovative sex education, improving parent-child communication, resolving conflicts in contraceptive decisionmaking, and supporting the role of boyfriends in contraceptive use."
3169388,1,a,"A prospective study was carried out on 133 neurologically deviant infants, 205 with mild abnormalities and 230 normal newborns to compare behavioural and cognitive development with neonatal and nine-year-old neurological condition. Overtly handicapped children were excluded. Major determinants of school failure were the severity of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) and social class. Main risk factors for distractable and clumsy behaviour were MND classification and male sex; for troublesome behaviour male sex and interval complications after two years of age; and for timid behaviour, family adversity. Definite neonatal neurological deviancy contributed both directly and by its association with MND to problems in behaviour and scholastic abilities. Mild neonatal neurological abnormalities and adverse obstetrical events contributed only indirectly to behavioural and learning problems. Preterm birth (less than 34 weeks) was the sole obstetric variable directly related to some of the outcome variables. The difference between home and school perception of the children's behaviour is emphasized."
22528046,0,a,"High HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women in Thailand suggest a vital need for targeted interventions. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to examine and compare sexual risk behaviors, and demographic and behavioral correlates of risk, among MSM and transgender women recruited from gay entertainment venue staff and community-based organization (CBO) participants. We used venue-based sampling across nine sites in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Among 260 participants (57.3% gay-identified, 26.9% heterosexual/bisexual-identified, 15.8% transgender; mean age = 26.7 years), nearly one-fifth (18.5%) reported unprotected anal sex (UAS), half (50.4%) sex in exchange for money, and one-fifth (20.0%) STI diagnosis (past year). Nearly one-fourth (23.1%) reported oral erectile dysfunction medication use and nearly one-fifth (19.2%) illicit drug use (past 3 months). Overall, 43.1% indicated that healthcare providers exhibited hostility towards them. Gay entertainment venue staff were significantly more likely to self-identify as heterosexual/bisexual (versus gay or transgender female), and to have less than high school degree education, higher monthly income, to have engaged in sex in exchange for money, sex with women and unprotected vaginal sex, but were significantly less likely to have engaged in UAS than CBO participants. Targeted interventions for younger MSM and transgender women, for non gay-identified men, and strategies to address structural determinants of risk, including low education and discrimination from healthcare providers, may support HIV prevention among MSM and transgender women, and serve broader national HIV prevention efforts in Thailand."
7264477,1,a,"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered."
6382590,1,a,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females."
3293236,1,a,"Cancer of the esophagus poses a unique challenge for students of cancer prevention. The role of nutritional determinants and other environmental factors in modulating esophageal cancer has received increasing support from data collected during the last decades. Ecologic, geographic, economic, and cultural variables appear to be collectively operational in determining the nutritional profiles of high-risk populations in the Asian esophageal cancer belt and discrete hyperendemic pockets throughout the world. Altering dietary staples, preventing food contamination by mycotoxins, using molybdenum as a chemical fertilizer, modifying social habits, and adding deficient micronutrients to diets of high-risk groups will potentially avert the development of this devastating malignant neoplasm."
27423320,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a community based participatory research (CBPR) developed, multi-level smoking cessation intervention among women in subsidized housing neighborhoods in the Southeastern US. METHODS: A total of n=409 women in 14 subsidized housing neighborhoods in Georgia and South Carolina participated in this group randomized controlled trial conducted from 2009 to 2013. Intervention neighborhoods received a 24-week intervention with 1:1 community health worker contact, behavioral peer group sessions, and nicotine replacement. Control neighborhoods received written cessation materials at weeks 1, 6, 12, 18. Random coefficient models were used to compare smoking abstinence outcomes at 6 and 12months. Significance was set a p<0.05. RESULTS: The majority of participants (91.2%) were retained during the 12-month intervention period. Smoking abstinence rates at 12months for intervention vs. control were 9% vs. 4.3%, p=0.05. Additional analyses accounting for passive smoke exposure in these multi-unit housing settings demonstrated 12month abstinence rates of 12% vs. 5.3%, p=0.016. However, in the multivariate regression analyses, there was no significant effect of the intervention on the odds of being a non-smoker (OR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.18-1.07). Intervention participants who kept coach visits, attended group sessions, and used patches were more likely to remain abstinent. CONCLUSIONS: This CBPR developed intervention showed potential to engage smokers and reduce smoking among women in these high-poverty neighborhoods. Effectiveness in promoting cessation in communities burdened with fiscal, environmental and social inequities remains a public health priority."
3852242,1,a,"Nursing clinic clients' health beliefs, values, and demographic characteristics were analyzed for their impact on health promotion activities. A sample of 175 clients was administered measures of health beliefs, health values, and health promotion activities. The type of health care clients had requested at the clinic for the previous 2 years was categorized as health promotion, illness prevention, health maintenance, or health restoration. Findings included: health value was not related to self-reported health promotion activities or to types of clinic visits; a strong belief in chance was negatively associated with engaging in health promotion activities; a strong belief in powerful others was negatively associated with a high percentage of restoration visits. The combination of beliefs, values, and selected demographic factors accounted for 16% of the variance in health promotion activities and 18% of the variance in the type of health care sought."

Particular attention is paid to pre-term infants and the biological roots of parenting."
28818240,0,a,"Adolescence and young adulthood, a period essential for determining exposures over the life-course, is an ideal time to intervene to lower cancer risk. This demographic group can be viewed as both the target audience and generator of messages for cancer prevention, such as skin cancer, obesity-, tobacco-, and human papillomavirus-related cancers. The purpose of this paper is to encourage innovative health communications that target youth; youth behavior; and the structural, environmental, and social determinants of youth behavior as critical areas of focus for cancer prevention and disparities reduction. The authors describe the rationale, processes, products, and early impacts of an award-winning youth diabetes prevention communication campaign model (The Bigger Picture) that harnesses spoken-word messages in school-based and social media presentations. The campaign supports minority adolescent and young adult artists to create content that aligns with values held closely by youth-values likely to resonate and affect change, such as defiance against authority, inclusion, and social justice. This campaign can be leveraged to prevent obesity, which is a cancer risk factor. Then, the authors propose concrete ways that The Bigger Picture's pedagogical model could be adapted for broader cancer prevention messaging for youth of color and youth stakeholders regarding tobacco-related cancers, skin cancers, and human papillomavirus-related cancers. The goal is to demonstrate how a youth-generated and youth-targeted prevention campaign can: (1) reframe conversations about cancer prevention, (2) increase awareness that cancer prevention is about social justice and health equity, and (3) catalyze action to change social norms and confront the social and environmental drivers of cancer disparities."
2692802,1,a,"Our emphasis in the past has been on disease prevention rather than health promotion. This emphasis served us reasonably well when morbidity was high throughout society and when interventions at the community level were able to achieve massive reductions. It is not faring as well now that the major shared environmental determinants of disease have been controlled. The present situation calls for changes in individual health-related behaviour and individual clinical interventions to achieve comparable progress. As difficult to win as collective commitments to community-level interventions have been, compliance in a free society by often unmotivated persons in numerous individual instances of decision making in daily life is even more difficult. Health promotion offers the promise of a quantum leap in improving the health status of the community by participating in behaviour perceived as not only responsible but appropriate and desirable, providing positive reinforcement rather than anxiety-provoking caution. Favourable social trends, such as physical conditioning and dietary changes may be encouraged through media interventions. There are biological limitations to this approach, however. Many healthful practices confer little benefit on large groups of people and a few may be harmful to selected groups. Vigorous promotion of weight reduction and obesity control, for example, may lead to profound dissatisfaction with body image and to severely self-destructive behaviour among those prone to eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive eating. Health promotion activities may fit well with social trends but their adverse potential can be aggravated because failure to comply can be penalized by peer disapproval in a way that disease prevention strategies usually are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
31679378,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the challenges and opportunities of the Communicable Diseases Surveillance System (CDSS) in Iran. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) with 64 participants from October 2016 to April 2017. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit participants. The collected data were analyzed via the content analysis method. Data analysis was performed using MAXQDA10 software. RESULTS: The results of this qualitative study were categorized in two parts: Challenges and opportunities. The CDSS is facing challenges in the fields of stewardship, reporting, information analysis, information, interventions, and education. Good infrastructures and structure, the technical support provided by the Centre for Communicable Disease Control (CCDC), the achievements of the CDSS, and the suitable electronic systems are among the opportunities of CDSS. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that CDSS has several major challenges. Authorities and policymakers must not ignore communicable diseases and their management tools, including CDSS because of their focus on non-communicable diseases. Some important strategies to overcome the challenges of CDSS can be the following: motivating policy makers to put emphasis on communicable diseases as a national security issue, the ratification and modification of laws and regulations on reporting, the involvement of the CDSS in the accreditation of hospitals and the renewal of the license for healthcare professionals, and motivating organizations outside the health sector to participate in the programs through inter-institutional agreements."
6705636,1,a,"This essay is based on the assumption that a long-neglected topic of socialization, the determinants of individual differences in parental functioning, is illuminated by research on the etiology of child maltreatment. Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child."
6737214,1,a,"This study examined Weiss' conceptualization of social and emotional loneliness. Using data from an extensive survey of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Iowa, we measured social and emotional loneliness, students' affective and behavioral reactions to loneliness, students' social relationships, and their judgments of the degree to which their relationships supply the six social provisions described by Weiss. As expected, we found differences in the subjective experiences of social and emotional loneliness, although both forms of loneliness were also characterized by a common core of experiences. The results generally supported Weiss's ideas concerning the determinants of social and emotional loneliness. Predictions concerning the affective and behavioral consequences associated with each type of loneliness, however, were only partly supported, although the two forms of loneliness were associated with different affective reactions and coping behaviors. The implications of these findings for Weiss's typology of loneliness are discussed."
29898353,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This work sought to assess the predictor role of work engagement and social support from the supervisor and coworkers on affective commitment with the organization in nursing staff from southern Portugal. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with participation from 215 nursing professionals from three public hospitals in southern Portugal. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 77.21% were women. Statistically significant and positive correlations were observed between affective organizational commitment and the three dimensions of engagement: vigor (r=0.48), dedication (r=0.49), and absorption (r=0.48). Likewise, support from the supervisor and support from coworkers were positively related with affective commitment (r=0.45 and r=0.24, p<0.01). The linear and hierarchical regression model showed the following significant predictors: support from the supervisor (beta=0.28), vigor (beta=0.26), and absorption (beta=0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Social support from the supervisor and work engagement (vigor and absorption) are important determinants of the affective bond of nursing professionals with their health organizations. Training and formation of the supervisors in leadership and coaching styles, and labor resources at work would permit increasing the levels of affective commitment in the health units."
3529422,1,a,"The development of a theory of quality of life following serious illness is currently an important field of endeavour in rehabilitation research. The interpersonal relationships of people and elements of the self-concept appear to be salient factors in causal models of subjective well-being. One such model developed to explain characteristic levels of well-being was used in a longitudinal study of adaptation to a first myocardial infarction. Data were collected from a national sample of male cardiac patients and their spouses on the illness and marital situation as predictors of long-term well-being or ill-being. Analyses of data from the first three waves of the study, which is to extend over 5 years after the onset of illness, are to be discussed in the paper. Marital status, the emotional quality of the spouse relationship and long-standing marital stressors were found to have direct and indirect effects on the two dimensions of the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. The same is true of continuing problems associated with the heart attack relative to perceptions of having coped effectively with the after effects of illness. Differences in self-esteem and personal competence were suggested as mediators of socio-environmental and illness-related influences. The two-factor conception of well-being developed was found to be a useful framework for investigating positive and negative aspects of psychosocial rehabilitation. The same factors that explain differences between happy and unhappy people in social indicators research also appeared to be determinants of different trajectories of adaptation in the wake of a life-threatening illness. Previous research using theoretical models from stress research has overemphasized psychosocial morbidity and stress management and neglected positive processes of adaptation. The identification of love resources related to positive feeling states and life satisfaction has, therefore, not received the attention it deserves. This is especially the case regarding an overemphasis of the concept of social support as a buffer of stress. Instruments were developed to measure high and low marital intimacy, as well as chronic marital role strains, and these measures appeared to explain different trajectories of adjustment to cardiac disease. The two-factor model appears to be useful for future work on quality of life with chronic illness. The same is true of four marital contexts of rehabilitation that were identified in the study."

31530321,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Successful scale-up of integrated primary mental healthcare requires routine monitoring of key programme performance indicators. A consensus set of mental health indicators has been proposed but evidence on their use in routine settings is lacking. AIMS: To assess the acceptability, feasibility, perceived costs and sustainability of implementing indicators relating to integrated mental health service coverage in six South Asian (India, Nepal) and sub-Saharan African countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda). METHOD: A qualitative study using semi-structured key informant interviews (n = 128) was conducted. The 'Performance of Routine Information Systems' framework served as the basis for a coding framework covering three main categories related to the performance of new tools introduced to collect data on mental health indicators: (1) technical; (2) organisation; and (3) behavioural determinants. RESULTS: Most mental health indicators were deemed relevant and potentially useful for improving care, and therefore acceptable to end users. Exceptions were indicators on functionality, cost and severity. The simplicity of the data-capturing formats contributed to the feasibility of using forms to generate data on mental health indicators. Health workers reported increasing confidence in their capacity to record the mental health data and minimal additional cost to initiate mental health reporting. However, overstretched primary care staff and the time-consuming reporting process affected perceived sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the newly developed, contextually appropriate mental health indicators in health facilities providing primary care services was seen largely to be feasible in the six Emerald countries, mainly because of the simplicity of the forms and continued support in the design and implementation stage. However, approaches to implementation of new forms generating data on mental health indicators need to be customised to the specific health system context of different countries. Further work is needed to identify ways to utilise mental health data to monitor and improve the quality of mental health services. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: None."
25582809,0,a,"Over the past decades, Internet use has grown substantially, and it now serves people as a supportive tool that is used regularly and-in large parts of the world-inevitably. Some people develop problematic Internet use, which may lead to addictive behavior and it is becoming important to explore the risk factors for compulsive Internet use. Data were analyzed on compulsive Internet use [with the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS)] from 5247 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) adolescent twins registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. The participants form a sample that is informative for genetic analyses, allowing the investigation of the causes of individual differences in compulsive Internet use. The internal consistency of the instrument was high and the 1.6-year test-retest correlation in a subsample (n = 902) was 0.55. CIUS scores increased slightly with age. Remarkably, gender did not explain variation in CIUS scores, as mean scores on the CIUS were the same in boys and girls. However, the time spent on specific Internet activities differed: boys spent more time on gaming, whereas girls spent more time on social network sites and chatting. The heritability estimates were the same for boys and girls: 48 percent of the individual differences in CIUS score were influenced by genetic factors. The remaining variance (52 percent) was due to environmental influences that were not shared between family members. Because a life without Internet is almost impossible nowadays, it is important to further explore the determinants of compulsive Internet use, including genetic risk factors."

The relationship between blood pressure and behavioural factors is not mediated by covariables such as social status, sexual maturity, body mass, smoking habits, etc."
23752449,0,a,"We aimed to compare self-reported adherence to the physical activity recommendation with accelerometry in older adults and to identify determinants of misperception. The sample included 138 adults age 65-75 yr old participating in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Participants completed a lifestyle questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for one week. More than half (56.8%) of the participants reported to adhere to the physical activity recommendation (in 5-min bouts), however, based on accelerometry, this percentage was only 24.6%. Of those who reported to adhere, 65.3% did not do so based on accelerometry. The misperceivers were older (p < .009), more often female (p = .007), had a poorer walking performance (p = .02), reported a lower social support (p = .04), and tended to have a lower self-efficacy (p = .09) compared with those who correctly perceived their adherence to the recommendation. These results suggest that misperception of adherence to the physical activity recommendation is highly prevalent among specific subgroups of older adults."
29635335,0,a,"Background: The French Chronic Kidney Disease-Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (CKD-REIN) cohort study was designed to investigate the determinants of prognosis and care of patients referred to nephrologists with moderate and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We examined their baseline risk profile and experience. Methods: We collected bioclinical and patient-reported information from 3033 outpatients with CKD and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) of 15-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 treated at 40 nationally representative public and private facilities. Results: The patients' median age was 69 (60-76) years, 65% were men, their mean eGFR was 33 mL/min/1.73 m2, 43% had diabetes, 24% had a history of acute kidney injury (AKI) and 57% had uncontrolled blood pressure (BP; >140/90 mmHg). Men had worse risk profiles than women and were more likely to be past or current smokers (73% versus 34%) and have cardiovascular disease (59% versus 42%), albuminuria >30 mg/mmol (or proteinuria > 50) (40% versus 30%) (all P < 0.001) and a higher median risk of end-stage renal disease within 5 years, predicted by the kidney failure risk equation {12% [interquartile range (IQR) 3-37%] versus 9% [3-31%], P = 0.008}. During the previous year, 60% of patients reported one-to-two nephrologist visits and four or more general practitioner visits; only 25% saw a dietician and 75% were prescribed five or more medications daily. Physical and mental quality of life (QoL) were poor, with scores <50/100. Conclusions: The CKD-REIN study highlights high-risk profiles of cohort members and identifies several priorities, including improving BP control and dietary counselling and increasing doctors' awareness of AKI, polypharmacy and QoL.

25888526,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A low socioeconomic position (SEP) is consistently associated with ill health, sickness absence (SA) and permanent disability, but studies among young employees are lacking. We examined the interrelationships between education, occupational class and income as determinants of SA among 25-34-year-old employees. We also examined, whether the association between SEP and SA varied over time in 2002-2007 and 2008-2013. METHODS: The analyses covered young, 25-34-year-old women and men employed by the City of Helsinki over the time periods 2002-2007 and 2008-2013. Four-level education and occupational class classifications were used, as well as income quartiles. The outcome measure was the number of annual SA days. RESULTS: Education had the strongest and most consistent independent association with SA among women and men in both periods under study. Occupational class had weaker independent and less consistent association with SA. Income had an independent association with SA, which strengthened over time among the men. The interrelationships between the SEP indicators and SA were partly explained by prior or mediated through subsequent SEP indicators. Socioeconomic differences followed only partially a gradient for occupational class and also for income among men. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive measures to reduce the risk of SA should be considered, especially among young employees with a basic or lower-secondary education."

27334297,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The causes of health inequalities are complex. For the reduction of health inequalities, intersectoral collaboration between the public health sector and both social policy sectors (e.g. youth affairs, education) and physical policy sectors (e.g. housing, spatial planning) is essential, but in local practice difficult to realize. The aim of this study was to examine the collaboration between the sectors in question more closely and to identify opportunities for improvement. METHOD: A qualitative descriptive analysis of five aspects of collaboration within sixteen Dutch municipalities was performed to examine the collaboration between the public health sector and other policy sectors: 1) involvement of the sectors in the public health policy network, 2) harmonisation of objectives, 3) use of policies by the relevant sectors, 4) formalised collaboration, and 5) previous experience. Empirical data on these collaboration aspects were collected based on document analysis, questionnaires and interviews. RESULTS: The study found that the policy workers of social sectors were more involved in the public health network and more frequently supported the objectives in the field of health inequality reduction. Both social policy sectors and physical policy sectors used policies and activities to reduce health inequalities. More is done to influence the determinants of health inequality through policies aimed at lifestyle and social setting than through policies aimed at socioeconomic factors and the physical environment. Where the physical policy sectors are involved in the public health network, the collaboration follows a very similar pattern as with the social policy sectors. All sectors recognise the importance of good relationships, positive experiences, a common interest in working together and coordinated mechanisms. CONCLUSION: This study shows that there is scope for improving collaboration in the field of health inequality reduction between the public health sector and both social policy sectors and physical policy sectors. Ways in which improvement could be realised include involving physical policy sectors in the network, pursuing widely supported policy goals, making balanced efforts to influence determinants of health inequalities, and increasing the emphasis on a programmatic approach."
3399999,1,a,"Theoretical consideration of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) suggests that the key determinants of transmission dynamics are the duration of infectiousness and the extent to which subgroups in the population interact sexually. We used two empirical correlates to represent these concepts: (1) the force of infectivity, calculated by summing all the days of potential infectivity (the time between last sexual exposure and treatment of the contact) generated by a given case, and then summing the days for all cases within a given subgroup; (2) self-selection, representing the observed probability that members of a given subgroup select sexual partners from within their own group. Using data gathered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, we estimated that a single group i.e., black, male, heterosexual, military personnel residing in the core areas, generated 27% of the force of infectivity. Subgroups that select greater than 50% of their sexual partners from outside their sociodemographic boundaries generated a rate for the force of infectivity that was 4.5 times higher than the rate for self-selectors. These findings confirm the core group theory and suggest strategies for control of STD."
30208173,0,a,"The shortage of physicians in remote and underprivileged areas poses an obstacle to universal access and quality of health care. Through the More Doctors Program (PMM), as of 2015, 18 thousand physicians had been incorporated into Brazil's Unified National Health System (SUS) to work in basic care, 79% of whom were Cubans. This article analyzed the comprehensiveness of practices by Cuban physicians in the PMM using a qualitative study in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, based on interviews with Cuban physicians (24) and a focus group with supervisors of the PMM (4). Comprehensiveness was analyzed in two dimensions: the community-oriented biopsychosocial approach to care and the range of activities in health promotion, prevention, and care. The work by Cuban physicians presents elements that are consistent with the comprehensiveness of practices in primary care, providing a wide range of care and services, in keeping with the health problems' complexity and the plurality of settings. These health workers show outstanding capacity for community interaction, a preventive focus, planning of activities, and positive interpersonal team relations. The study identified attitudes and techniques of solidarity, physician-patient bonding, and community accountability. Challenges were identified in the promotion of participatory practices with communities, the expansion of users' autonomy in clinical decisions, management of psychological problems, systematization of approach tools, and performance of invasive procedures. The study furnishes strong evidence that the PMM, in addition to medical consultations, provides comprehensive health care and contributes to strengthening basic care in Brazil."
3563565,1,a,"Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed."
29210863,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and determinants of high blood pressure (BP) and awareness, treatment, and control rates in the Far North Region of Cameroon, where these variables have not been explored so far. METHODS: In total, 889 individuals (41.5% women) aged at least 18 years participated in a cross-sectional survey conducted in Maroua (urban area) and Tokombere (rural area) from November 2014 to May 2015, using a multistage cluster sampling frame. Anthropometric variables, BP, and fasting capillary glucose were assessed in all participants. Hypertension was defined as BP at least 140/90 mmHg or antihypertensive therapy and BP control as BP less than 140/90 mmHg. Prevalence estimates were age standardized to the Cameroon population. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was 37.8% (rural: 34%; urban: 41.2%; men: 38.8%; women: 37.9%). Hypertension was associated with urban environment (odds ratio: 1.42; 95%; confidence interval 1.06-1.89), age at least 70 years (4.06; 2.02-6.14), male sex (4.06; 2.02-6.14), abdominal obesity (2.36; 1.54-3.61), and high blood sugar (2.01; 1.31-3.08). Among individuals with hypertension, 18.6% (rural: 17.9%; urban: 19.5%) were aware of having high BP. Among those aware, 29.3% (rural: 17.3%; urban: 36.3%) reported receiving treatment, of whom 16.3% (rural: 22.6%; urban: 4.2%) had BP controlled. Awareness, treatment, and BP control levels were higher in women than men. CONCLUSION: Hypertension is highly prevalent in Far North Cameroon and awareness, treatment, and control rates are low. Efforts to improve detection, treatment, and control of hypertension in Cameroon are needed."
26927655,0,a,"Analyzing the challenges and the future scenario of Family Medicine is a priority to address challenges such as the reduction of benefits granted by social security; to adapt their practice to the changing health profile; and to curb demand for specialized services and contain the high costs of care in the second and third level. The program is aimed at three professional roles: medical care, research, and education. It is imperative review these in the light of changing demographic conditions, the type of health needs arising from new social determinants, the public expectations for greater participation in their care, and the evolution of the health system itself with the advancement of technology and a variety of organizational options with frequently limited resources. For primary care, as the core of a health system that covers principles of equity, solidarity, universality, participation, decentralization, and intra- and inter-sectorial coordination, it is necessary to put at the center of the primary care team the family doctor and not an administrator, who plays an important role in supporting the care team, but can not take the lead."
12312686,1,a,"""This study of the determinants of legal abortion examines the interconnections between human reproduction and social organization. The hypothesis is that in the context of liberalized abortion laws, the incidence of abortion is determined by the socio-economic circumstances of women. A simple model of this relationship is tested using international data drawn from a sample of countries."" The policy implications for welfare and birth control planning are considered, as well as the implications for feminist action."
3297402,1,a,"The risk factors for sudden coronary heart disease (CHD) death have been well described. Sudden CHD deaths should be classified as those occurring in individuals with and those in individuals without a prior history of clinical heart disease. The extent of coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac arrhythmias are the primary pathophysiologic determinants of ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Psychosocial factors influence the threshold of response to the numerous physical and social environmental stimuli that can precipitate sudden death. The degree of pathology is probably inversely related to the intensity of the stimuli necessary to precipitate sudden CHD death. In the presence of extensive disease the precipitants of sudden deaths are probably ubiquitous in the environment and unlikely to be prevented. Thus, prevention of the basic cardiac disease is of higher priority."
25955675,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Youth comprise a significant portion of the total immigrant population in Canada. Immigrant and refugee youth often have different migration trajectories and experiences, which can result in different mental health outcomes. Research is emerging in this area, but study findings have not yet been consolidated. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is known from the existing literature about mental health issues and concerns among immigrant and refugee youth in Canada? METHOD: We searched Embase, Health Star, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Social Science Abstracts databases for the period 1990-2013 for Canadian studies related to the mental health of youth born outside Canada. Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Determinants of mental illness included pre-migration experiences, number of years since immigration to Canada, post-migration family and school environment, in- and out-group problems, discrimination, and lack of equitable access to health care. Only a few common categories of mental illness were identified, and the burden of mental illness was shared differently across gender and immigration status, with female youth experiencing more mental health problems than male youth. Some studies identified fewer emotional and behavioural problems among refugee youth; others reported higher rates of psychopathology among refugee youth compared with their Canadian-born provincial counterparts. Pre-migration experiences and the kinds of trauma experienced were important for refugee youth's mental health. Findings also indicated the importance of family involvement, school settings as points of care and services, and in terms of timing, focusing on the first year of arrival in Canada. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Professionals must work across health, social, and settlement sectors to address the various pre- and post-migration determinants of mental health and illness, and provide more timely and effective services based on how and when these determinants affect different groups of youth."
7112177,1,a,"Abortion rates in the United States have risen annually since the 1973 Supreme Court decision. The regions with the greatest rate increases are the Southern and Plains states; the lowest rate increases were in regions which had high abortion rates soon after abortion was legalized. While spatial contiguity appears to influence abortion rates, that is, states with high rates of abortion are clustered spatially, social and political influence are also evident. Ratification of the equal rights amendment, the seeking of abortion outside the state of residence, and the degree of urbanization within a state are variables which influenced U.S. abortion rates between 1973 and 1977."
3867226,1,a,"The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
27760532,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Millions of children travel to school every day in India, yet little is known about this journey. We examined the distribution and determinants of school travel in Hyderabad, India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. School travel questionnaires were used to collect data from children aged 11-14 years, attending private, semi-private and government funded schools in Hyderabad. We used Google Earth to estimate the distance from home to school for each child and modelled the relationship between distance to school and mode of travel, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Forty five of the 48 eligible schools that were selected agreed to participate, providing a total sample of 5842 children. The response rate was 99 %. Most children walked (57 %) or cycled (6 %) to school but 36 % used motorised transport (mostly bus). The proportion using motorised transport was higher in children attending private schools (41 %) than in those attending government schools (24 %). Most (90 %) children lived within 5km of school and 36 % lived within 1km. Greater distance to school was strongly associated with the use of motorised transport. Children living close to school were much more likely to walk or cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Most children in Hyderabad walk (57 %) or cycle (6 %) to school. If these levels are to be maintained, there is an urgent need to ensure that walking and cycling are safe and pleasant. Social policies that decrease distances to school could have a large impact on road traffic injuries, air pollution, and physical activity levels."
26157562,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Considering the importance of anger, aggression, violence and other misbehaviours in schoolchildren education, the present study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge and practice of students in Isfahan province regarding violence, in order to figure out the required interventions for violence-reduction. METHODS: In a survey during 2008-2009, 5500 junior and senior high school students of Isfahan province were assessed in a multistage sampling process to determine their level of knowledge about various types of violent behaviors, causes of violence, its consequences, and preventive behaviors. Validity and reliability of the data collection tool (questionnaire) were assessed. RESULTS: The study revealed that the mean scores of violent behaviors knowledge, knowledge of violent behavior outcomes, and knowledge of violence preventive behaviors, were 6.6 +/- 2.1, 5.5 +/- 1.9, and 4.7 +/- 1.3, respectively. Sources of violent behaviors in 92% of urban students and 89% of rural students were personal reasons and family behaviors, and 85% of urban and 88% of rural students considered mass media and computer games blameworthy, and the differences were statistically significant in all cases (P < 0.0001). In terms of practice, overall, 69.7% of girls and 84.2% of boys had violent behaviors. Physical and verbal violence were 31.3% and 40.7%in girls, and 66% and 52.8% in boys, respectively (intersexes P values were P < 0.001 and P = 0.7 respectively, and intra-sex P value was P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that girls and city dwellers were more aware of recognizing violent behaviors, outcomes, and causes, compared with boys and villagers, and in terms of general practice, violence was observed among boys more than girls. Further complementary studies in this area seem required."
3234016,1,a,"This sub-study of the WHO Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders research project was aimed at characterizing the behavioral and expressive qualities of schizophrenia in two highly diverse cultures. Early research has indicated that the core elements involving affect, perceptual and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia are highly similar in form in most cultures of the world. Much of the cross-cultural literature emphasizes, however, strong differences in the ways in which schizophrenia is actually expressed and manifested in different settings. The basic methodology for psychiatric description and diagnosis in the WHO program was the Present State Examination. In five of the field centers a method for investigating the expressive quality and the social behavior of patients in their own communities through the eyes of significant others was applied. This method was then subjected to psychometric tests of cross-cultural applicability and found to be valid for comparing behavior across settings. The expressive patterns of the Indian and Nigerian patients were studied from two perspectives. Indian schizophrenics were described by family members as manifesting a more affective and ""self-centered"" orientation; the Nigerian patients presented with a highly suspicious, bizarre, anxious quality to the basic behavioral pattern. The main features of pathology were in general accord with the descriptions of indigenous psychiatrists. The special qualities of the psychosis in the two cultures were interpreted against the background of traditional psychopathological and anthropologic theories concerning the psychodynamics and the influence of differing social conflictual themes in the two cultures. Analysis of psychopathology in this manner was found to enhance understanding of underlying mechanisms and the role of cultural conflicts in its expression."
30205278,0,a,"We explore race differences in how individuals experience mass incarceration, as well as in mass incarceration's impacts on measures of well-being that are recognized as major social determinants of health. We draw on baseline data from a sample of 302 men and women recently released from prison/jail or placed directly onto probation in New Haven, Connecticut (CT) for drug related offenses and followed at 6-month intervals for two years (2011-2014). We describe race differences in experiences of mass incarceration and in its impacts on well-being; and we conduct mediation analyses to analyze relationships among race, mass incarceration, and well-being. Blacks reported fewer adult convictions than whites, but an average of 2.5 more adult incarcerations. Blacks were more likely to have been incarcerated as a juvenile, spent time in a juvenile facility and in an adult facility as a juvenile, been on parole, and experienced multiple forms of surveillance. Whites were more likely to report being caught by the police doing something illegal but let go. Blacks were more likely to report any impact of incarceration on education, and dropping out of school, leaving a job, leaving their longest job, and becoming estranged from a family member due to incarceration. Whites were more likely to avoid getting needed health or social services for fear of arrest. Overall, Blacks reported a larger number of impacts of criminal justice involvement on well-being than whites. Number of adult incarcerations and of surveillance types, and being incarcerated as a juvenile, each mediated the relationship among race, mass incarceration, and well-being. Though more research is necessary, experiences of mass incarceration appear to vary by race and these differences, in turn, have implications for interventions aimed at addressing the impacts of mass incarceration on health and well-being."

7282978,1,a,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology."

It posits that part of the underlying dynamics of suicidal children is being pressured to solve a problem, in the family milieu, which is beyond the child's--and often anybody else's--ability to resolve. Moreover, the paper outlines the possible relation between the insolvable problem and various determinants involved in suicidal behavior such as depression, helplessness, hopelessness, rigidity, etc. This discussion will be accompanied by case demonstrations."
22003388,0,a,"Negotiation and trade typically require a mutual interaction while simultaneously resting in uncertainty which decision the partner ultimately will make at the end of the process. Assessing already during the negotiation in which direction one's counterpart tends would provide a tremendous advantage. Recently, neuroimaging techniques combined with multivariate pattern classification of the acquired data have made it possible to discriminate subjective states of mind on the basis of their neuronal activation signature. However, to enable an online-assessment of the participant's mind state both approaches need to be extended to a real-time technique. By combining real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and online pattern classification techniques, we show that it is possible to predict human behavior during social interaction before the interacting partner communicates a specific decision. Average accuracy reached approximately 70% when we predicted online the decisions of volunteers playing the ultimatum game, a well-known paradigm in economic game theory. Our results demonstrate the successful online analysis of complex emotional and cognitive states using real-time fMRI, which will enable a major breakthrough for social fMRI by providing information about mental states of partners already during the mutual interaction. Interestingly, an additional whole brain classification across subjects confirmed the online results: anterior insula, ventral striatum, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, known to act in emotional self-regulation and reward processing for adjustment of behavior, appeared to be strong determinants of later overt behavior in the ultimatum game. Using whole brain classification we were also able to discriminate between brain processes related to subjective emotional and motivational states and brain processes related to the evaluation of objective financial incentives."
21584456,0,a,"The scope of this article is to analyze satisfaction in the workplace of mental healthcare professionals who serve in Psychosocial Care Centers (Caps). The research is of a qualitative nature and the data-collecting medium was semistructured interviews with 19 workers of three Caps in Fortaleza, in the Northern Brazilian State of Ceara. The treatment of the empirical material was based upon the analysis of content with an emphasis on the thematic bias. The results revealed the determinants of (dis)satisfaction present in the daily routine of these workers. The relationships established with the users were singled out as the main source of satisfaction, whereas the work and wage conditions were the main motives for dissatisfaction. In addition to these aspects, consequences of (dis)satisfaction at work in the private, social and organizational field of the workers' life in the Caps were revealed, mainly in physical and mental health. Lastly, they emphasized the urgent need for implementation - on the part of public administration - of strategies that seek to reduce the precariousness of healthcare work, especially in mental health, with a view to mitigating damages potentially caused by such work."
24648835,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CONFIRM THE FOLLOWING CORE HYPOTHESIS: a Community of Practice's use of a Web 2.0 platform for communication between primary and hospital care leads to improved primary care and fewer hospital referrals. This core hypothesis will be corroborated by testing a further five partial hypotheses that complete the main hypothesis being estimated. METHODS: An ad-hoc questionnaire was designed and sent to a sample group of 357 professionals from the Badalona-Sant Adria de Besos Primary Care Service in Catalonia, Spain, which includes nine primary care centres and three specialist care centres. The study sample was formed by 159 respondents. The partial least squares methodology was used to estimate the model of the causal relationship and the proposed hypotheses. RESULTS: It was found that when healthcare staff used social networks and information and communication technologies professionally, and the more contact hours they have with patients, the more a Web 2.0 platform was likely to be used for communication between primary and hospital care professionals. Such use led to improved primary care and fewer hospital referrals according to the opinions of health professionals on its use. CONCLUSIONS: The research suggests that the efficiency of medical practice is explained by the intensity of Web 2.0 platform use for communication between primary and specialist care professionals. Public policies promoting the use of information and communication technologies in communities of practice should go beyond the technological dimension and consider other professional, organisational and social determinants."

There was no difference in expectancy of control for negative academic events between delinquents and nondelinquents. In general, birth order and delinquency were the two most important determinants of locus of control. Results are discussed in terms of previous literature on locus of control with particular consideration paid to expectations of control."
27902562,0,a,"CONTEXT: Rigorous qualitative research can enhance local health departments' efforts to gain a deeper insight into residents' perceived community health inequities necessary for productive community health assessments (CHAs) and community health improvement plans (CHIPs). OBJECTIVE: The Chicago Department of Public Health and the Partnership for Healthy Chicago used the National Association of County & City Health Officials' Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) model to conduct its CHA/CHIP, Healthy Chicago 2.0 (HC 2.0). Public health graduate students conducted qualitative research for part of the Community Themes and Strengths Assessment (CTSA), one of the 4 MAPP assessments. DESIGN: Using a health equity lens, this qualitative component included focus groups and oral histories with residents in Chicago Community Areas with the highest social and economic hardship to better understand how residents perceive health inequities in their respective neighborhoods. SETTINGS: Community-based organizations in 6 Chicago neighborhoods with the highest quartile of social and economic hardship. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight Chicago residents from 5 community areas participated in focus groups, and 6 residents of a Mexican ethnic enclave shared oral histories. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Residents' perceptions of community needs and assets. RESULTS: Needs identified include inaccessible resources and opportunities, economic instability, and safety. Assets include the efficacy and agency of resilient residents, as well as faith and spirituality. Systemic and institutional discrimination was identified at the roots of community health inequities. CONCLUSION: Through qualitative inquiry, the more nuanced understanding of how residents perceive health inequities better positioned HC 2.0 to develop upstream strategies in line with advanced health equity practice. Engaging qualitative academic researchers in CTSA brings academic expertise to enrich the CHA while providing real-time learning experiences to prepare future public health practitioners to work on upstream structural determinants of health."

28385465,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea was a serious threat to public health, and was exacerbated by the inappropriate responses of major institutions and the public. This study examined the sources of confusion during the MERS outbreak and identified the factors that can affect people's behavior. METHODS: An online survey of the risk perception of university students in South Korea was performed after the epidemic had peaked. The questionnaire addressed the major social determinants in South Korea during the MERS epidemic. The analysis included data from 1,470 subjects who provided complete answers. RESULTS: The students had 53.5% of the essential knowledge about MERS. Women showed higher risk perception than men, and trust in the media was positively associated with risk perception (P < .001). Additionally, risk perception was positively associated with overreaction by the public (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.60; P < .001). These findings suggest that media content affected the public's perception of MERS risk and that perception of a high level of risk led to overreaction. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perception was associated with most of the social factors examined and overreaction by the public. Therefore, providing accurate information and data to the public, establishing trust, and facilitating the development of an attitude will all be important in future crises."
25320672,0,a,"Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are both drivers and manifestations of poverty and social inequality. Increased advocacy efforts since the mid-2000s have led to ambitious new control and elimination targets set for 2020 by the World Health Organisation. While these global aspirations represent significant policy momentum, there are multifaceted challenges in controlling infectious diseases in resource-poor local contexts that need to be acknowledged, understood and engaged. However a number of recent publications have emphasised the ""neglected"" status of applied social science research on NTDs. In light of the 2020 targets, this paper explores the social science/NTD literature and unpacks some of the ways in which social inquiry can help support effective and sustainable interventions. Five priority areas are discussed, including on policy processes, health systems capacity, compliance and resistance to interventions, education and behaviour change, and community participation. The paper shows that despite the multifaceted value of having anthropological and sociological perspectives integrated into NTD programmes, contemporary efforts underutilise this potential. This is reflective of the dominance of top-down information flows and technocratic approaches in global health. To counter this tendency, social research needs to be more than an afterthought; integrating social inquiry into the planning, monitoring and evaluating process will help ensure that flexibility and adaptability to local realities are built into interventions. More emphasis on social science perspectives can also help link NTD control to broader social determinants of health, especially important given the major social and economic inequalities that continue to underpin transmission in endemic countries."
7397056,1,a,"A Paracetamol elimination was measured, using serial saliva samples, in 114 London factory and office workers, 76 Whites and 38 Asian immigrants. 2. Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man."

28270912,0,a,"The post-war period in Europe, between the late 1940s and the 1970s, was characterised by an expansion of the role of by the state, protecting its citizens from risks of unemployment, poverty, homelessness, and food insecurity. This security began to erode in the 1980s as a result of privatisation and deregulation. The withdrawal of the state further accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis, as countries began pursuing deep austerity. The result has been a rise in what has been termed 'precariousness'. Here we review the development of the concept of precariousness and related phenomena of vulnerability and resilience, before reviewing evidence of growing precariousness in European countries. It describes a series of studies of the impact on precariousness on health in domains of employment, housing, and food, as well as natural experiments of policies that either alleviate or worsen these impacts. It concludes with a warning, drawn from the history of the 1930s, of the political consequences of increasing precariousness in Europe and North America."

Research indicates that risk factors and their interactions are far more complex than originally thought. This article outlines social determinant constructs and their role in understanding oral health promotion. Due to the complex interactions, oral health must be promoted using a multilevel chronic disease model or common risk factor approach. An understanding of social determinants is particularly important for the pediatric population because optimum oral health and general health in adulthood are heavily influenced by childhood."
28433993,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Associations of specific types of stress with increased food intake and subsequent weight gain have been demonstrated in animal models as well as in experimental and epidemiological studies on humans. This study explores the research question of to what extent potentially obesity-related factors determine perceived stress in individuals with obesity. METHODS: N = 547 individuals with obesity participated in a cross-sectional study assessing perceived stress as the outcome variable and potential determinants of stress related to obesity. Based on the available evidence, a five factorial model of 'obesity-related obesogenic stressors' was hypothesized, including the dimensions, 'drive for thinness', 'impulse regulation', 'ineffectiveness', 'social insecurity', and 'body dissatisfaction'. The model was tested using multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The five factorial model of 'potentially obesity-related stressors' resulted in a total variance explanation of adjusted R(2) = 0.616 for males and adjusted R(2) = 0.595 for females for perceived stress. The relative variance contribution of the five included factors differed substantially for the two sexes. CONCLUSION: The findings of this cross-sectional study support the hypothesized, potentially obesity-related factors: 'drive for thinness', 'impulse regulation', 'ineffectiveness', 'social insecurity', and 'body dissatisfaction' as relevant determinants of perceived stress in individuals with obesity."
3058621,1,a,"This paper reviews several psychological models to explain disturbed food intake: the ""psychosomatic theory"", the ""stimulus-binding theory"", the ""concept of restraint eating"", closely related to the ""concept of latent obesity"", the ""set-point-theory"" and the ""boundary model"". All are based on the assumption that there are biological regulating processes of body weight (and with this also of feelings of hunger, appetite and satiation as the determinants of food intake), nevertheless the resulting body weight can be inconsistent with social standards and individual self-concepts. In this case a cognitive control of food intake (dieting behaviour) is activated for weight regulation, which in turn interacts with biological regulatory mechanisms, and as a result leads to specific behavioural dispositions which can be supported by experiments."
26849539,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Research on physical activity in relation to obesity gradually becomes more focused on environmental determinants, which can potentially influence people's health choices. The present article addresses the topic of physical activity from a wider sociological perspective. Our pilot study was designed with the objective of testing the applicability of a method included in the EC 6th Framework Programme EURO-PREVOB, in the Czech context. The method examines specific determinants of the built environment that can have an impact on physical activity at the population level. In addition, the study aims to analyze possible differences in built environment indicators and their relation to the physical activity of people living in neighbourhoods with areas of varying socioeconomic status. METHODS: The field study was carried out in the city of Brno, Czech Republic, in 5 neighbourhood quintiles, i.e. areas divided according to the socioeconomic status of local residents. In each quintile, we evaluated the quality of the built environment according to the quality, aesthetics and safety of segregated cycle facilities, playgrounds/playing areas, public open spaces, marked road crossings and pavements as well as signs of incivilities and devastation. RESULTS: Between the five quintiles, significant differences were found in the quality of parks and playgrounds/playing areas, pavements, marking of pedestrian crossings, and in general aesthetics, i.e. signs of incivilities and devastation of the built environment. No differences were found in the quality and use of cycle facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The method we used for the evaluation of the built environment proved highly applicable in Czech populated areas. Monitoring of built environment indicators in the Czech Republic should provide a basis for health maps, showing potential associations between the prevalence of high-incidence, non-infectious diseases and various social determinants of physical activity. This information might help in achieving an improvement in these determinants at a community level and promoting an increase in physical activity at the population level."

Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets provide insight into some of the proximate determinants of fission-fusion social organization in this species and illustrate the different strategies used by males and females to gain access to critical resources. Longitudinal data on known individuals provide evidence for male natal philopatry and female emigration at sexual maturity in this population. Interbirth intervals are long (mean = 34.5 months) in comparison with most other primate species, and 5 of 15 infants seen within a few days of birth died or disappeared before they were a year old. Home ranges are large (150-250 ha) and fairly discrete; overlap with neighboring groups is on the order of 10-15%. Males and females differed substantially in their ranging patterns; females, particularly those with infants, restricted much of their ranging to a ""core area"" 20-33% the size of the total group range, whereas males ranged more evenly over the entire area occupied by the group. Daily path length varied over almost an order of magnitude from 465 m to 4,070 m, with a mean of 1977 m. Males spent more time traveling and less time feeding than most females. These results are compared with those obtained in previous studies of Ateles and with similar data from other primate species to assess their implications for the evolution of fission-fusion sociality in spider monkeys. The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of very similar social organizations in spider monkeys and chimpanzees are discussed."
3964428,1,a,"Male and female juvenile rats were individually exposed to nonplayful juvenile social stimuli in a novel test of play-soliciting behavior to examine hormonal and experiential determinants of sex differences. In Experiment 1, neonatally androgenized females engaged in play soliciting at a level equal to that of male controls and greater than that of nonandrogenized female controls. In Experiment 2, males and females were reared in unisexual and bisexual groups in order to compare long-term sex-related social experience effects on juvenile play soliciting. Males exposed only to other young males engaged in greater play soliciting than males exposed to both sexes; females, in contrast, were unaffected by sex of cagemates. Within rearing conditions, however, males engaged in greater play soliciting than females. The combined results suggest that perinatal gonadal androgen exposure effects on social play are prepotent and contribute essentially to sex differences in the initiation of social play behavior."

3219420,1,a,"The psychological consequences of cancer are most frequently reactive and do not constitute a major psychiatric illness. Anxiety and depression are the two main psychological disorders which occur frequently but with variable intensity according to the type of disease, its course, as well as the individual and social background of the patient. Physical factors such as digestive disorders, pain, mutilation and sterility can undermine the psychological adaptation. Cognitive impairment is generally due to neurological localizations of the disease or to metabolic abnormalities. The interrelationship between somatic and psychological factors must be carefully analyzed in order to recognize the determinants of suffering and abnormal coping or behavior."
12280405,1,a,"An overview of the relationship between demographic factors and rural poverty in developing countries is presented. The author examines both the micro- and macro-level perspectives of this relationship and the determinants and consequences of population growth. The author notes the prospects for a rapid increase in the rural labor force and considers its implications for the agricultural production structure and the need for institutional change. Consideration is also given to the continuing demand for high fertility at the family level and the role of infant and child mortality in the poverty cycle. ""The paper concludes by drawing attention to the need for developing the mechanism for reconciliation of social and individual optima with respect to family size and population growth."" The need for rural development projects that take demographic factors into account is stressed as is the need for effective population programs. (summary in FRE, ITA)"
30730217,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: We carried out a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the effect of centchroman on mastalgia as well as any side effects. METHODS: The databases of the Cochrane Library, Medline (PubMed), Embase, ProQuest and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched. The quality of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised clinical trials. The quality of non-randomised clinical trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomised studies of interventions (ROBINS-I). Owing to different outcomes reporting, a meta-analysis of the results was not possible. RESULTS: Thirteen papers were included in the study. Of these, 12 showed a significant effect of centchroman in reducing breast pain at 3 months. One study that compared the effect of centchroman with that of tamoxifen reported a significant reduction in breast pain in both groups at 3 months; the difference between the two groups was not significant. Six studies showed the effectiveness of centchroman at 6 months. None of the papers reported any serious side effects of centchroman. CONCLUSIONS: Since a meta-analysis could not be conducted and the quality of the papers was low, there was insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of centchroman on mastalgia. It is therefore recommended to conduct well-designed RCTs to compare the effect of centchroman on mastalgia with that of a placebo or other medication."
7208724,1,a,"A population of professional dance (N = 183) and modelling (N = 56) students, who by career choice must focus increased attention and control over their body shapes, was studied. Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. The influence of socio-cultural determinants are discussed within the context of anorexia nervosa as a multidetermined disorder."
28602765,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Human brucellosis and recurrent brucellosis is an ever-increasing public health concern, especially in endemic areas like Iran. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the epidemiology and determinants of recurrent brucellosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate epidemiological patterns and potential determinants of recurrent brucellosis in Hamadan Province during the years 2009-2015. METHODS: Data on reported cases of new and recurrent brucellosis from 2009 to 2015 were obtained from the provincial Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. Incidence rates per 100000 were estimated at the county level. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of background characteristics and recurrent brucellosis. The power of discrimination of the model for recurrent brucellosis was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Among 7318 brucellosis cases, the total frequency (%) of recurrent cases was 472 (6.45%). The rate of recurrent brucellosis was higher in females, people aged 50 years and over, people with a history of consuming unpasteurized dairy products with no history of contact with animals, and in the winter season. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.65), age >/=55 years (AOR 4.15, 95% CI 2.32-7.42), consumption of unpasteurized dairy products (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.40), and winter season (AOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.71) are potential risk factors for recurrent brucellosis. The final model that involved all the determinants showed moderate discrimination (AUC 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Female sex, older age, and winter months were found to be significant determinants of recurrent human brucellosis. Enhanced surveillance systems with an emphasis on these population characteristics will allow effective preventive and protective measures to be implemented and might alleviate the recurrence of brucellosis in the country."
29293954,0,a,"Social cognitive theory (SCT) is a well-known theory for designing nutrition education and physical activity programs for adolescents. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intervention studies based on SCT in reducing or preventing overweight and obesity in adolescents. An electronic literature search in PubMed-Medline, Web of Science and Scopus was performed to identify intervention studies based on SCT aiming at preventing or reducing obesity in adolescents. All the articles published up to July 2016 were included. Only studies reporting body mass index (BMI) or its variant as one of the outcome measures were included. From 240 initially identified studies, 12 met the eligibility criteria. Seven had moderate or strong study quality. Two of the eight randomized controlled trials (RCT) and two of the four quasi-experimental studies showed significant reduction in BMI among intervened participants compared to control. Impacts on diet and physical activity were mixed, but were mostly not significant. The current systematic review found only weak evidence for the efficacy of SCT-based interventions in treating and preventing obesity in adolescents. Further studies systematically using effective behavior change strategies or techniques, larger population sizes, better measurement tools and more robust designs are warranted for a conclusive judgment."
25196925,1,a,"According to life course analysis, age systems create socially recognized turning points, which outline life paths, channel people into positions and roles, and determine the distribution of rights and obligations. Yet few studies have examined these social parameters. Another problem with life course research is its ahistoricity. Even specifically historical studies have often been unable to measure the dynamics of change because of their use of cross-sectional household data, which only measures a small portion of kinship relations. This case study of the Mennonite family of Cornelius and Helena Richert Voth, who migrated from Russia to the Kansas Plains in 1874, analyzes the role that religious and ethnic traditions and inheritance rules play in preserving family stability, providing security in old age, and shaping the family life course. It contributes to our understanding of the social determinants of life course change by illustrating how traditional Mennonite patterns of family organization and property transmission, formed during centuries of community life in Prussia and Russia, shaped the timing of life course transitions and how the differing social, political, and economic conditions the immigrants encountered on the American frontier altered those traditional patterns."
29749300,0,a,"How might the science of men's health progress if research on marginalized or subordinated men is moved from the margins of the literature to the center? This commentary seeks to answer this question, suggesting that if more attention is paid to men of color and other marginalized men, the field will be greatly enriched in its ability to understand determinants of men's health. Reimagining men's health by moving men's health disparities to a primary focus of the field may yield critical new insights that would be essential to moving men's health to the center of health equity research. Focusing on the dual goals of improving the health of marginalized men and examining the determinants of disparities among men and between men and women will yield insights into mechanisms, pathways, and strategies to improve men's health and address health disparities. Current definitions of health disparities limit the nation's ability to dedicate resources to populations that need attention-men of color and other marginalized men-that do not fit these definitions. Moving marginalized men to the center of research in men's health will foster new ways of understanding determinants of men's health that cannot be identified without focusing on populations of men whose health is as influenced by race, ethnicity, and other structures of marginalization as it is by gender and masculinities. Using Black men as a case example, the article illustrates how studying marginalized men can refine the study of men's health and health equity."
3788206,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."
24511760,0,a,"Nowadays, antibiotics are widely used in aquatic animals to control and treatment of infections or as food supplement for growth increase and animal output. With increasing use of veterinary drugs in food production, there is global consideration about the consumption of antimicrobial residues in aquatic foods and their effects on human health. This study was aimed to evaluate the Oxytetracycline (OTC) residues in Rainbow trout meat in Shahre-kord (Iran) markets before and after frying. After randomized collection of 50 samples of fish in Shahre-kord markets in a six months period were examined. The prepared samples were examined for OTC residues using HPLC analytical method before and after frying. Results showed that 3 (6%) of the samples before frying and 12 (24%) after frying were having lower than Maximum residual limits (MRLs) in Codex alimentarius. However, mean OTC residues before and after frying samples were above MRLs. The mean amounts of OTC were 2260 +/- 1090 and 1110 +/- 930 ng g(-1) before and after frying, respectively. These findings show that the frying of fish reduces OTC residual. Nevertheless, the usage of OTC should be reduced to an acceptable level in fishery industry."

Moreover, employment policy measures with respect to foreign workers are described and their impact on the inflow and outflow of guest workers [is] analyzed."" The author notes that the ability of the government to influence migration flows through legislation is limited because of the free movement of labor within the Common Market countries. It is suggested that in-migration of foreign labor slows wage increases for the native worker, may retard rationalization, and increases the social costs of unemployment, particularly during periods of recession."
22511015,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHR) have the potential to improve patient care through efficient access to complete patient health information. This potential may not be reached because many of the most important determinants of health outcome are rarely included. Successful health promotion and disease prevention requires patient-reported data reflecting health behaviors and psychosocial issues. Furthermore, there is a need to harmonize this information across different EHR systems. METHODS: To fill this gap a three-phased process was used to conceptualize, identify and recommend patient-reported data elements on health behaviors and psychosocial factors for the EHR. Expert panels (n=13) identified candidate measures (phase 1) that were reviewed and rated by a wide range of health professionals (n=93) using the grid-enabled measures wiki social media platform (phase 2). Recommendations were finalized through a town hall meeting with key stakeholders including patients, providers, researchers, policy makers, and representatives from healthcare settings (phase 3). RESULTS: Nine key elements from three areas emerged as the initial critical patient-reported elements to incorporate systematically into EHR--health behaviors (eg, exercise), psychosocial issues (eg, distress), and patient-centered factors (eg, demographics). Recommendations were also made regarding the frequency of collection ranging from a single assessment (eg, demographic characteristics), to annual assessment (eg, health behaviors), or more frequent (eg, patient goals). CONCLUSIONS: There was strong stakeholder support for this initiative reflecting the perceived value of incorporating patient-reported elements into EHR. The next steps will include testing the feasibility of incorporating these elements into the EHR across diverse primary care settings."
6512485,1,a,"A sample of 129 supporters caring for an elderly mentally infirm relative consecutively referred to psychogeriatric daycare services was interviewed. Information was obtained on the problems encountered by their dependant, the extent of their involvement, the amount of formal and informal support received, the subjective strain and burden reported, and their expectations of their ability to continue in the caring role. An attempt has been made to use this information to describe the extent of strain and some of the determinants of strain involved in caring. The results suggest that the sex of the dependant and the age of the supporter together with the number of problems faced all influence the reported level of strain. The amount of existing community support, whether formal or informal, does not seem to mitigate significantly the strain placed on the principal carers."
7076787,1,a,"Mortality from ischemic heart disease has declined sharply since the mid 1960's in the United States and several other industrialized nations. The causes of this decline have thus far not been established. Six major strategies for investigating determinants of ischemic heart disease mortality trends are discussed in this review: (1) analyses of mortality data; (2) morbidity surveillance; (3) surveillance of change in medical care; (4) surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors; (5) social and ecological surveillance; (6) experimental and quasi-experimental community approaches. The rationale, problems and limitations of each are discussed."
29514629,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Prison health systems are subject to increasing pressures given the specific health needs of a growing and aging prison population. Identifying the drivers of medical spending among incarcerated individuals is therefore key for health care governance in prisons. This study assesses the determinants of individual health care expenditures within the prisons of the canton of Vaud, a large region of Switzerland. METHODS: We use a unique dataset linking demographic and prison stay characteristics as well as objective measures of morbidity to detailed medical invoice data. We adopt a multivariate regression approach to model total, somatic and psychiatric outpatient health care expenditures. RESULTS: We find that chronic infectious, musculoskeletal and skin diseases are strong predictors of total and somatic costs. Schizophrenia, neurotic and personality disorders as well as the abuse of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals drive total and psychiatric costs. Furthermore, cumulating psychiatric and somatic comorbidities has an incremental effect on costs. CONCLUSION: By identifying the characteristics associated with health care expenditures in prison, this study constitutes a key step towards a more efficient use of medical resources in prison."
7287277,1,a,"The linear regression procedure of stepwise elimination has been used to examine the association between a range of environmental variables and infant mortality rates (IMR) in Sri Lanka. The nature of the water supply was found to be significantly associated with IMR. Latrines were significantly associated with IMR once qualitative differences between districts were allowed for. Other 'environmental determinants of health', 3 indices of housing quality and the presence of electricity supplies, were not significant. The cost of effecting changes in IMR by extending subsidies to water supply improvements is estimated."
3305594,1,a,"In this article, the literature on body image and related obesity perceptions is discussed. Research findings which span a 20 year period are summarized. Initially, Cheryl Rittenbaugh's concept of obesity as 'a culture bound syndrome' serves as a rationale for understanding sociocultural dimensions of body size perceptions. In this regard, the premise that perceptions of obesity and overweight have cultural determinants is substantiated in the reviewed literature. Societal preferences for body build and size and attitudes about weight are examined as a framework for understanding the impact that social perceptions have on individuals who are either overweight or obese. As a result of negative attitudes toward fatness, stigmatization of overweight people has been consistently documented. In related studies, investigators have centered on self-perceptions of obese and overweight individuals. According to the data, the existence of body image disturbance among extremely overweight individuals is a common phenomenon. However, evidence is also presented that suggests that normal weight individuals (especially women) may also have difficulty in accurately assessing their body size. The final focus of this paper is the relationship between body image and weight change behavior. As indicated in the discussion, this area of research has received the least amount of attention in the literature, and the present findings are contradictory. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research directions."
27370020,0,a,"RATIONALE: Preclinical studies indicate that gonadal hormones are important determinants of drug self-administration. To date, little is known about the influence of sex and estrous cycle on drug self-administration in ecologically relevant social contexts. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the role of sex and estrous cycle in a rat model during cocaine and heroin self-administration with male-female and female-female social dyads. METHODS: Male and female virgin rats were trained to self-administer cocaine and heroin in operant conditioning chambers that permitted two rats to self-administer concurrently, but prevented physical contact. Experiment 1 examined cocaine self-administration on a progressive ratio schedule in male-female dyads. Experiments 2 and 3 examined heroin self-administration on a fixed ratio schedule in male-female dyads at constant and varying doses, respectively. Experiment 4 examined heroin self-administration in female-female dyads on a fixed ratio schedule. RESULTS: Cocaine-maintained breakpoints increased by approximately 17 % in females during estrus, but remained consistent in males. Heroin self-administration decreased by approximately 70 % during proestrus in females whether they were isolated, housed with males, or housed with females. Heroin self-administration was lower in males than females under some conditions and was not consistently associated with the responding of females. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine and heroin self-administration is influenced by the estrous cycle in females when in the presence of a male partner. As a novel finding, these data illustrate that heroin self-administration is reduced in females during proestrus regardless of the social context tested. Finally, these data suggest that drug self-administration in males is only minimally influenced by the hormonal status of a female partner."
31696080,0,a,"Background: Overuse and underuse of health care services are progressively recognized in all health systems around the world. There is evidence of overuse and underuse of health care services in Iran. In this study, it was aimed to summarize the evidence of overuse and underuse of health care services in the Iranian health care system. Methods: This study will be conducted in 5 steps using a sequential explanatory multimethod design, literature review, systematic review, qualitative interview, expert panel, and policy Delphi method. This study was approved by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (ethical confirmation number: IR.TBZMED.REC.1396.908). Conclusion: There is a strong evidence of worldwide overuse and underuse of health care services. Designing context-based prevention strategies by conducting comprehensive and systematic studies will improve the appropriate use of routine services and help patients, physicians, and providers make evidence-based decisions."
24569382,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Size at birth has taken on renewed significance due to its now well-established association with many health and health-related outcomes in both the immediate perinatal period and across the entire life course. Optimizing fetal growth to improve both neonatal survival and population health is the focus of much research and policy development, although most efforts have concentrated on either the period of pregnancy itself or the period immediately preceding it. METHODS: Intergenerational data linked to the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s (ACONF) study were used to examine the influence of grandparental and parental life course biological and social variables on the distribution of offspring size at birth. Guided stepwise multivariable methods and a graphical approach were used to assess the relative importance of these temporally ordered and highly correlated life course measures. RESULTS: Both distal and proximal grandparental and parental life course biological and social factors predicted offspring size at birth. Inequalities in size at birth, according to adult maternal socioeconomic indicators, were found to be largely generated by the continuity of the social environment across generations, and the inequalities in maternal early life growth were predicted by the adult grandparental social environment during the mother's early life. Mother's own size at birth predicted her offspring's intrauterine growth, independent of her adult biological and social characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: A mother's childhood social environment and her early growth are both important predictors of her offspring's size at birth. Population strategies aimed at optimizing size at birth require broader social and intergenerational considerations, in addition to focusing on the health of mothers in the immediate pregnancy period."

Data were also gathered concerning age, family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and school grade. Results were subjected to a multivariate analysis and showed support for a multidimensional model of locus of control. There was no difference in expectancy of control for negative academic events between delinquents and nondelinquents. In general, birth order and delinquency were the two most important determinants of locus of control. Results are discussed in terms of previous literature on locus of control with particular consideration paid to expectations of control."
7259481,1,a,"In 1973, 532 persons desiring to quit smoking and seeking the Hermano therapy of chirothesia were questioned prior to the ritual treatment session. Typical smoking behavior, social background, and personality tests were documented. At intervals of 4 months, 1 year, and 5 years after treatment the group was examined with a follow-up questionnaire. In two earlier studies Gmur evaluated the results of this treatment after 1 year and analyzed in detail the various factors which influence these results. The present paper investigates the determinations for success with a follow-up study 5 years after treatment. The analysis show that the treatment was seldom successful for persons with an accentuated addiction-like smoking behavior. There were no findings proving a correlation between personality pattern and/or sociodemographic data and treatment success. No criteria was found to suggest indications for the successful application of the Hermano therapy."
6573998,1,a,"The purpose of the present investigation was to study dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status in the adult Danish population. The study group comprised 5151 persons (86.7% of the original sample) who were interviewed in order to determine living conditions. Questions on dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status were included. 61% of the adult Danish population in the age group 20-69 had regular dental visits. Dental visit habits varied according to urbanization, age, sex and social group. Among well off persons 85% had regular dental visits as opposed to only 40% in the disadvantaged social group. Well off persons and persons with regular dental visits more often claimed good dental health than persons in the disadvantaged social group and among the non-regular visitors. In the higher social group 13% reported to have removable dentures in contrast to 51% in the disadvantaged social group. To isolate determinants of dental visits a multiple dummy-regression analysis was performed. Nearly 50% of the variation in dental visit habits was explained by the variables: urbanization, sex, age, perceived dental health status, education, work in exhausting jobs, income, social background and perceived psychological problems. Efforts to bring a greater part of the adult population in Denmark in contract with the dental health service system should consider these findings."

3446306,1,a,"The 800 census enumeration districts of Nottingham were used as a basis for the production of 12 distinct 'clusters' or neighbourhood types. Plotting the place of residence of the 68 patients with 'certain' or 'very likely' diagnoses of ICD-9 schizophrenia, identified in the World Health Organization Study of Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders, showed the expected concentration in central areas of low social status. A more varied distribution was found for 132 patients with a case-register diagnosis of affective psychosis, contacting the psychiatric services for the first time during the same two-year period as the schizophrenic patients. Some of the highest rates for affective psychosis were found in new housing estates of middle and low status at some distance from the town centre."

This review considers the impacts of social movements focused on urban conditions and health, on the health of children, and on behavioral and substance-related determinants of health and illustrates how these movements have significantly influenced public health activities and programs. We hope this review will motivate public health workers to make common cause with social activists and to encourage social activists to ally with public health professionals."
28564235,1,a,"One component of sexual selection is sperm competition. It has been reasoned that the intensity of sperm competition may be reflected in the relative testicular sizes of animals. Among males residing in multimale breeding systems, testicular size is relatively larger than among males residing in unimale mating systems. Information on whether differences in testicular size within a species can account for differences in male reproductive success is unavailable for natural populations of primates. A population of six troops of savanna baboons in Kenya was surveyed for morphometric analysis, and one of these troops was the subject of extensive behavioral observations afterwards. Testicular weights could not be obtained, but measurements of linear dimensions were transformed into volumetric estimates. Male weight accounted for 30% of the variance in testicular volume. Neither body size nor testicular volume was associated with differences in male reproductive activity. The outcome of fights over access to females could not be related to male body size, and ejaculatory patterns of males were independent of testicle size. Both sperm competition and aggressive competition intensified during the four-day optimum conception period, but fights over access to consort females were infrequent. Among savanna baboons, the probability of an ejaculation resulting in a conception is fairly low, which may account for the infrequency of injurious fights. Although testicle size influences sperm production, it does not influence either the timing of mating or the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa, and both of these factors probably account for a substantial fraction of the variance in male baboon paternity. Sperm competition is an adjunct to agonistic competition as a mechanism affecting male baboon reproductive success. It is concluded that male reproductive success in baboons is affected more by social factors than by morphological traits associated with size."

30585640,0,a,"Gallstones, a common gastrointestinal condition, can lead to several digestive complications and can result in inflammation. Risk factors for gallstones include obesity, diabetes, smoking and physical inactivity, all of which are known risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC), as is inflammation. However, it is unclear whether gallstones are a risk factor for CRC. We examined the association between history of gallstones and CRC in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, a prospective cohort of over half a million participants from ten European countries. History of gallstones was assessed at baseline using a self-reported questionnaire. The analytic cohort included 334,986 participants; a history of gallstones was reported by 3,917 men and 19,836 women, and incident CRC was diagnosed among 1,832 men and 2,178 women (mean follow-up: 13.6 years). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between gallstones and CRC were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by sex, study centre and age at recruitment. The models were adjusted for body mass index, diabetes, alcohol intake and physical activity. A positive, marginally significant association was detected between gallstones and CRC among women in multivariable analyses (HR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.99-1.31, p = 0.077). The relationship between gallstones and CRC among men was inverse but not significant (HR = 0.81, 95%CI 0.63-1.04, p = 0.10). Additional adjustment for details of reproductive history or waist circumference yielded minimal changes to the observed associations. Further research is required to confirm the nature of the association between gallstones and CRC by sex."

We used propensity scores to predict parent's witnessing status using childhood confounders; response models included inverse probability of treatment weighting and population weights for standardization. Separate standardized multivariate logistic regression models provided average treatment effects and 95% CIs for associations between childhood witnessing and below average health for: 1) adults who witnessed and 2) their children. Sensitivity analyses guided interpretation. Standardized models showed no differences in average treatment effects for below average adult health for witnesses vs. non-witnesses [0.04 (-0.12, 0.19)]. Conversely, children whose parents witnessed had considerably higher probability of having below average health than children whose parents did not witness [0.15 (0.02, 0.28)]. An unmeasured confounder would need 3.0-fold associations with both exposure and outcome to completely remove observed effects, indicating a moderate relationship. However, the lower confidence bound could cross 1.0 in the presence of a weaker unmeasured confounder having 1.2-fold associations with both exposure and outcome, while controlling for our same measured confounders. Witnessing during childhood did not affect adult health in our population, but we found moderate evidence supporting harmful intergenerational effects of witnessing on health, with parent's witnessing exposure affecting their child's health."
21299725,0,a,"The evidence for the individual, social and economic benefits of mental health promotion is now well established. The indication is that a broader public health approach that addresses social and environmental factors related to mental health and well-being is required. Mainstream mental health services, however, continue to operate in relative isolation, allocating the greatest proportion of funding and resources to the treatment of mental illness and disorder. Relevant to health promotion, this paper explores the bidirectional link between physical and mental health and the social determinants of mental health. The growing interest in the positive aspects of health and well-being which focuses on wellness rather than illness is also discussed. One example of how mental health nurses can adopt principles of positive mental health to education, practice and research is presented. The author proposes that as the largest professional group in health care, nurses must become more actively involved in initiatives that reorientate practices and services away from an illness culture towards the adoption of wider mental health promotion principles."
24958251,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In order to develop health promotion initiatives it is important to identify at what age gender and socioeconomic inequalities in health-related behaviours emerge. The aim of this longitudinal study was to analyse how health-related behaviours and weight status differed by age-group, gender, family socio-economic status and over time in three cohorts of school children. METHODS: All children in grades 2, 4 and 7 in a Swedish semi-urban municipality were invited to participate (n = 1,359) of which 813 (60%) consented. At baseline and after 2 years a health questionnaire was answered by all children. Height and weight was measured. Fourteen outcomes were analysed. The main and interaction effects of time, gender and parental educational level on the health-related behaviours, weight status and body mass index standard deviation score (BMIsds) were analysed by the Weighted Least Squares method for categorical repeated measures and Analysis of Variance. RESULTS: Nine of 12 health behaviours deteriorated over the two years: consumption of breakfast and lunch, vegetables and fruit, intake of sweetened drinks, TV viewing, club membership, being outdoors, and school recess activity; two behaviours were unchanged: intake of sweets, and active transport. Only sports participation increased with time. Girls consumed more vegetables, less sweetened drinks, performed less sports, were less physically active during recess, and had lower BMIsds, compared to boys. Those with more highly educated parents had more favourable or similar behaviours compared to those with less educated parents in 10 out of 12 health behaviours, the only exception being intake of sweets and being outdoors, and had lower BMIsds. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to our knowledge regarding the temporal development of health behaviours and weight status in school children. Differences with regard to gender and socioeconomic status were seen already at a young age. These results contribute to our understanding of several important determinants of obesity and chronic diseases and may inform future interventions regarding how to decrease gender and social inequalities in health."
25697582,0,a,"Physical activity's role in promoting health is highlighted in public health campaigns, news and current affairs, reality television and other programs. An investigation of audience exposure, beliefs and reactions to media portrayals of physical activity offers insights into the salience and influence of this communication. An audience reception study was conducted involving in-depth interviews with 46 adults in New South Wales, Australia. The sample was stratified by gender, age group, area of residence and body mass index. Most respondents could only recall media coverage of physical activity with prompting. Television was the primary channel of exposure, with reality television the dominant source, followed by news programs and sports coverage. The messages most readily recalled were the health risks of inactivity, especially obesity, and the necessity of keeping active. Physical activity was regarded as a matter of personal volition, or for children, parental responsibility. Respondents believed that the media had given physical activity inadequate attention, focused too heavily on risks and not provided practical advice. In Australia, there is a need to counter the framing of physical activity by reality television, and engage the media to generate understanding of the socioecological determinants of inactivity. Physical activity campaigns should deliver positive and practical messages."
29365191,0,a,"Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (EC) are an emerging form of nicotine replacement that has had a discernible increase in prevalence in the general population. Little is known regarding EC use among different military demographic groups or the extent of influence that social determinants of health may have on the behavior. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of EC use in a select population of active duty U.S. Naval personnel. This study is unique in that it allows for EC behavior comparison between a traditionally healthy demographic (aviators, a subset of aircrew) and a representative general military population sample. Materials and methods: Cross-sectional survey data were collected anonymously and analyzed in 2015-2016. Active duty Naval personnel (n = 977) were asked about ever trying ECs, frequency of use, and when was the last time an EC was used. Participants were assessed similarly regarding cigarette use. Descriptive and inferential statistics as well as multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted using categorical and ordinal variables assigned to usage and demographic factors. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Naval Hospital Portsmouth located in Portsmouth, Virginia. Results: Within the study population, 31.4% have tried ECs, 9.3% were current users, and only 3.8% were dual (EC and cigarettes) users. EC use was significantly associated with paygrade (enlisted), primary job duty (non-aircrew), and education (less than a bachelor degree, p < 0.001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively). ECs were used at some point as a smoking cessation tool for 43.6% of current EC users (p < 0.001), 21.6% of current smokers, and only 5.6% of former smokers. Continued EC use after ever trying ECs (30.0%) was only slightly more prevalent as continued cigarette use after ever trying cigarettes (27.3%). Smokers were nearly five times more likely to currently use ECs compared with non-smokers. Trying cigarettes was associated with nearly 12 times the risk for trying ECs compared with those who never tried cigarettes. No significant misuse of ECs was noted; however, several cases of drinking, tasting, and touching EC fluid were reported. Conclusion: This study is unique in that it examines the use of electronic cigarettes among selected healthy and baseline groups within the active duty U.S. Navy population. The current prevalence of EC use among active duty personnel is much higher than previously thought. Continued use of ECs after ever trying them appears to exceed that of cigarettes even among healthy populations such as aircrew. The findings of increased risk of EC use among those with lower income and less than a bachelor's degree suggest social determinants of health implications. This study sheds new light on EC use, characteristics of use, addiction implications, and highlights concerns for a growing health risk behavior."
31639862,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the need for a health workforce trained in recognising, understanding and acting on the social determinants of health (SDH). However, little is known about how current medical education prepares graduates to meet this challenge. This study analyses the extent to which content on SDH is incorporated in the German medical curriculum. METHOD: This work is based on a qualitative and quantitative content analysis of 3 key document groups, outlining what medical schools are expected to teach and defining what medical students are expected to know on graduation. RESULTS: The assessment reveals important gaps in the representation of SDH in key frameworks for German medical education. Only between 4 and 27% of the analysed document-elements contained reference to any SDH-related issues, with 0-3% of those elements containing explicit references to SDH. While some aspects were widely covered (e. g. topics of occupational health), other topics such as health inequalities or determinants outside of the health care system were not or hardly represented. CONCLUSIONS: A stronger and more explicit representation of SDH during medical education could help to prepare the new health workforce for current and future challenges in our globalised world. The current reform process of the National Competency-Based Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Medicine should strive to fill the gaps, e. g. by putting more emphasis on aspects of poverty and health, health inequalities and issues of access to healthcare."
29166399,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Regular consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) is associated with weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and dental caries. The UK will introduce a levy on the manufacturers of SSBs in 2018. Details will be negotiated over the next two years. How the UK public views SSB taxes is likely to be an important determinant of the content and success of the final policy. We aimed to capture the views, ideas and concerns of commenters on major UK news websites on SSB taxes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a qualitative analysis of reader comments to online news coverage of one proposal for an SSB tax in the UK. 1645 comments on four articles were included. Three underpinning themes influenced support or opposition to the tax: the balance between individual responsibility and autonomy, and population need; mistrust of the intention of the proposed tax and those promoting it; and variations in the perceived complexity of unhealthy diets and obesity associated with variations in what are considered appropriate interventions. Arguments under each theme were used to justify both support and opposition in different cases. CONCLUSIONS: As the final form of the UK SSB tax is negotiated, effort should be made to address the concerns we identified. Our results suggest these efforts could usefully focus on emphasising the social and environmental determinants of diet and obesity, reinforcing the benefits of the tax to the NHS, and pitching the tax as playing into a variety of different conceptualisations of obesity."
2489983,1,a,"The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods."
7390022,1,a,"A series of experiments was performed to examine the determinants of the rat pups' 1st excursions from the maternal nest into the novel environment outside the burrow. A standardized, nidic environment consisting of a maternal nest and adjoining open field was studied under a variety of structured test conditions. When the mother was outside the nest, pups readily ventured into the field. The early excursions were not stimulated by the mother's absence from the nest because when the mother was removed from the nest but not placed in the field the pups remained nestbound. Anesthetized dams elicited few excursions, suggesting that olfactory cues are less potent in this situation than behaviorally transmitted signals. Nonlactating adults were not attractive to pups but after induction of ""maternal responsiveness"" concaveated males facilitated egression. The data from a final experiment suggest that when in the nest, the dam stimulates egression by providing additional ""permissive"" stimuli that render the weanling more responsive to approach cues outside the nest."
23722326,0,a,"The University of Wisconsin-Madison Pediatric Pulmonary Center (UW PPC) provides interdisciplinary leadership training for graduate students and postgraduate professionals. The training includes a three-credit on-line course entitled Interdisciplinary Care of Children with Special Health Care Needs. This paper describes the course, the content and organization of which was guided by the life course perspective (LCP). The UW PPC team used the LCP to guide course organization, content development, and evaluation approaches. UW PPC trainees took responsibility for content areas, performed literature reviews and reviews of resources, and suggested student activities. Course content was focused on the child with special health care needs (CSHCN) embedded in contextual environments of family, community, culture, and larger social and public policy arenas. The content included three case-study videos that followed a child with cystic fibrosis from birth to age 18. Key concepts of the LCP were woven in throughout the videos and other course materials. Emphasis was on representing development of the individual during critical/sensitive periods and on social determinants of health. At semester's end, qualitative and quantitative student evaluation results were very positive for all areas of the course. The final course paper, organized similarly to course modules, synthesized all aspects of the course. A successful paper included LCP concepts woven throughout to show integration of course content. The LCP provided a useful framework for course organization and content, and served as a lens through which students came to understand the care needs of CSHCN and their families. A course such as this can serve the important goal of educating future maternal child health professionals in using the LCP to understand how multiple determinants of health interact across the life span to produce health outcomes in this population."
24056364,0,a,"Multilevel neighbourhood analyses rarely account for (1) non-residential exposures and (2) duration of exposure, which have the potential to improve contextual level variance explained, model fit and strength of associations. Using cross-classified logistic regressions, we evaluate the impact of socio-environmental factors at work and home on cardiovascular disease risk for 1626 adults in Toronto-Canada. In the fully-adjusted model, increased CVD risk was associated with poor food environments, lack of parks/recreational facilities, home and work proximity to a major road and noise, and working in a low-SES neighbourhood (p<0.05). Adjusting for exposure duration improved model fit and the strength of associations."
26421116,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Serum lipid levels are not only associated with etiology, but also with prognosis in cancer. To investigate this issue further, we aimed to evaluate the serum levels of lipids in association with the most important prognostic indicators in cancer patients at the start of chemotherapy. METHODS: In a retrospective cross-sectional study, using existing medical records obtained from 2009-2014, the data of all incident cancer cases in Iranian patients referred to the Semnan oncology clinic for chemotherapy were analyzed. Data on demographics, cancer type, prognostic indicators (e.g. lymph node involvement, metastasis, and stage of disease), as well as the patient's lipid profile were collected. We used multiple logistic regression models to show the relationship between prognosis indicators and lipid profile adjusting for age, gender, and type of cancer. RESULTS: The data of 205 patients was gathered. We found a significant difference in the lipid profile between different types of cancers (breast, colon, gastric, and ovarian). With the exception of high-density lipoprotein levels in women, which were higher than in men, the means of other lipid profiles were similar between the genders. There was a significant association between higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL >110mg/dL) in the serum and metastasis (adjusted odds ratio=2.4, 95% CI 1.2-3.5). No significant association was reported between lipid profile and lymph nodes involvement and stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested a benefit of measuring serum levels of lipids for predicting cancer progression. Increased LDL levels can be considered a predictive factor for increasing the risk of metastasis."
7424897,1,a,"The major epidemiologic characteristics of hepatitis A virus (NAV) infections in Greece were studied in a sample of 877 Air Force recruits, 19-25 years old coming from every geographic region of Greece. Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) were detected by solid phase radioimmunoassay in 83.8% of the recruits. Antibody frequency varied significantly in the various geographic regions of Greece and was inversely related to the size of the community. It was further shown that the prevalence of HAV infection was highly related to the recruit's social class and years of education as well as number of siblings and number of persons per room. These findings in accordance with previous reported data show that hepatitis A is hyperendemic and should be regarded as a childhood infection in Greece. Prevailing socioeconomic, hygienic living and housing conditions should be considered as the main epidemiologic determinants of HAV infections."
30753161,0,a,"Background Adolescents should be empowered to improve their reproductive and sexual health needs. The present study aimed to investigate effects of protection motivation theory-based education on student girls' reproductive and sexual health self-care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted in parallel on 90 female students living in dormitories of the Alborz University of Medical Sciences in Iran. The data collection lasted from January 2017 to May 2018. Convenience sampling was performed, and samples were put into intervention and control groups by block randomization. The intervention group received six educational sessions based on the protection motivation theory(PMT). The data collection tool of this research consisted of the protection motivation theory and reproductive health self-care questionnaires. Results There was no significant difference between control and intervention groups in demographic characteristics. The results of the repeated measures test indicated that the reproductive health self-care variable had a significant change (p = 0.000), and there was a significant difference between groups (p = 0.000). The total score of the Protection Motivation Theory Questionnaire was not changed over time (p = 0.54) and there was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.51) according to results of the repeated measures test. Conclusion According to effects of an educational intervention based on the protection motivation theory, it is suggested to utilize this model as an educational framework for adolescents' reproductive and sexual health by healthcare providers, schools and universities as well as holding periodic courses educating adolescents within short-term intervals in order to achieve the higher sustainability of the educational results."
6736597,1,a,"This article analyzes and criticizes the "" technocratic "" view of occupational health and safety policies, which sees the values of the personnel in ""post-industrial"" regulatory agencies as the most important determinant of those policies. It takes an alternate position, which explains occupational health and safety policies as primarily resulting from the different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor), and from the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It shows how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies explains Swedish occupational health and safety policies better than a mere analysis of the regulators' views. And it concludes that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to those in the U.S.--as the "" technocratic "" theorists assume--but rather offer more protection to the workers than U.S. policies do. This situation is a result of labor having more power in Sweden than it has in the U.S. The different class formations and class behavior in the two societies are compared, and the implications of this comparison for occupational health and safety policies are discussed."
7458619,1,a,"Three parameters of social function-socialization in the home, socialization outside to the home, and hobbies and interests--were analyzed to determine social reintegration of long-term survivors of documented completed stroke, who had already achieved satisfactory levels of physical function as measured by the Kenny self-care evaluation. A significant proportion of survivors manifested social disability, despite complete physical restoration. Much of this disability cannot be accounted for by age, physical impairment or specific neurologic deficits. The distribution of functional disabilities documented suggests that psychosocial factors, as well as organic deficits, are major determinants."
23500669,0,a,"Children with Asperger's syndrome show deficits in social functioning while their intellectual and language development is intact suggesting a specific dysfunction in mechanisms mediating social cognition. An action observation/execution matching system might be one such mechanism. Recent studies indeed showed that electrophysiological modulation of the ""Mu-rhythm"" in the 10-12Hz range is weaker when individuals with Asperger's syndrome observe actions performed by others compared to controls. However, electrophysiological studies typically fall short in revealing the neural generators of this activity. To fill this gap we assessed magnetoencephalographic Mu-modulations in Asperger's and typically developed children, while observing grasping movements. Mu-power increased at frontal and central sensors during movement observation. This modulation was stronger in typical than in Asperger children. Source localization revealed stronger sources in premotor cortex, the intraparietal lobule (IPL) and the mid-occipito-temporal gyrus (MOTG) and weaker sources in prefrontal cortex in typical participants compared to Asperger. Activity in premotor regions, IPL and MOTG correlated positively with social competence, whereas prefrontal Mu-sources correlated negatively with social competence. No correlation with intellectual ability was found at any of these sites. These findings localize abnormal Mu-activity in the brain of Asperger children providing evidence which associates motor-system abnormalities with social-function deficits."
3858734,1,a,"The level of private medical insurance coverage was studied in a sample of 1106 seven year old children and their families who were participants in the Christchurch Child Development Study. In the last seven years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of families who were covered by private medical insurance: in 1977 an estimated 18% of families had coverage and by 1984, this figure had risen to 43%. Levels of coverage were correlated with a large number of factors associated with family social background including single parenthood, low income, poor parental education, Polynesian ethnicity, depressed living standards, family size and parental age. However, multivariate analysis suggested that the primary determinants of insurance coverage were family earning power and family structure. The social implications of these findings are discussed."
6875802,1,a,"An experiment was conducted to test the proposition that alcohol is consumed as a function of the quality of past performances and the individual's level of private self-consciousness. One hundred and twenty male subjects were randomly given success or failure feedback on an intellectual task. They then participated in a separate ""wine-tasting"" experiment in which they were allowed to regulate alcohol consumption. As predicted, high self-conscious subjects who had received failure feedback drank significantly more wine than did high self-conscious subjects who received success feedback. Consumption by low self-conscious subjects fell between these extremes and did not vary as a function of success and failure. Additional data indicated that these results were mediated by differential sensitivity to the positive or negative implications of success/failure by high and low self-conscious subjects. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for theoretical accounts of the psychological antecedents of alcohol consumption."
21046908,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To correlate the occurrence of tooth decay with a social class indicator (occupational level) and the immigrant status in a sample of pre-school children in Veneto region. BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. CLINICAL SETTING: Twenty nursery schools in the area of Health District n.15. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,410 children aged 3 to 5 years old visited between September 2005-May 2006. OUTCOMES: Occurrence of dental caries into dentine threshold was made visually and confirmed with a probe when necessary by two calibrated examiners. Information on immigrant status and occupational level of parents was obtained by a questionnaire. Children were categorized as immigrant or non-immigrant on the basis of their mother's country of origin. Means and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables; for categorical variables the results were provided as proportions. Comparisons between groups were made using Pearson chi-square test. The association between caries occurrence and the independent variables gender, age, immigrant status and family social class was evaluated by means of a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Caries occurrence was higher among children from lower social class families (1.7 +/- 3.2) than among children from higher social class (0.8 +/- 2.1). The prevalence of dental caries in immigrant preschool children was significantly higher than in indigenous ones (15% vs 40%; p = 0.000) while the severity in immigrants was almost 4 times higher (2.2 +/- 3.6 vs 0.6 +/- 1.8). CONCLUSIONS: Our data on preschoolers confirm the worldwide literature shared statement that social class as well as immigration status are determinants of oral health."
24302171,1,a,"Within our present health care system, there is a growing movement that argues that our perceptions of health and illness are in need of change. This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited."
2487128,1,a,"This report assesses current knowledge about the ecological determinants of child maltreatment and presents data from an aggregate study of co-variation between seven community characteristics and maltreatment rates. A review of these findings revealed literature in the early stages of development. Nothing is known about the ecology of sexual abuse, and studies of physical abuse and neglect have done little more than demonstrate co-variation between reported incidence and neighborhood population and housing characteristics. Study findings reveal that (a) five of the seven community characteristics are significant and independent correlates of neglect, and four are correlates of abuse; (b) the strongest predictors of both types of maltreatment are percentage of families with income less than 200% of poverty and percent of vacant housing; and (c) the pattern of co-variation between the two economic stress indicators and three inadequate social support indicators are consistent with the ecological hypothesis. Discussion focuses on interpretation of findings and recommendations for future research."
6695831,1,a,"The association between duration of breast-feeding and nutritional status was studied in a population-based sample of 802 children aged 12 to 35.9 months in Southern Brazil during 1982. The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis. These results are also consistent with a controlled trial on supplementary feeding in the Sudan."
7326949,1,a,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points."
17093748,1,a,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting."
22446140,0,a,"This paper examines the determinants of recycling behaviour among 200 university students from the perspective of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling technique. Findings indicate that environmental awareness was significantly related to attitude towards recycling, whilst attitude and social norms had significant impact on recycling behaviour. However, convenience and cost of recycling were not significant reasons for recycling. The study has enhanced the understanding of the determinants of recycling behaviour and has implications for schools and governmental agencies in educating and encouraging positive recycling behaviour. It also confirms the appropriateness of the TPB in examining studies of this nature. Further suggestions for future research are offered."

28360010,0,a,"According to the World Health Organization, mental distress and related illnesses are becoming leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Despite the influence of food insecurity on mental health, empirical understanding of this relationship in sub-Saharan Africa, where incidence of food insecurity is relatively high, is almost non-existent. This study contributes to the literature by examining the association between food insecurity and mental health in the Upper West Region of Ghana. We used Ordinary Least Square (OLS) to analyze cross-sectional data collected on household heads (n = 1438) in 2014 using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and the DUKE Health Profile. The results show that heads of severely food insecure (beta = 0.934, p </= 0.001) and moderately food secure households (beta = 0.759, p </= 0.001) were more likely to report elevated mental distress compared to those from food secure households. We also found that female household heads were more likely to report elevated mental distress (beta = 0.164, p </= 0.05) compared to their male counterparts. Our findings suggest the need to improve food security as a strategy targeted at improving overall mental health in the Ghanaian context."

31325358,0,a,"To better address the mental health and substance use crises facing youth globally, a comprehensive approach, inclusive of mental health promotion is needed. A key component of mental health promotion is policy intervention to address the social and structural determinants of health. Importantly, youth should be engaged in these efforts to maximize relevancy and impact. Yet, while there is growing interest in the inclusion of youth in the policymaking process, there is a paucity of guidance on how to do this well. This environmental scan reports findings from a comprehensive search of academic and grey literature that was conducted using the electronic databases: CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Google. Search terms included variations of 'youth*', 'educat*', 'engage*', 'policy' and 'policy training'. Thirteen English language training programmes met inclusion criteria. Analysis identified marked differences in programme philosophy and focus by geographic region and highlights the need for enhanced evaluation and impact measurement moving forward. This paper makes a needed contribution to the evidence-base guiding this key mental health promotion strategy, which holds the potential to address critical gaps in approaches to youth mental health and substance use."
3720261,1,a,"These case histories illustrate how medical, psychosocial, cultural and economic factors affect the elderly with chronic arthritis. Physicians need to be aware of their patient's attitudes, concerns, support systems and goals resulting from a lifetime of experience, to provide the most appropriate and effective care. 'Images of future are usually only caricatures of the present' (Starr, 1982), but based on current demography, one can predict trends for the future. It is likely that the elderly of the future will be better off financially, better educated, healthier, more politically connected and strident, but their social support systems will be less effective. The last stems from trends such as declining birth rate, an increasingly mobile society, diminished importance of the nuclear family, and the diminishing attractiveness of professions involved with providing maintenance care. This suggests that the physician and nurse, being the primary gatekeepers for the care of and services for the elderly, must be even more attentive to the non-biological determinants of arthritis disability."
2768294,1,a,"A life table analysis is made of the duration of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea in Orissa, India, taking one variable at a time using data from a baseline survey of fertility and mortality (BSFM) conducted on the lines of the World Fertility Survey. Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age. The durations of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea are strongly related."
4061712,1,a,"The extent to which the values attached to health states are similar in different cultures or social groups is important for understanding health and illness behaviors and for developing standardized health status measures. A cross-cultural study was conducted to compare the health status values obtained in a United States population (Seattle, Washington) with those from another English-speaking culture (London, England) on the Sickness Impact Profile, a standardized measure composed of 136 items. London judges rated the severity of dysfunction described in each item on an equal interval scale using the same methods of scaling and analysis employed in the Seattle study. A regression of English mean item values on US mean values yielded a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of -0.07, indicating that judges gave strikingly similar ratings to most items. Agreement was higher at the more severe end of the dysfunction continuum than at the least severe end, a finding consistent with the notion that what constitutes health is more difficult to define than what constitutes illness. While a universal conception of dysfunction may exist in English-speaking societies, the social and cultural determinants of health status values deserve more systematic study."
4049019,1,a,"This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6486090,1,a,"Associations between smoking habit, social class, body mass index, and diet were examined in 493 men aged 45 to 59 yr, selected from the general population and who had completed a 7-day weighed dietary record. Smokers were lighter than nonsmokers and had a lower body mass index. There was no difference in energy intake, but in general, smokers had lower intakes of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Exsmokers had similar intakes to nonsmokers. Manual workers tended to be shorter, had a higher body mass index, higher intakes of energy and carbohydrates, and lower intakes of vitamins and minerals than nonmanual workers. Social class had a greater effect than smoking habit on intakes of energy and carbohydrates, whereas smoking habit had the greater effect on intakes of minerals and vitamins. Body mass index was associated negatively with sucrose intake and positively with protein intake, smoking habit, and social class being less important determinants."
10281815,1,a,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious."
3384599,1,a,"Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological reasons were studied prospectively for a four month period in an Indian General Hospital. Psychiatric emergencies constituted only 2% of all emergency visits. Most of the patients were new except for 7.4% who were already registered with the outpatient services of the psychiatry department. Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 2:1. Self-referrals constituted 77% of the samples; 21% of patients were brought by police. Two-thirds of the patients were brought owing to the severity of their clinical condition and the rest, one-third, for medico-legal and social reasons. Approximately 80% of the patients sought consultation within one month of the onset of illness episode. First episode of mental illness was within last one year of the emergency room visit in 60% patients. Past history of hospitalization for mental illness was obtained only in 10% of cases. The pattern suggested that there was no misuse of emergency services by psychiatric patients although 20% of the patients presented with social problems only which required social rather than psychiatric intervention."
2707901,1,a,"This study examines factors which contribute to elderly abuse and neglect by caregivers in a domestic setting. Methodological and conceptual variations and problems in previous studies have led to considerable confusion as to the determinants of this important social problem. A more rigorous research design was used in this study than has been previously employed. Fifty-nine abused elders from a model project site for the study of elderly abuse were compared with forty-nine non-abused clients from a home care program in the same agency. Using a research instrument designed by the authors, data related to the following aspects of the lives of the elders and their caregivers were collected: psychological status, stressful life events, social networks, mutual dependency, and the nature of their relationships. The study indicates that members of abusive families are more likely to have emotional problems which contribute to interpersonal difficulties. Abused elders are not more dependent on caregivers for many of their daily needs. However, the abused elderly and their caregivers have become increasingly interdependent prior to the onset of abuse because of the loss of other family members, increased social isolation, and the increased financial dependency of the perpetrator on the elderly person."
12157840,1,a,"""This study attempts to trace the determinants of rural out-migration for a typical portion of the Canadian Prairies, namely agricultural Manitoba. In concentrating on the 'push' factors responsible for gross out-migration over the period 1966-71, the study considers aspects of several dimensions: spatial, economic, social, ethnic and demographic. However, in order to explore the ramifications of interaction between migration and these multifaceted factors, a model is construed which dwells not only on the forces responsible for out-migration, per se, but also on those capable of regulating rural economic structure and agricultural welfare."""
26147549,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The effects of social discrimination, job concerns, and social support on worker mental health and the influence of mental health on occupational health outcomes have been documented intermittently. We propose an integrated, theory-driven model to distinguish the impact of social determinants on work performance and injuries and the mediating effects of mental health problems. METHODS: The US Chinese immigrant food service workers (N = 194) completed a multimeasure interview; we tested the integrated model using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Mental health problems, which were associated with decreased work performance and increased injuries, also mediated relationships between job/employment concerns and both work performance and injuries but did not mediate the influences of discrimination and social support. CONCLUSIONS: This research reveals mechanisms by which social determinants influence immigrant worker health, pointing to complementary strategies for reducing occupational health disparities."
28221739,0,a,"Every aspect of society is dependent upon the health of its members. Health is essential to an individual's well-being, quality of life, and ability to participate in society. Yet the healthcare industry, even at its optimal level of functioning, cannot improve the health of the population without addressing the root causes of poor health. The health of approximately 46.7 million individuals, most of whom are low-income and racial minorities, is threatened by economic, societal, cultural, environmental, and social conditions. Poor health in any population group affects everyone, leading to higher crime rates, negative economic impacts, decreased residential home values, increased healthcare costs, and other devastating consequences. Despite this fact, efforts to improve health among low-income and minority communities are impeded by inequitable social structures, stereotypes, legal systems, and regulatory schemes that are not designed to take into account the social determinants of health in decision making models and legal interpretation. As a result, a large segment of the population is continually denied the opportunity to live long, productive lives and to exercise their rights under democratic principles. Health, equity, and justice make up the keystone of a functional, thriving society. These principles are unsatisfied when they do not apply equally to all members of society. This Article describes the social and legal roots of poor health and how health inequity, social injustice, and poverty are inextricably linked. For example, it provides an in depth overview of the social determinants of health, including poverty, institutional discrimination and segregation, implicit bias, residential environmental hazards, adverse childhood experiences, and food insecurity. It then discusses how the law is a determinant of health due to court systems that do not evaluate individual circumstances, the enactment of laws that perpetuate poor health, and the lack of primary prevention laws. It demonstrates how addressing these issues requires true adherence to equality principles and making justice and freedom of opportunity accessible to everyone. Finally, it recommends the creation of ""health justice,"" a new jurisprudential and legislative framework for the achievement and delivery of health equity and social justice."
30916821,0,a,"Protected areas are one of the most effective means by which biodiversity is conserved, but are often criticized for either neglecting the importance of local communities or sacrificing conservation objectives for political expedience. In the United States, federal protected areas can be designated via a democratic legislation process or via executive action, which allows for comparison of the ecological and sociopolitical context of these top-down and bottom-up processes. We compared protected areas resulting from congressional designation vs. presidential designation with respect to their ecological context (using measures of biodiversity and climate refugial potential) and sociopolitical context (using measures of local support for conservation and reliance on natural resource-based industries). We found minimal differences between these designation modes for both ecological and sociopolitical variables. These results suggest that presidentially designated protected areas tend to be no more burdensome to local communities and no less valuable for ecological conservation than more widely accepted federal protected areas such as national parks, and they provide new evidence to inform the current debate over national monuments."
6419709,1,a,"This double-blind, controlled study of XYY and XXY men found in a birth cohort of 4,591 tall men born in Copenhagen assessed evidence of delinquent and aggressive behavior and explored the role of hormonal determinants in the behavioral and psychological differences noted among groups. Information from social records, a structured psychological interview, and projective tests did not support the notion that men with sex chromosome anomalies are particularly violent or aggressive. Hormonally, XYY men had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than matched control groups. In contrast, XXY men had higher levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin, but low concentrations of testosterone. There was a significantly positive relation among all subjects as well as XY controls alone between plasma testosterone level and evidence of criminal convictions. A proportionate increase in testosterone levels was noted when subjects were divided into nondelinquents, delinquents without violent convictions, and delinquents with violent convictions. The relation between testosterone level and criminal behavior was not reflected in measures of aggression derived from the psychological interview and projective tests. There was no specific evidence that testosterone is a mediating factor in the criminal behavior of XYY men."
28989816,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To describe how select Social Determinants of Health (SDH) are associated with the burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among foreign-born persons residing in the United States. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) 2010 Risk Factor Survey data to investigate the independent relationship between SDH and HBV testing and access to care. RESULTS: HBV infected persons with insurance were more likely to see a physician than those without. Respondents worried about money to pay rent or mortgage were more likely to report HBV infection than individuals who reported they never worry. Compared to English speakers, Spanish-speakers were less likely to report HBV infection, Vietnamese-speakers were more likely to see a physician for HBV infection, and Khmer-speakers were less likely to be tested. CONCLUSIONS: Health insurance coverage, worries about paying rent, and language of interview all differentially affect HBV testing and linkages to care among foreign-born persons. Multi-sectorial stakeholder collaborative efforts should integrate resources to provide culturally sensitive health promotion campaigns which may improve HBV related outcomes."
7143281,1,a,"Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae. Aspects of coping problems, primarily the disease-related, but also those of intra- and inter-personal nature are discussed."
28386989,0,a,"AIM: In the present study, we evaluated the direct and mediating (indirect) effects of clinical oral conditions, dental anxiety, sense of coherence (SOC), and socioeconomic variables on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and general health-related quality of life (GHRQoL) in Iranian adolescents. METHODS: A longitudinal design was used with a sample of 1052 (694 males, mean age=15.05 years) schoolchildren from Qazvin, Iran. Each participant completed a background information sheet and the following scales at baseline: Modified Dental Anxiety Scale, SOC, PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scale, and PedsQL Oral Health Scale. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core and Oral Health scales were recompleted at the 18-mo follow up. RESULTS: Father's education, monthly family income, dental anxiety, Community Periodontal Index (CPI), decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT), and SOC significantly and directly predicted OHRQoL at 18 mo. Father's education had indirect effects on OHRQoL through CPI and DMFT, family income had indirect effects through DMFT, and dental anxiety had indirect effects through CPI. OHRQoL at 18 mo (beta=0.499) and SOC (beta=0.084) had significant and direct and mediating effects through OHRQoL on GHRQoL, while father's education, monthly family income, dental anxiety, CPI, and DMFT only showed mediating effects. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical oral indicators had direct effects on OHRQoL, but mediated the effects of dental anxiety and socioeconomic status on both OHRQoL and GHRQoL."
7241029,1,a,"Differences were analysed between growth patterns and determinants of physical growth in two groups of normal infants at 24 months. Longitudinal data routinely collected in a mother and child clinic were analysed. At 24 months, 26% of cohort infants were at or below the 10th percentile for length (= 'small' infants); 98 of these were compared with 83 'medium' infants (between the 50th and the 75th percentile, for example). Excessive downward deviation of length percentiles was seen in 80% of 'small' infants. In 20% their birthweight was on the 10th percentile or below; 50% had a mother less than 155 cm tall; maternal stature was closely linked with socioeconomic factors. Of mothers with less than nine years of schooling, 70% had 'small' infants. In 95% of both groups growth attainment at two years could be predicted from data at 12 months. The known factors influencing deviant physical growth overlap with those of mental and social development. Growth deviation by itself may identify infants open to multiple risks, especially if their mothers have a low educational level. Further narrowing of the target group for specialised intervention strategies should be attempted."
24569969,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the experience of select cities in the Americas using the Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART) launched by the World Health Organization in 2010 and to determine its utility in supporting government efforts to improve health equity using the social determinants of health (SDH) approach. METHODS: The Urban HEART experience was evaluated in four cities from 2010-2013: Guarulhos (Brazil), Toronto (Canada), and Bogota and Medellin (Colombia). Reports were submitted by Urban HEART teams in each city and supplemented by first-hand accounts of key informants. The analysis considered each city's networks and the resources it used to implement Urban HEART; the process by which each city identified equity gaps and prioritized interventions; and finally, the facilitators and barriers encountered, along with next steps. RESULTS: In three cities, local governments spearheaded the process, while in the fourth (Toronto), academia initiated and led the process. All cities used Urban HEART as a platform to engage multiple stakeholders. Urban HEART's Matrix and Monitor were used to identify equity gaps within cities. While Bogota and Medellin prioritized among existing interventions, Guarulhos adopted new interventions focused on deprived districts. Actions were taken on intermediate determinants, e.g., health systems access, and structural SDH, e.g., unemployment and human rights. CONCLUSIONS: Urban HEART provides local governments with a simple and systematic method for assessing and responding to health inequity. Through the SDH approach, the tool has provided a platform for intersectoral action and community involvement. While some areas of guidance could be strengthened, Urban HEART is a useful tool for directing local action on health inequities, and should be scaled up within the Region of the Americas, building upon current experience."
2928145,1,a,"Reward allocation in selected American universities was investigated using tenure receipt as the most valuable faculty reward. Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review."
27578563,0,a,"What are the determinants of altruism? While economists assume that altruism is mainly driven by fairness norms, social psychologists consider empathy to be a key motivator for altruistic behavior. To unite these two theories, we conducted an experiment in which we compared behavior in a standard economic game that assesses altruism (the so-called Dictator Game) with a Dictator Game in which participants' behavioral choices were preceded either by an empathy induction or by a control condition without empathy induction. The results of this within-subject manipulation show that the empathy induction substantially increased altruistic behavior. Moreover, the increase in experienced empathy predicted over 40% of the increase in sharing behavior. These data extend standard economic theories that altruism is based on fairness considerations, by showing that empathic feelings can be a key motivator for altruistic behavior in economic interactions."
28837566,0,a,"The use of the Internet and social applications has many benefits for the elderly, but numerous investigations have shown that the elderly do not perceive online social networks as a friendly social environment. Therefore, TreeIt, a social application specifically designed for the elderly, was developed for this study. In the TreeIt application, seven mechanisms promoting social interaction were designed to allow older adults to use social networking sites (SNSs) to increase social connection, maintain the intensity of social connections and strengthen social experience. This study's main objective was to investigate how user interface design affects older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. Fourteen user interface evaluation heuristics proposed by Zhang et al. were adopted as the criteria to assess user interface usability and further grouped into three categories: system support, user interface design and navigation. The technology acceptance model was adopted to assess older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. One hundred and one elderly persons were enrolled in this study as subjects, and the results showed that all of the hypotheses proposed in this study were valid: system support and perceived usefulness had a significant effect on behavioral intention; user interface design and perceived ease of use were positively correlated with perceived usefulness; and navigation exerted an influence on perceived ease of use. The results of this study are valuable for the future development of social applications for the elderly."
2705972,1,a,This paper discusses the basic directions of research carried out in Poland during the years 1981-86 within the Polish Academy of Science project 06.7. The subject matter concerns: individual and situational determinants of human functioning in stress conditions; functioning of a human in extreme conditions; and load imposition through activities requiring risk-taking decisions.
28476461,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether social determinants of health (SDH) risk adjustment changes hospital-level performance on the 30-day Pediatric All-Condition Readmission (PACR) measure and improves fit and accuracy of discharge-level models. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all hospital discharges meeting criteria for the PACR from 47 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information database from January to December 2014. We built four nested regression models by sequentially adding risk adjustment factors as follows: chronic condition indicators (CCIs); PACR patient factors (age and sex); electronic health record-derived SDH (race, ethnicity, payer), and zip code-linked SDH (families below poverty level, vacant housing units, adults without a high school diploma, single-parent households, median household income, unemployment rate). For each model, we measured the change in hospitals' readmission decile-rank and assessed model fit and accuracy. RESULTS: For the 458 686 discharges meeting PACR inclusion criteria, in multivariable models, factors associated with higher discharge-level PACR measure included age <1 year, female sex, 1 of 17 CCIs, higher CCI count, Medicaid insurance, higher median household income, and higher percentage of single-parent households. Adjustment for SDH made small but significant improvements in fit and accuracy of discharge-level PACR models, with larger effect at the hospital level, changing decile-rank for 17 of 47 hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: We found that risk adjustment for SDH changed hospitals' readmissions rate rank order. Hospital-level changes in relative readmissions performance can have considerable financial implications; thus, for pay for performance measures calculated at the hospital level, and for research associated therewith, our findings support the inclusion of SDH variables in risk adjustment."
7390022,1,a,"A series of experiments was performed to examine the determinants of the rat pups' 1st excursions from the maternal nest into the novel environment outside the burrow. A standardized, nidic environment consisting of a maternal nest and adjoining open field was studied under a variety of structured test conditions. When the mother was outside the nest, pups readily ventured into the field. The early excursions were not stimulated by the mother's absence from the nest because when the mother was removed from the nest but not placed in the field the pups remained nestbound. Anesthetized dams elicited few excursions, suggesting that olfactory cues are less potent in this situation than behaviorally transmitted signals. Nonlactating adults were not attractive to pups but after induction of ""maternal responsiveness"" concaveated males facilitated egression. The data from a final experiment suggest that when in the nest, the dam stimulates egression by providing additional ""permissive"" stimuli that render the weanling more responsive to approach cues outside the nest."
7020985,1,a,"The association between reported alcohol intake and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration is examined in an effort to establish whether it was a cause-and-effect basis. A cross-sectional descriptive study of several populations reveals a strong and consistent dose-response pattern: Social drinkers have mean HDL cholesterol levels that are higher than those of teetotalers by as much as 33%. Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period. The evidence supports the conclusion that alcohol habits are probably one of the determinants of plasma HDL cholesterol level. A clarification of the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical medicine awaits future clinical efforts."
23069774,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Childhood adversities may be important determinants of later illnesses and poor health behaviour. However, large-scale prospective studies on the associations between childhood adversities and the onset of asthma in adulthood are lacking. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with 7-year follow-up. SETTING: Nationally representative study. Data were collected from the Health and Social Support (HeSSup) survey and national registers. PARTICIPANTS: The participants represent the Finnish population from the following age groups: 20-24, 30-34, 40-44, and 50-54 years at baseline in 1998 (24 057 survey participants formed the final cohort of this study). The occurrence of childhood adversities was assessed at baseline with a six-item survey scale. The analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, behavioural health risks and common mental disorders. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The survey data were linked to data from national health registers on incident asthma during a 7-year follow-up to define new-onset asthma cases with verified diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 12 126 (59%) participants reported that they encountered a childhood adversity. Of them 3677 (18% of all) endured three to six adversities. During a follow-up of 7 years, 593 (2.9%) participants were diagnosed with incident asthma. Those who reported three or more childhood adversities had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.31 to 2.01) greater risk of asthma compared to those without childhood adversities. This hazard attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjustment for conventional risk factors (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: Adults who report having encountered adversities in childhood may have an increased risk of developing asthma."
24351387,0,a,"The non-universal nature of health services in India can also be the result of many reforms and milestones the health services had passed through since independence. The reform era during the post-nineties is replete with many new trends in organizational strategies which could have led to crises in health services. The salient crises need to be dissected from a larger societal crisis and the specific crises in the health services system. It is evident that non-accessibility and non-availability and the sub-optimal functioning of the primary health centers are perennial issues which could not be addressed by indigenous, imposed or cocktail reforms (such as National Rural Health Mission) and by targeting as these only tinker with the health services. Needless to reiterate that there is a need to address the social dimensions which fall outside the technical sphere of health services. This paper based on an analytical review of relevant literature concludes that any efforts to universalize health and health-care can not only focus on technical components but need to address the larger social determinants and especially the societal crisis, which engender ill-health."
26679449,0,a,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether empirically selected and social cognitive theory-based factors, including baseline characteristics and modifiable behavioral and psychosocial factors, were determinants of physical activity (PA) maintenance in breast cancer survivors (BCSs) six months after a PA intervention.. DESIGN: Single-group longitudinal study.. SETTING: The Breast Health Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.. SAMPLE: 42 survivors with stage 0-III breast cancer who completed chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.. METHODS: The community-based PA intervention included six weekly education and practice sessions on home-based aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility exercises.. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: The dependent variable, PA maintenance, was determined based on PA level measurement at six months postintervention. The independent variables of baseline characteristics (age, stage of cancer, and chronic musculoskeletal symptoms) and modifiable behavioral and psychosocial factors (PA level, fatigue, PA self-efficacy in overcoming barriers and performing tasks) were assessed at baseline and postintervention.. FINDINGS: Multivariate regression analyses revealed that baseline fatigue and chronic musculoskeletal symptoms were the only factors significantly associated with PA maintenance.. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline fatigue level and chronic musculoskeletal symptoms were significant determinants of PA maintenance in breast cancer survivors who had completed a community-based PA intervention. However, other key factors were considered.. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Prior to participation in community-based PA interventions, clinicians should take into account the effects of high baseline fatigue levels and chronic musculoskeletal symptoms on potential PA maintenance, and consider additional assessments and support for BCSs to sustain their PA behavioral change.."
26619045,0,a,"IMPORTANCE: Atopic disease is associated with chronic inflammation, food allergen avoidance, and use of systemic immunosuppressant medications. All these factors have been shown to be associated with anemia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether atopic disease is associated with increased risk of childhood anemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey and laboratory assessment were conducted using data from the 1997-2013 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) that included 207,007 children and adolescents and the 1999-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that included 30,673 children and adolescents. Analysis of the data was conducted between August 1, 2014, and August 28, 2015. EXPOSURES: Caregiver-reported history of eczema, asthma, hay fever, and/or food allergy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Anemia was defined by caregiver report in the NHIS and by hemoglobin levels for age and sex in the NHANES. RESULTS: Data were collected on 207,007 children and adolescents from NHIS, representing all pediatric age, sex, racial/ethnic, household educational level, and income groups. The US prevalence was 9.5% (95% CI, 9.4%-9.7%) from all years of the NHIS for health care-diagnosed eczema, 12.8% (95% CI, 12.6%-13.0%) for asthma, 17.1% (95% CI, 16.9%-17.3%) for hay fever, 4.2% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.3%) for food allergy, and 1.1% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.2%) for anemia. In multivariable logistic regression models controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, annual household income, highest educational level in the family, insurance coverage, number of persons in the household, birthplace in the United States, and history of asthma, hay fever, and food allergy, anemia was associated with eczema in 14 of 17 studies, asthma in 11, hay fever in 12, and food allergy in 12. In multivariable analysis across the NHIS (with results reported as adjusted odds ratios [95% CIs]), children with any eczema (1.83; 1.58-2.13), asthma (1.31; 1.14-1.51), hay fever (1.57; 1.36-1.81), and food allergy (2.08; 1.71-2.52) had higher odds of anemia (P < .001 for all). In the NHANES, current history of asthma (1.33; 1.04-1.70; P = .02) and eczema (1.93; 1.04-3.59; P = .04) were associated with higher odds of anemia, particularly microcytic anemia (asthma: 1.61; 1.09-2.38; P = .02; eczema: 2.03; 1.20-3.46; P = .009) while history of hay fever was not associated with anemia (0.85; 0.62-1.17; P = .33). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The association between atopic disease and anemia was reproducible in multiple cohorts. Future studies are needed to identify the determinants of association between atopic disease and anemia."
29024081,0,a,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that can occur in any area of the urinary tract which is characterized by a positive urine culture (U/C). The risk of UTI following cesarean section (CS) increases due to procedures such as catheterization. In vitro studies have demonstrated the effect of Rosa canina fruit in preventing Escherichia coli growth. This study was conducted to determine the effect of R. canina fruit in preventing the incidence of UTI in women following CS. This triple-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2016 on 400 women following CS with negative U/C in Alzahra and Taleghani educational hospitals in the city of Tabriz-Iran. Participants were assigned into two groups of 200 women using block randomization. Each group received a twice daily dose of 500 mg capsules containing R. canina or placebo from the second day after CS for 20 days. Women were assessed by U/C on the 7th-10th and 20th days following CS. UTI was significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control in the follow-ups conducted on the 7th-10th days (odds ratio = 0.22; confidence interval 95% [0.07, 0.67]; p = .006) and 20th day (odds ratio = 0.32; confidence interval 95% [0.14, 0.75]; p = .008). But the incidence of cystitis in the two groups was not statistically significant (p > .05). R. canina fruit capsules were able to reduce the incidence of UTI after CS. Thus, it is likely that administration of this medication can promote maternal health following CS."
7371381,1,a,"The intent of this paper is to present a representative, though not exhaustive, overview of the current literature on social networks, with an emphasis on research linking social networks to psychological adaptation. This overview includes a review of social network concepts; and analysis of the multiple determinants of social networks; an analysis of the varied effects of social networks; and the implications for policies and practices of community mental health centers. This paper adopts the view that the concept of social network is a useful tool in examining both the functional and the dysfunctional influences of one's primary group on individual adaption."
6667732,1,a,"An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3293236,1,a,"Cancer of the esophagus poses a unique challenge for students of cancer prevention. The role of nutritional determinants and other environmental factors in modulating esophageal cancer has received increasing support from data collected during the last decades. Ecologic, geographic, economic, and cultural variables appear to be collectively operational in determining the nutritional profiles of high-risk populations in the Asian esophageal cancer belt and discrete hyperendemic pockets throughout the world. Altering dietary staples, preventing food contamination by mycotoxins, using molybdenum as a chemical fertilizer, modifying social habits, and adding deficient micronutrients to diets of high-risk groups will potentially avert the development of this devastating malignant neoplasm."
23975798,0,a,"Individual risk assessment and behavior change dominate the content of high school health education instruction whereas broader social, political, and economic factors that influence health-known as upstream causes-are less commonly considered. With input from instructors and students, we developed a 10-lesson experiential Public Health Advocacy Curriculum that uses classroom-based activities to teach high school students about the upstream causes of health and engages them in community-based health advocacy. The Curriculum, most suitable for health- or advocacy-related elective classes or after-school programs, may be taught in its entirety or as single lessons integrated into existing coursework. Although students at many schools are using the Curriculum, it has been formally evaluated with 110 predominantly Latino students at one urban and one semirural public high school in Northern California (six classes). In pre-post surveys, students showed highly significant and positive changes in the nine questions that covered the three main Curriculum domains (Upstream Causes, Community Exploration, and Public Health Advocacy), p values .02 to <.001. The Curriculum is being widely disseminated without charge to local, national, and international audiences, with the objective of grooming a generation of youth who are committed to the public health perspective to health."
31798898,0,a,"Objective: Investigating demographic and socioeconomic factors as intersecting rather than as separate dimensions may improve our understanding of the heterogeneous distribution of type 2 diabetes in the population. However, this complexity has scarcely been investigated and we still do not know the accuracy of these factors for predicting type 2 diabetes. Improved understanding of the demographic and socioeconomic disparities predicting type 2 diabetes risk in the population would contribute to more precise and effective public health interventions. Research design and methods: We analyzed the risk of type 2 diabetes among 4 334 030 individuals aged 40-84 years who by 2010 had resided in Sweden for at least 5 years. We stratified the study population into 120 strata defined by categories of age, gender, income, education, and immigration status. We calculated measures of absolute risk (prevalence) and relative risk (prevalence ratio), and quantified the discriminatory accuracy of the information for predicting type 2 diabetes in the population. Results: The distribution of type 2 diabetes risk in the population was highly heterogeneous. For instance, immigrated men aged 70-79 years with low educational achievement and low income had a risk around 32 times higher than native women aged 40-49 years with high income and high educational achievement (ie, 17.6% vs 0.5%). The discriminatory accuracy of the information was acceptable. Conclusion: A more detailed, intersectional mapping of socioeconomic and demographic distribution of type 2 diabetes can assist in public health management aiming to reduce the prevalence of the disease."
31324185,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A huge number of people living with HIV/AIDS lives in developing countries. Thus, strengthening health systems in these countries is a prerequisite for improving disease prevention and care. After three decades of HIV/AIDS policy-making in Iran, conducting a comprehensive analysis on the policy process seems to be essential. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the HIV/AIDS policy-making process in Iran from 1986 to 2016. METHODS: This was a theory-based, multi-method and retrospective study. Interviewing of key informants and review of policy documents were concurrently conducted to identify and include further key informants (39 participants) and documents in the study. Framework analysis was used to analyse data. RESULTS: The mean age of participants working in HIV/AIDS policy-making was of 48 years and participants had a mean of 14 years of working experience. Findings were categorized as contextual factors, content of HIV/AIDS policies, actors involved in the policy process, and evidence use in the policy process. Contextual effective factors on the HIV/AIDS policy-making process were categorized into five major themes, namely situational factors, structural-managerial factors, socioeconomic factors, political and legal factors, and international factors. The HIV/AIDS phenomenon in Iran was identified to be deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of society. The HIV/AIDS policy content has, recently, been crystallized in the national strategic plans and harm reduction policies of the country. The policy process has been conducted with a solely governmental top-down approach and is now suffering from poor evidence and lack of sufficient consideration of contextual factors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a great need for change in the approach of government towards the issue and to increase the participation of non-governmental sectors and civil society in the policy process."

29757122,0,a,"The practice of operating room (OR) clinicians - nurses, surgeons, and anesthetists - is fundamentally about preserving life. Some patients, however, die in the OR. Clinicians are therefore vulnerable to moral and emotional trauma. In this paper, we discuss three forces that shape clinicians' moral and emotional experiences in OR care: biomedical values, normative death discourse, and socially (un)sanctioned grief. We suggest how each of these forces increases clinicians' vulnerability to feel traumatized when their patients die. We hope this discussion will stimulate clinicians and researchers to engage with social and cultural determinants of clinicians' experiences when patients die."
28673916,0,a,"Group size is a fundamental component of sociality, and has important consequences for an individual's fitness as well as the collective and cooperative behaviours of the group as a whole. This review focuses on how the costs and benefits of group living vary in female primates as a function of group size, with a particular emphasis on how competition within and between groups affects an individual's energetic balance. Because the repercussions of chronic energetic stress can lower an animal's fitness, identifying the predictors of energetic stress has important implications for understanding variation in survivorship and reproductive success within and between populations. Notably, we extend previous literature on this topic by discussing three physiological measures of energetic balance-glucocorticoids, c-peptides and thyroid hormones. Because these hormones can provide clear signals of metabolic states and processes, they present an important complement to field studies of spatial and temporal changes in food availability. We anticipate that their further application will play a crucial role in elucidating the adaptive significance of group size in different social and ecological contexts.This article is part of the themed issue 'Physiological determinants of social behaviour in animals'."
24627055,0,a,"The trend towards decline and stabilization of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil should be analyzed carefully, since aggregate data can mask regional or local inequalities in such a large and diverse country. The current study reevaluates the epidemic's spatial dissemination and the AIDS-related mortality pattern in Brazil. The study considered all AIDS cases diagnosed in individuals over 18 years of age and living in Brazil, as well as AIDS deaths recorded in 1998-2008. Three-year moving average rates were estimated, and a spatial analysis was conducted using a local empirical Bayesian method. The epidemic was only found to be expanding in the North and Northeast regions, while declining in the rest of the country, especially in the Southeast. According to the findings, the apparent stabilization of AIDS mortality tends to mask regional disparities. Social determinants of health and regional disparities should be taken into account in program development and policymaking."

Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves."""
31889953,0,a,"Objective: Assess the association between social and economic conditions and homicide rates in young people between 10 and 24 years of age in Mexico in 2017. Methods: This ecological study looked at the social inequalities associated with homicides in the population 10-24-year-old population in 2017 in Mexico, using secondary data sources for deaths by homicide in each Mexican state. Social inequalities in health were studied by measuring absolute and relative inequality gaps. Mortality rates were estimated using Poisson regression models. Results: In 2017, there were 8,094 homicides in the target population, predominantly in men (86.7%). There was high variance in inequality between states. Unemployment in the population over 12 years of age, households composed of people who are not family members, low school attendance rates, and income below the poverty line showed significant association with homicide rates. Conclusions: There is a strong association between social determinants and homicides in the study population. Policies and intersectoral actions should be implemented to help bridge inequality gaps and achieve better living conditions and higher levels of well-being and health for people and their communities."
29560849,0,a,"ABSTRACTBackground:Although foreign domestic workers (FDWs) play a significant role in caring for frail seniors in Singapore and are vulnerable to caregiving burden, there has been little research conducted hitherto. We explored caregiver burden and its determinants in this study. METHODS: FDWs (N = 221, Mage = 32.3, SD = 6.23) recruited from a hospital geriatric unit completed the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) administered in English, Bahasa Melayu, or Burmese. Univariate and multivariate regression were employed to investigate factors influencing caregiving burden in FDWs. RESULTS: Majority were Indonesians (60.0%), married (57.5%) with children (62.4%), with secondary-level education (59.7%), and providing care for >1 year (79.9%). Importantly, 25.1% reported physical health problems and 23.1% encountered language difficulties with employers. Univariate analysis revealed three significant factors associated with caregiving burden: nationality (p < 0.001), lack of privacy (p = 0.029), and caring for persons with dementia (PWD) (p = 0.001). On multivariate regression, FDWs who cared for PWD were 5.47 times (p = 0.013) more likely to experience burden, while FDWs who encountered language difficulties were 5.46 times (p = 0.030) more likely to experience burden. Filipinos FDWs were 9.73 times more likely to express burden (p < 0.001) compared to their Indonesian and Burmese counterparts. CONCLUSION: The study highlights caregiver burden in FDWs and potential ways to alleviate it by empowering FDWs with dementia-specific caregiving skills, providing language training opportunities, and supporting particular FDW ethnic groups with more emotional and practical help."
6856718,1,a,"This essay will attempt to show, citing evidence from diverse sources, that eye contact plays a central role in interpersonal relations. The eyes preface most new relationships, overshadowing other sensory inputs while transmitting a wide assortment of emotional cues. Visual behavior may at times prove decisive in assuring survival, in amorous encounters, and in clarifying interpersonal motives. Ocular performance, a final common pathway for many social, cultural and emotional determinants, is a crucial factor in defining relationships and in allowing reciprocal influences to be exchanged as persons relate. In psychiatric patients, ocular behavior may provide clues to diagnosis. A common finding in such persons is gaze aversion, a social avoidance phenomenon which indicates a desire to attenuate the interpersonal experience and thereby decrease anxiety."
2927118,1,a,"This article challenges the commonly held beliefs that there are few if any heavy drinkers among Asian-Americans and that different groups of Asians exhibit similar patterns of drinking. To explore these stereotypes, alcohol consumption patterns were compared in a survey of 298 Chinese, 295 Japanese and 280 Koreans in Los Angeles. Heavy drinking was found in each of the Asian groups. Gender specific logistic regression models were used to illustrate the differences in the drinking patterns of the Asian-American groups and to clarify the determinants of drinking. The greatest proportion of heavy drinking was found among the Japanese and the lowest among the Chinese. Having friends who drank was the only social factor consistently related to Asian drinking behavior."
3788206,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."
26743141,0,a,"Several mosquito species are vectors of disease; however, to understand their role in disease transmission, accurate species identification is of particular importance. Morphological identification is the main method used, but molecular techniques have emerged as a tool for the identification of closely related species. In this study, mosquitoes from the West Azerbaijan Province in northwestern Iran were characterized on the basis of their rDNA-ITS2 sequences. Nine populations of 6 species of mosquitoes belonging to the genera Anopheles, Culex, Culiseta, and Ochlerotatus were studied. To the best of our knowledge, ITS2 sequences of Culiseta longiareolata and Culex hortensis have been reported for the first time. In addition, ITS2 sequences of Culex theileri and Ochlerotatus caspius have been reported for the first time in Iran. Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS2 showed that subfamilies Anophelinae and Culicinae of the family Culicidae could be differentiated successfully and subgenera Anopheles and Cellia of the genus Anopheles were separated. The analysis showed that the genera Culex, Culiseta, and Ochlerotatus have diverged separately."
25343647,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Parents are a common source of alcohol for adolescent drinking. Few studies have examined the possible determinants of parental alcohol supply. We investigated the associations between parents' supply of alcohol, their attitudes concerning the supply of alcohol (personal norms), and their beliefs about other parents' attitudes and behavior (injunctive and descriptive social norms). METHOD: A web-based survey was completed by 490 parents of 12- to 18-year-olds from Australia (n = 251) and Canada (n = 239). Path analysis was used to test a conceptual model of the relationships between social norm constructs and supply of alcohol at home and for unsupervised consumption. RESULTS: Personal norms were the most important factor in parents' decisions to supply alcohol to adolescents for consumption both at home and in unsupervised settings. Descriptive and injunctive proximal norms were directly associated with supply of alcohol at home. Injunctive and descriptive proximal norms were indirectly associated with unsupervised supply through their positive association with personal norms. CONCLUSIONS: The path models identify personal norms relating to adolescent alcohol consumption as the variable most strongly associated with decisions to supply alcohol to adolescents both at home and in unsupervised settings, with associations between injunctive and descriptive norms operating via this pathway. Proximal norms have a more powerful influence on parents' personal norms than do distal norms. These associations have important implications for the design of interventions to reduce parental supply of alcohol and adolescent risky drinking."
28278009,0,a,"Despite significant health benefits of regular physical activity, over 60 percent of college women do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines to promote their health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a comprehensive construct including physical and psychosocial health functioning. The major purpose of this study was to examine the influences of individual (e.g., self-efficacy, enjoyment), social (e.g., family and friend support), and physical environmental factors (e.g., crime safety) on college women's physical activity and HRQoL. Participants were 235 (Mean age = 21.0 years) college women from a public research university located in the southwest region of the United States. They completed validated surveys assessing their perceptions of physical activity, HRQoL, and social ecological factors during the spring semester of 2012. The findings of three multiple linear regressions, entering individual factors first, followed by social and physical environmental factors, revealed that self-efficacy and crime safety were significantly related to physical activity. For HRQoL-physical functioning, significant factors were self-efficacy, enjoyment, and crime safety. Enjoyment was the only factor related to HRQoL-psychosocial functioning. These findings indicated that physical activity professionals need to foster safe environments, enhance self-efficacy, and provide enjoyable activities to promote college women's physical activity and HRQoL."
7124811,1,a,"Social desirability and intellectual limitations were investigated as possible determinants of two response biases--acquiescence and naysaying--among mentally retarded respondents. Results clearly indicated that naysaying and acquiescence occur more frequently among lower IQ individuals and naysaying occurs more frequently concerning prohibited behavior, whereas respondents acquiesce regarding desirable behavior. These results suggest that intellectual limitations predispose people to biased responding, whereas social desirability factors determine the type of bias."
20864722,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with sexual orientation among lesbians and bisexual women and compared the predictors of HRQOL between the 2 groups. METHODS: We used multivariate logistic regression to analyze Washington State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System population-based data (2003 to 2007) in a sample of 1496 lesbians and bisexual women and examined determinants of HRQOL among lesbians and bisexual women. RESULTS: For lesbians and bisexual women, frequent mental distress and poor general health were associated with poverty and lack of exercise; poor general health was associated with obesity and mental distress. Bisexual women showed a higher likelihood of frequent mental distress and poor general health than did lesbians. The odds of mental distress were higher for bisexual women living in urban areas as compared with nonurban areas. Lesbians had an elevated risk of poor general health and mental distress during midlife. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the standard practice of collapsing sexual minority women into a single group, lesbian and bisexual women in this study emerge as distinct groups that merit specific attention. Bisexual women are at elevated risk for poor HRQOL."
22517529,0,a,"Medical waste management (MWM) is an important public health concern worldwide. Although physicians must participate in medical waste management, their personal and organizational predictors in this process are unknown. This study aimed to the determinants of physicians' knowledge, attitudes and practices related to MWM in eight hospitals of Mazandaran province, northern Iran. A validated, reliable self-administered questionnaire was used including 30 questions about the respondents' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) and personal and professional variables. Of a total of 200 physicians, 150 persons completed the questionnaire (response rate of 75%). The average score (+/- SD) for physicians' knowledge was 6.50 (+/- 1.50) out of 10, whereas those for attitudes and practices were 4.44 (+/- 0.88) and 4.02 (+/- 1.35) out of 5, respectively. Surgeons and orthopaedists had the lowest scores, whereas para-clinical specialists and internal medicine specialists had the highest scores. The score of knowledge showed significant differences among speciality groups and the various speciality groups' scores differed significantly only for knowledge (P = 0.024) and the mean of total KAP was significantly different between educational and non-educational hospitals (P < 0.05). As hospital type and physician speciality was related to the KAP concerning MWM, therefore it is recommend that all hospitals should develop appropriate protocols for medical waste management based on the this variables using a participatory process with teamwork and continuous training."
30497404,0,a,"The area of ""deprescribing"" has rapidly expanded in recent years as a positive intervention to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy and improve health outcomes for (older) people with multimorbidity. While our understanding of deprescribing as a process has greatly improved and existing approaches all have patient-centered elements, there is still limited literature exploring the importance of the individual patient context in deprescribing decision-making. This is clearly an important consideration to ensure that any deprescribing approach is ethical, respectful, and successful. To address this gap in the literature, we have developed a conceptual framework in the form of a rainbow - with five different deprescribing determinants - and place the person at the center of the deprescribing process. This framework is informed by literature on patient-centered care for older people and people with multimorbidity. We illustrate the potential application of this framework to a complex patient case to highlight the importance of the different clinical, psychological, social, financial and physical deprescribing determinants, and how this approach could be adopted by those working in clinical practice."
23415046,0,a,"Teams participating in QI collaboratives reportedly enhance innovative culture in long-term care, but we currently lack empirical evidence of the ability of such teams to enhance (determinants of) innovative culture over time. The objectives of our study are therefore to explore innovative cultures in QI teams over time and identify its determinants. The study included QI teams participating between 2006 and 2011 in a national Dutch quality program (Care for Better), using an adapted version of the Breakthrough Method. Each QI team member received a questionnaire by mail within one week after the second (2-3 months post-implementation of the collaborative = T0) and final conference (12 months post-implementation = T1). A total of 859 (out of 1161) respondents filled in the questionnaire at T0 and 541 at T1 (47% response). A total of 307 team members filled in the questionnaire at both T0 and T1. We measured innovative culture, respondent characteristics (age, gender, education), perceived team effectiveness, organizational support, and management support. Two-tailed paired t-tests showed that innovative culture was slightly but significantly lower at T1 compared to T0 (12 months and 2-3 months after the start of the collaborative, respectively). Univariate analyses revealed that perceived effectiveness, organizational and management support were significantly related to innovative culture at T1 (all at p </= 0.001). Multilevel analyses showed that perceived effectiveness, organizational support, and management support predicted innovative culture. Our QI teams were not able to improve innovative culture over time, but their innovative culture scores were higher than non-participant professionals. QI interventions require organizational and management support to enhance innovative culture in long-term care settings."
29930110,0,a,"Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology."
27998026,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Patient-physician discordance in global assessment of disease activity concerns one-third of patients, but what does it reflect? We aimed to assess patient-physician discordance in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and patient-reported domains of health (physical and psychological) associated with discordance. METHODS: We analyzed the PsAID (Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease), a cross-sectional, multicenter European study of patients with PsA according to expert opinion. Patient global assessment (PGA) and physician global assessment (PhGA) were rated on a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Discordance was defined as the difference (PGA-PhGA) and as the absolute difference |PGA-PhGA| >/=3 points. Determinants of PGA-PhGA were assessed by a stepwise multivariate linear regression among 12 physical and psychological aspects of impact: pain, skin problems, fatigue, ability to work/leisure, functional incapacity, feeling of discomfort, sleep disturbance, anxiety/fear, coping, embarrassment/shame, social participation, and depressive affects. RESULTS: In 460 patients (mean +/- SD age 50.6 +/- 12.9 years, 52.2% female, mean +/- SD disease duration 9.5 +/- 9.5 years, mean +/- SD Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis score 30.8 +/- 32.4, and 40.4% undergoing treatment with biologic agents), the mean +/- SD PGA was higher than the mean PhGA, with a mean absolute difference of 1.9 +/- 1.8 points. Discordance defined by |PGA-PhGA| >/=3 of 10 concerned 134 patients (29.1%), and 115 patients (85.8% of the patients with discordance) had PGA>PhGA. Higher fatigue (beta = 0.14), lower self-perceived coping (beta = 0.23), and impaired social participation (beta = 0.16) were independently associated with a higher difference (PGA-PhGA). CONCLUSION: Discordance concerned 29.1% of these patient/physician dyads, mainly by PGA>PhGA. Factors associated with discordance were psychological rather than physical domains of health. Discordance was more frequent in patients in remission, indicating more work is needed on the patient perspective regarding disease activity."
7249932,1,a,"The authors have investigated reasons for medication compliance in a population of epileptic patients. The hypothesis that the health care belief model would be predictive of medication-taking behavior was validated. A pilot study was constructed which investigated the comparative responses of compliant and noncompliant epileptic outpatients to questions regarding demographic, clinical history, and attitudinal characteristics. Noncompliant patients were characterized as having a longer duration of epilepsy, more complicated dosage regimens, and more changes in medication. In addition, noncompliant patients both demonstrated more confusion over medication directions and less insight into the need for anticonvulsants and feared addiction to their medication. They had a lower level of satisfaction with their health care and were more frequently subject to the social complications of epilepsy. The authors suggest that a more holistic approach be taken when attempting to reverse noncompliant behavior."
3186028,1,a,"The pattern of disease in New Zealand is changing and will continue to do so. Some trends are predictable, while others (such as the epidemic of AIDS) may be unexpected. Analysis of past improvements in health suggests that medical research would be more productive if greater attention were paid to the external influences and personal behaviour which are the chief determinants of health. Apart from such general implications, analysis of the changing patterns of disease is vital as a stimulus and guide for medical research of all kinds. More effective monitoring of disease trends in New Zealand will require improvement in the quality and timeliness of routine health statistics, and training of adequate numbers of epidemiologists to analyse and interpret the data. Such developments are essential if medical research is to make a full contribution to the health of New Zealanders."

The present integrative multimethod research yielded a novel finding: that participants with more positive implicit partner evaluations exhibited more constructive nonverbal (but not verbal) behavior toward their partner in a videotaped dyadic interaction. In turn, this behavior was associated with greater satisfaction with the conversation and with the relationship in the following 8-day diary portion of the study. These findings represent a significant step forward in understanding the crucial role of automatic processes in romantic relationships. Together, they provide novel evidence that relationship success appears to be highly dependent on how people spontaneously behave in their relationship, which may be ultimately rooted in their implicit partner evaluations."
6584748,1,a,"Maori mortality is compared with that of other New Zealanders aged 15-64 in the period 1974 to 1978. For males, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the Maori excess in mortality is associated with marked ethnic differences in socio-economic status. Of the remaining excess, an estimated 15% is linked with cigarette smoking, 10% with alcohol consumption (excluding accidental cause of deaths), 5% with obesity and 17% was due to accidents. However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris. It is recommended that resources should be allocated so that Maori people can be employed to maintain contact with Maori patients with these diseases in order to improve health services utilisation and compliance with therapy. While it was not possible to determine socio-economic status for females from national mortality data, other findings were similar to those found for males except that mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease also contributed to the Maori excess."
3070761,1,a,"Medical compliance researchers have produced more than 4000 scientific papers in the past two decades, but their research into the determinants of non-compliance has been inconclusive. This paper argues that the popularity of compliance and the uncertainty over its determinants can be understood if compliance is analyzed as an ideology that assumes and justifies physician authority. I explore compliance as a problematic concept, looking at its assumptions and its influences on clinical practice. The concept of patient compliance has a social history linked to the struggle to create and maintain physician control over infant feeding technology earlier in this century. But while physicians were successful in that struggle, they have never exercised complete control over health care products. Compliance must be reconceptualized and its research reoriented if it is accurately to portray medication usage and related health behaviors outside the clinic."
3049068,1,a,"This article presents a critique of current models of preventive behavior. It discusses a variety of factors that are usually overlooked-including the appearance of costs and benefits over time, the role of cues to action, the problem of competing life demands, and the ways that actual decision behavior differs from the rational ideal implicit in expectancy-value and utility theories. Such considerations suggest that the adoption of new precautions should be viewed as a dynamic process with many determinants. The framework of a model that is able to accommodate these additional factors is described. This alternative model portrays the precaution adoption process as an orderly sequence of qualitatively different cognitive stages. Data illustrating a few of the suggestions made in the article are presented, and implications for prevention programs are discussed."
3686078,1,a,"Lifestyles of groups and individuals are significant determinants of the health status of a population. Behaviour with respect to such areas as alcohol, food, drugs, tobacco, physical exercise, etc., correlates with medical and social well-being and are thus on the agenda for modern health care. The present article reports a study of how such lifestyle habits, notably alcohol and tobacco consumption, are addressed in medical consultations. The results indicate that the areas of smoking and drinking are sensitive and that specific communicative strategies are used for introducing these topics and for eliciting information. Smoking habits are addressed in 75% of the consultations and alcohol habits in 30%. In most cases, the information exchanged is shallow and gives only a fragmentary picture of patients' habits. There is little evidence of attempts to influence patients' attitudes and behaviours and the physicians do not contextualise possible relationships between such lifestyle habits and health in the light of their medical knowledge. In this sense, a potentially very influential face-to-face encounter is not used as a vehicle for attempting to eliminate such significant causes of poor health."

2707518,1,a,"Using the Swedish childhood diabetes register, a nationwide, case-referent study was performed from September 1, 1985 to August 31, 1986. Based on the information from a mailed questionnaire sent to all incident diabetic children and for each diabetic child - two referent children matched according to age, sex, and county, we have analysed perinatal events and aspects of the social environment as possible risk factors for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in childhood. A significantly larger proportion of the mothers of the diabetic children were older than 40 years compared to those of the referent children (33% and 24%, p = 0.01 respectively). A smaller percentage of mothers of the diabetic children had a high educational level compared to mothers of referent children (10% and 15%, p = 0.03 respectively) and 39% of the fathers of the diabetic children were manual workers compared to 31% of the fathers of referent children (p = 0.03). Perinatal events did not differ between diabetic and referent children. In children 0-6 years, the duration of breast-feeding was significantly shorter in diabetic children than among referent children (median duration for diabetic children 5 months compared to 6 months for referent children p = 0.03). When considering the presence of Type 1 diabetes among relatives, maternal age over 40 years, low educational level of the mother, and the father being a manual worker as risk factors, the presence of 1 to 4 of any of these risk factors increased the relative risk for Type 1 diabetes cumulatively from 1.2-7.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3806448,1,a,"Social psychological models of health care behaviour frequently take as their starting point perception of the illness. This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed."

6128936,1,a,"The research, upon which this article is based is part of a program on ""Social Integration"" sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation. A sample of 4500 persons aged more than 59 years were interviewed in 1978. The theoretical approach was to identify the elements of successful aging under the conditions of swiss society, which are: the quality and degrees of independence and self determination of personality, continuity of the manner of living and adequate handling of the changing conditions of life in the third age including physical, mental, communicational and economic mutations. To reach this goal the survey measured the socio-economic conditions of the investigated population, their psycho-physical ability, how old people compensate deficits: the conditions essential for life, integration in leisure, private contacts, public opinions and political participation. The results show that a great majority is satisfied with the conditions of dwelling, occupation and economic conditions. But in all dimensions of life we also found minorities oppressed, threatened or deprived. Psycho-physical fitness proved to be in good state for a great majority and only a few percent were in a physical or mental condition which did not grant them independence and self-determination. This diagnosis was assisted by the results of two newly developed tests for meaning ability."
22077172,1,a,"Summary In order to unravel the complex set of the determinants of fertility, we suggest that the child-bearing process be separated into a sequence of events and intervals. As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval. The strong effect of ethnicity is consistent with a cultural interpretation, but important qualifications are noted."
3749967,1,a,Rumor and misinformation about oral contraceptives continue to prevail in much of Egypt. This study tests the hypothesis that rumor involvement can have a negative and independent impact on pill usage by focusing on a common misbelief that the pill causes 'weakness'. The data comes from a 1981-1982 national self-weighted sample survey of 3283 currently married men and women dealing with family planning and mass media behaviors. The analyses confirm that rumor involvement decreases the probability of current or future pill use by previous users and by those who have never used it. Correct knowledge about the pill is shown to enhance pill usage as do other determinants such as social support for birth control and the desire for no more children. The importance of providing strong contraceptive education programs giving deeper consideration to contraceptive and related health beliefs in delivering fertility regulation services is highlighted.
25731129,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Cities are important settings for production and prevention of non-communicable diseases. This article proposes a conceptual framework for identification of opportunities to prevent diet-related non-communicable diseases in cities. It compares two cities, Cape Town in South Africa and New York City in the United States, to illustrate municipal, regional, national and global influences in three policy domains that influence NCDs: product formulation, shaping retail environments and institutional food practices, domains in which each city has taken action. STUDY DESIGN: Comparative case study. METHODS: Critical analysis of selected published studies and government and non-governmental reports on food policies and systems in Cape Town and New York City. RESULTS: While Cape Town and New York City differ in governance, history and culture, both have food systems that make unhealthy food more available in low-income than higher income neighborhoods; cope with food environments in which unhealthy food is increasingly ubiquitous; and have political economies dominated by business and financial sectors. New York City has more authority and resources to take on local influences on food environments but neither city has made progress in addressing deeper social determinants of diet-related NCDs including income inequality, child poverty and the disproportionate political influence of wealthy elites. CONCLUSIONS: Through their intimate connections with the daily lives of their residents, municipal governments have the potential to shape environments that promote health. Identifying the specific opportunities to prevent diet-related NCDs in a particular city requires intersectoral and multilevel analyses of the full range of influences on food environments."
26817422,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Attractive toxic baits are the prevailing method for managing leaf-cutting ants in the eucalypt forests planted for the production of pulp, paper, timber and charcoal. For successful use in these baits, the insecticidal compounds need to circumvent the typical defences of the eusocial leaf-cutting ants. The challenge is to have an insecticide in the bait that will not directly harm and/or compromise foraging workers, but that will eventually suppress the colony. These underlying mechanisms are poorly known, and here the potential mechanism of fipronil activity in toxic baits for leaf-cutting ants was assessed using colonies of the representative Neotropical Acromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus (Forel, 1893). RESULTS: Although forager activity was not directly impaired by fipronil, the insecticide affected forager nestmate interactions (auto- and allogrooming) and waste removal and, more importantly, greatly affected the minor workers, impairing their activities of fungus garden cultivation and progeny handling. The fast decay of the fungus garden compromised the sustainability of the colonies, ultimately leading to their demise within 8 days. CONCLUSION: The behavioural effects of sublethal insecticide exposure towards minor workers are the main determinants of insecticide activity as ant baits and should be targeted in developing such compounds.

21870166,0,a,"In a prospective study conducted from January to December 2010 in the Teaching Hospital of Brazzaville (Congo), we compared the discharge of hospitalized children against medical advice at the parents' request (group 1 - cases) with those admitted during same period with routine discharge (group 2 - controls). Two hundred and seven (7.7%) hospitalized children, 117 boys and 90 girls, were discharged at the parents request. The mean age was 18.0 +/- 13.5 months (range: 1 month-5 years). Among these patients, 150 (72.5%) children were from biparental families, and 30.9% of children were the first and/or only child of the household. Among the parents of Congolese nationality, 147 (71%) had a secondary school level education, including 66.7% of mothers and 58% of the fathers 59.9% of children were admitted between 15 and 7 hours, and 75.4% were hospitalized during working days. The duration of hospitalization did not exceed 3 days in 147 cases (71%). The main reasons for hospitalization were digestive disorders (27%), fever (16.4%), convulsions (11.1%) and anaemia (11.1%). Among patients discharged against medical advice, 34.8% left on the first day of hospitalization (72 cases), 36.7% before the start of treatment (76 cases of which 36 during check-up) and 63.3% during treatment (131 cases). The main reasons for discharge request were improvement in the clinical condition improvement (30.9% of cases), lack of money (28% of cases), supposed insufficient medical care (7.7% of cases), unsatisfactory hospitalization conditions (6.3% of cases), care of other children at home (6.3% of cases), traditional and/or religious beliefs (5.8% of cases) and disagreements with nurses (5.3%). Patients discharge against medical advice was correlated strongly with the educational level of parents, age of the child, delay of consultation, time of admission, rank of the child in family and nationality of parents. Discharge against medical advice is associated to the distrust between the patients and nurses. Improvement of hospitalization conditions in our hospitals, improvement of the socioeconomic status of Congolese and establishment of national social security seem to be the main determinants of reduction of discharge against medical advice."

In response to such challenges, the Healthy Cities concept was instigated in 1977 that, along with the Alma Ata Declaration and commitment of countries at the Thirtieth World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, would empower communities to lead socially and economically productive lives. A number of policy documents from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other bodies suggested introducing new approaches to managing cities and addressing health challenges, focusing more on health determinants and prevention than medical interventions."
24354817,0,a,"Evidence suggests national- and community-level interventions are not reaching women living at the economic and social margins of society in Pakistan. We conducted a 10-month qualitative study (May 2010-February 2011) in a village in Punjab, Pakistan. Data were collected using 94 in-depth interviews, 11 focus group discussions, 134 observational sessions, and 5 maternal death case studies. Despite awareness of birth complications and treatment options, poverty and dependence on richer, higher-caste people for cash transfers or loans prevented women from accessing required care. There is a need to end the invisibility of low-caste groups in Pakistani health care policy. Technical improvements in maternal health care services should be supported to counter social and economic marginalization so progress can be made toward Millennium Development Goal 5 in Pakistan."
28411525,0,a,"In the United States (US) and elsewhere, residents of low resource areas face health-related disparities, and may experience different outcomes throughout times of severe economic flux. We aimed to identify individual (e.g. sociodemographic) and environmental (e.g. region, rurality) factors associated with self-reported health and forgone medical care due to the cost of treatment in the US across the Great Recession (2008-2009). We analyzed nationally representative data (2004-2010) using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in the US. Individual and geospatial factors (rurality, census region) were used to identify differences in self-reported health and forgone medical care due to the cost. Adjusted-analyses taking into account individual and geospatial factors among those with incomes <$50,000 identified multiple differences across time, sex, education, disability, rurality and Census Region for health. Similar analyses for forgone medical care found that those in the Recovery and the Recession were more likely to report forgone care than before the Recession. Having insurance and/or being employed (versus unemployed) was a protective factor in terms of reporting fair/poor health and having to forgo health care due to cost. Policies affecting improvements in health and access for vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income minority adults) are critical. Monitoring trends related to Social Determinants of Health, including the relationship between health and place (e.g. Census region, rurality), is necessary in efforts targeted towards ameliorating disparities."
6695831,1,a,"The association between duration of breast-feeding and nutritional status was studied in a population-based sample of 802 children aged 12 to 35.9 months in Southern Brazil during 1982. The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis. These results are also consistent with a controlled trial on supplementary feeding in the Sudan."

7190778,1,a,"The critical determinants of extended diurnal death feigning were assessed in a refinement experiment in which visual and tactile cues during rearing and/or testing were systematically eliminated. Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing. It was concluded that visual novelty of the environment is the minimal condition for sustained death feigning by young chicks in the daylight hours."
3933036,1,a,"The hypothesis was examined that the interaction of ethanol with the conditions under which it is administered may determine whether either preference or aversion for the drug develops. In Experiment 1, eight groups of food-deprived rats received injections of ethanol (175-1,400 mg/kg) in one environment and were later offered a choice between that environment and a different one previously associated with saline injections. Another eight groups were treated identically, except that food was available in both the saline and ethanol-paired environments. The groups given the drug without food showed no preference or aversion at low doses (175-700 mg/kg), but showed aversion at higher doses (1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg). When food was available, there was an increased preference for the environment paired with the 500 mg/kg dose and reduced aversion at the 1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg doses. In Experiment 2, placing two rats together increased each rat's preference for the environment associated with the other animal. However, rats pretreated with 500 mg/kg ethanol before being placed together showed a reduced preference for the environment associated with the drug and the other animal. Controls never paired with another rat showed no preference or aversion at the same ethanol dose. Thus, ethanol may interact with conditions such as the presence of food or another animal to determine final effects that are unique to those conditions."

30720625,0,a,"CONTEXT: Despite a growing consensus in public health to address health inequities and leverage social determinants of health (SDoH), the level of public health practitioners' readiness to become the agents of change in promoting health equity and shaping SDoH is not well researched. OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) the level of public health agency employees' perceived desirability for impacting health equity and SDoH, and (2) the impact of employee characteristics such as a (PH WINS) public health degree and awareness of health in all policies on such desirability. METHODS: Data from the 2017 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey were used in examining the sense of desirability among agency employees for affecting health equity and SDoH in the agency jurisdictions. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of health agency employees believed that their agencies should be very involved in affecting health equity in their jurisdictions. Fairly smaller proportions of employees believed in the desirability of affecting SDoH, and the proportions who believed that the agency should be very involved in affecting specific SDoH were 17.8% for affecting the quality of transportation, 18.5% for affecting the economy, 22.2% for quality of housing, 22.4% for quality of the built environment, 25.4% for K-12 education system, and 34.5% for impacting the quality of social support systems. Agency employees without a public health degree had significantly lower odds (P < .05) of believing that the agency should be very involved in affecting health equity. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing efforts to reduce health inequities and leverage SDoH for improved population health, gaps exist in the public health workforce's perceived desirability for their agencies to be involved in such efforts. These gaps exist among employees regardless of their demographic characteristics, length of tenure, or agency setting. Policy and practice initiatives aimed to improve health equity might benefit from our findings positing a need for education regarding SDoH and health equity. Our study findings imply the need for interventions for improving alignment between employee beliefs and organizational priorities for an effective transformation to Public Health 3.0. Fostering cross-sector partnerships with a focus on Health in All Policies (HiAP), SDoH, and health equity must be a high priority for public health agencies, which can be formalized through organizational strategic plans."
21489284,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is ample evidence in Asia and Latin America showing that past economic crises resulted in cuts in expenditures on health, lower utilization of health services, and deterioration of child and maternal nutrition and health outcomes. Evidence on the impact of past economic crises on health sector in Africa is lacking. The objectives of this article are to present the findings of a quick survey conducted among countries of the WHO African Region to monitor the effects of global financial crisis on funding for health development; and to discuss the way forward. METHODS: This is a descriptive study. A questionnaire was prepared and sent by email to all the 46 Member States in the WHO African Region through the WHO Country Office for facilitation and follow up. The questionnaires were completed by directors of policy and planning in ministries of health. The data were entered and analyzed in Excel spreadsheet. The main limitations of this study were that authors did not ask whether other relevant sectors were consulted in the process of completing the survey questionnaire; and that the overall response rate was low. RESULTS: The main findings were as follows: the response rate was 41.3% (19/46 countries); 36.8% (7/19) indicated they had been notified by the Ministry of Finance that the budget for health would be cut; 15.8% (3/19) had been notified by partners of their intention to cut health funding; 61.1% (11/18) indicated that the prices of medicines had increased recently; 83.3% (15/18) indicated that the prices of basic food stuffs had increased recently; 38.8% (7/18) indicated that their local currency had been devalued against the US dollar; 47.1% (8/17) affirmed that the levels of unemployment had increased since the onset of global financial crisis; and 64.7% (11/17) indicated that the ministry of health had taken some measures already, either in reaction to the global financing crisis, or in anticipation. CONCLUSION: A rapid assessment, like the one reported in this article, of the effects of the global financial crisis on a few variables, is important to alert the Ministry of Health on the looming danger of cuts in health funding from domestic and external sources. However, it is even more important for national governments to monitor the effects of the economic crisis and the policy responses on the social determinants of health, health inputs, health system outputs and health system outcomes, e.g. health."
7361821,1,a,"Status-attainment theory and methodology and data from the 1966 and 1971 National Longitudinal Surveys were used to construct and estimate a 13-variable, seven-stage causal model of the career-attainment process of low-IQ and average-IQ young men. Model variables included six personal-social inputs, three educationally related intervening variables, and four occupationally related outcomes. Multiple-regression analysis was used to estimate the model on the low-IQ and average-IQ groups, within white and black racial categories separately. Results showed gross differences to exist between low-IQ and average-IQ subjects on a number of variables. The regression results, however, indicated that the determinants of career attainment had similar effects among low-IQ and average-IQ subjects and that status-attainment theory applied equally well to the two IQ groups. Policy implications of the findings were discussed."

30709095,0,a,"This commentary discusses the interesting and surprising findings by Hagen and colleagues, focusing on the role of the public health coordinator as a Health in All Policies (HiAP) tool. The original article finds a negative association between the employment of public health coordinators in Norwegian municipalities and consideration of a fair distribution of social and economic resources between social groups in local policymaking and planning. The commentary contemplates whether this surprising negative association should be interpreted as a failure of implementation, as suggested by the authors, or whether it might be the theory of change that has failed. On this basis, it is suggested that the very notion of HiAP could be flawed by the assumption that health should function as an overarching aim across government sectors. Potentially, the social determinants of health (SDH) might be more efficiently addressed by means of sectoral action by the corresponding sectors, emphasizing equity rather than health."
20587762,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic rheumatological disorder among southern Chinese patients in Hong Kong, with an estimated prevalence of 0.33%-0.35%. The resulting chronic pain, disability, social stress, and isolation contribute to the development of psychiatric symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The authors identify the prevalence and determining factors of psychiatric disorders in patients with RA. METHOD: Consecutive RA patients (N=200) were recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic. Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed by a psychiatrist using the Chinese-bilingual Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, Patient Research Version. Sociodemographic and clinical data and subjective health status and perceived social support data were also collected. Factors associated with the occurrence of psychiatric disorders were studied by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were diagnosed with a current psychiatric disorder (depressive disorders, 14.5%; anxiety disorders, 13.0%; schizophrenia, 0.5%). Major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were the commonest current mood and anxiety disorders, respectively. Independent predictors for a current psychiatric disorder were poverty and perceived poor social support. Limited social interaction, perceived poor social support, high pain intensity, and a family history of psychiatric disorders were independently associated with a current depressive disorder, whereas poverty and perceived poor social support were associated with a current anxiety disorder. CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety are common in Chinese patients with RA. Patients who lack social support or rely on economic assistance are more prone to the development of psychiatric disorders."
6684973,1,a,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts."
30033521,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Parent-delivered therapy interventions for children with cerebral palsy can help achieve a sufficient therapy dose, improve parental mental well-being, and facilitate parent-child relationships creating a more relaxed familial environment. However, parent-delivered interventions may also lead to increased parental stress, guilt if the therapy is not delivered, and time constraints. The primary aim of this review was to gain a deeper understanding of the determinants of effective parent-delivered therapy interventions. METHOD: Searches were conducted in the following databases: Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane. Studies had to meet the following inclusion criteria: descriptions of parent/health care professional/child experiences of parent-delivered therapy interventions for children and young people age 0-18 years with cerebral palsy, published in the English language between January 1989 and May 2017, with qualitative or mixed methods research design. The articles were critically appraised, then synthesized using a meta-ethnographic approach. RESULTS: A literature search identified 17 articles, which met the inclusion criteria. Three main themes were identified: (a) building trusting relationships, (b) enabling the parents to cope, and (c) for parents and health care professionals to see the intervention as a priority. Further synthesis presented three concepts identifying the important aspects of the interventions: empowerment, motivation, and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The themes and concepts emerging from this qualitative synthesis can be addressed by specific points of action to support parent-delivered therapy interventions. We have summarized these in a checklist for use by intervention developers, health care professionals, and parents."
6382590,1,a,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females."
29592532,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Analyses of representative, system-level data to examine trends in short- and longer-term readmission rates for psychiatric illnesses are largely absent. The objective of this article is to examine key trends and variables with implications for inpatient care as indicated by 30-day readmission and outpatient care as reflected by readmission within 5 years. METHODS: Using OMHRS data from 2005 to 2015, patients who had their first inpatient admission were followed for 5 years to examine their subsequent 30-day and overall admission rates stratified by discharge time and diagnosis. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 42,280 patients. The 30-day and 5-year readmission rates for the entire cohort were 7.2% and 35.1%, respectively. Using a time course analysis of readmission for discharges in different years, both 30-day readmission and 5-year readmission rates decreased in a linear manner from 2005 to 2010, primarily because of readmission patterns for patients diagnosed with mood disorders and schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders. It was also evident that both demographic considerations such as age and gender and variables reflective of social determinants such as education level and employment were predictive of rehospitalization risk. CONCLUSIONS: The trends of decreasing readmission rates may be reflective of improvements in the quality of hospital and community-based outpatient care. Such system-level indicators warrant tracking and may inform more effective tertiary prevention."
2641946,1,a,"A follow-up study of 58 patients with spinal cord injury was conducted. As measure of function the Barthel index was used. There was correlation between functional capacity and ability of self-care as well as some social determinants. However, no association was found with employment rate or certain other determinants of independent living, such as going on a holiday. We conclude that the severity of the lesion is a fundamental factor in determining the outcome, but factors related to personal and psychosocial variables, not easily measured, also have great influence on the rehabilitation process."
23503540,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine sociodemographic and epidemiological factors associated with private health insurance coverage in the elderly. METHODS: A total of 2,143 individuals aged 60 years or more were interviewed in the city of Sao Paulo in 2000 and 2006. Having private health insurance was the dichotomous dependent variable. Independent variables included sociodemographic characteristics and self-reported health status. The proportions of the variables studied were described and a logistic regression model considering those variables significant at p < 0.05 was constructed. RESULTS: The elderly with private insurance coverage had significantly higher income and education. The elderly with no private insurance were screened less for cancer and more for respiratory diseases; they waited longer for appointments; they performed less medical tests; they reported fewer conditions and more falls and had a more negative self-rated health. The insured respondents reported lower vaccination rates and, among those hospitalized, 11.1% had their medical costs covered by the Brazilian National Health System (SUS) in 2000 and 17.9% in 2006. Osteoporosis was the single condition associated with private health insurance. CONCLUSIONS: The elderly with private insurance coverage had significantly higher income and education than those with no private coverage, and these differences were associated with service utilization and social determinants of health."

26744912,0,a,"Previous research examining labour migration in sport focused on athletes in professional team sports. The purpose of this study is to analyse the factors influencing the migration probability of elite sport coaches in Germany (i.e. national coaches, state coaches, and coaches at Olympic training bases). From a theoretical perspective, labour migration of athletes is affected by economic, social, political, competitive, geographic and cultural factors. This study examines whether these factors can be applied to coaches. Primary data were collected using an online survey of elite sport coaches in Germany. Applying a conjoint design, respondents were presented with 10 migration scenarios leading to a sample size of n = 1860 for the empirical analysis. In the scenarios, the coaching position openings abroad differed in terms of income level, contract length, weekly workload, responsibility for personnel, reputation of coaching job, career perspectives, sporting performance of athletes, distance from Germany, and predominant job language. Coaches were asked for their migration probability contingent on the specific scenario. On average, migration probability was 24.2%. The results of regression analysis showed that higher income, contracts of longer duration, responsibility for personnel and speaking the respective language significantly increased the migration probability, while distances of nine flight hours and more, lower reputation and career perspectives reduced it. The findings have implications for policy-makers: they indicate in what areas the situation of coaches needs improvement to increase the likelihood of retaining elite sport coaches in the German sport system."
21316832,0,a,"Health disparities are, to a large extent, the result of socio-economic factors that cannot be entirely mitigated through the health care system. While an array of social services are thought to be necessary to address the social determinants of health, budget constraints, particularly in difficult economic times, limit the availability of such services. It is therefore necessary to prioritize interventions through some fair process. While it might be appropriate to engage in public deliberation to set priorities, doing so requires that the public accept such a deliberative process and appreciate the social determinants of health. We therefore analyzed the results of a study in which groups deliberated to prioritize socio-economic interventions to examine whether these two requirements can possibly be met and to explore the basis for their priorities. A total of 431 residents of Washington, D.C. with incomes under 200% of the federal poverty threshold participated in 43 groups to engage in a hypothetical exercise to prioritize interventions designed to ameliorate the social determinants of health within the constraints of a limited budget. Findings from pre- and post-exercise questionnaires demonstrate that the priority setting exercise was perceived as a fair deliberative process, and that following the deliberation, participants became more likely to agree that a broad number of determinants contribute to their health. Qualitative analysis of the group discussions indicate that participants prioritized interventions that would provide for basic necessities and improve community conditions, while at the same time addressing more macro-structural factors such as homelessness and unemployment. We conclude that engaging small groups in deliberation about ways to address the social determinants of health can both change participant attitudes and yield informed priorities that might guide public policy aimed at most affordably reducing health disparities."
20302437,0,a,"In the general population, social disparities in Internet practices have been less described than disparities in health information access. Aim is to determine whether there are differences in the frequency of Internet use for health information among health seekers. We conducted an Internet-based survey from November 2006 to March 2007. We considered the 3720 residents of France who had searched for health information during the previous 12 months. This study reveals different uses of the Internet for health information seeking (HIS) between men and women and between the general population and people who work in the health sector. Health status, taking care of somebody who is sick, and active Internet use were associated with higher frequencies of online HIS to varying degrees. The effects of age and level of education were not clear or were not significant. Greater health concerns and some issues in the physician-patient relationship were associated with higher frequencies of Internet use for HIS in the general population. Considering that this increasing use of online tools for HIS is consistent with current public health policies that promote the development of the 'informed patient', one should remain cautious about these social disparities in online HIS practices."

3563565,1,a,"Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed."
3317879,1,a,"Social science research on cultural issues in maternal and child health has stressed some aspects and neglected others. From the perspective of both policy applications and theory development, new research efforts could profitably be directed to the following areas: cultural adjustments to changed energy and nutrient requirements in pregnancy and lactation; maternal illness; the mother/infant dyadic interaction; emic views of growth and development; determinants of infant and young child feeding; management of childhood illnesses; popular medicine and childhood illnesses; intra-household food distribution; household composition and maternal and child health; and macrolevel/microlevel linkages and health."
30649280,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A movement is emerging to encourage health providers and health organizations to take action on the social determinants of health. However, few evidence-based interventions exist. Digital tools have not been examined in depth. OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of integrating, within routine primary care, screening for poverty and an online tool that helps identify financial benefits. METHODS: The setting was a Community Health Centre serving a large number of low-income individuals in Toronto, Canada. Physicians were encouraged to use the tool at every possible encounter during a 1-month period. A link to the tool was easily accessible, and reminder emails were circulated regularly. This mixed-methods study used a combination of pre-intervention and post-intervention surveys, focus groups and interviews. RESULTS: Thirteen physicians participated (81.25% of all) and represented a range of genders and years in practice. Physicians reported a strong awareness of the importance of identifying poverty as a health concern, but low confidence in their ability to address poverty. The tool was used with 63 patients over a 1-month period. Although screening and intervening on poverty is logistically challenging in regular workflows, online tools could assist patients and health providers identify financial benefits quickly. Future interventions should include more robust follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes to the evidence based on addressing the social determinants of health in clinical settings. Future approaches could involve routine screening, engaging other members of the team in intervening and following up, and better integration with the electronic health record."
7282978,1,a,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology."
22677974,0,a,"Despite efforts to increase HIV testing in the African region, the proportion of men who report ever having been tested for HIV remains low. Research has focused on individual level determinants of women's testing however little is known about factors associated with men's testing behavior. This analysis investigates community influences on HIV testing among men ages 15-54, using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from Chad, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Multilevel models were fitted in each country for the outcome of ever receiving an HIV test. After controlling for individual and household level factors, community level factors of demographics, economics, and behavior and knowledge remain significantly associated with HIV testing among men. The results of this analysis highlight the need to recognize the impact of community influences on men's HIV test seeking behavior, and to harness these community factors in the design of programs aimed at encouraging the uptake of HIV testing among men in Africa."
20624293,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Bicycle use entails high safety and health risks especially for adolescents. Most safety education programs aimed at adolescents focus on accident statistics and risk perceptions. This paper proposes the investigation of the social-cognitive correlates of risky cycling behaviors of adolescents prior to developing safety education programs. METHOD: Secondary school students aged 13 to 18 years (n = 1446) filled out questionnaires regarding bicycle behavior, risky intentions, accident experience, and social-cognitive determinants as suggested by the theory of planned behavior. RESULTS: Regression analysis revealed that the proximal variables (i.e., self-efficacy, attitudes towards drunk driving, personal norm regarding safekeeping of self and others, and compared risk) were able to predict 17% of the variance of risky behavior and 23% of the variance of risky intentions. The full model explained respectively 29% and 37% of the variance in risky behavior and risky intentions. Adolescents with positive attitudes towards risky behavior and low sense of responsibility report risky behavior, even when having been (close to) an accident. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents realize whether they are risk takers or not. This implies that the focus of education programs should not be on risk perceptions, but on decreasing positive attitudes towards alcohol in traffic and increasing sense of responsibility instead. Cognitions regarding near accidents should be studied, the role of safe cycling self-efficacy is unclear."
30294398,0,a,"Background: Rehabilitation tailored to older adults' needs might improve their functional performance and quality of life, as well as increase social participation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of medical rehabilitation services among older Poles in relation to socio-economic and health-related determinants. Materials and methods: Data regarding medical rehabilitation were obtained from the nationwide, multidisciplinary PolSenior project (2007-2012) conducted on representative sample of 4813 respondents (48.3% women) aged 65+ years. Socio-economic status, physical functioning, falls, chronic pain, and formal disability occurrence, as well as self-rated health were accounted for. Results: One in six respondents (18.9% women vs. 15.8% men, p < 0.005) underwent medical rehabilitation during 12 months prior to the survey. Respondents mostly received electrotherapy or light radiation therapy (61.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that women aged 80+ years and men aged 90+ years had a significantly lower chance of using rehabilitation services compared to the youngest study participants (65-69 y.o.). City dwellers used rehabilitation services nearly twice as frequently as rural dwellers. Respondents with university education level were most likely to take part in these services. Dependence in IADL decreased participation in medical rehabilitation, while formal disability and chronic pain promoted utilization of rehabilitation services. Conclusions: Younger age, city dwelling, higher education, functional independence, formal disability certificate, and chronic pain increased participation in medical rehabilitation. Such results of the study should be considered in planning actions towards reducing health inequalities at the national level and promoting health and well-being among older adults."
6495362,1,a,"In Sri Lanka in 1975, the majority Sinhalese had a much higher use of contraception than either the Sri Lanka Tamils or the Moors. This study uses a national sample of women of childbearing age gathered by the Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey in 1975 to assess four possible reasons for differential contraceptive use: (1) differences in socioeconomic position; (2) cultural differences; (3) minority status; and (4) differential access to family planning services. The first three explanations focus on differences in the demand for contraception while the fourth explanation focuses on differences in the availability of contraceptives. The socioeconomic, cultural, and minority status hypotheses fail to explain the higher contraceptive use among the Sinhalese. The evidence is consistent with the idea that ethnic differences in contraceptive use were largely caused by differential access to family planning services."
25720044,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking remains a major preventable public health problem associated with premature deaths worldwide. Adolescence is a unique developmental stage between childhood and adulthood. Smoking is a lifestyle habit acquired during adolescence and into adulthood, with its associated morbidity and mortality. It is therefore important to determine the factors associated with cigarette smoking in these adolescents in order to institute preventive measures and health policies to protect these adolescents early. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the prevalence of smoking, factors associated with smoking, and knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking in these adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1120 adolescents aged 10-19 years selected from 10 secondary schools in Port Harcourt was conducted using a multistage sampling technique. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) core questionnaire was used to collect data from the subjects. A smoker was defined as one who had ever smoked a cigarette or who had one or two puffs, while a current smoker was defined as one who had taken a puff or smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days preceding the day of the questionnaire's completion. RESULTS: Eighty subjects (7.1%) were smokers. This was significantly (p=<0.001) higher in males (9.7%) than in females (4%). Thirty seven (3.3%) subjects were current smokers. The mean age at which smoking was initiated was 12.47+/-3.0 years. Twenty six (32.5%) of the smokers reported that they were initiated into cigarette smoking by their friends, 36 (45%) just wanted to experiment, 7 (8.8%) were influenced by media advertisements while 5 (6.3%) were due to parental exposure. Parental history of smoking and poor knowledge of cancer of the lungs as a harmful effect of smoking, was significantly (p=<0.05) associated with cigarette smoking. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of smoking in adolescents in Port Harcourt is high and is associated with parental smoking and poor knowledge of cancer of the lungs as a harmful effect. We recommend that adolescent health education with an emphasis on the harmful effects of smoking be included in the curriculum of all secondary schools."
3395696,1,a,"Specialization--the predisposition to violent behavior persisting over an extended period of time--is considered in relation to congenital factors, to determine whether such factors are contributory to this predisposition. Congenital factors include inherited characteristics and perinatal experiences. Evidence for inherited characteristics in criminal behavior is approached through family studies, the study of twins, and adoption studies. Of those three, adoption studies provide the most fertile ground for study. Predisposition toward criminal behavior is noted to be limited to property crime. The second congenital factor is the perinatal experience. Minor physical anomalies appear to be strongly related to hyperactivity and later criminal involvement, but only if the offender was reared in an unstable, nonintact family. Indices of perinatal problems relate to later violent crime, rather than to property crime, and may have as their basis some form of trauma occurring very early in life."
28218688,0,a,"There is insufficient empirical evidence on the correlates of health care utilization of irregular migrants currently living in Turkey. The aim of this study was to identify individual level determinants associated with health service and medication use. One hundred and fifty-five Afghans completed surveys assessing service utilization including encounters with primary care physicians and outpatient specialists in addition to the use of prescription and nonprescription medicines. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to examine associations between service use and a range of predisposing, enabling, and perceived need factors. Health services utilization was lowest for outpatient specialists (20%) and highest for nonprescription medications (37%). Female gender and higher income predicted encounters with primary care physicians. Income, and other enabling factors such as family presence in Turkey predicted encounters with outpatient specialists. Perceived illness-related need factors had little to no influence on use of services; however, asylum difficulties increased the likelihood for encounters with primary care physicians, outpatient services, and the use of prescription medications. This study suggests that health services use among Afghan migrants in Turkey is low considering the extent of their perceived illness-related needs, which may be further exacerbated by the precarious conditions in which they live."
3225143,1,a,"Subjects completed two brief questionnaires, one concerning the description of, and attitudes towards schizophrenia and schizophrenics and the second on the possible cause of schizophrenia. Both questionnaires yielded a clearly interpretable factor structure and the relationship between the cause and 'symptoms' was examined. The results are discussed in terms of the range, determinants and structure of lay beliefs in mental illness, particularly schizophrenia."
3992291,1,a,"The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed."
10287174,1,a,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2980864,1,a,"This study prospectively tracked the self-change attempts of 200 New Year's resolvers over a 2-year period in order to more fully understand the coping determinants of maintenance and the natural history of lapses and relapses. Seventy-seven percent maintained their pledges for 1 week but only 19% for 2 years. Successful resolvers reported employing significantly more stimulus control, reinforcement, and willpower than the unsuccessful over the 2 years; social support and interpersonal strategies failed to predict success before 6 months but did so thereafter. Counterconditioning and fading were retrospectively nominated as the most efficacious coping strategies; paucity of willpower and failure of stimulus control were reported as the most hindering to maintenance. Fifty-three percent of the successful group experienced at least one slip, and the mean number of slips over the 2-year interval was 14. Slips were typically precipitated by a lack of personal control, excessive stress, and negative emotion."
25195529,1,a,"With the increasing interest in comparative studies of the elderly, China has become the focus of research attention. This society, which has been inaccessible to most Western researchers, offers a special site for studies of aging because of its sheer size as a world power, its relationship to Third World countries, and its population problem-a growing segment of elderly people. Available data from a variety of social science sources are utilized to compare how the sociocultural context of China and the United States impact differentially upon the older population in each society. Three major determinants specify the theoretical context: economic development (the level of production an economic system achieves); traditional cultural patterns (norms, roles, relationships); and the social control mechanisms (regulatory processes based upon the legal and sanctioning systems). These determinants provide a theoretical orientation for analyzing the outcome variables involved in the behavior and adaptation of the old. In American society, cultural norms and values are advantageous for active older persons in good health, particularly those with a favorable economic situation. In contemporary Chinese society, which blends traditional customs with the values of a revolutionary and changing society, there are advantages for the frail elderly."
27009062,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although evidence-based and effective treatments are available for people with depression, a substantial number does not seek or receive help. Therefore, it is important to gain a better understanding of the reasons why people do or do not seek help. This study examined what predisposing and need factors are associated with help-seeking among people with major depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 102 subjects with major depression. Respondents were recruited from the general population in collaboration with three Municipal Health Services (GGD) across different regions in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria were: being aged 18 years or older, a high score on a screening instrument for depression (K10 > 20), and a diagnosis of major depression established through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 65 % (n = 66) had received help in the past six months. Results showed that respondents with a longer duration of symptoms and those with lower personal stigma were more likely to seek help. Other determinants were not significantly related to help-seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration of symptoms was found to be an important determinant of help-seeking among people with depression. It is concerning that stigma was related to less help-seeking. Knowledge and understanding of depression should be promoted in society, hopefully leading to reduced stigma and increased help-seeking."
25023491,0,a,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the key social determinants of physical activity among six Asian-American subgroups using public access 2007 California Health Interview Survey data. Physical activity was defined as meeting the American College of Sports Medicine recommendation of 450 metabolic equivalent-minutes per week. Factors positively associated with meeting physical activity recommendations included being bilingual among Chinese and Vietnamese, and increasing age for Chinese only. On the other hand, being middle aged, currently married, and low neighborhood safety were significantly associated with lower odds of meeting physical activity recommendations, as were being female for Japanese and Koreans, and living above the poverty level for Vietnamese. Such results highlight the heterogeneity among Asian-Americans and need for health messages targeted at specific subgroups. Additionally, the role of built environment, particularly in areas with high Filipino residents, should be a public health priority for increasing physical activity outcomes."

It has been demonstrated through analysis of a large quantity of data that family planning under the guidance of national population policies is the major cause for the decline of the fertility rate to the replacement level within the short span of a dozen years."""
28575394,0,a,"Objectives: To project future smoking prevalence rates in Spain by sex and age groups using Bayesian methods and to estimate the probability of a 30% relative reduction between 2010 and 2025. Methods: We used the data from the Spanish National Health Surveys (2003, 2006, and 2011) to obtain information about current and former smoking. We reconstructed annual smoking rates from 1989 through 2011 by sex and 5-year age groups. The prevalence were projected for the period 2012-2025 using a Bayesian logistic binomial model and estimated the probability to achieve the 30% relative reduction endorsed by the WHO. We calculated the 95% credible interval (CrI) of the posterior distribution, which includes a 95% of the distribution of potential smoking prevalences. Results: In men, the projections show a decline for crude (-2.64% annually, 95% CrI: -3.32; -1.97) and adjusted (-2.50%, 95% CrI:-3.14; -1.87) prevalence. In women, the projections show a decline for crude prevalence (-0.36%, 95% CrI: -1.02; -0.30)) and the age-adjusted prevalence (-1.02%, 95% CrI: -1.61, -0.47). By age groups, the decline is greater among women aged 15-39 years (-3.92%, 95% CrI: -4.92; -2.96)) while for women aged 40-64 years an increase (1.84%, 95% CrI: 1.06; 2.58) is expected. In men, the probability to achieve the WHO target is 0.728 and in women is less than 0.001. The age group 15-39 shows the highest probability to achieve the target. Conclusions: The results suggest smoking prevalence will decrease during 2012-2025 in all age groups for both sexes except for women aged 40-64. We found that the WHO target of a 30% reduction in prevalence is likely to be achieved overall and in the 15-39 years age groups for both sexes, but not achieved for older women and it is uncertain whether it will be achieved for older men. These results highlight the need to strengthen public health interventions that focus on reducing tobacco use in adult women aged 40-64 years old. Implications: We project a decrease in smoking prevalence in during 2012-2025 except for women aged 40-64. The WHO Target of a 30% relative reduction could be achieved in the population aged 15-39; but not in women and the results are inconclusive in men. These results highlight the need to strengthen public health interventions that focus on reducing tobacco use in adult women aged 40-64 years old."
12283322,1,a,"""The article analyses the population growth in rural counties of the U.S.A. for 1970-80 and 1980-86. The growth rates are examined on different levels of aggregation (individual counties, subregions and regions) and in relation to several possible determinants of growth. The main objective of the study is to examine whether the growth patterns in the eighties support the hypothesis of a turnaround in the population development of rural areas.... The results reveal a diversity of growth patterns and significant regional differences. Rural counties within the daily urban system of a metropolitan area have significantly higher growth rates than peripheral rural counties. The results do not support the notion of a turnaround of long established trends. The trends in the eighties bear more resemblance to traditional growth patterns of rural areas."" (SUMMARY IN ENG)"
24301041,1,a,"In order to examine the relationships among social network structure, types of social support, and determinants of support satisfaction, an alternative method was used to score the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ). Factor analysis procedures suggested that college students' (N=198) social networks consisted of four groups: nuclear family, other family, friends, and others. Satisfaction with support was positively related to the proportion of the network occupied by nuclear family and negatively related to the proportion of friends in the network. Evidence was found for the presence of both support specialists and support generalists in the networks of the college students. These results are discussed from a developmental perspective with attention to the implications for interventions."
25950574,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to examine workplace determinants of obesity and participation in employer-sponsored wellness programs among low-wage workers. METHODS: We conducted key informant interviews and focus groups with 2 partner organizations: a health care employer and a union representing retail workers. Interviews and focus groups discussed worksite factors that support or constrain healthy eating and physical activity and barriers that reduce participation in workplace wellness programs. Focus group discussions were transcribed and coded to identify main themes related to healthy eating, physical activity, and workplace factors that affect health. RESULTS: Although the union informants recognized the need for workplace wellness programs, very few programs were offered because informants did not know how to reach their widespread and diverse membership. Informants from the health care organization described various programs available to employees but noted several barriers to effective implementation. Workers discussed how their job characteristics contributed to their weight; irregular schedules, shift work, short breaks, physical job demands, and food options at work were among the most commonly discussed contributors to poor eating and exercise behaviors. Workers also described several general factors such as motivation, time, money, and conflicting responsibilities. CONCLUSION: The workplace offers unique opportunities for obesity interventions that go beyond traditional approaches. Our results suggest that modifying the physical and social work environment by using participatory or integrated health and safety approaches may improve eating and physical activity behaviors. However, more research is needed about the methods best suited to the needs of low-wage workers."
2785722,1,a,"In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact."
31162863,0,a,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of nurses caring for socially at-risk patients and gain an understanding of the challenges nurses face when providing care. BACKGROUND: Nurses play a pivotal role in caring for hospitalised patients with social risk factors and preparing them for discharge. Few studies have explored whether acute care nurses are adequately supported in their practice environments to address the unique needs of socially at-risk patients as they transition back into community settings. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study of nurses working in a large urban academic medical centre. METHODS: We conducted six semi-structured focus groups of nurses (n = 21). Thematic content analysis was performed to analyse the transcripts from the focus groups. We adhered to COREQ guidelines for reporting this qualitative study. RESULTS: Six key themes emerged: (a) nurses' assessments of social risk factors, (b) experiences providing care, (c) barriers to care, (d) fear of ""labelling"" socially at-risk patients, (e) unmet social care needs and (f) recommendations to improve care. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that nurses are able to identify social risk factors. However, prioritisation of medical needs during acute care hospitalisation and lack of organisational supports may deter nurses from fully addressing social concerns. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Acute care nurses should be involved in the development of future efforts to address the needs of socially at-risk patients and be provided with additional supports in their practice environments. This could include continuing education to build nursing competencies in community-based care and social vulnerability."
17093748,1,a,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting."
20446184,0,a,"Group disparities in health have been documented for several decades. Despite recent efforts to eliminate them, group differences persist and challenge the ability of scientists to address them using traditional research paradigms. Because the determinants of disparities occur at multiple levels, from the molecular to the societal, and interact with one another in ways not yet fully understood, they represent a challenge to researchers attempting to capture their complexity. After reviewing existing models of disciplinary collaboration, we outline the challenges of a transdisciplinary approach and its ability to afford the holistic view of disparities needed to develop effective interventions."
31198518,0,a,"Background: Low physical activity (PA) is increasing public health problem. The present study aimed to determine socioeconomic inequality in PA among children aged 10-12 years old in Kurdistan, west of Iran in 2015. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 2506 children aged 10-12 in Sanandaj, Iran, in 2015. Data on the children's level of PA were collected using the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire. The concentration index was used to measure inequality and the Oaxaca decomposition to examine the different determinants of the inequality. The data were analyzed in Stata 13 and SPSS 20. Results: Of the 2506 participants, 40.90% (38.97-42.82) had insufficient PA. Girls had a lower level of PA than boys (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.28-0.41) and it is directly related to maternal education (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.18-2.47), the family's Socioeconomic status (SES) (OR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.56-3.05), and the place of residence (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.16-2.44). The concentration index for insufficient PA was -0.25 (95 CI: -0.30 to -0.21), revealing an insufficient PA in the group with a low SES. The prevalence of insufficient PA is 51.38% (95% CI: 48.45-54.31) in poor group and 28.40% (95% CI: 22.80-33.99) in the wealthier group. The Oaxaca decomposition showed maternal education and the place of residence was the most important determinants of inequality. Conclusions: According to the findings, most of the children especially in the poor groups didn't have sufficient PA and socioeconomic factors could have the important role."

30254996,0,a,"Objective: Endometriosis, a common hormone-dependent chronic inflammatory disease causes various symptoms including pelvic pain, which affect the physical and psychological quality of life in women of reproductive age. The present study aimed to assess the quality of life of Iranian women with endometriosis using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument, Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Methods: This cross-sectional study performed in Tehran between October 2014 and July 2016 included 70 Iranian women with endometriosis. The Iranian version of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was used to measure quality of life in these women. The Pearson's correlation coefficient, the paired and the independent t-tests, and a linear regression model were used to statistically analyze the data using the SPSS software version 16.0. Results: The total mean score of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was 80.58. The highest and the lowest mean scores were observed in the environmental (28.15) and the physical health domains (10.59), respectively. A multiple linear regression model (backward method) showed that insurance coverage was associated with the total WHOQOL-BREF score, whereas age, insurance coverage, and income level were associated with domains 1 through 4, respectively (P<0.05). Conclusion: Endometriosis affects various aspects of the quality of life of Iranian women who therefore require holistic management focused on both, the physical and psychological aspects of treatment."
25187184,0,a,"The objective of this study was to develop a multidisciplinary guideline that supports the care and vocational rehabilitation of HIV-infected people with employment-related problems. The guideline was developed according to the ""evidence-based guideline development"" method developed by the Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement. This method consists of the following steps: forming a multidisciplinary core group and an expert panel, formulating key questions, searching and appraising the available literature, formulating considerations and recommendations, peer reviewing the draft guideline, and authorizing the final guideline. All relevant professional associations were represented in the core group that was assembled to develop the guideline, i.e., HIV doctors, HIV nurses, general practitioners, occupational health physicians, psychologists, social workers, occupational health nurses, vocational experts, and insurance physicians. Five key questions for the guideline were formulated with the following themes: determinants of employment, disclosure and stigma, self-management, interventions, and the organization of care. In the literature review on these topics, 45 studies met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included articles was poor. Factors such as patient preferences and medical/ethical issues were considered. The recommendations in the guideline are a weighting of the scientific evidence and the considerations of the core group. The guideline, as well as its summary for daily practice, clarifies the most important barriers and facilitators to people with HIV either staying at work or returning to work, and it constitutes a clinical, easy-to-use guideline for health-care providers and how they can support people with HIV who want to work."
29033059,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Inter-sectoral policy networks may be effective in addressing environmental determinants of health with interventions. However, contradictory results are reported on relations between structural network characteristics (i.e., composition and integration) and network performance, such as addressing environmental determinants of health. This study examines these relations in different phases of the policy process. METHODS: A multiple-case study was performed on four public health-related policy networks. Using a snowball method among network actors, overall and sub-networks per policy phase were identified and the policy sector of each actor was assigned. To operationalise the outcome variable, interventions were classified by the proportion of environmental determinants they addressed. RESULTS: In the overall networks, no relation was found between structural network characteristics and network performance. In most effective cases, the policy development sub-networks were characterised by integration with less interrelations between actors (low cohesion), more equally distributed distances between the actors (low closeness centralisation), and horizontal integration in inter-sectoral cliques. The most effective case had non-public health central actors with less connections in all sub-networks. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that, to address environmental determinants of health, sub-networks should be inter-sectorally composed in the policy development rather than in the intervention development and implementation phases, and that policy development actors should have the opportunity to connect with other actors, without strong direction from a central actor."
30654680,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Mental health can help explain how social inequalities impact on health. Many current public health challenges are shaped by social, economic and environmental conditions that take a mental toll on society. PURPOSE: This article describes a conceptual framework illustrating the psychosocial pathways that link the wider conditions to health behaviours and outcomes. It draws out implications of this framework for mental health practice that aim to support policy and decision-making on future action to reduce health inequalities and presents practical examples of what can be done. METHODS: This article expands on a report commissioned by Public Health England. A narrative review and synthesis of relevant evidence built on existing research by the Institute of Health Equity. A conceptual framework was developed and a consultation exercise with stakeholders helped to revise and illustrate it with practice examples. CONCLUSIONS: The field of mental health has much to contribute to prevention, not just of mental illness but also of physical health conditions and reduction of inequalities in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy, especially through collaborative public health action."

The presence of immigrants arriving before 1965 has a positive impact on youth earnings. Recently arrived immigrants impact negatively, however. These results are consistent with recent findings that the skill level of immigrants arriving within the last two decades is lower relative to that of immigrants arriving earlier. The results also show that the negative effects diminish as the youth ages, reflecting skill acquisition and job mobility of the young worker into jobs less vulnerable to competition from immigrant workers."""
30825760,0,a,"Health is not only a result of biological conditions, but of psychological, economic, and social circumstances. Both proximal factors, which impact daily life, and distal factors, which are further removed from everyday life, can influence a person's wellbeing. However, traditionally these distal factors have been overlooked in public discourse and government policy. OBJECTIVE: In the present study we examined whether measures of country-level safety predict the health of their residents. Additionally, we examined whether socioeconomic status (SES; approximated by income) interacts with other proximal factors to predict health. METHODS: Participants were 81,415 individuals residing in 58 countries. Multilevel modeling was used to determine the influence of distal and proximal factors on health. RESULTS: Findings indicated that both country-level safety and SES predict health regardless of the country of residence. Additionally, SES interacted with other proximal variables (e.g., life satisfaction and access to food) to predict health. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to everyday living conditions, health is contingent upon circumstances that do not directly impact daily life. This indicates that preventive measures are needed to secure the health of individuals impacted not only by negative proximal factors, but negative distal factors as well. In light of these findings, more translational research is needed to highlight the importance of the biopsychosocial model of health to both policymakers and the public. In this article, we suggest two research avenues relating to country-level safety that could provide specific recommendations for policy change."
20576799,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Asian American youth are one of the fastest growing populations in the United States. This present study examined intrapersonal and interpersonal determinants of smoking status among Asian American adolescents. METHODS: Using data from the 2006 National Youth Tobacco Survey, 1,368 Asian American adolescents in Grades 6 through 12 were selected. RESULTS: Findings revealed that one eighth (12%) experimented with cigarettes, 3% smoked occasionally, and 2% smoked regularly. High school students reported higher rates for experimental, occasional, and regular smoking than middle school students. More male than female youth reported the three types of smoking status. Multivariate analyses showed that, compared with nonsmoking, age, weekly income, family members' smoking, refusal of cigarettes from best friends predicted experimental smoking; and positive images of smoking, perception of safety of smoking for only 1 year, awareness of the harmful effects of secondhand smoking, refusal to smoke, and absence from school predicted occasional smoking. Age interacted with refusal to smoke in predicting occasional smoking. Male gender, awareness of the harmful effects of secondhand smoking, refusal to smoke, absence from school, and receptivity to tobacco marketing were determinants of regular smoking. DISCUSSION: This study uniquely examined how the impacts of multiple intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors differed by various stages of smoking in a nationally representative sample of Asian American adolescents. Our findings underscore that smoking treatment and prevention programs should consider predictors of risk for different stages of adolescent smoking."
2576262,1,a,"Historically, concerns about rapidly growing populations and resources that could not support them persuaded governments of developing countries to initiate family planning programs. Between the early 1960s and the early 1980s, the number of governments supporting these programs increased from 7 to approximately 120. Today, 52 governments in developing countries provide support to family planning programs because of the demographic rationale, and 65 governments do so because of human rights and health considerations: The effective use of family planning significantly diminishes infant, child, and maternal mortality and morbidity. Forty-five percent of married women of reproductive age worldwide are practicing contraception today; however, 69% do so in East Asia and only 11% in Africa. Female sterilization and use of intrauterine devices are the most popular methods in developing countries, and oral contraceptives and condoms, in developed countries. Of the 400 million women of reproductive age, 140 million (35%) are relying on family planning methods requiring male cooperation and less than 60 million (15%) are using oral contraceptives. More than half of these oral contraceptive users live in four countries: the United States, Brazil, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany. On the other hand, the percentage of currently married women, aged 15 to 19 years, who have never used any form of contraception is as high as 85% to 90% in Bangladesh, Sudan, and Pakistan. In many developing countries, there is a statistically significant correlation between women's use of contraception and years of education. Other important factors influencing contraceptive prevalence include the established or perceived side effects of currently available methods, the status of women, the political climate, and a number of behavioral and social determinants."

The patient lives a life of poverty, and the outcome of her illness is a result of her being unable to overcome barriers to accessing health care due to inability to afford transport, lodging and treatment. In this case, the patient's vulnerability to disease due to her poverty is not overcome because of lack of infrastructure. The infrastructure fails to develop because of inadequate investment and other delays in building. The end result is that the patient is vulnerable to disease.

Subjects were classified as predominantly right-, left-, or bidirectional movers. Discriminant analyses significantly separated these groups in terms of checklist scales. Accuracy of classification was 51.9% in the psychology sample and 89.7% in the engineering sample. A bidirectional pattern in eye movement was associated with a more adaptive and well-adjusted personality style than unidirectional consistency."

29187771,0,a,"Trust is a good approach to explain the functioning of markets, institutions or society as a whole. It is a key element in almost every commercial transaction over time and might be one of the main explanations of economic success and development. Trust diminishes the more we perceive others to have economically different living realities. In most of the relevant contributions, scholars have taken a macro perspective on the inequality-trust linkage, with an aggregation of both trust and inequality on a country level. However, patterns of within-country inequality and possibly influential determinants, such as perception and socioeconomic reference, remained undetected. This paper offers the opportunity to look at the interplay between inequality and trust at a more refined level. A measure of (generalized) trust emerges from ESS 5 survey which asks ""...generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?"". With the use of 2009 EU-SILC data, measurements of income inequality are developed for age-specific groups of society in 22 countries. A sizable variation in inequality measures can be noticed. Even in low inequality countries, like Sweden, income imbalances within certain age groups have the potential to undermine social trust."

Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers."
26060778,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, natural disasters and the accompanying health risks have become more frequent, and rehabilitation work has become an important part of government performance. On one hand, social networks play an important role in participants' therapeutic community participation and physical & mental recovery. On the other hand, therapeutic communities with widespread participation can also contribute to community recovery after disaster. METHODS: This paper described a field study in an earthquake-stricken area of Ya'an. A set of 3-stage follow-up data was obtained concerning with the villagers' participation in therapeutic community, social network status, demographic background, and other factors. The Hierarchical linear Model (HLM) method was used to investigate the determinants of social network on therapeutic community participation. RESULTS: First, social networks have significantly impacts on the annual changes of therapeutic community participation. Second, there were obvious differences in education between groups mobilized by the self-organization and local government. However, they all exerted the mobilization force through the acquaintance networks. Third, local cadre networks of villagers could negatively influence the activities of self-organized therapeutic community, while with positively influence in government-organized therapeutic activities. CONCLUSION: This paper suggests that relevant government departments need to focus more on the reconstruction and cultivation of villagers' social network and social capital in the process of post-disaster recovery. These findings contribute to better understandings of how social networks influence therapeutic community participation, and what role local government can play in post-disaster recovery and public health improvement after natural disasters."

24583944,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Guided by the social comparison theory, we examined correlates of the discrepancy between chronological and felt ages in three age groups of community-dwelling older adults: 65 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 and older. METHOD: Data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study and linear regression models were used to test the hypothesis that age discrepancy would be significantly associated with objective health indicators among those in the 65 to 69 and 70 to 79 age groups but not among the 80+ group. RESULTS: Objective health indicators were significantly associated with age discrepancy only in the 70 to 79 age group, while subjective health perceptions and psychological well-being were significantly associated with age discrepancy in all age groups. DISCUSSION: The correlates of the discrepancy in the 65 to 69 age group appear to resemble those in the 80+ group more than those in the 70 to 79 age group. Further research is needed to identify the determinants of age group differences."
31226344,0,a,"Researchers examining the influence of the built environment on health are increasingly using mixed methods approaches. The use of more than one type of methodology to address a single research question is compelling in this field because researchers investigating the impact of the built environment on health have been faced with proposing solutions to a complex societal problem involving interacting systems and social uncertainties. Mixed methods studies can help researchers to gain a better understanding of the relationships that exist between humans and their environment by drawing on qualitative and quantitative methods. Mixed methods studies could also be instrumental for providing effective policy solutions. This is because they allow researchers to identify built environment determinants of health in a population of interest and to understand the social and cultural factors that might influence the uptake of an intervention by this population. The objective of this paper is to assist those conducting research on the built environment and health who may have little background in mixed methods. We provide an overview of mixed methods research designs and provide concrete techniques for the integration of diverse methods. We also discuss the recommendations for mixed methods research in the field of built environment - health research, drawing on specific examples from published studies. Reporting a research design and an integration strategy in mixed methods studies could help to strengthen our ability to gain new insights into the multidimensional nature of the relationship between the built environment and health."
29689054,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Community health worker (CHW) interventions are a successful strategy to promote health among HIV-negative and persons living with HIV (PLWH). Psychosocial factors are critical dimensions of HIV/AIDS care contributing to prognosis of the disease, yet it is unclear how CHW interventions improve psychosocial outcomes in PLWH. The purpose of this study was to critically appraise the types, scope, and nature of CHW interventions designed to address psychosocial outcomes in PLWH. METHODS: We performed database searches-PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane-to identify randomized controlled trials published in English before April 2017. Fourteen articles met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Half of the studies were conducted in the United States. Social cognitive theory was used more than once in nine theory-guided studies. CHW interventions were largely focused on reducing depression (n = 6) or stigma related to HIV (n = 4), or promoting quality of life (n = 4), social support (n = 4), and self-efficacy (n = 4). Didactic methods and role-playing were used to train CHWs. CHWs played multiple roles in delivering intervention, including a counselor and a supporter (n = 10), educator (n = 5), or a navigator (n = 3). CHW intervention fidelity was assessed in 4 studies. Five studies found positive changes in six psychosocial outcomes including quality of life (2 of 4) and self-efficacy (2 of 4). CHW interventions had no effect on social support in 2 of 4 studies, and stigma in 3 of 4 studies. None of the CHW interventions were successful in reducing depressive symptoms among PLWH. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence partially supported the use of CHWs in promoting psychosocial outcomes in PLWH. Future CHW intervention should be expanded in scope to address key psychosocial determinants of HIV/AIDS outcomes such as health literacy. Further, fidelity measures should be incorporated into intervention delivery."
28355636,0,a,"Background: It has been suggested that cross-national variation in educational inequalities in health outcomes (e.g. NCDs) is due to cross-national variation in risky health behaviour. In this paper we aim to use highly recent data (2014) to examine educational inequalities in risky health behaviour in 21 European countries from all regions of the continent to map cross-national variation in the extent to which educational level is associated with risky health behaviour. We focus on four dimensions of risky health behaviour: smoking, alcohol use, lack of physical activity and lack of fruit and vegetable consumption. Methods: We make use of recent data from the 7th wave of the European Social Survey (2014), which contains a special rotating module on the social determinants of health. We performed logistic regression analyses to examine the associations between educational level and the risky health behaviour indicators. Educational level was measured through a three-category version of the harmonized International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Results: Our findings show substantial and mostly significant inequalities in risky health behaviour between educational groups in most of the 21 European countries examined in this paper. The risk of being a daily smoker is higher as respondents' level of education is lower (Low education (L): OR = 4.24 (95% CI: 3.83-4.68); Middle education (M): OR = 2.91 (95% CI: 2.65-3.19)). Respondents have a lower risk of consuming alcohol frequently if they have a low level of education (L: OR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.54-0.64); M: OR = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.65-0.76)), but a higher risk of binge drinking frequently (L: OR = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.16-1.44); M: OR = 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04-1.27)). People are more likely to be physically active at least 3 days in the past week when they have a higher level of education (M: OR = 1.42 (95% CI: 1.34-1.50); H: OR = 1.67 (95% CI: 1.55-1.80)). Finally, people are more likely to consume fruit and vegetables at least daily if they have a higher level of education (fruit: M: OR = 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03-1.16); H: OR = 1.77 (95% CI: 1.63-1.92); vegetables: M: OR = 1.34 (95% CI: 1.26-1.42); H: OR = 2.35 (95% CI: 2.16-2.55)). However, we also found considerable cross-national variation in the associations between education and risky health behaviour. Conclusions: Our results yield a complex picture: the lowest educational groups are more likely to smoke and less likely to engage in physical activity and to eat fruit and vegetables, but the highest educational groups are at greater risk of frequent alcohol consumption. Additionally, inequalities in risky health behaviour do not appear to be systematically weakest in the South or strongest in the North and West of Europe."
7418140,1,a,"Correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were studied in 4756 white males and females ages 20-59 years examined during a population survey conducted by 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined. These empirical findings from a cross-sectional study replicated across diverse populations were used to derive speculative estimates of the potential for modification of population levels of HDL cholesterol, consistent with hygienic intervention and lifestyle changes. The results of the study were considered in the context of the literature on determinants of HDL cholesterol."
10301136,1,a,"The mid-1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe--and other parts of the world--a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches."
30867676,0,a,"Background: Depression and heart disease are an important public-health problem. Depression is one of the most prevalent and disabling psychiatric disorders with more than three times increased risk among patients with cardiovascular disorders. Objective: To identify the prevalence and associated factors of depressive disorder among adult patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study design was used to conduct this study on 293 study participants attending an outpatient cardiac clinic at Jimma University Teaching Hospital. All eligible patients were recruited into the study consecutively. Depression was assessed using patient health questionnaire-9. The patient health questionnaire-9 had a total score of 27, from which 0-4: no/minimal depression, 5-9: mild depression, 10-14: moderately depression, 15-19: moderately severe depression and 20-27 severe depression. The data was feed into Epi-data version 3.1 and lastly exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Bivariate analysis was used to analyze the statistical association of covariates of interest with depressive disorder among patients with cardiovascular disease. Then, logistic regression analysis was used as a final model to control confounders. The strength of association was measured by a 95% confidence interval. Results: A total of 293 adult patients diagnosed with the cardiovascular disease were included in the study with 97% (n = 284) of response rate, 47.2% (n = 134) males and 52.8% (n = 150) females, making female to a male ratio around 1.1:1. The prevalence of depression was 52.8% (n = 150/284). Out of the subjects with depression 52.67% (n = 79), 36.0% (n = 54) and 11.33% (n = 17) were mild, moderate and severe depression, respectively. Variables such as employed, unemployed, physical activity, current cigarette user and poor social support were independently associated with depression in the final model. Conclusions: In this study, depression was found to be highly prevalent psychiatric comorbidity in adult cardiovascular disease patients."
3354493,1,a,"In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking."
3730318,1,a,"This paper presents findings concerning variables expected to influence the motivation of persons caring for a dementing relative in the community to continue giving care and support. The variables examined in relation to 'preference for institutional care' were those previously examined in relation to supporters' psychological well-being (Gilhooly, 1984). The results indicate that factors within the relationship between supporter and the dependent dementing relative are important determinants of motivation to continue giving support. Other variables significantly associated with advocacy of institutional care included the age of the supporter, supporter's contacts with friends, satisfaction with help from relatives, another dependent relative, and whether or not the supporter was employed. Help from the services and supporters' well-being were not significantly correlated with ratings of preference for institutional care."
3754503,1,a,"Following opportunity to copulate with a female housed in an adjacent compartment, male Japanese quail spent 64% of their time near a window that provided visual access to the female (Experiment 1). This social proximity behavior persisted for at least 2 weeks of continual exposure to the window despite lack of further physical access to the female (Experiment 2) and was evident at all daylight hours (Experiment 3). Female Japanese quail stimulated more proximity behavior in male conspecifics than did other male Japanese quail or birds of other species (Experiments 4 and 5). However, many characteristics of the female quail were not critical. The female quail did not have to be previous sexual partners, familiar, sexually experienced, or reproductively competent to stimulate proximity behavior in males (Experiments 4 and 5). Experiment 6 demonstrated that the social proximity behavior was primarily a response to the visual aspects of the females. The results are discussed in relation to mate-guarding and surveillance behavior, and implications of the data for sexual classical conditioning of male Japanese quail are noted."
6663350,1,a,"The epidemiological and clinical profile of Chronic Post-Traumatic Headache (CPTH) has been studied in 57 out of 130 consecutive patients hospitalized, following closed head injuries, at the Institute of Neurosurgery of the University of Milan. The incidence of CPTH has been 44%. Age of the patients ranged between 4 and 69 years. Clinical pictures included closed head injuries of different degree of severity: mild, moderate and severe. Time of onset, headache frequency, character, intensity, duration and associated symptoms showed a great degree of variability. However, chronic muscle contraction headache was the commonest clinical syndrome followed by migraine. Moderate correlations have been found between the severity of CPTH disturbance of consciousness, following the head trauma, and positive findings at CT scan. Moreover the comparison of personality profiles (MMPI) of CPTH (n=26) with a post-traumatic control group, without headache (n=17) showed higher scores on hypocondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales only in the severe CPTH group. Age of the patients, duration of unconsciousness, neurological deficits, course length and pending litigation or compensations were unrelated to the occurrence and outcome of CPTH. These findings suggest the importance of both physical and psychological determinants (social or emotional maladjustment) in the pathogenesis of CPTH."
24896982,1,a,"An experimental model was constructed using seven postulates derived from the experimental results of Zayan (1974, 1975a,b,c, 1976). The model specifies the relative importance of several asymmetries in predicting aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus helleri . These asymmetries concern difference between duellists with respect to: prior residence in the tested area (vs intrusion); immediate social experiences of dominance or submission; social isolation; individual familiarity and recognition. The predictions of the general model were checked experimentally and confirmed; a multiple orthogonal regression accounted for about 97% of the variance in our experimental results. The basic experimental results serving as postulates were confirmed and could be generalized; a new synthetic and predictive model was formulated concerning the determinants of aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus ."
3399999,1,a,"Theoretical consideration of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) suggests that the key determinants of transmission dynamics are the duration of infectiousness and the extent to which subgroups in the population interact sexually. We used two empirical correlates to represent these concepts: (1) the force of infectivity, calculated by summing all the days of potential infectivity (the time between last sexual exposure and treatment of the contact) generated by a given case, and then summing the days for all cases within a given subgroup; (2) self-selection, representing the observed probability that members of a given subgroup select sexual partners from within their own group. Using data gathered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, we estimated that a single group i.e., black, male, heterosexual, military personnel residing in the core areas, generated 27% of the force of infectivity. Subgroups that select greater than 50% of their sexual partners from outside their sociodemographic boundaries generated a rate for the force of infectivity that was 4.5 times higher than the rate for self-selectors. These findings confirm the core group theory and suggest strategies for control of STD."
30847579,0,a,"Generation of health-care wastes is one of the major concerns in health-care institutions worldwide due to direct and indirect impact on human health and environment. The purpose of the present work was to estimate the quantity and quality of clinical laboratory wastes in the city of Ilam, Iran. In this cross-sectional study, randomly eight clinical laboratories including five in private sector and three governmental clinical laboratories were selected for sampling according to the purpose of the study. The results showed that the total amount of waste generation was 27,700.90 kg/year. The average amount of health-care wastes generation in Ilam city was 0.2 kg/person/year. The portions of general, pathologic, sharp, infectious, and pharmaceutical and chemical wastes were 37, 5, 2, and 56% (by weight), respectively. As a considerable amount of waste is generated in clinical laboratories of Ilam city, therefore, it is necessary to implement integrated plans for the proper management of these wastes. Thus, sufficient training and education programs must be developed for all clinical staffs and that the existing training and education procedures should also be promoted."
3529422,1,a,"The development of a theory of quality of life following serious illness is currently an important field of endeavour in rehabilitation research. The interpersonal relationships of people and elements of the self-concept appear to be salient factors in causal models of subjective well-being. One such model developed to explain characteristic levels of well-being was used in a longitudinal study of adaptation to a first myocardial infarction. Data were collected from a national sample of male cardiac patients and their spouses on the illness and marital situation as predictors of long-term well-being or ill-being. Analyses of data from the first three waves of the study, which is to extend over 5 years after the onset of illness, are to be discussed in the paper. Marital status, the emotional quality of the spouse relationship and long-standing marital stressors were found to have direct and indirect effects on the two dimensions of the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. The same is true of continuing problems associated with the heart attack relative to perceptions of having coped effectively with the after effects of illness. Differences in self-esteem and personal competence were suggested as mediators of socio-environmental and illness-related influences. The two-factor conception of well-being developed was found to be a useful framework for investigating positive and negative aspects of psychosocial rehabilitation. The same factors that explain differences between happy and unhappy people in social indicators research also appeared to be determinants of different trajectories of adaptation in the wake of a life-threatening illness. Previous research using theoretical models from stress research has overemphasized psychosocial morbidity and stress management and neglected positive processes of adaptation. The identification of love resources related to positive feeling states and life satisfaction has, therefore, not received the attention it deserves. This is especially the case regarding an overemphasis of the concept of social support as a buffer of stress. Instruments were developed to measure high and low marital intimacy, as well as chronic marital role strains, and these measures appeared to explain different trajectories of adjustment to cardiac disease. The two-factor model appears to be useful for future work on quality of life with chronic illness. The same is true of four marital contexts of rehabilitation that were identified in the study."
3426705,1,a,"An experiment was conducted in which 66 male subjects were given access to alcohol (20% vol.) and fruit juice to be mixed and tasted ad lib. A factorial design included social vs. solitary drinking conditions, laboratory vs. informal setting, and variable exposure to music. The amount of ethanol consumed (g/kg body weight) was used as an unobtrusive measure of preferred intake. The reciprocal relationship between mood and consumption was analyzed by LISREL. While euphoria has usually been perceived as a consequence of drinking, the only plausible fit to a LISREL model was obtained by assuming that the disposition to drink would be increased by positive mood changes occurring during the drinking session. An analogy between social drinking and adjunctive behaviour was supported, as alcohol consumption was directly affected by time-dependent environmental factors such as company and music. Since the presence of company also stimulated positive mood and alleviated boredom, consumption was precipitated by company indirectly as well as directly. These results emphasize the importance of direct as well as indirect environmental influences on spontaneous alcohol intake during social drinking."
7275378,1,a,"Principal components analysis was used to delineate motivational patterns associated with illicit drug use in a population of U.S. Navy enlisted men (n = 867) undergoing drug rehabilitation. Patients indicated which of 31 reasons for drug use were associated with various drugs. Four components emerged from this analysis, labeled Insight-Seeking, Therapeutic Needs, Sentience, and Pleasure-Seeking. Higher order factor analysis revealed the presence of a general factor, labeled General Sensation-Seeking. Multiple regression procedures were used to relate the derived dimensions to actual drug use behavior. The significant relationships observed among the factor analytic patterns in predicting overall drug involvement were shown to lead to increased explanation concerning interrelationships among personality needs and social resources. The findings suggested a number of hypotheses pertaining to increased understanding of motivational patterns underlying initiation and continuation of illicit drug use."
29252196,0,a,"Background Peer and parental substance use are established predictors for substance use among adolescent, little is known about influence of sibling cigarette smoking and its interaction with peer network on substance use potential that can introduce an important way for substance use prevention programs. Objective The aim of present study was to explore the association of sibling cigarette smoking and peer network with substance use potential among high school students in Tehran. Subjects Data were drawn from the population-based cross-sectional study of among 650 high schools students. Methods Multiple linear regression was used in order to determine the adjusted association between cigarette smoking among family members, peer network, their interaction and substance use potential. Result Having a sister who smokes (B = 3.19; p < 0.01) and peer network quality were associated with substance use potential (B = -0.1; p < 0.05). The increase in mean of substance use potential associated with decreases in peer network quality score is much more than in who have a sister with a cigarette smoking habit. Conclusion Having a sister who smokes interacts with peer network quality; appears to be one of the important mechanisms for adolescents' tendency to substance use. These findings can help in a better understanding of substance use potential mechanisms, screening efforts and the formulation of prevention programs."

Especially the influence of characteristics of the delivery system (e.g. differences between urban and rural regions) and characteristics of users (e.g. social class) are investigated. In this article the conceptual frame of the study is described. The model is based on assumptions of the action-decision-theory. It structures the process of decision and action into four phases: the first two, perception and interpretation, are summarized as ""process of attention""; the subsequent ones, coping and evaluation, as ""process of acting"". The model describes the social system (the total of demographic, socio-structural and socio-economic variables) and the memory system (contained within the individual life history) as mediating factors influencing the decision to act."

27400922,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Frequent emergency department (ED) users account for a disproportionately high number of ED visits. Studies on case management (CM) interventions to reduce frequent ED use have shown mixed results, and few studies have been conducted within a universal health coverage system. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a CM intervention-compared to standard emergency care-reduces ED attendance. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty frequent ED users (5 or more visits in the prior 12 months) who visited a public urban ED at the Lausanne University Hospital between May 2012 and July 2013 were allocated to either an intervention (n = 125) or control (n = 125) group, and monitored for 12 months. INTERVENTIONS: An individualized CM intervention consisting of concrete assistance in obtaining income entitlements, referral to primary or specialty medical care, access to mental health care or substance abuse treatment, and counseling on at-risk behaviors and health care utilization (in addition to standard care) at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 months. MAIN MEASURES: We used a generalized linear model for count data (negative binomial distribution) to compare the number of ED visits during the 12-month follow-up between CM and usual care, from an intention-to-treat perspective. KEY RESULTS: At 12 months, there were 2.71 (+/-0.23) ED visits in the intervention group versus 3.35 (+/-0.32) visits among controls (ratio = 0.81, 95 % CI = 0.63; 1.02). In the multivariate model, the effect of the CM intervention on the number of ED visits approached statistical significance (b = -0.219, p = 0.075). The presence of poor social determinants of health was a significant predictor of ED use in the multivariate model (b = 0.280, p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: CM may reduce ED use by frequent users through an improved orientation to the health care system. Poor social determinants of health significantly increase use of the ED by frequent users."
6464823,1,a,"A sample of delinquent and nondelinquent male adolescents was assessed with respect to locus of control and intellectual achievement responsibility. Data were also gathered concerning age, family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and school grade. Results were subjected to a multivariate analysis and showed support for a multidimensional model of locus of control. There was no difference in expectancy of control for negative academic events between delinquents and nondelinquents. In general, birth order and delinquency were the two most important determinants of locus of control. Results are discussed in terms of previous literature on locus of control with particular consideration paid to expectations of control."
30541042,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify associations of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cancer risk but usually only explain a fraction of the inherited variability. Pathway analysis of genetic variants is a powerful tool to identify networks of susceptibility genes. METHODS: We conducted a large agnostic pathway-based meta-analysis of GWAS data using the summary-based adaptive rank truncated product method to identify gene sets and pathways associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in 9040 cases and 12 496 controls. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and functional annotation of the top SNPs in genes contributing to the top associated pathways and gene sets. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified 14 pathways and gene sets associated with PDAC at a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. After Bonferroni correction (P </= 1.3 x 10-5), the strongest associations were detected in five pathways and gene sets, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young, regulation of beta-cell development, role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor transactivation by G protein-coupled receptors in cardiac hypertrophy pathways, and the Nikolsky breast cancer chr17q11-q21 amplicon and Pujana ATM Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) network gene sets. We identified and validated rs876493 and three correlating SNPs (PGAP3) and rs3124737 (CASP7) from the Pujana ATM PCC gene set as eQTLs in two normal derived pancreas tissue datasets. CONCLUSION: Our agnostic pathway and gene set analysis integrated with functional annotation and eQTL analysis provides insight into genes and pathways that may be biologically relevant for risk of PDAC, including those not previously identified."
6542479,1,a,"Reproductive and agonistic behaviors in Siamese fighting fish were investigated in eight experiments, and some consequences and determinants of these sequences were isolated. First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior."
4034814,1,a,"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration."
31143637,0,a,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, account for 72% of all global deaths, with 78% of all NCDs taking place in low- and middle-income countries. Among these four main groups of NCDs, CVDs are taking the highest death toll at 17.9 million or 44% of all NCD mortality. This paper suggests that the complex interplay of NCD risk factors and their underlying social and commercial determinants requires active cooperation with the private sector to bring about policy change, pool resources and generate innovative solutions by capitalizing on each partner's strengths. However, such partnerships can only be successful if safeguards are in place to define the rules of engagement, align incentives to achieve shared public health objectives and manage potential conflicts of interest."
30856145,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Construction workers are at greater risk of musculoskeletal disorders due to their exposure to physical ergonomic risk factors. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to quantify the ergonomic hazards for workers in the construction of residential buildings. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, PATH method, a work-sampling observation method, was applied to study the working postures, handled loads, and manual material handling activities in construction workers. A total of 5832 observations were made on 10 workers involved in tasks of three jobs including reinforcing bar, formwork, and pouring concrete. The ergonomic exposure was characterized in terms of percentage of observations made for each task. RESULTS: Non-neutral trunk postures, especially mild and severe flexions, were frequently observed in all job tasks. High-strain leg postures of squatting, kneeling, and leg(s) bent were mostly observed in floor formwork (39%), concrete finishing (5%), and floor rebar construction (52.3%), respectively. The highest proportion of work time with one (5.8%) and two hands (9%) at/above shoulder was observed in column rebar construction. In concrete pouring and rebar cutting, workers were observed in 39.45% and 23.1% of work time doing carry and push/pull activities, respectively. Heavy loads (>15 kg) were mostly observed in concrete pouring and floor formwork tasks. CONCLUSION: In the construction of residential buildings with the concrete structure, workers perform their task with non-neutral postures of trunk and leg and handling heavy loads. The recommended controls could reduce the musculoskeletal stress in rebar tying, concrete pouring, and concrete finishing tasks."
7226684,1,a,"In an effort to provide the clinician with suggestions for preventive and remedial approaches to adolescent pregnancy, the nature, medical, social, economic, and psychological aspects of the problem are reviewed and discussed. While the rate of adolescent pregnancy is declining, there are more than 560,000 deliveries to teenagers annually. Medical risks are significantly diminished by early and comprehensive prenatal care. The major complications continue to be social and economic. Lower I.Q.s in offspring of adolescent mothers have been reported. Failure to complete high school significantly increases the risk of unemployment, trapping the premature parent and her offspring in a web of poverty. A lack of a sense of future and viable alternatives may legitimize the option of motherhood in the minds of many adolescent girls. Furthermore, an ignorance and a denial of sexuality combined with the developmental imperatives of experimentation and rebellion place the adolescent at high risk for pregnancy."
26682658,0,a,"Postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (P-PTSD) is a variant of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that, although relatively prevalent, is under-researched. Up to one-third of women in the United States describe childbirth as traumatic, with 9 percent of women meeting the criteria for PTSD outlined by the American Psychiatric Association. These statistics are sobering in light of common use of analgesia during birth as well as hospital birth environments promoting family-centered maternity care. How can a seemingly natural event, such as childbirth, be associated with PTSD? This review includes a description of key variables associated with P-PTSD. Socioeconomic, environmental and genetic determinants are discussed, as are evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches."
26347090,0,a,"Numerous studies have documented the determinants of sexual behavior among adolescents in less-developed countries, yet relatively little is known about the influence of social contexts such as school and neighborhood. Using two waves of data from a school-based longitudinal survey conducted in Malawi from 2011-13, this study advances our understanding of the relationship between school-level socioeconomic contexts and adolescents' sexual activity. The results from two-level multinomial logistic regression models suggest that high socioeconomic composition of the student body in school decreases the odds of initiation of sexual activity, independent of other important features of schools and individual-level characteristics. This study also finds that the association between school socioeconomic composition and sexual activity is statistically significant among male adolescents but not female adolescents, suggesting that schools' socioeconomic contexts may be more relevant to male adolescents' initiation of sexual activity."
29064345,0,a,"Research indicates that older adults receive only about half of their recommended care, with varying quality and limited attention to social issues impacting their health through the most commonly used quality measures. Additionally, many existing measures neglect to address nonclinical social determinants of health. Evidence of the need for more comprehensive measures for seniors is growing. The primary purpose of this article, which is supported by a limited review of literature, is to describe gaps among current quality measures in addressing certain nonclinical needs of older adults, including key social determinants of health. In doing so, the authors describe their position on the need for expanded measures to incorporate these factors to improve care and quality of life. The authors conducted a limited review of the literature to inform this article, focusing specifically on selected measures for older adults rather than a broader systematic review of all measures. Most research identified was related to clinical practice guidelines rather than quality measures of care as applied to older adults. Furthermore, the literature reviewed reflected limited evidence of efforts to tailor quality measures for the unique social needs of older adults, confirming a potential gap in this area. A growing need exists for improved quality measures specifically designed to help providers address the unique social needs of older adults. Filling this gap will improve overall understanding of seniors and help them to achieve optimal health and successful aging."

10284405,1,a,"Much research on internal labor markets has been hampered by the failure to differentiate the wide variety of ILMs, by accounts of their determinants that too heavily emphasize isolated causal factors, by the lack of detailed material describing the economic and organizational dimensions of their design and implementation, and by the neglect of managerial perceptions of and motivations for constructing ILMs. This paper presents detailed case studies of three organizations that have constructed very different ILMs. Based on this material, a model of the determinants of ILMs is developed that centers around the concepts of costs, commitment, and rewards and that attempts to assess the interactions of effects of markets and hierarchies on ILMs. The model is built on the premise that the underlying imperatives typically held to affect ILMs are inevitably filtered through managerial beliefs and the constraints on managerial decision making. The implications of these findings for theory and research on ILMs are discussed."
6520880,1,a,"This study tests two theories regarding the attitude and behavioral determinants of women's coital and masturbatory orgasmic responsiveness. Data from 115 sexually active women were analyzed using latent-variable structural equation models. Twenty-one variables are used to represent seven latent constructs: Parent Sexual Attitudes, Sexual Latency, Sexual Behavior, Dating Competence, Social Assertiveness, Subjective Masturbatory Responsiveness, and Subjective Coital Responsiveness. Two specific theories are tested with these constructs. Each theory predicts a different structural arrangement among these latent factors with the fundamental difference being whether behavior predicts responsiveness or vice-versa. Two alternate models were found to reflect the data adequately. In both instances, attitudes predicted behavior and, in general, orgasmic responsiveness tended to be a function of behavior."
3384511,1,a,"Empirical data on Japanese American drinking behavior are scarce. The present study was a random sample (N = 295) of households in Los Angeles with Japanese surnames. Japanese Americans born in the United States tended to drink less than those born in Japan. The study also observed significant gender differences in Japanese American drinking behavior which were attributed to ascribed social roles. Other demographic and social determinants of drinking were examined through two logistic regression models. The first model predicted drinking (as opposed to abstaining), while the other distinguished heavy drinkers from those who drank alcohol in more moderate amounts. Potential reference groups (e.g., parents, friends, church groups, etc.) were often significant in predicting whether and how much a Japanese American drank."
28414829,0,a,"This text looks at the difference between sociology in medicine (collaborator of health institutions) and the sociology of medicine (independent of health institutions). If consistent, sociology in medicine should become a sociology of medicine. As an example, it is shown how the study of the social determinants of health and illness begins by assuming non-problematically the ontological reality of health and illness, but ends up problematizing the very concept of health-disease, demonstrating that the study of health determinants also requires the study of the determinants of the social construction of disease. The urgent necessity of objectifying collective health itself is argued. By applying sociological tools we can examine the so-called objective factors in the determination of health and disease, the socially constructed nature of these categories of knowledge, and the struggles and power relations that determine whether or not such categories are viable."
6139036,1,a,"A community sample of older adults was investigated to test some of the current hypothesis about the etiology of depression in the elderly. Multiple regression analysis showed that cognitive disturbances (memory, concentration), previous depressive episodes, and somatic health problems accounted for most of the etiological variance. Other variables, like stressful life events, financial problems, social isolation, alcohol use, age, sex, and previous somatic illnesses are significant but their numerical values are very small. Etiological insignificant were the variables: physical activities, competency in daily living, and support by ones own children."
3811607,1,a,"Data concerning histories of Adenoidectomy (Ad), Tonsillectomy (T) and Appendectomy (Ap) were collected from the escorts (mainly mothers) of 2296 children 3-12 years-old. The children were admitted as outpatients at the First Department of Paediatrics of the University of Athens or the Polyclinic of the Children's Welfare Center of PIKPA in Pireaus, during the last six months of 1983. Among children with median age of about six years, 12 percent had already had at least one operation (Ad, T or Ap); this proportion increased to about 25 percent among children with median age of about 10 years. The cumulative incidence of Ad and/or T was higher among boys, whereas the cumulative incidence of Ap was higher among girls. The age adjusted cumulative incidence of Ap was significantly higher in the lower social class, whereas there was no social gradient with respect to Ad or T. There were strong intra-individual correlations among the three studied operations; in particular the age adjusted cumulative incidence of Ap was 2.9 times higher among children with Ad and/or T than among children without any of these operations. Since there are no apparent biomedical reasons to account for the observed intra-individual associations, it appears likely, that these associations reflect parental or physician's attitudes leading to unjustifiable operations in some of the children."
3407490,1,a,"The influence of parental factors on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use has been examined previously, and findings have been contradictory. Previous studies, which found little relationship between parental norms and adolescent sexual activity, have been limited by their failure to recognize developmental differences in the relative weight of parent and peer influences between younger and older teens and by use of selected samples, resulting in a restriction of range. The current study differs in that it utilizes a clustered sample household survey of 329 males and females, aged 14 to 17, and 470 of their parents. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that parents' reported behavioral norms account for 5% of the variance in whether adolescents have had intercourse, and for 33% of the variance in use of contraception at last intercourse. The study suggests that while parents' normative beliefs have limited effect in the decision to become sexually active, they have considerable impact on later contraceptive use."
2768294,1,a,"A life table analysis is made of the duration of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea in Orissa, India, taking one variable at a time using data from a baseline survey of fertility and mortality (BSFM) conducted on the lines of the World Fertility Survey. Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age. The durations of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea are strongly related."
3788206,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."
31826014,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the levels and trends of household need for caregivers of older people and to explore the impact of potential determinants of psychological burden among caregivers of older people in Thailand. METHODS: The secondary data analysis was performed using the Survey of Older Persons in Thailand 2007, 2011, and 2014 datasets which conducted by the National Statistical Office of Thailand. The household need for caregivers of older persons refers to having at least one older person in the household who needs a caregiver for assistance with activities of daily living. Caregiver mental health, which is confined to the available 2011 data, is defined as a state of psychological burden. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to explore the impact of potential determinants of psychological caregiver burden. RESULTS: The household need for caregivers in Thailand tends to be increasing, from 5.0% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2014. The levels of the household need for caregivers were significantly higher in urban areas, Bangkok, and high socioeconomic households. In terms of psychological caregiver burden, the Thai Mental Health Indicators in 2011 produced, on average, a fair level of mental health, but one-fourth of caregivers had poor mental health. Duration of care for older people, household wealth, and functional dependency significantly predict total caregiver burden. Household characteristics are vital in predicting psychological caregiver burden, and the adjusted effect of the fifth quintile of household wealth was high (odds ratio = 2.34; 95% confidence interval = 1.47-3.73). CONCLUSION: The increasing need for caregiving in households with an older person can lead to a higher caregiver burden, particularly among those caregivers who care for dependent older people in poor households. Longer duration of caregiving is a factor that mitigates this burden."
30315427,0,a,"PURPOSE: Cancer patients in Germany often face payments related to their disease or treatment which are not covered by their health insurance. The aim of this study was to analyze the amount of out-of-pocket payments (OOPPs) among cancer patients in Germany, to explore potential socioeconomic determinants of OOPPs, and to identify how cancer patients are burdened by these payments. METHODS: Cancer ptients were consecutively enrolled in 16 clinics in Leipzig, Germany. Data on OOPPs for the past 3 months and on socioeconomic status were obtained at the end of their hospital stay (t0) and 3 (t1) and 15 months (t2) after t0. Financial burden was calculated by dividing the monthly OOPPs by the midpoint of the income category, and the perceived burden was assessed by using the financial difficulties scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30. A two-part regression model was used to estimate the determinants of OOPPs. RESULTS: At baseline (t0), 502 cancer patients participated in the study and provided data on OOPPs and socioeconomic status. The mean 3-month OOPPs were the following: euro205.8 at baseline, euro179.2 at t1, and euro148.1 at t2. Compared to the lowest income group (< euro500 monthly), all other income groups (euro500-999, euro1000-1499, and >/= euro1500) had higher 3-month OOPPs of euro52.3 (p = 0.241), euro90.2 (p = 0.059), or euro62.2 (p = 0.176). Financial burden at t0 was 6.4% (SD 9.2%) on average, 5.4% (SD 9.9%) at t1, and to 3.9% (SD 7.0%) of monthly income at t2. CONCLUSION: German cancer patients face relatively high OOPPs during their cancer journey. These payments may burden cancer patients, especially certain subgroups like low-income groups."
21110000,0,a,"PURPOSE: European studies about ethnic inequalities in depressive symptoms are scarce, show inconclusive results and are complicated by the discussion of what constitute (im)migrant and ethnic minority groups. Moreover, comparisons across countries are hampered by a lack of comparable measures of depressive symptoms. This study aims to assess the prevalence and determinants of depressive symptoms among immigrants, ethnic minorities and natives in 23 European countries. METHODS: Multilevel analyses are performed using data from the third wave of the European Social Survey (ESS-3). This dataset comprises information about 36,970 respondents, aged 21 years or older, of whom 13.3% immigrants and 6.2% ethnic minorities. Depressive symptoms were assessed with an 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Main determinants are immigrant status, socio-economic conditions and the experience of ethnic discrimination in the host country. RESULTS: The results show that immigrants and ethnic minorities do experience more depressive symptoms than natives in an essential part of the countries. Moreover, socio-economic conditions and the experience of ethnic discrimination are important risk factors. Immigrant status seems irrelevant, once the other risk factors are accounted for. Finally, immigrant and ethnic minority groups do not consist of the same individuals and therefore have different prevalence rates of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms are higher for immigrant and ethnic minority groups in a substantial part of the European countries. A clear definition is indispensable for developing policies that address the right-targeted population."
29157994,0,a,"A better understanding of the public's preferences and what factors influence them is required if they are to be used to drive decision-making in health. This is particularly the case for service areas undergoing continual reform such as emergency and primary care. Accordingly, this study sought to determine if attitudes, socio-demographic characteristics and healthcare experiences influence the public's intentions to access care and their preferences for hypothetical emergency care alternatives. A discrete choice experiment was used to elicit the preferences of Australian adults (n=1529). Mixed logit regression analyses revealed the influence of a range of individual characteristics on preferences and service uptake choices across three different presenting scenarios. Age was associated with service uptake choices in all contexts, whilst the impact of other sociodemographics, health experience and attitudinal factors varied by context. The improvements in explanatory power observed from including these factors in the models highlight the need to further clarify their influence with larger populations and other presenting contexts, and to identify other determinants of preference heterogeneity. The results suggest social marketing programs undertaken as part of demand management efforts need to be better targeted if decision-makers are seeking to increase community acceptance of emerging service models and alternatives. Other implications for health policy, service planning and research, including for workforce planning and the possible introduction of a system of co-payments are discussed."
3961043,1,a,"Groups of highly anxious, moderately anxious and minimally anxious primiparous mothers (N = 147) were obtained on the basis of Spielberger trait anxiety scores in the postpartum period, and subjects were compared. Allocation to those groups appeared to be more likely to reflect constitutional levels of anxiety, rather than recent or current social stressors. Highly anxious mothers were distinguished on a number of presumed correlates of anxiety measured by clinical questions (e.g. terminating of anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. mood problems noted by nursing staff) and blind rater assessments (e.g. unassertiveness). While highly anxious mothers were more likely to report more recent life events, less social support, and negative interpretations of the pregnancy, the hospital experience and the hospital staff, such variables were less discriminating when neuroticism levels were effectively controlled. This suggests an intrinsic perceptual bias, rather than that the factors were determinants. Highly anxious mothers had more delivery complications, while their babies were more likely to be dysmature and slow to suckle, features we interpret as consequences of the anxiety levels. In the postpartum period these mothers were more depressed, had more concerns about their baby, themselves and their marriage, and were less confident about coping and their parenting capacities. Such variables may be correlates or consequences of anxiety."
21289357,0,a,"Comparative effectiveness research to date has focused primarily on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries in individuals. Yet the greatest drivers of people's overall health are found in their social and physical environments. We recommend that the comparative effectiveness research agenda focus on the public health issues responsible for the greatest overall illness and death levels, such as programs to increase high school graduation rates, which are strongly associated with improvements in long-term illness and death rates. In so doing, the agenda should spotlight efforts to address widely recognized social and environmental determinants of health, such as improving access to early childhood development programs and education, as well as interventions aimed at affecting climate change and addressing behavioral risk factors such as smoking. We also urge federal health agencies to invest in further development of methods to compare public health interventions and to use those methods to conduct the studies."
26432012,0,a,"BACKGROUND: School preparedness for bioevents, such as emerging infectious diseases, bioterrorism, and pandemics, is imperative, but historically has been low. METHODS: The Missouri Association of School Nurses members were sent an online survey during the 2013-2014 school year to assess current bioevent readiness. There were 15 and 35 indicators of school disaster and bioevent preparedness, respectively. Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to delineate factors associated with higher school disaster and bioevent preparedness scores. RESULTS: In total, 133 school nurses participated, with a 33.6% response rate. On average, schools had fewer than half of the disaster or bioevent indicators. Disaster and bioevent preparedness scores ranged from 1-12.5 (mean, 6.0) and 5-25 (mean, 13.8), respectively. The least frequently reported plan components included bioterrorism-specific psychological needs addressed (1.5%, n = 2), having a foodservice biosecurity plan (8.3%, n = 11), and having a liberal sick leave policy for bioevents (22.6%, n = 30). Determinants of better bioevent preparedness include perception that the school is well prepared for a pandemic (P = .001) or natural disaster (P < .05), nurse being on the disaster planning committee (P = .001), and school being a closed point of dispensing (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Schools are underprepared for biological events and are not on track to meet state and national biological preparedness goals."
3232413,1,a,"With the aging of populations in developing countries there is both a demographic and an epidemiological transition which affects the impact of chronic degenerative diseases on the health status of the populations. Demographic transition takes place in countries where there are effective programmes of disease control which allow for survival during the early years of childhood and adolescence. This results in an increase in life expectancy which places larger proportions of the population in the age range (60 years and older) in which chronic degenerative diseases become the major determinants of health status. Epidemiological transition in diseases may also be brought about by shifts in social and economic patterns which favour detrimental changes in risk factors for the chronic degenerative diseases. Such changes may include health-related behaviour which augments dietary consumption of fats and alcohol, increases obesity, increases smoking and decreases physical activity. Such changes in risk-factor levels increase the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases which manifest themselves at later ages, and for which early preventive actions could be cost-effective. In order to illustrate the impact of both demographic and risk-factor effects, analyses are made of the impact of increases in life expectancy on cause-specific mortality in both developing and developed countries. It is shown that there is great similarity in the effect of major noncommunicable diseases on the life expectancy of adults in both developed and developing countries. The major differences are seen to be in the proportions of deaths expected from such diseases as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cirrhosis; but not in the distribution of age at death which is the better measure of disease impact. Demographic analyses, computing indirect estimates of mortality, also demonstrate that there are currently more chronic disease deaths in developing than developed countries and that as expectation of life increases in developing countries the global chronic disease burden will be greatly concentrated in the developing countries. Analyses of risk-factor reduction by feasible intervention strategies, e.g. smoking cessation campaigns, treatment of high blood pressure, using relationships between risk factors and diseases established in longitudinal studies carried out in developed countries, point out that the effect of risk-factor control in long-living populations can be hidden by the dependency of risk factors and various related causes of death, e.g. smoking has an impact on lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, but at different ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
17093748,1,a,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting."
3453175,1,a,"To explore the psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination (BSE) among women, we studied a stratified random sample of 264 women students, faculty, and staff in a university community. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported frequency of BSE, and predictors included measures of general health predispositions, variables of the Health Belief Model, the impact of a woman's social network, a set of secondary non-health-related barriers and benefits, and the woman's evaluation of her personal health care system. Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice."
22095353,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of social determinants of potential exposure to H1N1--which are unequally distributed by race/ethnicity in the United States--on incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. METHODS: In January 2010 we surveyed a nationally representative sample (n = 2079) of US adults from the Knowledge Networks online research panel, with Hispanic and African American oversamples. The completion rate was 56%. RESULTS: Path analysis examining ILI incidence, race, and social determinants of potential exposure to H1N1 demonstrated that higher ILI incidence was related to workplace policies, such as lack of access to sick leave, and structural factors, such as number of children in the household. Hispanic ethnicity was related to a greater risk of ILI attributable to these social determinants, even after we controlled for income and education. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of certain workplace policies, such as paid sick leave, confers a population-attributable risk of 5 million additional cases of ILI in the general population and 1.2 million cases among Hispanics. Federal mandates for sick leave could have significant health impacts by reducing morbidity from ILI, especially in Hispanics."
28241960,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is an important public health problem globally. Algorithms incorporating the assessment of clinical biomarkers together with several established traditional risk factors can help clinicians to predict CHD and support clinical decision making with respect to interventions. Decision tree (DT) is a data mining model for extracting hidden knowledge from large databases. We aimed to establish a predictive model for coronary heart disease using a decision tree algorithm. METHODS: Here we used a dataset of 2346 individuals including 1159 healthy participants and 1187 participant who had undergone coronary angiography (405 participants with negative angiography and 782 participants with positive angiography). We entered 10 variables of a total 12 variables into the DT algorithm (including age, sex, FBG, TG, hs-CRP, TC, HDL, LDL, SBP and DBP). RESULTS: Our model could identify the associated risk factors of CHD with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of 96%, 87%, 94% and respectively. Serum hs-CRP levels was at top of the tree in our model, following by FBG, gender and age. CONCLUSION: Our model appears to be an accurate, specific and sensitive model for identifying the presence of CHD, but will require validation in prospective studies."
3182366,1,a,"A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers."
3990300,1,a,"Contemporary theorists view many alcohol effects as complex functions of a number of interacting variables ranging from pharmacological factors (e.g., limb of the blood alcohol curve), environmental factors (e.g., setting) and dispositional factors (e.g., individually held expectations concerning the effects of alcohol). To examine this general model, the joint effects on subjective state of beverage (alcohol vs placebo), of setting (alone vs group) and of individual differences in alcohol expectancies were examined in a sample of 98 men social drinkers. Assessment of subjective state included measures of both mood and perceived physical sensations. The results demonstrated the complex determinants of subjective effects of alcohol and illustrated the difficulty of making strong generalizations concerning the subjective effects of alcohol. Alcohol consumption, alcohol expectancies and setting appear to have both independent and interacting effects on subjective state. These effects appear to vary in importance across the types of effects considered and the time since drinking."
3762472,1,a,"In 1983-1984, 4578 Perth primary and secondary schoolchildren were studied. The selected sample was broadly representative of the ethnic groups that make up the Perth population and of the different social ranks within that population. The age, sex, weight, height, country of birth of the child and the parents, and occupation of the father were recorded for each subject. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI) increased with age. Age and sex were the most important determinants of body size. However, children of lower social rank and those with a southern European background were over-represented among the overweight children (greater than the 90th centile for BMI), particularly in adolescence. Children with an Asian background who were 11 years of age and younger were over-represented among the underweight children (less than or equal to the 10th centile for BMI). Results from this study indicate a continuing, though small (1.5 cm to 1.6 cm), secular increase in height over the past 13 to 14 years."
30963510,0,a,"We used four methods (direct count, indirect count, wisdom of the crowd, and unique object multiplier) to map and estimate the population size of street children in six major cities in Iran in 2017. In aggregate for the six cities, the number of street children was estimated at 5296 (interquartile range [IQR] 4122-7071) using the median of the four methods. This corresponds to a rate of 16.3 (IQR 12.5-24.5) per 10,000 children age 5-18 years old, or 3.2 (IQR 2.4-5.3) per 10,000 total population. The total number for street children in the country is estimated at 26,000 (IQR 20,239-34,719) children. Results can help policy-makers advocate for resources, plan programs, and evaluate the reach of programs for street children. The maps created through the course of the population size estimation exercise can also guide outreach efforts to provide street children with health and social welfare services."
6738684,1,a,"Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance."

3130744,1,a,"In a longitudinal pilot study on the course of the PCB concentration in human milk during six months of lactation, some important PCB determinants could be studied in 23 women and their infants. PCB values were within the range of those found in the literature. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the association of the mean PCB concentration over the first half year of lactation with maternal parameters, such as age, height, weight, previous lactation period, education, occupation, residence, smoking, drinking and dietary habits as well as the infant parameters gestational age, birthweight and weight gain in the first six months of life. Since the PCB concentration on fat basis and the fat content of the milk were strongly inversely related, statistical analyses were carried out both on fat and on milk basis. In univariate analyses the PCB concentration on fat basis was most strongly associated with pre- versus post-pregnancy weight gain, age and occupation. After multiple regression analysis PCB concentration on fat basis remained significantly associated with weight gain changes and remained borderline (p less than 0.10) significantly related with occupation. The pre-pregnancy Quetelet Index of the mother (height/weight) and the estimated PCB content of the diet (primarily fish) were strongly correlated with the PCB concentration on milk basis. Only the Quetelet Index remained significantly related after multiple regression analysis."
27491283,0,a,"The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize evidence describing delivery of healthcare services to adolescents while in foster care and to young adults after they exit foster care. The long-term, deleterious effect of abuse and/or neglect by caregivers among youth who have been placed in foster care is grounded in empirical evidence demonstrating the relationship between long-term health needs and exposure to trauma in childhood. Evidence is needed to provide culturally-specific care and also to identify knowledge gaps in the care of adolescents and young adults who have been in the foster care system. Peer-reviewed research studies published between 2004 and 2014 that include samples of youth 12 to 30 years of age are included in the review. Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria for the review. Physical and behavioral healthcare needs among youth with foster care experience are significant. The ability to adequately meet health needs are inextricable from the ability to negotiate resources and to successfully interact with adults. Challenges that youth with foster care histories experience when transitioning into young adulthood are comparable to other populations of vulnerable youth not in foster care. Nurses must use each healthcare encounter to assess how the social determinants of health facilitate or impede optimal health among youth with foster care experience. The development of integrated intervention strategies to inform best practice models is a priority for current and former foster care youth as they transition into young adulthood."
25858180,0,a,"Background The relationship between well-being and mental ill health is complex; people may experience very low levels of well-being even in the absence of overt mental health problems. Aims This study tested the hypothesis that anxiety, depression and well-being have different causal determinants and psychological mediating mechanisms. Method The influence of causal and mediating factors on anxiety, depression and well-being were investigated in a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey hosted on a UK national broadcasting website. Results Multivariate conditional independence analysis of data from 27 397 participants revealed different association pathways for the two constructs. Anxiety and depression were associated with negative life events mediated by rumination; low levels of subjective well-being were associated with material deprivation and social isolation, mediated by adaptive coping style. Conclusions Our findings support the 'two continua' model of the relationship between psychological well-being and mental health problems, with implications for both treatment and prevention."
27663703,0,a,"Objectives The broad maternal and child health community has witnessed increased attention to the entire continuum of reproductive and perinatal health concerns over the past few years. However, both recent discouraging trends in prenatal care access and utilization and a renewed understanding of prenatal care as a critical anchor of the reproductive/perinatal health continuum for women who do get pregnant demand a new effort to focus on the prenatal period as a gateway for maternal and infant health. Methods This commentary: describes the Medicaid expansions and the momentum for universal access to prenatal care of the 1980-1990s; examines the pivot away from this goal and its aftermath; provides a rationale for why renewed attention to prenatal care and the prenatal period is essential; and, explores the potential focus of an updated prenatal care agenda. Conclusion We conclude that increasing women's access to high quality prenatal care will require substantial effort at the clinical, community, policy, and system levels. Only when attention is paid to all phases of the reproductive/perinatal health continuum with an emphasis on continuity between all periods, and on the social determinants that affect health and well-being, will our nation be able to ensure the health of all women across the life course (whether or not they ever become mothers), while simultaneously fulfilling our nation's promise that all children-no matter their income or race/ethnicity-will have the opportunity to be born well."
25079288,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The Health System Responsiveness Questionnaire is an instrument designed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000 to assess the experience of patients when interacting with the health care system. This investigation aimed to adapt a Mental Health System Responsiveness Questionnaire (MHSRQ) based on the WHO concept and evaluate its validity and reliability to the mental health care system in Iran. DESIGN: In accordance with the WHO health system responsiveness questionnaire and the findings of a qualitative study, a Farsi version of the MHSRQ was tailored to suit the mental health system in Iran. This version was tested in a cross-sectional study at nine public mental health clinics in Tehran. A sample of 500 mental health services patients was recruited and subsequently completed the questionnaire. Item missing rate was used to check the feasibility while the reliability of the scale was determined by assessing the Cronbach's alpha and item total correlations. The factor structure of the questionnaire was investigated by performing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). RESULTS: The results showed a satisfactory feasibility since the item missing value was lower than 5.2%. With the exception of access domain, reliability of different domains of the questionnaire was within a desirable range. The factor loading showed an acceptable unidimentionality of the scale despite the fact that three items related to access did not perform well. The CFA also indicated good fit indices for the model (CFI=0.99, GFI=0.97, IFI=0.99, AGFI=0.97). CONCLUSIONS: In general, the findings suggest that the Farsi version of the MHSRQ is a feasible, reliable, and valid measure of the mental health system responsiveness in Iran. Changes to the questions related to the access domain should be considered in order to improve the psychometric properties of the measure."
27660875,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Caregivers of demented relatives devote their time and attention in order to help the beloved members of the family. Those who are informal caregivers require support in order to avoid being overburdened. Many such caregivers may suffer from chronic health problems, for instance, depression. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the factors of depression in caregivers, and to discover the determinants of depression among informal family caregivers of demented individuals. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Forty-one caregivers in the research group were administered a questionnaire which included the caregivers' demographics. Caregiver's level of depression was measured by the scale of the Centre for Epidemiology Scale for Depression. The relationship between depression and demographic features was analyzed. Data were analyzed using STATISTICA 8.1 (StatSoft). Analysis of the results was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality. Pearson correlation coefficient was also used. RESULTS: Referring to The Centre for Epidemiology Scale for Depression, the average score in the study group was 18 +/- 7.49. There was no statistically significant relationship between the level of depression and such factors as caregiver's age, time of care of demented relative, and type of kinship and pain. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no relationship between the level of depression and demographic features, the problem with quality of life, worries and grief which may appear, seemed to be sufficient reason for organizing the prevention of depression for all informal caregivers of persons with dementia."
23179742,0,a,"PURPOSE: To examine the frequency, distribution and determinants of a change in recovery expectations following non-life threatening acute orthopaedic trauma to Victorian workers. It is proposed that interventions to modify recovery expectations may reduce the burden associated with injury. However, it is not known whether recovery expectations change over time or the factors that are associated with change. METHODS: A prospective inception cohort study was carried out in which participants were recruited following presentation to hospital for treatment of their injury and followed for 6 months post-injury. Baseline data was obtained by survey and medical record review. Binary logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with a change in recovery expectations between week 2 and week 12 post-injury. RESULTS: The cohort comprised injured workers (n = 145) who had sustained nonlife threatening acute orthopaedic trauma. Factors associated with an improvement in recovery expectations or recovery timeframe included more years of education and higher social functioning. Participants whose injury involved a perception of responsibility by a third party were 7.18 (95 % CI 1.86-27.68) times more likely to change their recovery expectations to more negative expectations and less likely to change to an earlier recovery timeframe. Participants with more severe injuries were more likely to change their recovery timeframe to a longer timeframe. CONCLUSION: Change in recovery expectations provide some information on injured workers who may benefit from targeted interventions to improve or maintain recovery expectations. The post-injury time-point at which recovery expectations are measured is important if recovery expectations are to inform long-term outcomes."
21303787,0,a,"This article explores the dearth of coverage of the social determinants of health by the Canadian mainstream media. It is argued that this neglect is primarily a reflection of political and economic societal structures that has been associated with increasing corporate control of the mainstream media. Applying a critical political economy lens, it is argued that the barriers to having the Canadian mainstream media report on the social determinants of health are so numerous that it may indeed be 'time to call it a day' in regard to having them assist in the dissemination of social determinants of health findings. Recognizing this reality should spur the development of alternative means of communicating with the public in order to develop a citizens' movement to create health-promoting public policy. Recent dissemination efforts related to the Social Determinants of Health: The Canadian Facts provide an example of how this might be accomplished."
30509511,0,a,"Beyond vitamin D (VD) effect on bone homeostasis, numerous physiological functions in human health have been described for this versatile prohormone. In 2016, 95% of the world's population lived in areas where annual mean ambient particulate matter (<2.5mum) levels exceeded the World Health Organization guideline value (Shaddick et al., 2018). On the other hand, industries disperse thousands of chemicals continually into the environment. Further, considerable fraction of populations are exposed to tobacco smoke. All of these may disrupt biochemical pathways and cause detrimental consequences, such as VD deficiency (VDD). In spite of the remarkable number of studies conducted on the role of some of the above mentioned exposures on VDD, the literature suffers from two main shortcomings: (1) an overview of the impacts of environmental exposures on the levels of main VD metabolites, and (2) credible engaged mechanisms in VDD because of those exposures. To summarize explanations for these unclear topics, we conducted the present review, using relevant keywords in the PubMed database, to investigate the adverse effects of exposure to air pollution, some environmental chemicals, and smoking on the VD metabolism, and incorporate relevant potential pathways disrupting VD endocrine system (VDES) leading to VDD. Air pollution may lead to the reduction of VD cutaneous production either directly by blocking ultraviolet B photons or indirectly by decreasing outdoor activity. Heavy metals may reduce VD serum levels by increasing renal tubular dysfunction, as well as downregulating the transcription of cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidases (CYPs). Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may inhibit the activity and expression of CYPs, and indirectly cause VDD through weight gain and dysregulation of thyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone, and calcium homeostasis. Smoking through several pathways decreases serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levels, VD intake from diet, and the cutaneous production of VD through skin aging. In summary, disturbance in the cutaneous production of cholecalciferol, decreased intestinal intake of VD, the modulation of genes involved in VD homeostasis, and decreased local production of calcitriol in target tissues are the most likely mechanisms that involve in decreasing the serum VD levels."
6736597,1,a,"This article analyzes and criticizes the "" technocratic "" view of occupational health and safety policies, which sees the values of the personnel in ""post-industrial"" regulatory agencies as the most important determinant of those policies. It takes an alternate position, which explains occupational health and safety policies as primarily resulting from the different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor), and from the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It shows how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies explains Swedish occupational health and safety policies better than a mere analysis of the regulators' views. And it concludes that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to those in the U.S.--as the "" technocratic "" theorists assume--but rather offer more protection to the workers than U.S. policies do. This situation is a result of labor having more power in Sweden than it has in the U.S. The different class formations and class behavior in the two societies are compared, and the implications of this comparison for occupational health and safety policies are discussed."
30012781,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To test whether social ties play any roles in mitigating depression and anxiety, as well as in fostering mental health among young men living in a poor urban community. SETTING: A cohort of all young men living in an urban slum in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: All men aged 18-29 years (n=824) living in a low-income urban community at the time of the survey. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Unspecified psychological morbidity measured using the General Health Questionnaire, 12-item (GHQ-12), where lower scores suggest better mental status. RESULTS: The GHQ scores (mean=9.2, SD=4.9) suggest a significant psychological morbidity among the respondents. However, each additional friend is associated with a 0.063 SD lower GHQ score (95% CI -0.106 to -0.021). Between centrality measuring the relative importance of the respondent within his social network is also associated with a 0.103 SD lower GHQ score (95% CI -0.155 to -0.051), as are other measures of social network ties. Among other factors, married respondents and recent migrants also report a better mental health status. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the importance of social connection in providing a buffer against stress and anxiety through psychosocial support from one's peers in a resource-constraint urban setting. Our findings also suggest incorporating a social network and community ties in designing mental health policies and interventions."
22115499,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Individuals' experience of interacting with the healthcare system has significant impact on their overall health and well-being. To relate patients' experiences to a common set of standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the concept of health system responsiveness. This study aimed to assess if the WHO responsiveness concept reflected the non-medical expectations of mental healthcare users in Teheran. METHODS: In this qualitative study, four mixed focus group discussions were formed, comprising 53 mental health service users in Tehran, Iran, in 2010. Content analysis was performed for data analysis. Responses were examined in relation to the eight domains of the WHO's responsiveness model. RESULTS: There were many commonalities between the findings of this study and the eight domains of the WHO responsiveness model, although some variations were found. Effective care was a new domain generated from our findings. In addition, the domain of prompt attention was included in two new labelled domains: attention and access to care. Participants could not differentiate autonomy from choice of healthcare provider, believing that free choice is part of autonomy. Therefore these domains were unified under the name of autonomy. The domains of quality of basic amenities, access to social support, dignity and confidentiality were considered to be important for the responsiveness concept. Some differences regarding how these domains should be defined were observed, however. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the concept of responsiveness developed by the WHO is applicable to mental health services in Iran. These findings might help policy-makers' better understanding of what is useful for the improvement of mental health services."
24496556,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Sufficient sleep is needed for the healthy development of youth. However, only a small minority of adolescents obtain adequate amounts of sleep. Although individual-level correlates of sleep have been identified, studies investigating the influence of the environment on sleep are warranted. METHODS: By using cross-sectional data collected from 1878 urban adolescents living in 38 neighborhoods participating in the 2008 Boston Youth Survey (BYS), we determined the association between neighborhood social fragmentation and sleep. Social fragmentation of each participant's residential neighborhood was composed using 2010 US Census data. Multilevel regression models were used to determine the association between social fragmentation and meeting the recommended hours of sleep (>8.5 h) and sleep duration while controlling for individual-level sex, race, age and nativity. RESULTS: Moderate (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.97) and high (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.61) social fragmentation within the residential neighborhood was associated with a decreased likelihood of obtaining adequate sleep. Those in moderate (beta = -23.9, 95% CI = -43.1, -4.8) and high (beta = -22.1, 95% CI = -43.3, -0.9) socially fragmented neighborhoods obtained fewer minutes of sleep per night. CONCLUSIONS: Social fragmentation may be an important determinant of sleep among youth living in urban settings."
3834353,1,a,"Using ethnicity of surname, nativity, residential social class, and inferred age at migration to characterize and subdivide Hispanics in Los Angeles, we compared risk ratios and proportional incidence ratios to examine the patterns of occurrence of selected neoplasms within the Hispanic community. Common neoplasms for which Hispanics have high, low, and intermediary risk were examined in detail. Although the patterns expected on the basis of current concepts of etiology were generally found and served to reinforce presumptions about the biologic significance of the risk factors, a number of observations cannot be explained easily with current knowledge. The risks for stomach and bowel cancers do not conform to the mirror-image patterns to be expected on the basis of inverse patterns of dietary acculturation. Incidence of cancer of the breast, in contrast to that of cervix, does not appear to reflect early cultural practice. Consistent details in the patterns of cancers of the bladder, rectum, ovary, prostate, and possibly pancreas imply unrecognized determinants of disease. Gallbladder cancer in Hispanic women is the disease most closely tied to Hispanic origin or culture, or both, but the ethnic pattern in women differs greatly from that in men."
2694206,1,a,"In recent developmental and psychosomatic studies the focus shifts from pathogenic to health protective factors. Literature on coping with daily stresses, life events and biographic determinants is reviewed. Despite conceptual (negative health definitions, divergent theoretical backgrounds and values) and methodological problems (reliance on self-report and trait measurement) moderate, however consistent health protective affects of personal resources are shown. These are mainly generalized attitudes of persons toward self and their environment (e.g. optimism, internal locus of control, self-efficacy, commitment). Contrasting influential concepts (sense of coherence, hardiness) the bias toward self-reliant, internal control as health protective resource is criticized and a plea is made for conjoint consideration of health-protective influences of social relationships."
27957304,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy at birth (LEB) is closely associated with the degree of economic and social development in developed and developing countries. This study aimed to examine the socioeconomic factors affecting LEB in Iran from 1985 to 2013. METHODS: Time series analysis was used to examine the effects of key explanatory factors (GDP per capita, number of doctors per 10,000 population, degree of urbanization, food availability, CO2 emission, total fertility rate, inflation rate, and literacy rate) on LEB in Iran from 1985 to 2013. Study data were retrieved from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), Iranian Statistical Center (ISC), and World Bank. Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Banergy, Dolado, and Master (BDM) tests, Engle Granger approach, and an ordinary least-square (OLS) model were used to achieve the aim of the study. Data analysis was performed by Stata V.12 software. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that GDP per capita (p=0.003), number of doctors per 10,000 population (p=0.036), literacy rate (p=0.0001), and food availability (p=0.0001) have a positive and significant statistically effect on LEB. The relationship between total fertility rate and LEB was negative and significant (p=0.023). In addition, the effect of degree urbanization (p=0.811), CO2 emission (p=0.185), and inflation rate (p=0.579) on LEB were not significant. CONCLUSION: GDP per capita, number of doctors per 10,000 population, food availability, literacy rate, and total fertility were identified as the main factors affecting life expectancy in Iran. The study, however, suggests that life expectancy in Iran could be improved if attention is given to factors that reside outside of the health sector."
7397056,1,a,"A Paracetamol elimination was measured, using serial saliva samples, in 114 London factory and office workers, 76 Whites and 38 Asian immigrants. 2. Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man."
29560849,0,a,"ABSTRACTBackground:Although foreign domestic workers (FDWs) play a significant role in caring for frail seniors in Singapore and are vulnerable to caregiving burden, there has been little research conducted hitherto. We explored caregiver burden and its determinants in this study. METHODS: FDWs (N = 221, Mage = 32.3, SD = 6.23) recruited from a hospital geriatric unit completed the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) administered in English, Bahasa Melayu, or Burmese. Univariate and multivariate regression were employed to investigate factors influencing caregiving burden in FDWs. RESULTS: Majority were Indonesians (60.0%), married (57.5%) with children (62.4%), with secondary-level education (59.7%), and providing care for >1 year (79.9%). Importantly, 25.1% reported physical health problems and 23.1% encountered language difficulties with employers. Univariate analysis revealed three significant factors associated with caregiving burden: nationality (p < 0.001), lack of privacy (p = 0.029), and caring for persons with dementia (PWD) (p = 0.001). On multivariate regression, FDWs who cared for PWD were 5.47 times (p = 0.013) more likely to experience burden, while FDWs who encountered language difficulties were 5.46 times (p = 0.030) more likely to experience burden. Filipinos FDWs were 9.73 times more likely to express burden (p < 0.001) compared to their Indonesian and Burmese counterparts. CONCLUSION: The study highlights caregiver burden in FDWs and potential ways to alleviate it by empowering FDWs with dementia-specific caregiving skills, providing language training opportunities, and supporting particular FDW ethnic groups with more emotional and practical help."
6701567,1,a,"This study deals with the relationship between social support and mental health. This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports. It is further suggested that sex roles may be important determinants of the availability and use of different support sources."
3566318,1,a,"We followed 183 infants for two years, 31 of whom were breast fed less than three and a half months (median 70 days; short breast feeding group) and a further 31 of whom were exclusively breast fed for more than nine months (long breast feeding group). We assessed heredity for atopy, number of infections, and duration of breast feeding as determinants of atopy. During the first year of life 14 infants has signs of atopy. During the second year parents reported signs of atopy in a further 31. Heredity was the only significant predictor of atopy. Atopy was seen in 33% of infants with a positive heredity and in 16% without family history for atopy. The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13). Duration of breast feeding did not associate with incidence of respiratory infections. Diarrhoea was more common in the short breast feeding group than in the long breast feeding group during the first year of life. We conclude that prolonging exclusive breast feeding from the median of 70 days to nine months did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy and respiratory tract infections."
24845239,0,a,"Recent research published in Health and Place (Ngamini Ngui et al., 2013b) found that one third of people with first episode psychosis [FEP] will have made a large-scale migration six years after initial diagnosis. Here, I extend this discussion around three important observations. Namely, at first presentation the most disadvantaged communities already shoulder the burden of psychotic morbidity; people with FEP in more rural communities migrate less often, and; people with FEP exhibit both upwards and downwards social mobility after onset. Understanding the reasons for (non-)migration before and after psychosis onset is now required for effective public mental health and service provision."
3701582,1,a,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors."
20841128,1,a,"This article presents a multidimensional model of psychosocial determinants of health behavior for health promotion research and policy analysis. Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented."
3729384,1,a,"This study evaluated methods for empirically identifying environmental determinants of aggressive and disruptive behavior in three developmentally delayed children. A variety of sessions conducted on an inpatient treatment unit were designed to stimulate contingencies maintaining aggression and disruption in the subjects' natural environments. The basic analog conditions included: instructional demands, contingent social disapproval, and structured play. In addition, variations of the three basic conditions were developed based on informal observation and parental reports of naturally occurring contingencies. Results showed considerable variability both between and within subjects. However, for each subject a specific analog condition was shown to produce relatively higher rates of aberrant behavior. Subsequently, behavioral treatments based on assessment results were successfully implemented with two of the subjects. Results are discussed in terms of the importance and practical limitations of conducting systematic assessment of aberrant repertoires in developmentally delayed clients."
3058621,1,a,"This paper reviews several psychological models to explain disturbed food intake: the ""psychosomatic theory"", the ""stimulus-binding theory"", the ""concept of restraint eating"", closely related to the ""concept of latent obesity"", the ""set-point-theory"" and the ""boundary model"". All are based on the assumption that there are biological regulating processes of body weight (and with this also of feelings of hunger, appetite and satiation as the determinants of food intake), nevertheless the resulting body weight can be inconsistent with social standards and individual self-concepts. In this case a cognitive control of food intake (dieting behaviour) is activated for weight regulation, which in turn interacts with biological regulatory mechanisms, and as a result leads to specific behavioural dispositions which can be supported by experiments."
3430425,1,a,To evaluate the possible first-night effect on the nocturnal motor activity 25 poor sleepers and 12 good sleepers slept on the Static Charge Sensitive Bed (SCSB) during two consecutive nights. The frequency of body movements in poor sleepers was almost two times higher than in good sleepers. The method itself was reproducible across two nights. There were no statistically significant and systemic level differences between the nights in the movements in bed (MIB). The difference t-test did not either reveal group differences in the magnitude or direction of changes from night to night. Results are consistent with the view that the level of motor activity is one of the determinants of sleep quality. No first-night effect exists in terms of psychomotor activity.
31859950,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to analyze the relationship between visceral leishmaniasis mortality and social determinants of health (SDH). METHODS: This was an ecological study of all leishmaniasis-related deaths in Brazil, from 2001 to 2015. We analyzed 49 indicators of human development and social vulnerability. The association was tested using the classical and spatial regression model. RESULTS: Mortality was associated with indicators that expressed low human development and high social vulnerability: lack of garbage collection, low schooling, unemployment rate, low per capita income, and income inequality (Gini index). CONCLUSIONS: There was an association between high mortality by leishmaniasis and low SDH."
3071406,1,a,"In this presentation, physical appearance has been considered an inseparable part of daily human existence. Relevant aspects of research in social psychology on interpersonal attraction and personality theory stressing narcissistic vulnerability were reviewed. General systems theory was proposed as a theoretical framework from which to view the multifactorial aspects of the psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness. In support of this proposition, the contemporary use of systems thinking in medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family therapy, and the understanding of emotions was stressed. Emotional reactions to the evaluations of physical appearance by self and others were shown to be inevitable, involving appraisal and feedback processes affecting different systems in the person's life. The person's self-image and self-esteem were stressed as underlying determinants of outcome in health and in illness. Finally, we hope to have communicated our belief that in the present, as a way of integrating and summarizing the knowledge obtained in the specialized fields, systems thinking allows for more creative and successful treatment outcomes."
12314548,1,a,"""Theories of trade and migration explain the distribution of individuals among regions based on private good productivities. The theory of local public goods (LPG's) uses collective good consumption economies to explain the size and composition of communities.

Assuming that individuals must consume and produce in the same jurisdiction, the paper examines the nature of efficient allocations, the tensions between the private and public incentives, the nature of the equilibrium (if any) which migration among jurisdictions will generate, and how such equilibrium will depend on tax rules for sharing the costs of the LPG."""
23803435,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Precarious employment is becoming an increasingly important social determinant of health inequalities among workers. The way in which contemporary employment arrangements and their health consequences are addressed in empirical research is mostly based on the contract-related or employment instability dimension. A broader conceptual approach including various important characteristics of the degrading of employment conditions and relations is needed. OBJECTIVE: The general objective of this paper is to empirically test a new multidimensional construct for measuring precarious employment in an existing database. Special focus is on the social distribution of precarious employment. METHODS: A subsample of 21,415 participants in the EU-27 from the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey-2005 was analysed. A cross-sectional study of the social distribution of precarious employment was conducted through the analysis of proportional differences according to gender, social class and credentials for the European Union as a whole and within each country. The 8 dimensions of the employment precariousness construct were represented by 11 indicators. RESULTS: In general, women, workers without supervisory authority, those with fewer credentials, and those living in Eastern and Southern European countries suffer the highest levels of precarious employment. Exceptionally, men, workers with supervisory authority and those with the highest credentials suffer the highest levels of long working hours, schedule unpredictability and uncompensated flexible working times. CONCLUSIONS: This article offers the first validation for an innovative multidimensional conceptualisation of employment precariousness applied to the analysis of existing survey data, showing the unequal distribution of precarious employment across the European labour force. This set of indicators can be useful for monitoring precarious employment."
28142254,0,a,"AIM: We investigated the diffusion of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) since its introduction into the Italian market aimed at identifying the potential drivers of uptake and diffusion at hospital and regional levels. MATERIALS & METHODS: We estimated the determinants of TAVI diffusion in Italy from 2007 to 2015 with a regression analysis based on registry data. RESULTS: Since 2007, TAVI has shown significant diffusion rates in Italy. The diffusion is positively correlated with implanting centers' experience and with the presence of key opinion leaders. Regional recommendations on the use of TAVI negatively influence the diffusion. Reimbursement policies do not exert a relevant impact. CONCLUSION: Learning effect seems to be the major driver of TAVI diffusion in Italy."
2489983,1,a,"The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods."

The prevalence of caries is high in the sample: 1. 31.5% of the children aged 5 to 6 are free of caries (according to the WHO objectives, 50% of the children aged 5 to 6 should have no caries), 2. the mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMF/T index) in children aged 11 to 12 is 6.6 (The DMF/T should be less than or equal to 3). The frequency of toothbrushing is distributed as follows: 23% of the children brush their teeth once a week or less, 46% brush their teeth once a day, and 31% brush their teeth twice a day or more. The purpose and the frequency of the consultations at the dentist's office have been examined: 15% of the children never consult the dentist, 44% consult the dentist in case of toothache, and 41% go to the dentist's office for screening or control. Only 3.2% of the children use regularly and appropriately fluoride tablets. Since the variance of the results is large, it is difficult to distinguish explaining variables or determinants. However, the data indicate that social groups show differences in DMF indices as well as in the behaviors associated with dental hygiene and prevention."
3992612,1,a,"This article begins with a discussion of the motivation for fertility reduction and related population policies. Next, it identifies the two major approaches to evaluating these policies in the population ethics literature: the individualistic approach and the international approach. Each approach is then characterized according to the kinds of policies evaluated, the ethical principles that are most prominent, and the major conclusions drawn. Major empirical gaps in the population ethics literature are identified, and pertinent social science issues concerning the effectiveness of family planning programs, the socioeconomic determinants of fertility, and the interpersonal or community determinants of fertility are discussed. Finally, these issues are linked with the United Nations World Population Plan of Action to identify ethical questions that warrant detailed scrutiny."
24074213,0,a,"Food prices and food affordability are important determinants of food choices, obesity and non-communicable diseases. As governments around the world consider policies to promote the consumption of healthier foods, data on the relative price and affordability of foods, with a particular focus on the difference between 'less healthy' and 'healthy' foods and diets, are urgently needed. This paper briefly reviews past and current approaches to monitoring food prices, and identifies key issues affecting the development of practical tools and methods for food price data collection, analysis and reporting. A step-wise monitoring framework, including measurement indicators, is proposed. 'Minimal' data collection will assess the differential price of 'healthy' and 'less healthy' foods; 'expanded' monitoring will assess the differential price of 'healthy' and 'less healthy' diets; and the 'optimal' approach will also monitor food affordability, by taking into account household income. The monitoring of the price and affordability of 'healthy' and 'less healthy' foods and diets globally will provide robust data and benchmarks to inform economic and fiscal policy responses. Given the range of methodological, cultural and logistical challenges in this area, it is imperative that all aspects of the proposed monitoring framework are tested rigorously before implementation."
29398554,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The role of maternal serum triglycerides (TGs) in the development of fetal macrosomia in different subgroups of body mass index (BMI) has received little attention. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the level of maternal TGs and fetal macrosomia in Iranian pregnant women of different BMI subgroups with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: This cohort study was conducted on 305 pregnant women with GDM referred for glucose control to Kowsar Hospital in Qazvin, Iran. Level of TGs was measured on the 24th-28th weeks of pregnancy. The ROC curve of the level of TGs was depicted in BMI subgroups to predict fetal macrosomia. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk of macrosomia per 1-SD increase in the level of TGs. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia did not significantly differ across BMI subgroups. Macrosomia was more prevalent in obese women (32.2%) than overweight (19.1%) and normal weight (11.1%) women (P < 0.05). A 1-SD increase in the level of TG was associated with 4.2 and 1.9 times increased risk of macrosomia in normal weight (P < 0.01) and overweight (P < 0.01) women, respectively. Serum level of TGs was not associated with macrosomia in any adjustment models in obese women. The area under the curve of the level of TGs for macrosomia was 0.828 (95% CI: 0.712-0.911, P < 0.001) and 0.711 (95% CI: 0.639-0.775, P < 0.001) in normal weight and overweight women, respectively. CONCLUSION: Hypertriglyceridemia was a predictor of macrosomia in non-obese women. More studies on different ethnicities and lifestyles are necessary to determine the association between the level of maternal TG and fetal macrosomia in BMI subgroups."
26178206,0,a,"BACKGROUND: while sexual behaviours are potentially important for quality of life in older adults, they are under-researched. The current study examined associations between frequency and importance of sexual behaviours and quality of life in older adults. METHOD: one hundred and thirty-three participants (mean 74 years, SD = 7.1) provided information about the frequency with which they participated in six sexual behaviours and the perceived importance of these: touching/holding hands, embracing/hugging, kissing, mutual stroking, masturbating and intercourse. Participants also completed the WHO Quality of Life scale, providing an overall quality of life score, in addition to the domains of physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment. Participants provided information on their marital status, living arrangements and self-reported health. RESULTS: both the frequency and importance of sexual behaviours were moderately positively correlated with quality of life (r = 0.52 and 0.47, respectively, both P < 0.001). In separate regression analyses, the frequency of sexual behaviours was a significant predictor of quality of life in the social relationships domain (beta = 0.225, P < 0.05), and the importance of sexual behaviours was associated with the psychological domain (beta = 0.151, P < 0.05), independent of the presence of a spouse/partner and self-reported health. CONCLUSIONS: with ageing trends, a broader understanding of the factors that influence quality of life in older adults is increasingly important. The current findings suggest that aspects of sexual behaviour and quality of life were positively associated. Researchers are encouraged to consider aspects of sex and sexuality when exploring determinants of well-being in later life."
6523992,1,a,"A comparison between rather short-lived (n = 60) and rather long-lived (n = 88) participants of the initial sample of the Bonn longitudinal study on aging (BOLSA) yielded evidence - with regard to differences in the central tendencies of these two groups - for a variety of determinants of longevity in old age. The statistical analyses included eight constructs or clusters of variables, respectively, that were either empirically or theoretically based and were supposed to have predictive power (intelligence, health status, satisfaction, personality, family involvement, socioeconomic/ecological aspects, coping techniques/dominant themes of life, general social participation). Within each ""cluster"", it could be referred to several different aspects. Besides defining general characteristics of longevious people, the purpose of the study was to look for differentiating aspects. Thus, a host of evidence was yielded for gender- and cohort-linked differences in the structure and relevance of the included central clusters with regard to ""prediction"" of advanced longevity in old age."
28976114,0,a,"There is limited and inconsistent empirical evidence regarding the role of economic factors in breastfeeding practices, globally. Studies have found both negative and positive associations between low income and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Employment, which should improve household income, may reduce EBF due to separation of mother and infant. In the context of a randomized controlled study of lipid-based complementary feeding in an urban slum in Cap Haitien, Haiti, we examined the economic factors influencing breastfeeding practices using mixed methods. Findings demonstrate relationships between urban context, economic factors, and breastfeeding practices. Poverty, food insecurity, time constraints, and limited social support create challenges for EBF. Maternal employment is associated with lower rates of EBF and less frequent breastfeeding. Extreme food insecurity sometimes leads to increased exclusive breastfeeding among Haitian mothers, what we call ""last resort EBF."" In this case, women practice EBF because they have no alternative food source for the infant. Suggested policies and programs to address economic constraints and promote EBF in this population include maternal and child allowances, quality child care options, and small-scale household urban food production."
23975893,0,a,"BACKGROUND: It is beneficial for tuberculosis patients to seek health care in time. The aim of this study was to understand the situation of initial health care-seeking delay among tuberculosis patients in eastern China, and explore its influencing factors, to provide a basis for formulating related polices and reducing its transmission. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in six counties of Shandong Province, China, and we selected study sites by multi-stage random sampling. Subjects were pulmonary tuberculosis patients registered with the county tuberculosis dispensaries at study sites that completed treatment during the period October 2006 to September 30, 2007. RESULTS: For the 819 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, the median initial health care-seeking delay time was 6 days, and 49.8% of them were initial health care-seeking delayed. The logistic regression analysis showed that marriage (odds ratio = 0.354, 95% confidence interval: 0.193-0.650) and knowledge of the national tuberculosis subsidy policy (odds ratio = 1.753, 95% confidence interval: 1.258-2.441) were associated with initial health care-seeking delay. CONCLUSION: Changing the perception of patients and popularizing the national tuberculosis subsidy policy will do well towards reducing initial health care-seeking delay."
3049068,1,a,"This article presents a critique of current models of preventive behavior. It discusses a variety of factors that are usually overlooked-including the appearance of costs and benefits over time, the role of cues to action, the problem of competing life demands, and the ways that actual decision behavior differs from the rational ideal implicit in expectancy-value and utility theories. Such considerations suggest that the adoption of new precautions should be viewed as a dynamic process with many determinants. The framework of a model that is able to accommodate these additional factors is described. This alternative model portrays the precaution adoption process as an orderly sequence of qualitatively different cognitive stages. Data illustrating a few of the suggestions made in the article are presented, and implications for prevention programs are discussed."
22014976,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Behavioural factors and beliefs are important determinants of the adoption of sports injury interventions. This study aimed to understand behavioural factors associated with junior community netball players' intentions to learn correct landing technique during coach-led training sessions, proposed as a means of reducing their risk of lower limb injury. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: 287 female players from 58 junior netball teams in the 2007/2008-summer competition completed a 13-item questionnaire developed from the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This assessed players' attitudes (four items), subjective norms (four), perceived behavioural control (four) and intentions (one) around the safety behaviour of learning correct landing technique at netball training. All items were rated on a seven-point bipolar scale. Cluster-adjusted logistic regression was used to assess which TPB constructs were most associated with strong intentions. RESULTS: Players had positive intentions and attitudes towards learning safe landing technique and perceived positive social pressure from significant others. They also perceived themselves to have considerable control over engaging (or not) in this behaviour. Players' attitudes (p<0.001) and subjective norms (p<0.001), but not perceived behavioural control (p=0.49), were associated with strong intentions to learn correct landing technique at training. CONCLUSIONS: Injury prevention implementation strategies aimed at maximising junior players' participation in correct landing training programs should emphasise the benefits of learning correct landing technique (i.e. change attitudes) and involve significant others and role models whom junior players admire (i.e. capitalise on social norms) in the promotion of such programs."
21907950,0,a,"Potential upstream determinants of coronary heart disease (CHD) include life-course socioeconomic position (e.g., childhood socioeconomic circumstances, own education and occupation); however, several plausible biological mechanisms by which socioeconomic position (SEP) may influence CHD are poorly understood. Several CHD risk factors appear to be more strongly associated with SEP in women than in men; little is known as to whether any CHD risk factors may be more strongly associated with SEP in men. Objectives were to evaluate whether cumulative life-course SEP is associated with a measurement of subclinical atherosclerosis, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), in men and women. This study was a prospective analysis of 1,454 participants from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (mean age 57 years, 53.8% women). Cumulative SEP was calculated by summing tertile scores for father's education, own education, and own occupation. ABI was dichotomized as low (</=1.1) and normal (>1.1 to 1.4). After adjustment for age and CHD risk factors cumulative life-course SEP was associated with low ABI in men (odds ratio [OR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 to 3.42, for low vs high cumulative SEP score) but not in women (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.33). Associations with low ABI in men were substantially driven by their own education (OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.86 to 9.16, for lower vs higher than high school education). In conclusion, cumulative life-course SEP was associated with low ABI in men but not in women."
31692975,0,a,"We study the impact of the Zimbabwe Harmonized Social Cash Transfer (HSCT) on household food security after 12 months of implementation. We investigate determinants of food security as measured by a well-known food security scale - the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) - and as measured by value of household food consumption composed of own-production, market purchases and gifts received. We find that several dimensions of household vulnerability correlate more strongly with the food security measure than with food consumption. Labor constraints, which is a key vulnerability criterion used by the HSCT to target households, is an important predictor of the food security score but not food consumption, and its effect on food security is even larger during the lean season. Impact analysis shows that the program has had statistically significant impacts on Food Security and Diet Diversity scores but null to low impacts on food consumption. However aggregate food consumption hides dynamic activity taking place within the household where the cash is used to obtain more food from the market and rely less on food received as gifts. The cash in turn gives beneficiaries greater choice in their food basket, which improves diet diversity."
3529452,1,a,"The literature was reviewed to assess whether the evidence implicating socio-environmental (SE) factors as determinants of adult lung function was sufficient to require that they be taken into account in epidemiological studies, together with other factors, such as age and smoking. In six studies involving 11,000 adults resident in the USA, France and Denmark forced expiratory volume in 1 second was related to social class and/or one of a number of other factors including education, area of residence and housing status. Trends in three other studies involving approximately 15,000 children resident in the UK and the USA were similar. The consistency of the findings makes it difficult to escape the conclusion that SE factors should be taken into account in comparisons of lung function between populations when the purpose is to assess the role of other environmental factors such as occupational exposure."
2785722,1,a,"In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact."

29914464,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Migrants are the unique production of China's urbanization process. They are often excluded from social welfare and security systems of cities, and often exposed to high health risk related closely to their health problems. This research sought to unveil and explore the influencing factors on health services utilization of migrants in Beijing. METHODS: A sample of 2014 inter-provincial migrants and 4578 residents with Beijing ""Hukou"" who were 15 years old and above was chosen by three-stage stratified cluster sampling method. A structured questionnaire survey was conducted via face-to-face interviews. Anderson health service utilization model was used to demonstrate the effects of the explanatory variables on health seeking behavior from predisposing, enabling and need variables. RESULTS: The study reveals that the rate of 'having symptoms' of migrants was lower than that of residents with ""Hukou"" only in the group of 25 to 34 years old in the past month. 503 migrants (25.0%) and 1441 (31.5%) residents with ""Hukou"" reported at least one episode of discomfort in the past month, and the rate of health service seeking behavior among migrants (46.8%) was lower than residents with ""Hukou"" (62.6%) (P < 0.0001). Chi-square independence test shows that age, ethnicity, employment status, having chronic disease and the degree of symptom were the major determinants affecting migrants to receive health services. The binary logistic regression indicates that the degree of symptom as the need variable and ethnicity as the predisposing variable were the strong and consistent determinants of health services seeking behavior. The migrants with moderate degree and severe degree of symptom in the past month were at 1.623-times (OR = 1.623) and 5.035-times (OR = 5.035) higher chances of seeking health services respectively, comparing to mild degree of symptom. Minority migrants were less likely to seek health services than Han migrants (OR = 0.282). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the current health delivery system is not conducive for migrants to seek appropriate health services. Relevant policies and feasible measures, including increasing the coverage of health insurance and improving the health perception of migrants should be vigorously implemented to provide affordable health services and change health service utilization behaviors for migrants."
2641946,1,a,"A follow-up study of 58 patients with spinal cord injury was conducted. As measure of function the Barthel index was used. There was correlation between functional capacity and ability of self-care as well as some social determinants. However, no association was found with employment rate or certain other determinants of independent living, such as going on a holiday. We conclude that the severity of the lesion is a fundamental factor in determining the outcome, but factors related to personal and psychosocial variables, not easily measured, also have great influence on the rehabilitation process."
29379564,0,a,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine factors influencing the number of times neonatal intensive care unit admitted preterm infants attend Neonatal Follow up and Early Intervention services (NFEI) during first year of life. Materials &Methods: A parent-report questionnaire was administered via phone after the first birthday of preterm infants admitted to the NICU at Arash Hospital, Tehran, for at least 24 h, and who received standard NICU-based therapeutic services, from Apr 2014 to Feb 2015. Data included mother's age, education, type of pregnancy, history of abortion or premature birth, self-reported post-partum depression, number of children, infant's gender, birth weight, gestational age, length of stay in the NICU, living area, twin or triplet birth, number of siblings, and the child rank. Number of attending times to services was recorded. Another question addressed the causes of not attending the NFEI services. Results: Ultimately, 119 eligible children participated, 51% were girls and whose mean birth weight was 1908+/-626.7 gr, and average length of NICU stay was 20.1+/-16.9 d. After multivariate analysis, shorter length of stay in the NICU, lower maternal education, number of children, self-declared lack of awareness about early intervention services, and self-reported lack of referral by a physician were the only factors that continued to be significantly correlated, and in fact, the truly influential ones associated with number of attending times. Conclusion: This study has defined some predictors of poor follow up and early intervention service utilization in a high-risk group of infants suggested be addressing and tackling by policymakers."
3685922,1,a,"The study was based on 471 males, aged 19 to 20 years, who started their compulsory military service in three military bases in Southwest, Southeast and Northern Finland in February 1982. Of these subjects 48% smoked regularly and had smoked in the past three weeks. The correlation between the reported number of cigarettes smoked a day and serum thiocyanate was 0.60. Seventy-four per cent of the subjects whose best friend smoked, were current smokers compared with 24% of the others. Proportion of smokers was higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Among the 14 explanatory variables in the multivariate logistic analysis, family members' and friends' smoking, the place of residence, strenuousness of leisure-time physical activities, number of friends, rebelliousness, intelligence test score, and general pessimism were most strongly associated with the likelihood of being a current smoker. The model explained 87% of the smoking variance."

3323587,1,a,"In this review, the author theoretically and empirically examined motives and interpersonal functions of aggression. A factor-analysis of Averill's questionnaire items on anger revealed that motives involved in aggressive responses were clustered into two groups: the hostile and the instrumental. It was also clarified that an individual is likely to engage in aggression particularly when some hostile motives are evoked. Concerning the interpersonal functions, the author proposed that aggression might serve four principal goals. (1) Aggression can be generated as an avoidance response to an aversive stimulus, such as frustration, annoyance, or pain, and so on. It depends on the severity of the stimulus. It was however emphasized that aggression is also mediated by social cognition, such as an attribution of intent to a harm-doer. (2) Aggression can be used as a means of coercing the other person into doing something. An individual is likely to use such a power strategy if he/she is lacking in self-confidence or a perspective for influencing the target person by more peaceful strategies. (3) Aggression can be interpreted as a punishment when it is directed toward a transgressor. In this case, aggression is motivated by restoration of a social justice, and thus its intensity is determined by the perceived moral responsibility of the transgressor. Further, it was indicated that aggression is intensified if it is justified as a sanctional conduct against the immoral. (4) Aggression can be also evoked when an individual's social identity is threatened. It was suggested that impression management motives are involved in aggression by an unexpected finding that the presence of audience or the identifiability rather facilitated retaliative aggression. The aggression-inhibition effect of apology was also explained in terms of impression management. In conclusion, it was presented that aggression is a behavioral strategy as an attempt to resolve interpersonal conflicts including physical or psychological annoyance, the other person's disobedience, perceived injustice, and a threat to one's social identity. Whether one's aggression is performed or not depends on a number of intra- and inter-personal determinants, particularly on social cognitive processes such as attribution, inference, prediction and other judgements."
24685665,0,a,"Children with epilepsy show a high co-morbidity with psychiatric disorders and autism. One of the critical determinants of a child's behavioral outcome with autism and cognitive dysfunction is the age of onset of seizures. In order to examine whether seizures during postnatal days 7-11 result in learning and memory deficits and behavioral features of autism we administered the inhalant flurothyl to induce seizures in C57BL/6J mice. Mice received three seizures per day for five days starting on postnatal day 7. Parallel control groups consisted of similarly handled animals that were not exposed to flurothyl and naive mice. Subjects were then processed through a battery of behavioral tests in adulthood: elevated-plus maze, nose-poke assay, marble burying, social partition, social chamber, fear conditioning, and Morris water maze. Mice with early-life seizures had learning and memory deficits in the training portion of the Morris water maze (p<0.05) and probe trial (p<0.01). Mice with seizures showed no differences in marble burying, the nose-poke assay, or elevated plus-maze testing compared to controls. However, they showed a significant difference in the social chamber and social partition tests. Mice with seizures during postnatal days 7-11 showed a significant decrease in social interaction in the social chamber test and had a significant impairment in social behavior in the social partition test. Together, these results indicate that early life seizures result in deficits in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks and produce long-term disruptions in social behavior."
3751657,1,a,"The aim of the present study was to relate children's aggression levels to social determinants of interest (i.e., child-rearing measures, day-care attendance, peer group influence, and TV-watching) in a sample of Chinese children in the People's Republic of China. A sample of 290 primary school students (155 boys and 135 girls, mean age 10.3) in grade four in Beijing were investigated using the Multi-Faceted Aggression Inventory. The children's parents were asked about child-rearing measures and day-care experience for the child. Teachers rated the children's aggression, school achievement level, and membership in the Young Pioneers. Despite acknowledged limitations, the findings in this study gave evidence that according to a person-environment interaction perspective, the Chinese children's individual differences in aggression were influenced by the restricted environment. As aggressive behaviour is undesired and suppressed in the Chinese culture in and outside the home, the Chinese children seemed to show lower levels and less variation of aggression behaviour than children in permissive environments (e.g., Sweden). However, when analysing sex differences in aggression environmental influences alone might not explain the differences."
24781089,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of education and chronic and/or infectious disease, and the interaction between both variables, on the risk of dying among Mexicans 60 years and older. METHODS: Using data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), logistic regressions were performed to estimate the risk of mortality for older Mexicans between 2001 and 2003. Estimated mortality risks associated with chronic disease, infectious disease, and a combination of both were used to estimate additional life expectancy at age 60. RESULTS: Compared to the group with some schooling, the probability of dying over the twoyear inter-wave period was 26% higher among those with no schooling. Not having at least one year of formal education translated into a shorter additional life expectancy at age 60 by 1.4-2.0 years. Having chronic and/or infectious disease also increased the risk of mortality during the same period CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 1) a mixed epidemiological regime (the presence of both chronic and infectious disease) adds to the mortality health burden experienced by older people, and 2) there are persistent inequalities in mortality risks based on socioeconomic status."
3276981,1,a,"The growth of dental health services over the past 15 years has produced several issues in dentistry. Because economic markets are the cornerstone of dental delivery in the US, informed responses to these issues require a thorough understanding of dental-care markets. The empirical literature is reviewed to examine the structure of dental markets, to assess the major determinants of market equilibrium, and to examine the social and health consequences of dental-care markets. Results reveal that while dental markets are imperfectly competitive, it is unclear whether prices exceed competitive levels. Little is known about the effects of dental markets on public oral health and society. Future research is proposed in two broad areas: 1) updating early studies conducted when few Americans had dental insurance benefits; and 2) path-breaking research to advance our knowledge of dental-care markets in particular and medical-care markets in general."
24143156,0,a,"Large knowledge gaps currently exist that limit our ability to understand and characterise dynamics and patterns of land-use intensity: in particular, a comprehensive conceptual framework and a system of measurement are lacking. This situation hampers the development of a sound understanding of the mechanisms, determinants, and constraints underlying changes in land-use intensity. On the basis of a review of approaches for studying land-use intensity, we propose a conceptual framework to quantify and analyse land-use intensity. This framework integrates three dimensions: (a) input intensity, (b) output intensity, and (c) the associated system-level impacts of land-based production (e.g. changes in carbon storage or biodiversity). The systematic development of indicators across these dimensions would provide opportunities for the systematic analyses of the trade-offs, synergies and opportunity costs of land-use intensification strategies."
31448118,0,a,"Introduction: HIV/AIDS-related stigma remains an essential barrier to the formulated care delivery and improved quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Only a few studies have evaluated stigma and its determinants as concerns people living with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional design study recruited 386 people living with HIV/AIDS attending the government clinic, Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta, Nigeria, for the assessment of stigma using Berger's HIV stigma scale and United States Agency International Development-recommended indicators and questions on HIV-related stigma among people living with HIV/AIDS. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21. Results: Of the 386 people living with HIV/AIDS, 322 (83.4%) were females and 64 (16.6%) were males, and 96.9% had disclosed their HIV status. Overall, mean perceived stigma score was moderately high at 95.74 (standard deviation = +/-16.04). Majority (77.2%) of the participants experienced moderately perceived stigma. Among the subscales, disclosure concerns contributed the most to stigma score at 68.9%. Enacted stigma in the last 12 months was documented in 35.8% (138). There was no association observed between age, gender, marital status and HIV-related stigma. However, low education was associated with higher negative self-image perception (31.83 +/- 5.81 vs 29.76 +/- 5.74, p < 0.001). Furthermore, higher perceived stigma score was associated with abandonment by spouses (p < 0.001), isolation from household members (p < 0.001) and social exclusion (p < 0.001). We demonstrated a correlation between the domains of enacted stigma and Berger HIV stigma scales except for the loss of resources. Conclusion: Perceived HIV-related stigma is moderately high among people living with HIV/AIDS. Low education, disclosure concerns, spousal or household abandonment and social exclusion are the significant contributors. HIV-related stigma preventive interventions at different levels of care are advocated."
17839015,1,a,"Everyday observation reveals that both individuals and organizations often become overly committed to losing courses of action; in a sense, throwing good money after bad.

The influence of these four sets of variables evolves over time, forming a dynamic model of behavior in escalation situations."
31071070,0,a,"Incident human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among adolescent females and women declined during 2010-2016, with the largest decrease (21%) occurring among black women (1). However, in 2016, although black women accounted for 13% of the U.S. female population, 60% of new HIV infections among women were in black women, indicating persisting disparities (1). CDC used the population attributable proportion (PAP) disparity measure to describe the proportional decrease in HIV infection among black and white women combined that would be realized if the group with the higher rate (blacks) had the same rate as did the group with the lower rate (whites) (2). Analyses indicated that an estimated 3,900 of 4,200 (93%) incident HIV infections among black women in 2016 would not have occurred if rates were the same for black and white women. The PAP disparity measure decreased from 0.75 in 2010 to 0.70 in 2016, suggesting that if incidence rates for black women were the same as those for white women, the annual number of incident HIV infections among black and white women would have been 75% lower in 2010 and 70% lower in 2016. Continued efforts are needed to identify and address social and structural determinants associated with HIV-related disparities to eliminate these disparities and decrease HIV incidence among black women."

Results clearly indicated that naysaying and acquiescence occur more frequently among lower IQ individuals and naysaying occurs more frequently concerning prohibited behavior, whereas respondents acquiesce regarding desirable behavior. These results suggest that intellectual limitations predispose people to biased responding, whereas social desirability factors determine the type of bias."
23587104,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There are many social and cultural factors affecting the sexual knowledge of adolescents. This study measured the sexual health knowledge level of adolescents and identified its association with role of parents, friends and school environment in adolescent girls in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Four hundred and nineteen Saudi female students belonging to intermediate and secondary grades were randomly selected from four public and private girl schools. 255 (69.8%) students were </=15 years and 164 (39.2%) were >15 years. A self-administered structured questionnaire comprising of socio-demographic information, role of parents and teachers, availability of school curriculum on sexual health was used. Sexual health knowledge was assessed through questions on identification of physical changes during puberty for </=15 years and separate questions on sexually transmitted infections for >15 years. RESULTS: 54% of </=15 years and 70.7% of >15 years had poor sexual health knowledge. Multivariate analysis found determinants for poor sexual health education in </=15 years are: lower education level of both parents (OR 10.87; 95% CI 2.44-48.38), second birth order or more (OR 2.32; 95% CI 1.24-4.33) and absence of school curriculum on sexual health (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.33-0.95). Determinants for >15 years of age are : mothers with low literacy (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.42-6.71), as for sources of poor sexual knowledge : parents (OR 10.10; 95% CI 2.70-37.74), schools (OR 6.95; 95% CI 1.95-24.78) maids (OR 4.57; 95% CI 1.26-16.59) and media (OR 5.12; 95% CI 1.29-20.07) were statistically significant factors. CONCLUSION: Government agencies with collaboration of all stake holders should develop policies and programs for implementing and evaluating integrated and comprehensive sexual educational programs for adolescents in Saudi Arabia."
31155271,0,a,"Evidence that gender inequalities and restrictive norms adversely affect health is extensive; however, far less research has focused on testing solutions. We first comprehensively reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey literature for rigorously evaluated programmes that aimed to reduce gender inequality and restrictive gender norms and improve health. We identified four mutually reinforcing factors underpinning change: (1) multisectoral action, (2) multilevel, multistakeholder involvement, (3) diversified programming, and (4) social participation and empowerment. Following this review, because little research has investigated the effects of national-level law and policy reforms, we conducted original quasi-experimental studies on laws and policies related to education, work, and income, all social determinants of health in which deep gender inequalities exist. We examined whether the laws and policies significantly affected health outcomes and gender norms, and whether law-induced and policy-induced changes in gender norms mediated the health effects, in areas for which longitudinal data existed. Laws and policies that made primary education tuition-free (13 intervention countries with the law and/or policy and ten control countries without) and that provided paid maternity and parental leave (seven intervention and 15 control countries) significantly improved women's and their children's health (odds ratios [OR] of 1.16-2.10, depending on health outcome) and gender equality in household decision making (OR 1.46 for tuition-free and 1.45 for paid maternity and parental leave) as a proxy indicator of gender norms. Increased equality partially mediated the positive effects on health outcomes. We conclude by discussing examples of how improved governance can support gender-equitable laws, policies, and programmes, immediate next steps, and future research needs."
7112177,1,a,"Abortion rates in the United States have risen annually since the 1973 Supreme Court decision. The regions with the greatest rate increases are the Southern and Plains states; the lowest rate increases were in regions which had high abortion rates soon after abortion was legalized. While spatial contiguity appears to influence abortion rates, that is, states with high rates of abortion are clustered spatially, social and political influence are also evident. Ratification of the equal rights amendment, the seeking of abortion outside the state of residence, and the degree of urbanization within a state are variables which influenced U.S. abortion rates between 1973 and 1977."
6705636,1,a,"This essay is based on the assumption that a long-neglected topic of socialization, the determinants of individual differences in parental functioning, is illuminated by research on the etiology of child maltreatment. Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child."
3282449,1,a,"The authors discuss the phenomenon of lying, a common psychic process that has received remarkably little scrutiny. The ubiquity of lying and others forms of deception suggests that they have ""normal"" aspects, but lying which is persistent or destructive to the quality of a person's life becomes pathological. Lying has many determinants, including developmental, biological, social, and psychodynamic. Antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic, borderline, and compulsive personalities have been associated with lying. The treatment of lying needs to be individualized according to the overall symptom complex in which it is embedded."
23296994,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: In affluent countries habitual physical activity (PA) levels are low while participation of middle-aged people in road running events is increasing. We compared PA determinants of runners aged 50+ to those of a general population sample of similar age in Switzerland. METHOD: Cross-sectional study comparing 580 road running event participants to 1,067 general population subjects. Binary logistic regression was used to predict group membership and multinomial logistic regression to describe relationships between regular PA levels, health and socio-economic status, adjusted for age, marital status and sex. RESULTS: There was better health status, higher socio-economic position, less obesity and less depression in the runners than in the general population. People in self-reported ""poor / very poor"" and ""good"" health categories were less likely than the ""excellent/very good"" category to engage in vigorous regular PA compared to moderate regular PA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the association of PA with better health and higher socio-economic status in people aged 50+ but do not allow conclusions on causality. Further research and managerial effort should be expanded to develop programmes for the inactive population. New and existing prevention programmes should be undertaken to increase the awareness of target audiences. Popular road running events should be seen as having important public health potential and should be fostered."
31446636,0,a,"Poor recovery among older adults with hip fractures can occur despite successful surgical repair and rehabilitation, suggesting other factors might play a role in recovery, such as social factors. The aim of this scoping review was to provide an overview of the literature on the role of social factors in older adult's recovery after hip fracture. This review followed the York Framework and its modifications and recent reporting guidelines. Two independent researchers searched main medical databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO and the Cochrane libraries) from inception to June 2017, for studies investigating social factors and recovery post hip fracture. Studies were excluded if they were qualitative, perspective papers or if participants were < 65 years or they were not living in the community. We screened 2,503 unique abstracts in total and 19 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Social factors investigated in the included studies were social support, socioeconomic factors and living arrangement. We classified outcomes in the studies into three subgroups: physical functional recovery, mortality and other outcomes (pain, hospital length of stay and quality of life). We found evidence that social support and socioeconomic factors (e.g. socioeconomic status) were significantly associated with an increase in functional recovery, a decrease in mortality and other outcomes, but conflicting evidence was found for the effect of one's living arrangement. Only two included studies were randomised controlled trials. To conclude, social factors, such as social support and socioeconomic status, affect physical functional recovery and mortality in older adults with hip fractures. However, this is an under researched area that lacks rigorously designed studies and would benefit from more studies with rigorous designs."
28917950,0,a,"Suicide is an important public health problem that requires a preventive approach. The present study aimed at assessing suicidal behaviors and their relations with other psychosocial factors in Campeche, Mexico, in order to inform the design of potential preventive interventions. A multistage probability sample of 2386 students representative of all middle schools of the state of Campeche, Mexico, took a standardized, paper-and-pencil survey covering selected psychosocial constructs including suicide behavior, depression, drug use, familial relationships, locus of control, impulsivity, and self-esteem, among others. Latent classes were identified and multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze associations between class membership and psychosocial covariates. An estimated 8% of the middle school population in Campeche had three or more psychosocial problems in the past month including drug use, major depression episode symptoms, as well as suicidal problems like attempts and self-inflicted injuries. Four latent classes were identified, one with lowest risk and three with varying characteristics in terms of binge alcohol and other drug use, depression, and suicide behaviors. Associations between psychosocial covariates and latent class were observed, as predicted based on a multi-dimensional theoretical framework. Heterogeneity across ""High-Risk"" groups and their potential determinants highlight the need for differentiated, specialized efforts ranging from universal to indicated interventions. Given the high level of risk factors in this population, universal preventive interventions should aim at building resiliency among youth by helping them develop an array of coping resources, as well as by creating a more nurturing psychosocial environment."
26246692,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines the effects of a standardized fitness training on motivational factors such as the intention to be physically active, self-efficacy, perceived barriers, counterstrategies, and exercise specific social support in patients with progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and the relation of these factors to physical performance. METHODS: Moderately disabled patients with secondary or primary progressive MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale of 4-6) were randomized to a training group or a waitlist control group. Patients completed on average 20 sessions of training tailored to their individual fitness at baseline over a course of 8-12 weeks. Motivational variables (stage of change according to the transtheoretical model (TTM), self-efficacy, perceived barriers, counterstrategies, and exercise specific social support) were assessed via questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Forty patients completed the trial. We found significant effects on stages of change (p = .016) and self-efficacy (p = .014) and a trend in counterstrategies (p = .08). Significant correlations between change of physical performance during the exercise training and change in the TTM, perceived barriers, and counterstrategies were detected. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that tailored individual endurance training could stabilize self-efficacy and increase exercise motivation in patients with progressive MS. Motivational variables were related to the physical performance."
7214067,1,a,Social and audiometric characteristics of the hearing-impaired elderly without aids have been analysed and some understanding developed of the factors which lead people to seek rehabilitation. The two major single determinants of seeking help were found to be severity of impairment and onset of deafness before reaching retirement age. There were strong indications that negative attitudes of both the elderly themselves and their general practitioners towards deafness and ageing played a crucial part in perpetuating the neglect of the disorder.
3210110,1,a,"A prospective study was conducted to determine the effects of maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy on the birth weight of fetuses in an unselected study population. Several confounding factors were taken into account. The main factors associated with an increase of birth weight of both sexes were gestational age at birth and parity. Both maternal smoking and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy had the effect of decreasing the birth weight of female fetuses, whereas smoking, but not alcohol, had a decreasing effect on birth weight of male and female fetuses."
3064632,1,a,"Retrospective information about teenage alcohol use was obtained from 1589 adult twin pairs aged 20-30 years from the Australian twin register. Twin pairs were highly concordant both for teenage drinking (or abstinence) and for early versus late onset of drinking. Sociodemographic variables (e.g., paternal occupation and parental religious affiliation) and psychosocial variables (e.g., personality and attitudinal traits), assessed when the twins were adults, were comparatively poor predictors of teenage drinking. Environmental influences on onset of drinking appeared to be sex-specific, i.e., uncorrelated over twins from unlike-sex pairs. Among drinkers, early versus late onset of drinking was more strongly influenced by inherited factors in females, but by shared features of the social environment (e.g., family background or school experience) in males."
29254546,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In 2010 Mexican health authorities enacted an antibiotic sale, prescription, and dispensation bill that increased the presence of a new kind of ambulatory care provider, the doctors adjacent to private pharmacies (DAPPs). OBJECTIVES: To analyze how DAPPs' presence in the Mexican ambulatory care market has modified health care seekers' behavior following a two-stage health care provider selection decision process. METHODS: The first stage focuses on individuals' propensity to captivity to the health care system structure before 2010. The second stage analyzes individuals' medical provider selection in a health system including DAPPs. This two-stage process analysis allowed us not only to show the determinants of each part in the decision process but also to understand the overall picture of DAPPs' impact in both the Mexican health care system and health care seekers, taking into account conditions such as the origins, evolution, and context of this new provider. We used data from individuals (N = 97,549) participating in the Mexican National Survey of Health and Nutrition in 2012. RESULTS: We found that DAPPs have become not only a widely accepted but also a preferred option among the Mexican ambulatory care providers that follow no specific income-level population user group (in spite of its original low-income population target). Our results showed DAPPs as an urban and rapidly expanded phenomenon, presumably keeping the growing pace of new communities and adapting to demographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals opt for DAPPs when they look for health care: in a nearby provider, for either the most recent or common ailments, and in an urban setting; regardless of most socioeconomic background. The relevance of location and accessibility variables in our study provides evidence of the role taken by this provider in the Mexican health care system."
2746717,1,a,"The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations."
6667732,1,a,"An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
30183970,0,a,"OBJECTIVE : Perform a literature review about systems of sanitary and epidemiological surveillance for frontier zones and the points of entry of Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS : A systematic literature review using the Prisma methodology, MeSH and DECS terms, was developed in PubMed and BVS bibliographic databases between 2000 and 2014. We included 51 documents according to inclusion-exclusion criteria and we proposed and discussed these categories: health services, mental health, health status and social determinants. RESULTS : The analysis makes it possible to evidence that the epidemiological and sanitary surveillance of borders and entry points worldwide, focused mainly on axes such as mental health, transmissible events and events of non-communicable conditions. In addition, the importance of comprehensive care in health services, as well as the analysis of the health status of immigrant population under the territorial, ethnic and cultural differential approach. However, there are few experiences with a social determinants analysis in borders zone and / or entry points. CONCLUSIONS : Differences in the context, health systems, information systems and priorities of each country make the exchange and cooperation between borders challenging. It is necessary to have instruments of cooperation between neighboring countries and a common information based on the Social Determinants of Health."
7371381,1,a,"The intent of this paper is to present a representative, though not exhaustive, overview of the current literature on social networks, with an emphasis on research linking social networks to psychological adaptation. This overview includes a review of social network concepts; and analysis of the multiple determinants of social networks; an analysis of the varied effects of social networks; and the implications for policies and practices of community mental health centers. This paper adopts the view that the concept of social network is a useful tool in examining both the functional and the dysfunctional influences of one's primary group on individual adaption."
28466762,1,a,"Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces."
30849711,0,a,"Strategies to date have been ineffective in reducing high rates of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in Australian Aboriginal people; a disease caused by streptococcal infections. A remote Aboriginal community initiated a collaboration to work towards elimination of RHD. Based in 'both-way learning' (reciprocal knowledge co-creation), the aim of this study was to co-design, implement and evaluate community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) to achieve this vision. Activities related to understanding and addressing RHD social determinants were delivered through an accredited course adapted to meet learner and project needs. Theory-driven evaluation linking CBPAR to empowerment was applied. Data collection comprised focus groups, interviews, observation, and co-development and use of measurement tools such as surveys. Data analysis utilised process indicators from national guidelines for Aboriginal health research, and outcome indicators derived from the Wallerstein framework. Findings include the importance of valuing traditional knowledges and ways of learning such as locally-meaningful metaphors to explore unfamiliar concepts; empowerment through critical thinking and community ownership of knowledge about RHD and research; providing practical guidance in implementing empowering and decolonising principles / theories. Lessons learned are applicable to next stages of the RHD elimination strategy which must include scale-up of community leadership in research agenda-setting and implementation."
23591761,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A combined quantitative and qualitative socio-technical approach is applied in two evaluation studies of electronic patient records (EPR). In these studies the focus was on factors influencing the adoption of the EPR by care providers. OBJECTIVE: The research approach is based on the USE IT-model. In addition to the USE IT-interview model, the USE IT-questionnaire is presented and evaluated in order to present a valid and useful integrated approach for the evaluation of IT-adoption in healthcare. METHODS: The USE IT-questionnaire was evaluated by applying a principal component analysis of the quantitative results in two cases (n = 222), and by comparison of the resulting factors with the determinants of the USE IT-model. RESULTS: The factor analysis of the USE IT-questionnaire resulted in six valid factors: 1. Task support satisfaction, 2. Interface satisfaction, 3. Compatibility, 4. Collaboration, 5. Learnability, and 6. Accessibility. The questions about resources did not combine into a factor. CONCLUSION: The detailed questions of the questionnaire lead to decomposition of the constructs Task support satisfaction and Ease of use into factors. The construct Task support satisfaction which was supposed to measure relevance was decomposed in two factors measuring relevance and two factors measuring micro-requirements."
2589474,1,a,"Data on nutritional intake and patterns of physical growth in the rural Andean community of Nunoa, Peru (elevation 4,000 m), are described and compared to data previously collected from this location. Food consumption data and selected anthropometric measures were obtained from a sample of 33 households. Estimates of caloric intake from this study are very similar to those obtained in Nunoa during the mid- and late 1960s. However, within the present sample, upper income (i.e., middle class) individuals have significantly higher caloric intakes than those of the lower income group and also appear to have an improved diet relative to individuals of 20 years ago. Anthropometric data show that children of the upper socioeconomic status (SES) group are significantly taller and heavier than the lower SES group children. Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not. These results indicate that nutritional factors have significantly contributed to the extreme pattern of slow growth previously reported for children of Nunoa and, moreover, demonstrate how social and environmental forces interact to create differential levels of stress that contribute to variation in biological well-being."
27298066,0,a,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide systematic empirical evidence on the health planning through Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs) in India. Design/methodology/approach - A micro-level study was carried out using qualitative study design. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 105 respondents selected from 42 VHSNC sites. A thematic analytical framework approach was used to analyse the data. Findings - The research results indicate that VHSNCs are playing a significant role in health planning. However, the committee meetings are not organised by the committee members on the regular basis. Most of the VHSNC members do not make village health plans. There are some challenges associated with the functioning of VHSNCs like insufficient resources, lack of people's interest, insignificant attention and the unfair behaviour of the Panchayati Raj leaders. Practical implications - The implications of the findings suggest that VHSNCs play a significant role in health planning. However, the leadership is ineffective due to their partial capabilities and approach that generate non-conducive environment. Studies of such nature will be helpful for policy makers in understanding the current situation and micro-level picture of VHSNC and also in analysing it in the existing health system. Originality/value - VHSNC functions with a broader concern and cover range of social determinants at the village level. This study provides empirical evidence on the VHSNCs as lowest part of the health system."
31805907,0,a,"Health inequities are widespread and persistent, and the root causes are social, political and economic as opposed to exclusively behavioural or genetic. A barrier to transformative change is the tendency to frame these inequities as unfair consequences of social structures that result in disadvantage, without also considering how these same structures give unearned advantage, or privilege, to others. Eclipsing privilege in discussions of health equity is a crucial shortcoming, because how one frames the problem sets the range of possible solutions that will follow. If inequity is framed exclusively as a problem facing people who are disadvantaged, then responses will only ever target the needs of these groups without redressing the social structures causing disadvantages. Furthermore, responses will ignore the complicity of the corollary groups who receive unearned and unfair advantage from these same structures. In other words, we are missing the bigger picture. In this conceptualization of health inequity, we have limited the potential for disruptive action to end these enduring patterns.The goal of this article is to advance understanding and action on health inequities and the social determinants of health by introducing a framework for transformative change: the Coin Model of Privilege and Critical Allyship. First, I introduce the model, which explains how social structures produce both unearned advantage and disadvantage. The model embraces an intersectional approach to understand how systems of inequality, such as sexism, racism and ableism, interact with each other to produce complex patterns of privilege and oppression. Second, I describe principles for practicing critical allyship to guide the actions of people in positions of privilege for resisting the unjust structures that produce health inequities. The article is a call to action for all working in health to (1) recognize their positions of privilege, and (2) use this understanding to reorient their approach from saving unfortunate people to working in solidarity and collective action on systems of inequality."
30738376,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown the adverse impact of exposure to community violence on adolescent health. However, most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries. This study aimed at assessing the community violence exposure and the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents in Ambon, a post-conflict area in Indonesia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, school-based study involving 511 of 10th-graders from six randomly selected high schools in Kotamadya Ambon. Our participants were assessed using a set of questionnaires including the Strength Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure mental health problems, and the child version of the Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure (KID-SAVE) to measure community violence exposure. The hierarchical regression analyses were used to explore the determinants of mental health problems. RESULTS: In this study, boys reported more exposure to community violence (both in frequency and severity) than girls. Meanwhile, the girls reported higher emotional problems than boys. The hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in the total sample and among boys, the community violence exposure was associated with mental health problems. However, it was the perceived impact of community violence exposure which showed an association with mental health problems among girls. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the high community violence exposure among adolescents living in a post-conflict setting in Indonesia. The study also found gender differences in the determinants of mental health problems among adolescents who were exposed to CVE."
6663350,1,a,"The epidemiological and clinical profile of Chronic Post-Traumatic Headache (CPTH) has been studied in 57 out of 130 consecutive patients hospitalized, following closed head injuries, at the Institute of Neurosurgery of the University of Milan. The incidence of CPTH has been 44%. Age of the patients ranged between 4 and 69 years. Clinical pictures included closed head injuries of different degree of severity: mild, moderate and severe. Time of onset, headache frequency, character, intensity, duration and associated symptoms showed a great degree of variability. However, chronic muscle contraction headache was the commonest clinical syndrome followed by migraine. Moderate correlations have been found between the severity of CPTH disturbance of consciousness, following the head trauma, and positive findings at CT scan. Moreover the comparison of personality profiles (MMPI) of CPTH (n=26) with a post-traumatic control group, without headache (n=17) showed higher scores on hypocondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales only in the severe CPTH group. Age of the patients, duration of unconsciousness, neurological deficits, course length and pending litigation or compensations were unrelated to the occurrence and outcome of CPTH. These findings suggest the importance of both physical and psychological determinants (social or emotional maladjustment) in the pathogenesis of CPTH."
23318979,0,a,"Hydroxyurea (HU) is a drug that induces fetal hemoglobin production. As a result, HU is widely used to treat beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) patients. However, the response of these patients to HU varies. Some beta-thal patients respond favorably to treatment while others do not respond at all. HU has a number of side-effects and therefore its targeted prescription is beneficial. Hence, identifying the genetic determinants which lead to the differential HU response is important. This review summarizes recent findings which have shed light on this topic. Special emphasis is given to the mechanisms and genetic loci which may govern these differences. These findings have helped identify several single nucleotide polymorphisms which associate with the response to HU in both beta-thal and sickle cell disease patients."

29517192,0,a,"Background: The introduction and maintenance of healthy habits in the field of physical activity at the early stage of life is particularly important for public health. With increasing of public awareness in physical activity, researchers are increasingly questioning its determinants in different age groups. In this paper we focus on variables such as age, sex and place of residence. Objectives: To determine what selected socio-demographic factors influence the level of physical activity of school youth from the eastern region of Poland in different domains of daily life. Material and Methods: A random sample of 916 Polish school youth from Secondary Schools from Eastern Region of Poland aged 16-18 was interviewed in spring 2016 by diagnostic survey method with the use of the official Polish long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Results: Analysing the relationship between gender and the level of physical activity statistically significant differences were found in all domains in favour of boys. The level of total physical activity in girls was 5345.5 MET-min./week, whereas in boys - 6556.6 MET-min./week. In the area of total physical activity, the highest values were observed in pupils from small towns and villages, with lower values in the youth living in large and medium-sized cities. When the relationship of age with the level of physical activity in particular domains was examined, only the activity in the work/ school domain (p = 0.0129) spoke in favour of the youngest pupils (2578.7 MET-min./week) when compared to the oldest ones (2226.4 MET-min./week). Conclusions: The level of physical activity in young people from the Eastern region of Poland is decreasing with age, both in girls and boys. It is therefore important, especially for the group emerging adulthood, to offer a wide variety of updated, involving, age and gender-oriented school physical activity classes that could be easily practised outside the school environment to improve the level of physical activity in leisure domain"
26374502,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Determinants of waterpipe use in adolescents are believed to differ from those for other tobacco products, but there is a lack of studies of possible social, cultural, or psychological aspects of waterpipe use in this population. This study applied a socioecological model to explore waterpipe use, and its relationship to other tobacco use in Swedish adolescents. METHODS: A total of 106 adolescents who attended an urban high-school in northern Sweden responded to an anonymous questionnaire. Prevalence rates for waterpipe use were examined in relation to socio-demographics, peer pressure, sensation seeking behavior, harm perception, environmental factors, and depression. RESULTS: Thirty-three percent reported ever having smoked waterpipe (ever use), with 30% having done so during the last 30 days (current use). Among waterpipe ever users, 60% had ever smoked cigarettes in comparison to 32% of non-waterpipe smokers (95% confidence interval 1.4-7.9). The odds of having ever smoked waterpipe were three times higher among male high school seniors as well as students with lower grades. Waterpipe ever users had three times higher odds of having higher levels of sensation-seeking (95% confidence interval 1.2-9.5) and scored high on the depression scales (95% confidence interval 1.6-6.8) than non-users. The odds of waterpipe ever use were four times higher for those who perceived waterpipe products to have pleasant smell compared to cigarettes (95% confidence interval 1.7-9.8). Waterpipe ever users were twice as likely to have seen waterpipe use on television compared to non-users (95% confidence interval 1.1-5.7). The odds of having friends who smoked regularly was eight times higher for waterpipe ever users than non-users (95% confidence interval 2.1-31.2). CONCLUSION: The current study reports a high use of waterpipe in a select group of students in northern Sweden. The study adds the importance of looking at socioecological determinants of use, including peer pressure and exposure to media marketing, as well as mental health among users."
3222582,1,a,"The Childhood Antecedents of Smoking Study (CASS) investigated patterns of cigarette smoking among junior and senior high school students in an upper midwest school district. Four biannual school-based surveys were conducted over two years. A cohort of 72 smokers was identified and followed to determine who continued smoking and who quit. Discriminant analysis was used to study social, psychological, and environmental factors predictive of quitting smoking. Compared to continuing smokers, quitters reported having fewer friends and siblings who smoked, they were less likely to view the cigarette smoker's image as positive, and lived in families where parental involvement with teenagers was high (based on the reports of parents). These results are consistent with the view that social influences are strong determinants of patterns of adolescent smoking behaviour."
12179093,1,a,"Female migration in Thailand, especially from rural areas to the Bangkok Metropolis, is an important migratory phenomenon which leads to an unfavorable population distribution. Generally the migration level in Thailand is low but many women from the rural areas, especially from the Northeast Region, move to Bangkok Metropolis to seek work. Findings reveal that the majority of migrants are young, single women. Women migrants find it relatively easy to participate in the Bangkok labor market. Service work is the main source of employment. For the temporary migrants, it was found that those from the Northeast Region tend to return to their hometown in higher proportion than those from other regions. This was particularly so among young women migrants."
2660269,1,a,"The innovation of epidemiology plays a crucial role in the development of the health sciences. The authors emphasize the importance of epistemological analysis related to scientific and technical production. They focus on the theoretical and methodological contributions of the principal Latin American groups in the field of epidemiology, stating their main accomplishments, issues and potentials. When reviewing those conceptual and practical innovations, the authors analyse the effects of broader historical conditions on scientific work. To them, Latin American contemporary innovative epidemiological research and production have developed clearly differentiated principles, methods and technical projections which have led to a movement of critical or 'social' epidemiology. The functionalist approach of conventional epidemiology, characterized by an empiricist viewpoint, is being overcome by a more rigorous and analytical approach. This new epidemiological approach, in which the authors as members of CEAS (Health Research and Advisory Center) are working, has selectively incorporated some of the technical instruments of conventional epidemiology, subordinating them to a different theoretical and logical paradigm. The new framework of this group explains the need to consider the people's objective situation and necessities, when constructing scientific interpretations and planning technical action. In order to accomplish this goal, epidemiological reasoning has to reflect the unity of external epidemiological facts and associations, the so-called phenomenological aspect of health, with the underlying determinants and conditioning processes or internal relations, which are the essence of the health-disease production and distribution process. Epidemiological analysis is considered not only as a problem of empirical observation but as a process of theoretical construction, in which there is a dynamic fusion of deductive and inductive reasoning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

26515249,0,a,"Health impact assessment (HIA) aims to incorporate people's health and wellbeing as a key feature in policy-making. Many authors believe that HIA might be systematically integrated into all decision-making processes as a way to achieve that goal. To that end, there is need to overcome a number of challenges, including the fact that Andalusia (Spain) has made HIA compulsory by law, the need for awareness of all public sectors whose decisions might have substantial impacts on health and for a methodology that would enable a comprehensive approach to health determinants and inequalities, and the training of both the public health staff and professional sectors responsible for its application. In Andalusia, a law provides mandatory and binding health impact reports for most authorisation procedures in different areas: from sectoral plans to urban planning schemes, and especially projects subject to environmental assessment. Implementation of this law has required its integration into authorisation procedures, the training of interdisciplinary working groups in public health, the preparation of technical guidelines, and the organisation of dissemination and training seminars for developers."

This study aims to determine the immunity and susceptibility rate against rubella in a representative population of women in reproductive age in Iran through serological evaluation. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2012 on 804 pre-marriage women in Iran. Multi-stage random sampling was used for choosing study sample. Serologic test were used to assess subjects' immunity to rubella and their titers of IgG antibody against rubella with ELISA method was measured. In total, 98.4% (95% CI: 97.5% -99.2%) of study participants were immune against rubella. Five women (0.6%) were in borderline category and 1% (8 women) was susceptible to rubella. The proportion of immune people in low and high incidence regions was 99.3% (95% CI: 97.8-99.9%), and 97.5% (95% CI: 96.4-98.5%), respectively (P = 0.05). Our data indicated that level of immunity to rubella in women of reproductive age in Iran is satisfactory. This finding indicates the achievement of Iran to the goal of high level of serum immunity against rubella among young women."

2707492,1,a,"Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) inhibit their vocal behavior upon hearing the maternal alarm call of their species. The present study assesses the interaction of the ducklings' experiential history with the environment in which they are tested. If ducklings are reared and tested to the alarm call in small social groups, they respond by dramatically inhibiting their vocalizations. If, however, socially reared ducklings are tested to the alarm call individually in an open field, responsiveness drops precipitously. In addition, individually reared ducklings respond at a far greater level to the alarm call when tested individually, not in groups. Thus, there is an interaction between the rearing history and the testing environment such that the same rearing history leads to different behavioral outcomes depending on the context in which the ducklings are observed. This demonstrates the importance of behavioral context, in addition to developmental history, as one of the determinants of behavior."

25420973,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The University of Sydney's Graduate Diploma in Indigenous Health Promotion (GDIHP) and Masters of International Public Health (MIPH) students have expressed a consistent desire to engage more with each other through student tutorials or any small group activity. MIPH students have expressed an interest in learning about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanderpeople and their health issues recognising contextual similarities in health priorities and social-cultural determinants. A and TSI students enrolled in the GDIHP have traditionally had very little contact with other students and are often unaware of the innovative solutions implemented in developing countries. METHODS: Through this inclusive teaching innovation the MIPH and GDIHP programmes utilised diversity in the student population and responded to the University's Strategic Plan to promote and enhance pathways for supporting Indigenous students. This innovation provided an opportunity for both groups to learn more about each other as they develop into globally competitive public health practitioners. RESULTS: The 'Beyond Borders' initiative exposed MIPH and GDIHP students to problem-based learning that incorporated global perspectives as well as focusing on the very specific and unique realities of life in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Both student cohorts reported that the knowledge and skill exchange was highly valuable and contributed to their development as health professionals. DISCUSSION: This simple yet effective initiative created a sustainable cross-cultural, interdisciplinary and community-oriented partnership that benefited all involved and assisted in addressing health inequities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and in developing countries."

3791024,1,a,"The present study documented later developmental outcome in a group of 29 failure-to-thrive (FTT) infants who received extended hospitalization in infancy as an intervention for their growth failure. All infants were seen at approximately 3 years of age and were given standardized assessments of intellectual and physical development. A standard interview documented demographic variables, health problems, placements subsequent to hospitalization and additional psychological and medical treatment. Infants were divided into three groups dependent on medical and treatment factors. Means and percentages of occurrence of outcome variables were compared through either one-way ANOVAS or single sample chi-square tests with post hoc analyses. Correlational analyses were used to understand the relationships between outcome and relevant demographic, medical, and treatment variables. In general, the infants manifest persistent intellectual delays at follow-up despite maintenance of weight gains achieved during early hospitalization. More than half the group suffered from chronic health problems. A large percentage of infants had been removed from parental custody at the time of follow-up. Several demographic, medical, and treatment factors bore moderate relationships to developmental outcome. Infants who achieved more optimal growth tended to be full-term at birth, later born and without a question of physical abuse in their social histories. Intellectual functioning was related only to parental and caretaker socioeconomic status. Infants placed in foster care were unlikely to return to their families of origin. The findings suggest the need for further investigation into the determinants and outcome of extended hospitalization as a treatment for FTT."

23458089,0,a,"BACKGROUND: At the turn of the 21st century, India was plagued by significant rural-urban, inter-state and inter-district inequities in health. For example, in 2004, the infant mortality rate (IMR) was 24 points higher in rural areas compared to urban areas. To address these inequities, to strengthen the rural health system (a major determinant of health in itself) and to facilitate action on other determinants of health, India launched the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in April 2005. METHODS: Under the NRHM, Rs. 666 billion (US$12.1 billion) was invested in rural areas from April 2005 to March 2012. There was also a substantially higher allocation for 18 high-focus states and 264 high-focus districts, identified on the basis of poor health and demographic indicators. Other determinants of health, especially nutrition and decentralized action, were addressed through mechanisms like State/District Health Missions, Village Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Committees, and Village Health and Nutrition Days. RESULTS: Consequently, in bigger high-focus states, rural IMR fell by 15.6 points between 2004 and 2011, as compared to 9 points in urban areas. Similarly, the maternal mortality rate in high-focus states declined by 17.9% between 2004-2006 and 2007-2009 compared to 14.6% in other states. CONCLUSION: The article, on the basis of the above approaches employed under NRHM, proposes the NRHM model to 'reduce health inequities and initiate action on SDH'."
27284704,0,a,"Canadian research indicates that individuals with lower incomes, less education or lower occupational skill levels tend to be less healthy than those who enjoy greater advantages in these areas. This uneven distribution of health across different socioeconomic status (SES) groups is referred to as ""socioeconomic inequality in health."" Evidence of the economic cost of health inequalities helps us understand the benefits of reducing these inequalities. However, the data needed to generate such evidence is difficult to obtain. A lack of Canadian data linking health costs and socioeconomic characteristics means that assessment of the degree to which health costs are associated with socioeconomic inequalities at the national level is limited. In order to build evidence on the cost of socioeconomic health inequalities, the Public Health Agency of Canada worked with Statistics Canada to test the feasibility of a ""bottom-up"" approach to compiling national health cost data. A bottom-up approach relies on individual-level data, which allows costs to be calculated by individual-level characteristics not always found in other data sources. This includes indicators of SES such as level of education or income. In this study, the population was divided into quintiles based on income, and the health care costs incurred by these five income groups were examined for a single year (2007-2008)."
6667732,1,a,"An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill.

Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
27352474,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To address the mouth as a site of structural inequalities looking through the lens of Aboriginal Australian experience. RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a critical review of published literature relevant to our objective. Criteria for selection included articles on: the social context of oral and general health inequalities for Aboriginal Australians; Aboriginal perceptions and meanings of the mouth and experiences of oral health care and the role of the current political-economic climate in promoting or compromising oral health for Aboriginal Australians. RESULTS: Evidence suggests oral health is important for Aboriginal Australians yet constrained by challenges beyond their control as individuals, including accessing dental services. Competing demands on limited budgets often led to oral health dropping off the radar unless there was an emergency. CONCLUSIONS: Structural (social, political and economic) factors often inhibited Aboriginal people making optimum health choices to prevent oral disease and access services for treatment. Factors included cost of services, limited education about oral health, intense advertising of sugary drinks and discrimination from service providers. Yet the literature indicates individuals, rather than structural factors, are held responsible and blamed for the poor state of their oral health. The current neoliberal climate focuses on individual responsibility for health and wellbeing often ignoring the social context. To avoid the mouth becoming an ongoing site for structural inequality, critically reviewing oral health policies and practices for whether they promote or compromise Aboriginal Australians' oral health is a step towards accountability-related oral health outcomes."
21391962,0,a,"BACKGROUND. Although recent research has provided evidence for the predictive validity of personality traits in academic settings, the path to an improved understanding of the nature of personality influences on academic achievement involves a reconceptualization of both criterion and predictor construct spaces. AIMS. For the criterion space, one needs to consider student behaviours beyond grades and level of educational attainment, and include what the student does among other things outside of the classroom. For the predictor space, it is possible to bring some order to the myriad personality constructs that have been developed over the last century, by focusing on common variance among personality and other non-ability traits. METHODS. We review these conceptual issues and several empirical studies. CONCLUSIONS. We demonstrate the possible increments in understanding non-ability determinants of academic achievement that may be obtained by focusing on areas where there is a theoretical convergence between predictor and criterion spaces."

3867226,1,a,"The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
12281022,1,a,"This paper analyzes the migration phenomenon within a framework that treats migration movements as continuous loops, from the country of origin to the destination and back. Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications."
31425558,0,a,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third greatest cancer burden in the United States. The remarkably diverse Mountain West state of Nevada has uncharacteristically high CRC mortality compared to other Western states. We aimed to study the determinants of the CRC excess burden by using data from the Nevada Central Cancer Registry from 2003-2013. Five-year cause-specific age-adjusted survival from colorectal cancer was calculated and stratified by sex, race/ethnicity and region of Nevada. Cox Proportional Hazards regression modelling was used to study the impact of demographic, social, and clinical factors on CRC survival in Nevada, assessing follow-up as accurately as possible. The extent to which differences in survival can be explained by receipt of stage-appropriate treatment was also assessed. 12,413 CRC cases from 2003-2013 in Nevada were analyzed. Five-year CRC survival was low: 56.0% (95% CI: 54.6-57.5) among males and 59.5% (95% CI: 58.0-61.1) among females; significantly lower than national 5-year survival of 65.1% and 66.5%, respectively. Low survival was driven by populous Southern Nevada; after adjustment for all covariates, Southern Nevadans were at 17% higher risk of death than their counterparts in Northwestern Nevada (HR:1.17; 95% CI:1.08-1.27). Many patients did not receive stage-appropriate treatment, although this only partly explained the poor survival, uniformly low for every race/ethnicity in Nevada. The observed disparity for this one state within a single nation merits public health attention; regardless of the state or region of residence, all Americans deserve equal opportunity for optimum health outcomes in the face of a cancer diagnosis. The current study provides baseline information critical to clinicians, public health professionals, and all relevant stakeholders as they attempt to discern why Nevada's outcomes are vastly divergent from its neighboring Western states and make plans for remediation."
25006080,0,a,"The idea of a Framework Convention for Global Health (FCGH), using the treaty-making powers of the World Health Organization (WHO), has been promoted as an opportunity to advance global health equity and the right to health. The idea has promise, but needs more thought regarding risks, obstacles, and strategies. The reform of global health governance must be based on a robust analysis of the political economy out of which the drivers of inequality and the denial of the right to health arise. Some of the published commentary has focused on using the proposed FCGH to institutionalize a paradigm change regarding international aid for health care, i.e., reconceptualizing such aid as obligatory, based on human solidarity rather than strategic considerations, based on global stability and national security. We warn against limiting the project to questions of inter-governmental financial transfers because of the risk of neglecting the underlying structural determinants of health injustice. Such neglect would help to legitimize an unjust and unsustainable global economic regime. We raise further questions about the strategic logic informing any campaign for a FCGH. The governments of the United States and Europe have put considerable effort into weakening WHO through tight donor controls, and it would require heavy pressure to persuade them to sign on to a FCGH. Generating such pressure would require strong popular mobilization around the local and diverse priorities of different communities across the globe, and recognition of a common need for effective regulation at the global level. We argue for a broad-based campaign from which the need for more effective global health regulation (and a FCGH) would emerge as a common theme arising from myriad more specific claims. This type of campaign would respond to local needs, and would also be understood within a global, political, and economic perspective."
24261639,0,a,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 358,000 maternal deaths still occur worldwide each year. The place of delivery is of great significance to the reduction of maternal mortality. Moreover, socio-economic factors, cultural traits, and local customs are associated with health-seeking behavior. This study aimed to explore determinants of association between social support and place of delivery. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from September to November 2011 at Sosiot Health Center, Kericho West District, Kenya. Participants were 303 mothers who brought their babies to the health center for immunization within their first year of life. Women underwent a structured interview using a questionnaire on demographic characteristics and their experiences of delivery including place of delivery and social support. RESULTS: The proportion of deliveries at health facilities was significantly higher in unmarried than married women (93% and 78%, respectively; P = 0.008). Unmarried women whose mothers supported them in housework and whose sisters helped them fetch water were more likely to deliver at health facilities (P = 0.002 and 0.042, respectively) than those without this support. However, married women whose husbands supported them in farming and whose neighbors helped them fetch water were less likely to deliver at health facilities (P = 0.003 and 0.021, respectively) than those without this support. Married women who were advised to deliver at a health facility by their mother-in-law or health staff were more likely to deliver at health facilities (P = 0.015 and 0.022, respectively) than those who did not receive this advice. Multivariate analysis revealed that married women were more likely to deliver at health facilities if they were highly educated (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5); had financial capability (OR = 4.3); had medical insurance (OR = 4.2); were primiparous (OR = 3.5); did not have the support of sisters-in-law for fetching water (OR = 2.2); or were advised to deliver at a health facility by family or neighbors (OR = 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Promotion of delivery at health facilities requires approaches that consider women's social situation, since factors influencing place of delivery differ for married and unmarried women."
30760829,0,a,"Neuropsychiatric disease has polygenic determinants but is often precipitated by environmental pressures, including adverse perinatal events. However, the way in which genetic vulnerability and early-life adversity interact remains obscure. We hypothesised that the extreme environmental stress of prematurity would promote neuroanatomic abnormality in individuals genetically vulnerable to psychiatric disorders. In 194 unrelated infants (104 males, 90 females), born before 33 weeks of gestation (mean gestational age 29.7 weeks), we combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging with a polygenic risk score (PRS) for five psychiatric pathologies to test the prediction that: deep grey matter abnormalities frequently seen in preterm infants are associated with increased polygenic risk for psychiatric illness. The variance explained by the PRS in the relative volumes of four deep grey matter structures (caudate nucleus, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and lentiform nucleus) was estimated using linear regression both for the full, mixed ancestral, cohort and a subsample of European infants. Psychiatric PRS was negatively associated with lentiform volume in the full cohort (beta = -0.24, p = 8 x 10(-4)) and a European subsample (beta = -0.24, p = 8 x 10(-3)). Genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric disease increase vulnerability to abnormal lentiform development after perinatal stress and are associated with neuroanatomic changes in the perinatal period."

29380381,0,a,"AIM: This study aimed to summarize the available information in the literature to make an accurate estimate of the prevalence of burnout among Iranian nurses. BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION: Burnout is a work-related stress syndrome that has negative impact on healthcare providers, patients and healthcare delivery systems. METHOD: A comprehensive search of literature using international [PubMed, Scopus and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)] and Iranian scientific data bases [Scientific Information Database (SID), IranMedex and Magiran] was conducted to identify English and Persian language studies, published between 2000 and 2016, that examined the prevalence of burnout among nurses in Iran. The I-squared test and Chi-squared-based Q-test suggested heterogeneity of reported prevalence among the qualified studies; thus, a random-effects model was applied to estimate the overall prevalence of burnout among nurses in Iran. RESULTS: Based on 21 selected articles with 4180 participants, the overall prevalence of burnout among Iranian nurses was estimated to be 36% [95% confidence interval (CI), 20-53%] in Iran. Meta-regression indicated that sample size and year of data collection, mean age of samples, female to male ratio and geographic regions were not statistically significantly associated with the prevalence of burnout. Also, based on Egger's test and funnel plot, there is no publication bias among studies included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Professional burnout affects more than one-third of nursing staff in Iran; thus, effective interventions and strategies are required to reduce and prevent burnout among nurses. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Due to the negative consequences of burnout on patients, nurses and organizations, nursing and healthcare managers should intervene to prevent and reduce burnout among nurses in Iran. Policy attention should focus on developing effective interventions to prevent and minimize the burden of burnout among nurses in Iran. Nurses' involvement in the policy-making process is crucial in the implementation of effective programs and initiatives tailored to address the higher prevalence of burnout among Iranian nurses."
31234807,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The connection between choice, control and health is well established in the literature on the social determinants of health, which includes choice and control of vital health and social services. However, even in the context of universal health and social care schemes, the ability to exercise choice and control can be distributed unequally. This paper uses the case of the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) to examine these issues. The NDIS is a major policy reform based on an international trend towards personalisation in social care. It aims to increase choice and control over services and supports for people who have or acquire a permanent disability, thereby boosting citizen empowerment and improving health and social outcomes. METHODS: The research is a structured review of empirical evidence on the administration and outcomes of the NDIS to identify how social factors constrain or enable the ability of individuals to exercise choice within personalised care schemes. RESULTS: We show how social determinants of health at the individual level can collide with the complexity of policy delivery systems to entrench health inequalities. CONCLUSION: Many social policy reforms internationally focus on improving empowerment through enabling choice and control. However, if administrative systems do not take account of existing structural inequities, then such schemes are likely to entrench or grow social inequality. Our research indicates that more attention must be given to the design of policy delivery systems for personalisation schemes to ensure health equity."
23110632,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This report presents the initial results of the first Epidemiological Catchment Area Study in mental health in Canada. Five neighbourhoods in the South-West sector of Montreal, with a population of 258,000, were under study. The objectives of the research program were: 1) to assess the prevalence and incidence of psychological distress, mental disorders, substance abuse, parasuicide, risky behaviour and quality of life; 2) to examine the links and interactions between individual determinants, neighbourhood ecology and mental health in each neighbourhood; 3) to identify the conditions facilitating the integration of individuals with mental health problems; 4) to analyse the impact of the social, economic and physical aspects of the neighbourhoods using a geographic information system. 5) to verify the adequacy of mental health services. METHOD: A longitudinal study in the form of a community survey was used, complemented by focused qualitative sub-studies. The longitudinal study included a randomly selected sample of 2,433 individuals between the ages of 15 and 65 in the first wave of data collection, and three other waves are projected. An overview of the methods is presented. RESULTS: The prevalence of psychological distress, mental disorders and use of mental health services and their correlates are described for the first wave of data collection. CONCLUSION: Several vulnerable groups and risk factors related to socio-demographic variables have been identified such as: gender, age, marital status, income, immigration and language. These results can be used to improve treatment services, prevention of mental disorders, and mental health promotion."
20879964,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although limited health literacy is a barrier to disease management and has been associated with poor glycemic control, the mechanisms underlying the relationships between health literacy and diabetes outcomes are unknown. We examined the relationships between health literacy, determinants of diabetes self-care, and glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Patients with diabetes were recruited from an outpatient primary care clinic. We collected information on demographics, health literacy, diabetes knowledge, diabetes fatalism, social support, and diabetes self-care, and hemoglobin A1c values were extracted from the medical record. Structural equation models tested the predicted pathways linking health literacy to diabetes self-care and glycemic control. RESULTS: No direct relationship was observed between health literacy and diabetes self-care or glycemic control. Health literacy had a direct effect on social support (r = -0.20, P < 0.05) and through social support had an indirect effect on diabetes self-care (r = -0.07) and on glycemic control (r = -0.01). More diabetes knowledge (r = 0.22, P < 0.05), less fatalism (r = -0.22, P < 0.05), and more social support (r = 0.27, P < 0.01) were independent, direct predictors of diabetes self-care and through self-care were related to glycemic control (r = -0.20, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest health literacy has an indirect effect on diabetes self-care and glycemic control through its association with social support. This suggests that for patients with limited health literacy, enhancing social support would facilitate diabetes self-care and improved glycemic control."

3053480,1,a,"The offense-defense dichotomy undeniably proved to be of heuristic interest in that it allowed relevant distinctions between specific behaviour patterns, to establish correlations between situations in which either ""offensive"" or ""defensive"" patterns are likely to be displayed, and to uncover differential drug effects on those distinct behavior patterns. But for a number of reasons, the author is led to conclude that even though the offense-defense dichotomy indeed helps in many instances to describe and to distinguish, it has rather limited potential really to explain in depth what it distinguishes at a phenomenological level of investigation."
28659703,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Hajj pilgrimage, in Saudi Arabia, is one of the world's largest religious mass gatherings. We have similar mass gathering scenarios in India such as the Amarnath Yatra and Kumbh. A unique combination of physical, physiological, and psychological factors makes this pilgrimage a very stressful milieu. We studied the emergence of psychopathology and its determinants, in this adverse environment in mass gathering situation, in Indian pilgrims on Hajj 2016. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study analyzing the mental morbidity in 1.36 lakh Indian pilgrims during Hajj 2016, using SPSS software version 19. RESULTS: Totally 182 patients reported psychological problems. Twenty-two patients (12%) required admission. Twelve (6.8%) pilgrims reported a past history of a mental illness. One hundred and sixty-five (93.2%) patients never had any mental symptoms earlier in life. The most common illnesses seen were stress related (45.7%) followed by psychosis (9.8%), insomnia (7.3%), and mood disorders (5.6%). The most common symptoms recorded were apprehension (45%), sleep (55%), anxiety (41%), and fear of being lost (27%). Psychotropics were prescribed for 46% of pilgrims. All patients completed their Hajj successfully and returned to India. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative stress causes full spectrum of mental decompensation, and prompt healing is aided by simple nonpharmacological measures including social support and counseling in compatible sociolinguistic milieu."
3453175,1,a,"To explore the psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination (BSE) among women, we studied a stratified random sample of 264 women students, faculty, and staff in a university community. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported frequency of BSE, and predictors included measures of general health predispositions, variables of the Health Belief Model, the impact of a woman's social network, a set of secondary non-health-related barriers and benefits, and the woman's evaluation of her personal health care system. Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice."
6474230,1,a,"The paper examines role of social support, structural-environmental and perceptual variables in explaining variation in illness behaviour in a sample of 240 adults with impaired hearing. The specific behaviour examined is physician visits over a 12 month period. We find that previous experience with illness and perceived health status are important variables with respect to illness behaviour and that the relevance of these variables and social support vary considerably by level of psychological distress. While the addition of psychological distress as an explanatory variable makes little contribution, the variation in the power of the model to explain variation in behaviour across levels of distress is substantial. Our findings argue strongly for increased awareness of the role of social and psychological factors in illness behaviour, particularly among those who plan and deliver health care services."
3566318,1,a,"We followed 183 infants for two years, 31 of whom were breast fed less than three and a half months (median 70 days; short breast feeding group) and a further 31 of whom were exclusively breast fed for more than nine months (long breast feeding group). We assessed heredity for atopy, number of infections, and duration of breast feeding as determinants of atopy. During the first year of life 14 infants has signs of atopy. During the second year parents reported signs of atopy in a further 31. Heredity was the only significant predictor of atopy. Atopy was seen in 33% of infants with a positive heredity and in 16% without family history for atopy. The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13). Duration of breast feeding did not associate with incidence of respiratory infections. Diarrhoea was more common in the short breast feeding group than in the long breast feeding group during the first year of life. We conclude that prolonging exclusive breast feeding from the median of 70 days to nine months did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy and respiratory tract infections."
22420116,0,a,"Two studies investigated relationships between traditional indicators of acculturation, cultural distance, acculturation strategies, and basic dimensions of personality as they pertain to psychological adjustment among Hispanic students. Although personality characteristics have been shown to be important determinants of psychological well-being, acculturation research has put less emphasis on the role of personality in the well-being of immigrants. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that basic dimensions of personality such as extraversion and neuroticism were strongly related to psychological adjustment. Acculturation strategies did not mediate the effect of personality variables, but cultural resistance made a small, independent contribution to the explanation of some aspects of negative psychological adjustment. The implications of the results were discussed."
3883893,1,a,"Our review has focused centrally on the etiologic significance of social factors in the development of psychopathology. Our implicit assumption has been that social factors in general, and stressors in particular, may play a causal role in the development of psychopathology. Yet the evidence is clear that the vast majority of people who are exposed to stressful life events or to chronic stress situations do not develop significant psychiatric impairments. For this reason, research interest over the past decade has shifted to factors like social support and coping strategies that may ameliorate the impact of stress. We have examined some of the important empirical results from recent studies of stress, support, and coping, and we have discussed ways in which these new understandings have informed long-standing attempts to explain group differences in emotional functioning. In each section of the review we have attempted not only to summarize existing results but also to provide some evaluation of the literature and suggestions for future research. It is important to recognize that the contributors to the work reviewed here do not all share a common research agenda. Some of them are primarily committed to unraveling the psychosocial determinants of a particular clinical disorder. Others are mainly concerned with the effects of a particular stressor. Still others are interested in the processes that link stress to health across a broad array of stress situations and health outcomes. In the face of these diverse interests, it is little wonder that our understanding of social factors in psychopathology is uneven. There is good reason to believe, however that these diverse strands of research are beginning to converge on a common conception of the stress process and on a common research design. The conception at present is only in rough form, but its outlines are nonetheless capable of description. At its center is the notion that stress exposure sets off a process of adaptation. It recognizes that this process unfolds over time, and it acknowledges that this process is modified by structural factors as well as by personal dispositions and vulnerabilities. There is growing recognition that the analysis of this process requires longitudinal methods. Also, it is becoming increasingly clear that experimental interventions are required to unravel the parts of this process that link stress and health. It is too early to know if this nascent convergence will lead to an integrative theory of adaptation, yet it is almost certain to promote methodological and conceptual rigor and facilitate replication and cumulation of findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
28612807,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In the early 1960s, the Kingdom of Bhutan began to develop its modern health-care system and by the 1990s had developed an extensive network of health-care facilities. These developments, in tandem with wider social and economic progress encapsulated in the Gross National Happiness concept, have resulted in major gains in child survival and life expectancy in the past 50 years. In order to sustain these gains, the country has identified a constitutional and health-policy mandate for universal access to health. METHODS: Based on analysis of the literature, and qualitative and quantitative health data, this case study aims to provide an assessment of universal health coverage in Bhutan, and to identify the major challenges to measuring, monitoring and sustaining universal coverage. RESULTS: The study reveals that the wide network of primary and secondary care, reinforced by constitutional and policy mandates, ensures high population coverage, as well as wide availability and accessibility of care, with significant levels of financial protection. This achievement has been attributable to sustained state investment in the sector over past decades. Despite this achievement, recent surveys have demonstrated gaps in utilization of health services and confirmed associations between socioeconomic variables and health access and outcomes, which raise important questions relating to both supply- and demand-side barriers in accessing health care. CONCLUSION: In order to sustain and improve the quality of universal health coverage, improved measurements of service availability at subnational levels and of the determinants of pockets of low service utilization are required. More rigorous monitoring of financial protection is also needed, particularly in relation to rates of public investment and the impact of out-of-pocket costs while accessing care. These approaches should assist improvements in quality and equity in universal health coverage, in the context of ongoing epidemiological, demographic and social transition."
29561832,0,a,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the need for supportive care among women suffering from breast cancer in China and to identify its potential determinants to inform the development of effective and efficient healthcare services across different settings. MATERIAL AND METHODS In a tertiary-care hospital in Weifang, China, between July 2015 and January 2016, all women attending the Breast Cancer Clinic for regular physical examinations after treatment for breast cancer were consecutively recruited. The 34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey tool (Chinese version) (SCNS-SF34-C) was used to assess the unmet needs among participants. RESULTS Among 264 recruited patients, based on at least single-item endorsement, 60.2% had moderate to high level of need for supportive care, while only 13.3% expressed no need. Lack of information regarding health systems was the most common domain with moderate to high unmet needs, more so among rural patients (8 vs. 5 out of 10). In each information-related domain, huge unmet need was observed among all patients irrespective of urban or rural residence. Both overall and individual information-related domain-specific unmet needs were significantly higher among rural patients as opposed to their urban counterparts. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant rural-urban variation of unmet needs. Moreover, education and post-diagnosis time duration were negatively associated with unmet needs while stage of cancer was positively associated with these unmet needs. CONCLUSIONS There is a huge burden of unmet needs for information on the healthcare system among breast cancer survivors in China. Rural residence, less education, advanced stage of cancer, and shorter duration since diagnosis were the identified determinants requiring targeted intervention."
23611831,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The home and family environment is a highly influential psychosocial antecedent of pediatric obesity. Implementation of conventional family- and home-based childhood obesity interventions is challenging for parents, often requiring them to attend multiple educational sessions. Attrition rates for traditional interventions are frequently high due to competing demands for parents' time. Under such constraints, an Internet-based intervention has the potential to modify determinants of childhood obesity while making judicious use of parents' time. Theory-based interventions offer many advantages over atheoretical interventions, including reduced intervention dosage, increased likelihood of behavioral change, and efficient resource allocation. Social cognitive theory (SCT) is a robust theoretical framework for addressing childhood obesity. SCT is a behavior change model rooted in reciprocal determinism, a causal paradigm that states that human functioning is the product of a dynamic interplay of behavioral, personal, and environmental factors. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of the Enabling Mothers to Prevent Childhood Obesity Through Web-Based Education and Reciprocal Determinism (EMPOWER) program, an Internet-based, theory-driven intervention for preventing childhood overweight and obesity. The project goal is supported by two specific aims: (1) modification of four obesogenic protective factors related to childhood obesity (minutes engaged in physical activity, servings of fruits and vegetables consumed, servings of sugar-sweetened and sugar-free beverages consumed, and minutes engaged in screen time), and (2) reification of five maternal-mediated constructs of SCT (environment, expectations, emotional coping, self-control, and self-efficacy). METHODS: We will recruit mothers with children ages 4 to 6 years from childcare centers and randomly assign them to either the theory-based (experimental) or knowledge-based (control) arm of the trial. Data for the intervention will be collected at three intervals: baseline (week 0), posttest (week 4), and follow-up (8 weeks). At each phase of data collection, we will collect from both groups (1) measures of the four obesogenic protective factors, and (2) summated SCT construct scores. Constructs will be measured by a psychometrically valid and reliable SCT-based instrument. Behaviors will be evaluated by a behavior log. We will use a repeated-measures one-between-, one-within-participants design to evaluate intervention results. Constructs will be modified through Web-based learning modules, online interactive worksheets, and mother-child home-based activities. Process evaluation will assess program fidelity."

Two sets of factors are examined: social characteristics of the adopters are used to test Rogers's and Shoemaker's contention that discontinuers have more traditional values than continuers; and the adoption decision process is analyzed to identify the relationship of communication factors to discontinuance. Although number of children and experience of method problems were the major determinants of discontinuance, unfavorable information from friends and other birth control users was a significant factor. Rumor was found to have little effect on a women's decision to continue or discontinue."

The procedure is not always easy to undertake and can lead to problems for the patient and nurse. Alongside various procedures, local warming is one technique that could be used to increase the diameter of superficial veins. This prospective non-randomised trial aimed to determine the effect of local warming on vein diameter in the antecubital area in adults aged 20-40 years. METHOD: the subjects included 55 volunteers who were in good health. The cephalic vein diameter of the right arm cubital area was measured for each participant using ultrasound guidance. The arm was warmed for 10 minutes using a heating device maintained at 42 masculineC. A second ultrasound scan was then undertaken immediately afterwards and cephalic vein diameter measured. RESULTS: local warming increased the cephalic vein diameter in the cubital area by 0.43+/-0.4 mm. There was no significant relationship between change in cephalic vein diameter and participants' gender, age or body mass index. CONCLUSION: the results indicate that the application of heat is an effective technique for venodilation and could be considered in emergencies or in cases when other veins are difficult to access."

26495261,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Smoking among the youth is an important public health concern. Although several studies have investigated the correlates of smoking behavior, no theory-based study has particularly assessed this problem among medical students. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict smoking behavior among a sample of Iranian medical students. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out in Ahvaz, Iran, 2014. The data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire, which included items on demographics, smoking behavior, and components of the TPB model (attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, and intention), and an added construct on smoking refusal skill. Data were analyzed using descriptive correlation, and linear regression statistics by SPSS, version 16. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy medical students with a mean age of 21.25 (SD = 2.9) years were enrolled in the study. Of them, 24 (13.5%) students were smokers. All components of the TPB model and smoking refusal skill were statistically significant as to intention to smoke (P < 0.001). The TPB constructs with and without smoking refusal skill accounted for 77% (adjusted R2) and 78% of the variance observed for intention to smoke, respectively. The results also revealed the highest weight for perceived behavior control (beta= -0.40). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicated that all TPB variables are useful tools for prediction of the smoking behaviors among students. Particularly, students' perceived behavioral control and attitudes towards smoking were found to be important determinants of smoking intentions. Thus, the findings could be used for planning effective tobacco control programs targeting University students."
24884891,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This study ascertained gender-specific determinants of outpatient mental health (MH) service use for depression to highlight any gender disparities in barriers to care and explain how depressed men and women in need of care might differ in their help-seeking behaviour. METHODS: Data used in this study came from the Canadian Community Health Survey on Mental Health and Well Being, cycle 1.2 (CCHS 1.2) conducted by Statistics Canada in 2002 (N = 36,984). The sample was limited to respondents filling criteria for a probable major depression in the 12 months prior to the interview (n = 1743). Gender-specific multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out. RESULTS: The results showed that 54.3% of respondents meeting criteria for major depression had consulted for mental health reasons in the year prior to interview. When looking at type of outpatient mental health service use, males were more likely to consult a general practitioner and a mental health specialist in the past year as opposed to females. However, females were more likely to consult a general practitioner only as opposed to no service use than males. Gender specific differences in determinants associated with outpatient service use included for males, lower adjusted household income, and for females, a younger age, the presence of social support, self-reported availability barriers, the presence of self-reported suicidal thoughts or attempt and a poorer self- perceived mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Continued efforts to promote access to mental health care are needed for men and women affected by depression, and this, to target specific vulnerable populations and increase utilization rates."
7246836,1,a,"This study examined the records of the North Carolina Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine which social, family, and child characteristics were most influential in the decision to place a child in foster care. These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care."
28186384,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) is being incorporated into the cervical screening programme, with the probable future introduction of HPV as a primary test and a possibility of HPV self-sampling. In anticipation of this development, we sought to inform future policy and practice by identifying potential barriers to HPV self-sampling. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 194 women aged 20-64 years was conducted. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants of self-sampling intentions. A purposive subsample of 19 women who reported low self-sampling intentions were interviewed. Interviews were framework-analysed. RESULTS: Most survey participants (N=133, 69.3%) intended to HPV self-sample. Lower intention was associated with lower self-efficacy (OR=24.96, P</=.001), lower education (OR=6.06, P</=.05) and lower perceived importance of HPV as a cause of cervical cancer (OR=2.33, P</=.05). Interviews revealed personal and system-related barriers. Personal barriers included a lack of knowledge about HPV self-sampling, women's low confidence in their ability to self-sample correctly and low confidence in the subsequent results. System-related factors included a lack of confidence in the rationale for modifying the current cervical screening programme, and concerns about sample contamination and identity theft. CONCLUSIONS: Insights gained from this research can be used to guide further enquiry into the possibility of HPV self-sampling and to help inform future policy and practice. Personal and system-related barriers including low confidence in the reasons for changing current cervical screening provision need to be addressed, should HPV self-sampling be incorporated into the cervical screening programme."
4076484,1,a,"This paper has analyzed a theoretical model of mobility decision-making. The model relies entirely on individual-level factors rather than macro-level factors as determinants of migration decision-making. The individual-level variables included in the model are: recent mobility history, urban social contacts, information about urban areas, evaluations of different locations, migration plans, and actual movements in the period subsequent to an initial interview. The empirical results indicate that with some exceptions there are relatively strong links of the type suggested in the model among these variables. The model was evaluated separately for two groups of villages for movement to Bangkok and for movement to Northeast Thai towns. Thus, four submodels were estimated, providing an opportunity to observe how robust the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins. Although certain differences are found among the four submodels, the overwhelming feature is their similarity. Where differences do exist, they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process. Clearly, a villager's previous history of movement is a key factor affecting subsequent movement and the entire decision-making process. The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center. Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans. Except in one submodel, evaluations have a significant effect on plans; and the existence of plans--which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts, information, and evaluations--is the only factor other than previous mobility which has a significant direct effect on subsequent movement. Thai policy makers are searching for ways to stimulate the growth of regional urban growth centers and reduce the growth of Bangkok. From the standpoint of intervention, a key variable in this process would appear to be information. Not only is information level related to evaluations of an urban area and mobility plans, but, compared to other variables in the model, it appears to be relatively amenable to modification by inputs deriving from a source external to the village itself. It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly, though both could be indirectly influenced by informational inputs. Movement history would be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate; while villagers could be sponsored for short trips to town, this is not likely to produce much long-range effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
31271940,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In both the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), health inequities are proving resistant to improvement. Nurses are ideally placed to advocate for social justice. It is therefore important that nurse education encourages awareness of the social determinants of health and equips students to act to address health inequity. However, little is known about student nurses' attitudes to social justice and poverty and the impact of pedagogical strategies used to teach the determinants and patterns of health inequities. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare UK and US student nurses' attitudes towards social justice and poverty before and after learning about social determinants of health and health inequities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with embedded before and after design using validated measures. SETTING: Two universities: one urban UK university and one US university with urban and rural campuses. PARTICIPANTS: 230 student nurses in the UK (n=143) and US (n=87) enrolled in courses teaching content including health inequities and social determinants of health. RESULTS: Student nurses generally disagreed with stigmatizing statements about people living in poverty and mostly agreed with statements promoting social justice. However, US students were significantly more likely to have positive attitudes towards both social justice (p=0.001) and poverty (p<0.001). In multiple regression analyses, engagement in social justice-promoting activities, activism and higher levels of education were associated with positive attitudes to social justice and poverty. Statistically significant positive changes in attitudes to poverty and social justice after their courses were observed only among US student nurses. CONCLUSION: UK and US student nurses' attitudes to poverty and social justice were generally positive. Education around social determinants of health and health inequity had a different effect in the UK and the US. There is a need to explore further what specific components of educational programmes lead to positive changes in attitudes."
2801277,1,a,"This study investigated the relationships among family environment, demographic measures, the decisions made by unintentionally pregnant adolescents regarding postdelivery plans and the certainty with which these decisions were made. Subjects were 175 pregnant adolescents, ages 14 through 22, who intended to carry their pregnancies to term. Greater uncertainty was associated with living with both natural parents or with mother only. Higher levels of negative affect were related to lower levels of perceived family cohesion, independence, expressiveness, and intellectual-cultural orientation. Age, trimester of pregnancy, and family constellation also were related to levels of negative affect. Discriminant analysis revealed that subjects choosing adoption were more likely to be older and to be white than were those choosing to keep the child. They also tended to perceive higher levels of expressiveness and independence in their families. The implications of these findings for the delivery of services and for future research efforts in this area are discussed."
2926701,1,a,"This study used a subsample of 543 married couples from a large group of families in Utah, who were originally studied to assess the genetic and environmental determinants of hypertension. Excluding individuals on medication and controlling for the major risk factors for hypertension, evidence was obtained for cross-spouse blood pressure associations equal in magnitude to self-psychosocial and demographic measures. Observed spouse-spouse similarity for blood pressures remained significant after adjustment for shared psychological factors. It is speculated that different aspects of each spouse's nonmarital environments (e.g. work, social support) have differential impacts on the marital environment and on physiologic indicators of health."
30673126,0,a,"Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) cause zoonotic infections transmitted by birds and livestock herds. These pathogens have remained as serious economic and health threats in most areas of the world. As zoonotic diseases, the risk of development of occupational disease and even death outcome necessitate implementation of control strategies to prevent its spread. Zoonotic MAP infections include Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, and immune-related diseases (such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Paratuberculosis has classified as type B epidemic zoonotic disease according to world health organization which is transmitted to human through consumption of dairy and meat products. In addition, MAC causes pulmonary manifestations and lymphadenitis in normal hosts and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progression (by serotypes 1, 4, and 8). Furthermore, other subspecies have caused respiratory abscesses, neck lymph nodes, and disseminated osteomyelitis in children and ulcers. However, the data over the occupational relatedness of these subspecies is rare. These agents can cause occupational infections in susceptible herd breeders. Several molecular methods have been recognized as proper strategies for tracking the infection. In this study, some zoonotic aspects, worldwide prevalence and control strategies regarding infections due to MAP and MAC and related subspecies has been reviewed."
19925468,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Self-care for kidney transplantation is recommended to maintain kidney function. Little is known about levels of self-care practices and demographic, psychosocial, and health-related correlates. AIM: To investigate patients' self-reported exercise and fluid intake, demographic and psychosocial factors associated with these self-care practices, and health-related quality of life. METHODS: Eighty-eight of 158 kidney recipients from two academic medical centers completed a semi-structured interview and surveys 2 months post-transplant. RESULTS: Most patients were sedentary (76%) with a quarter exercising either regularly (11%) or not at current recommendations (13%). One-third (35%) reported drinking the recommended 3 L of fluid daily. Multivariate analyses indicated that private insurance, high self-efficacy, and better physical functioning were significantly associated with engaging in physical activity (p < 0.05); while male gender, private insurance, high self-efficacy, and not attributing oneself responsible for transplant success were significant predictors of adherence to fluid intake (p < 0.05). Despite the significance of these predictors, models for physical activity and fluid intake explained 10-15% of the overall variance in these behaviors. Multivariate analyses indicated that younger age, high value of exercise, and higher social functioning significantly (p < 0.05) predicted high self-efficacy for physical activity, while being married significantly (p < 0.05) predicted high self-efficacy for fluid intake. CONCLUSION: Identifying patients at risk of inadequate self-care practice is essential for educating patients about the importance of self-care."
29432789,0,a,"Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption are key determinants of morbidity and mortality. These health behaviours often begin at a young age and track into adulthood, emphasising a need for interventions in children and young people. Previous research has demonstrated the potential effectiveness of behavioural incentive (BI) interventions in adults. However, little is known about their effectiveness in children and adolescents. Eight bibliographic databases were searched. Eligibility criteria included controlled trials using behavioural incentives (rewards provided contingent on successful performance of the target behaviour) as an intervention component for health behaviour change in children and adolescents. Intervention effects (standardised mean differences or odds ratios) were calculated and pooled by health behaviour, using a random effects model. Twenty-two studies were included (of n=8392 identified), 19 of which were eligible for meta-analysis: physical activity (n=8); healthier eating (n=3); and smoking (n=8). There was strong evidence that behavioural incentives may encourage healthier eating behaviours, some evidence that behavioural incentives were effective for encouraging physical activity behaviour, and limited evidence to support the use of behavioural incentives for smoking cessation and prevention in adolescents. Findings suggest that behavioural incentives may encourage uptake and initiation of healthy eating and physical activity in young people. However, this is a limited evidence base and a wide range of incentive designs have yet to be explored. Future research should further investigate the acceptability of these intervention approaches for young people."
3342135,1,a,"Determinants of families' reactions to their relatives' relocation (from a large developmental disability institution that was closing to smaller institutions) were examined. Ninety-four families responded to two surveys sent during closure and one year later asking about (a) reactions to the closure, (b) relative's medical status, (c) involvement with their relative, (d) appraisal of the situation, and (e) social support. Over time, families reported less stress and dissatisfaction with closure. Family reactions during closure were related to the relative's medical status, involvement with their relative, and appraisal of the situation, whereas family reactions one year later were related to appraisal, involvement with their relative, and social support."
23131600,0,a,"Cognitive reserve is thought to reflect life experiences. Which experiences contribute to reserve and their relative importance is not understood. Subjects were 652 autopsied cases from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. Reserve was defined as the residual variance of the regressions of cognitive factors on brain pathology and was captured in a latent variable that was regressed on potential determinants of reserve. Neuropathology variables included Alzheimer's disease markers, Lewy bodies, infarcts, microinfarcts, and brain weight. Cognition was measured with six cognitive domain scores. Determinants of reserve were socioeconomic status (SES), education, leisure cognitive activities at age 40 (CA40) and at study enrollment (CAbaseline) in late life. The four exogenous predictors of reserve were weakly to moderately inter-correlated. In a multivariate model, all except SES had statistically significant effects on Reserve, the strongest of which were CA40 (beta = .31) and CAbaseline (beta = .28). The Education effect was negative in the full model (beta = -.25). Results suggest that leisure cognitive activities throughout adulthood are more important than education in determining reserve. Discrepancies between cognitive activity and education may be informative in estimating late life reserve."
6359827,1,a,"Representative theories and research associated with biosocial and psychosocial explanations of juvenile delinquency in the context of the family are reviewed. The studies discussed demonstrate that biological, psychological, and social forces are all determinants of parent-child relations in the development of delinquency. Theories and research are also reviewed which show how biosocial and psychosocial orientations toward antisocial behavior can be integrated into a unified understanding of delinquency. It is concluded that biosocial and psychosocial theories of delinquency must be considered before a full understanding of delinquent conduct can be reached."
31706274,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is a multidimensional concept that is affected by various factors. According to the literature, social capital is one of the key determinants of QoL that improves the living conditions of the entire community. This study aimed to investigate the association between social capital and QoL in pregnant women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 240 pregnant women with a mean age of 27.98 years who were referred to healthcare centers in Qazvin, Iran. A two-stage random sampling method was used to select the health centers and participants. Social capital, QoL, demographic and obstetric characteristics were assessed. RESULTS: The mean scores of social capital, physical and mental dimensions of quality of life were 67.43, 70.2 and 71.88 respectively. All dimensions of social capital except for family and friends' connection and tolerance of diversity had positive significant correlations with the physical and mental health dimensions of quality of life (r = 0.17 to 0.28 p < 0.05). A univariate regression model revealed that social capital had a significant association with both the physical health (B = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19-0.61, p < 0.001) and mental health (B = 0 .44, 95% CI: 0.18-0.58, p < 0.001) dimensions of pregnant women's quality of life. In the adjusted model, each unit increase of social capital increased pregnant women's QoL in both the physical health and mental health dimensions. CONCLUSION: Social capital has a significant association with women's QoL during pregnancy. Therefore, QoL during pregnancy could be improved by considering physical, psychological and social components of their healthcare."
20664624,0,a,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Most insulin-requiring diabetes patients in Ethiopia have an atypical form of the disease, which resembles previous descriptions of malnutrition-related diabetes. As so little is known about its aetiology, we have carried out a case-control study to evaluate its social and nutritional determinants. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Men and women with insulin-requiring diabetes (n=107), aged 18-40 years, were recruited in two centres, Gondar and Jimma, 750 km northwest and 330 km southwest of the capital, Addis Ababa, respectively. Controls of similar age and sex (n=110) were recruited from patients attending other hospital clinics. RESULTS: Diabetes was strongly associated with subsistence farming, odds ratio=3.5 (95% confidence interval: 1.5-7.8) and illiteracy/low levels of education, odds ratio=4.0 (2.0-8.0). Diabetes was also linked with a history of childhood malnutrition, odds ratio=5.5 (1.0-29.0) the mother's death during childhood, odds ratio=3.9 (1.0-14.8), and markers of poverty including poorer access to sanitation (P=0.004), clean water (P=0.009), greater overcrowding (P=0.04), increased distance from the clinic (P=0.01) and having fewer possessions (P=0.01). Compared with controls, people with diabetes had low mid upper arm circumference, body mass index (BMI) and fat/lean body mass (P<0.01). In addition, men with the disease tended to be shorter, were lighter (P=0.001), with reduced sitting height (P=0.015) and reduced biacromial (P=0.003) and bitrochanteric (P=0.008) diameters. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin-requiring diabetes in Ethiopia is strongly linked with poor education and markers of poverty. Men with the disease have associated disproportionate skeletal growth. These findings point towards a nutritional aetiology for this condition although the nature of the nutritional deficiency and its timing during growth and development remains obscure."
26382241,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), knowledge about health and its determinants has been integrated into a comparable framework to inform health policy. Outputs of this analysis are relevant to current policy questions in England and elsewhere, particularly on health inequalities. We use GBD 2013 data on mortality and causes of death, and disease and injury incidence and prevalence to analyse the burden of disease and injury in England as a whole, in English regions, and within each English region by deprivation quintile. We also assess disease and injury burden in England attributable to potentially preventable risk factors. England and the English regions are compared with the remaining constituent countries of the UK and with comparable countries in the European Union (EU) and beyond. METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2013 to compare mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with a disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in England, the UK, and 18 other countries (the first 15 EU members [apart from the UK] and Australia, Canada, Norway, and the USA [EU15+]). We extended elements of the analysis to English regions, and subregional areas defined by deprivation quintile (deprivation areas). We used data split by the nine English regions (corresponding to the European boundaries of the Nomenclature for Territorial Statistics level 1 [NUTS 1] regions), and by quintile groups within each English region according to deprivation, thereby making 45 regional deprivation areas. Deprivation quintiles were defined by area of residence ranked at national level by Index of Multiple Deprivation score, 2010. Burden due to various risk factors is described for England using new GBD methodology to estimate independent and overlapping attributable risk for five tiers of behavioural, metabolic, and environmental risk factors. We present results for 306 causes and 2337 sequelae, and 79 risks or risk clusters. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2013, life expectancy from birth in England increased by 5.4 years (95% uncertainty interval 5.0-5.8) from 75.9 years (75.9-76.0) to 81.3 years (80.9-81.7); gains were greater for men than for women. Rates of age-standardised YLLs reduced by 41.1% (38.3-43.6), whereas DALYs were reduced by 23.8% (20.9-27.1), and YLDs by 1.4% (0.1-2.8). For these measures, England ranked better than the UK and the EU15+ means. Between 1990 and 2013, the range in life expectancy among 45 regional deprivation areas remained 8.2 years for men and decreased from 7.2 years in 1990 to 6.9 years in 2013 for women. In 2013, the leading cause of YLLs was ischaemic heart disease, and the leading cause of DALYs was low back and neck pain. Known risk factors accounted for 39.6% (37.7-41.7) of DALYs; leading behavioural risk factors were suboptimal diet (10.8% [9.1-12.7]) and tobacco (10.7% [9.4-12.0]). INTERPRETATION: Health in England is improving although substantial opportunities exist for further reductions in the burden of preventable disease. The gap in mortality rates between men and women has reduced, but marked health inequalities between the least deprived and most deprived areas remain. Declines in mortality have not been matched by similar declines in morbidity, resulting in people living longer with diseases. Health policies must therefore address the causes of ill health as well as those of premature mortality. Systematic action locally and nationally is needed to reduce risk exposures, support healthy behaviours, alleviate the severity of chronic disabling disorders, and mitigate the effects of socioeconomic deprivation.

6706795,1,a,"A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed. Smoking, use of drugs, sexual behavior, and drinking of alcoholic beverages at the age of 16 years was related to dropout from secondary school during the 2-year study period. The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed."
2797981,1,a,"Height and weight data from the Mexican-American portion of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) are shown for children of ages 2 to 17 years and compared with data for non-Hispanic white children from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference curves. Differences in stature between the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the reference populations were minor prior to adolescence and could be entirely attributed to the greater poverty of Mexican-Americans. However, differences increased during adolescence (ie, median stature was less than the 25th percentile of the NCHS reference population at 17 years of age) and, in contrast with earlier ages, were independent of poverty. Similar growth patterns were observed in samples of upper-class subjects from Mexico and Guatemala. Nonetheless, the extent to which the short stature of Mexican-American adolescents is genetic is unclear because there is an apparent time trend toward greater stature in the Mexican-American population. In conclusion, the NCHS reference curves are appropriate growth standards for preadolescent Mexican-American children. Whether they are valid for Mexican-American adolescents remains unclear."
27621437,0,a,"In a globalized world, establishing successful cooperation between people from different nations is becoming increasingly important. We present results from a comprehensive investigation of cross-societal cooperation in one-shot prisoner's dilemmas involving population-representative samples from six countries and identify crucial facilitators of and obstacles to cooperation. In interactions involving mutual knowledge about only the other players' nationalities, we demonstrate that people hold strong and transnationally shared expectations (i.e., stereotypes) concerning the cooperation level of interaction partners from other countries. These expectations are the strongest determinants of participant cooperation. Paradoxically, however, they turn out to be incorrect stereotypes that even correlate negatively with reality. In addition to erroneous expectations, participants' cooperation behavior is driven by (shared) social preferences that vary according to the interaction partner's nationality. In the cross-societal context, these social preferences are influenced by differences in wealth and ingroup favoritism, as well as effects of specific country combinations but not by spatial distance between nations."
30526593,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In 2000, the Millennium Development Goals set targets for social achievements by 2015 including goals related to maternal and child health, with mixed success. Several initiatives supported these goals including assuring availability of appropriate medicines and commodities to meet health service targets. To reach the new Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, information is needed to address policy and systems factors to improve access to lifesaving commodities. METHODS: We compiled indicator data on 15 commodities related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) and analyzed them across 75 Countdown to 2015 countries from eight regions to identify problems with specific commodities and determinants of access. The determinants related to policy, regulatory environment, financing, pharmaceutical procurement and supply chain, and information systems. We mapped commodity information from four datasets from the World Health Organization and the United Nation's Commission on Life Saving Commodities creating a stoplight dashboard to illustrate countries' environment to assure access. We also developed a dashboard for policy and systems indicators for select countries. RESULTS: The commodities we identified as having the fewest barriers to access had been in use longer, including oral rehydration solution and oxytocin injection. Looking across the different systems and policy determinants of access, only Zimbabwe had all 15 commodities on both its essential medicines list and in its standard treatment guidelines, and only Cameroon and Zambia had at least one product registered for each commodity. Senegal alone procured all tracer commodities centrally in the previous year, and 70% of responding countries had costed plans for maternal, newborn, and child health. No country reported recent stock-outs of all the 15 commodities at the central level-countries always had some of the 15 commodities available; however, products with frequent stock-outs included misoprostol, calcium gluconate, penicillin injections, ceftriaxone, and amoxicillin dispersible tablets. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis highlights country deficiencies in policies and systems, such as incoherent policy guidelines, problems in product registration, lack of logistics data, and central-level stock-outs that may affect access to essential RMNCH commodities. To tackle these deficiencies, countries need to integrate commodity-related indicators into other health monitoring activities to improve service quality."
6481664,1,a,"Psychosocial outcome in terms of mental state, health preoccupation, leisure activity, avoidance behaviour, sexual activity and attitude towards life and the future one year after a myocardial infarction (MI) was studied in 177 consecutive male, able-bodied patients below 61 yr of age with a first MI. Questionnaires and a brief interview covered the psychological and social data while the somatic variables were recorded in a standardized medical examination. Emotional distress, self-reported symptoms, avoidance behaviour, overprotection, pessimism and a diminished sexual activity were frequent, indicating a poor adaptation. These disturbances were apparent two months after the MI and remained stable. Psychological factors were stronger determinants of maladjustment than smoking, angina pectoris and recorded somatic illness. Neither severity of the infarction nor social and demographic factors determined maladjustment. Intervention must take place early and be directed to psychological factors as well as to the cardiac condition."
24971295,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is one of the most common life threatening diseases all over the world, in particular in Asian countries, and tobacco and alcohol are considered to be the most potent risk factors for oral cancer. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the combined effect of smoking types and alcohol consumption on the development of oral cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case-control study of 350 cases and 350 controls over a period of 19 months in the time period between February 2005 and September 2006 was carried out in Pune, India. The self-reported information about their consumption of alcohol and smoking behaviors was collected by structured questionnaires. The data was analyzed by SPSS software package. Risk analysis was performed using conditional logistic regression, which provides results in the form of crude odd ratios. RESULTS: The smoking as well as alcohol drinking rates in the subjects of the case group were signi fi cantly higher than the controls. Of smoking types, bidi (a hand rolled cigarette) (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.4-6.9), and among alcohol types, hard liquor (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1. 4-6.4), country liquor (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3-3.6) and beer (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-5.0), showed a strong association with oral cancer. A significant interaction effect was found between alcohol consumption and bidi smoking (OR = 19.6, 95% CI = 4.6-83.5) followed by alcohol and non-filtered cigarette (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.8-12.0) as well as filtered-cigarette (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.1-5.0). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that oral cancer is etiologically related to the interaction between smoking and drinking."
31093127,0,a,"Objective: To determine the association between teenage pregnancy and socioeconomic factors and to estimate social inequalities among adolescents in Mexico in 2015. Methods: A study involving women from 15 to 19 years of age was conducted using data from birth records for 2015. The fertility rate was determined and disaggregated by quintiles for each socioeconomic variable. Absolute and relative measures of inequality were estimated; negative binomial regression analysis was used to obtain risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: The fertility rate was 73.21 births per 1000 women between the ages of 15 and 19 years in Mexico. Coahuila was the state with the highest birth rate (99.3 per 1000 adolescents). A statistically significant association was found between fertility rate and the gap in access to health services, especially in quintile 5 (risk ratio [RR] = 45.68), whereas a greater association with the gap in education was found in quintile 4 (RR = 27.36). No significant differences were found in terms of the gap in access to social security. Conclusions: Marginalization and poverty are significantly associated with teenage pregnancy and fertility rate. However, wide inequalities exist among the different social groups, making it necessary to implement actions geared towards promoting measures to improve the social, political, and economic environment."
24601909,0,a,"In three experimental studies, with managers and students as participants, we explore in this paper the relation between two kinds of responsibility judgments, called Responsibility 1 (R1) and Responsibility 2 (R2). Decision makers can be viewed as being more or less responsible for their choice and its consequences (R1). Their actions can also be evaluated, from a normative point of view, as instances of more or less responsible behavior (R2). Experiment 1 showed that managers who depart from the default or ""normal"" course of action, by choosing a new (versus familiar) alternative, changing (versus sticking to) an initial decision, or going against (versus following) the advice of a management team, are rated as more responsible (R1) for the outcomes of their decision. At the same time, they are perceived to act in a less responsible way (R2). Experiment 2 compared decision makers choosing between more or less risky options. High risk takers were held more responsible (R1) for their choice and for its consequences, but were again viewed as behaving in a less responsible way (R2) than low risk takers. In Experiment 3, participants judged decision makers who followed or opposed others' advice by choosing either a high or a low risk option. Opposing others' advice led to higher R1 and lower R2 scores, especially when choosing the high risk option, moderated by outcome (successful decisions appearing more responsible than those that went wrong). Thus R1 and R2 judgments should be distinguished as having different and sometimes even opposite determinants."
25147780,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Patients, who survived from shotgun injuries, often have some retained lead pellets in their bodies. Several cases of lead toxicity have been reported regarding these patients. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to compare the serum lead level in patients who have retained lead pellets in their bodies with the control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, we gathered the serum lead levels of 25 patients with some retained lead pellets in their bodies due to shotgun and 25 volunteers without similar lead exposure and compared them in view of the age, gender, and living place. RESULTS: While the mean serum lead level in both groups was lower than the standard level (i.e. 40 microg/dL) , the mean +/- SD of serum lead level were 29 +/- 12.8 microg/dL and 25.3 +/- 6.4 microg/dL in the case and control groups, respectively without any significant difference (P = 0. 30) . However, a positive relationship was seen between serum lead level, and the number of retained lead pellets (r = 0.447, P = 0. 025) . CONCLUSIONS: Although extensive surgery to remove the lead pellets is not recommended in patients injured with shotguns, those with many retained lead pellets in their bodies should be considered at risk for lead poisoning and monitored carefully."
3788206,1,a,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."
29228977,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A conceptual model approach to clarify the elements of health-related quality of life (HRQL), their determinants and causal pathways is needed to aid researchers, health practitioners and policy makers in their bid to improve HRQL outcomes in patients. The aim of this systematic review was to appraise empirical evidence on the performance of the Wilson and Cleary Model of HRQL. METHODS: We conducted a search of MEDLINE, Science Direct, PsyARTICLES and CINAHL databases to identify articles that used Wilson and Cleary model to examine HRQL in chronic diseases. A narrative synthesis was employed in the review of the articles. RESULTS: Evidence supports linkages between adjacent concepts and between non-adjacent concepts of the Wilson and Cleary model indicating that in practice there is a need to examine relationships among constructs - or to consider interventions in terms of - both with and without mediators. Symptoms status has the highest magnitude of relative impact on health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: The Wilson and Cleary model demonstrated good features suitable for evaluating health-related quality of life in chronic diseases."
31968907,1,a,"Results of a long-term field study on the ecology and social organization of two groups of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in Peru are reported. Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets provide insight into some of the proximate determinants of fission-fusion social organization in this species and illustrate the different strategies used by males and females to gain access to critical resources. Longitudinal data on known individuals provide evidence for male natal philopatry and female emigration at sexual maturity in this population. Interbirth intervals are long (mean = 34.5 months) in comparison with most other primate species, and 5 of 15 infants seen within a few days of birth died or disappeared before they were a year old. Home ranges are large (150-250 ha) and fairly discrete; overlap with neighboring groups is on the order of 10-15%. Males and females differed substantially in their ranging patterns; females, particularly those with infants, restricted much of their ranging to a ""core area"" 20-33% the size of the total group range, whereas males ranged more evenly over the entire area occupied by the group. Daily path length varied over almost an order of magnitude from 465 m to 4,070 m, with a mean of 1977 m. Males spent more time traveling and less time feeding than most females. These results are compared with those obtained in previous studies of Ateles and with similar data from other primate species to assess their implications for the evolution of fission-fusion sociality in spider monkeys. The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of very similar social organizations in spider monkeys and chimpanzees are discussed."
29239799,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Demographic, physical and psychological associations of successful aging (SA) have been evaluated, but occupational factors have not. Nor has SA been evaluated in a specific occupational group. The aims of this study were to examine the occupational associations of SA in older physicians, and to explore the concept of occupational SA. METHODS: Physicians aged 55+ years completed self-ratings of occupational and personal SA on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS; 1 being ""least successful"" and 10 ""most successful""). Associations between occupational and personal SA (defined as 8-10 on the VAS), respectively, and demographic and practice characteristics; health; social and financial resources; cognitive, emotional and motivational resources; work centrality; and anxiety about aging were examined. RESULTS: Rates of occupational SA (69.2%; 95% CI: 66.3-72.0) were significantly higher than personal SA (63.1%; 95% CI: 60.1-66.0) in the sample of 1,048 physicians. Occupational and personal SA were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.73, N = 1,041, p < 0.001). Personal SA was predicted by demographic (older age, female, international medical graduate, urban practice), physical (better self-rated health), psychological (less depression, better cognitive, emotional and motivational resources, and greater anxiety about aging), and occupational (higher work centrality, fewer practice adaptations and not intending to retire) factors. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational factors are central to physicians' self-conceptualization of SA. That greater work centrality, fewer work adaptations and less retirement planning were associated with personal SA suggests older physicians' sense of ""success"" is intertwined with continuing practice. There is a need for educating physicians to adapt to aging and retirement."
7214067,1,a,Social and audiometric characteristics of the hearing-impaired elderly without aids have been analysed and some understanding developed of the factors which lead people to seek rehabilitation. The two major single determinants of seeking help were found to be severity of impairment and onset of deafness before reaching retirement age. There were strong indications that negative attitudes of both the elderly themselves and their general practitioners towards deafness and ageing played a crucial part in perpetuating the neglect of the disorder.
3820141,1,a,"Thirty one married men, under 65 yr of age, who were admitted to hospital with a suspected myocardial infarction, were interviewed on four occasions over six months. The patients' social and psychological responses during the course of his rehabilitation were elicited using a semistructured interview schedule. Determinants of outcome were assessed using multiple regression analysis. Return to work, exercise, leisure and sexual activity were all strongly influenced by somatic symptoms of chest pain, breathlessness, and tiredness. Lack of depression, not smoking, and support from the family doctor were important contributors to successful rehabilitation. Cardiac damage sustained at the time of admission did not appear to have any consistent influence on outcome. Half of the smokers had not resumed their habit at six months. Fewer men were working at six months than on admission. Somatic symptoms, anxiety and depression were considerable."
2926701,1,a,"This study used a subsample of 543 married couples from a large group of families in Utah, who were originally studied to assess the genetic and environmental determinants of hypertension. Excluding individuals on medication and controlling for the major risk factors for hypertension, evidence was obtained for cross-spouse blood pressure associations equal in magnitude to self-psychosocial and demographic measures. Observed spouse-spouse similarity for blood pressures remained significant after adjustment for shared psychological factors. It is speculated that different aspects of each spouse's nonmarital environments (e.g. work, social support) have differential impacts on the marital environment and on physiologic indicators of health."
3817461,1,a,"The authors attempt to understand the nature of denial of illness by an examination of two patients with serious and disfiguring physical disorders who postponed medical treatment for over a decade. Both patients subsequently had dramatic negative reactions to the therapeutic efforts of physicians caring for them. Various social, experiential, and characterologic determinants are discussed. In addition, the authors argue that the illness served important organizing functions: it sheltered these patients from the exigencies of everyday life; it allowed them to defeat the physician's efforts to effect a cure; and, finally, the disfigured physical state appeared to correspond to their internalized defective self-image and self-esteem."
27247652,0,a,"Obedience and disobedience have always been salient issues for both civil society and social psychologists. Since Milgram's first studies on destructive obedience there has not been a bottom-up definition of what obedience and disobedience mean. The current study aimed at investigating the social representations young adults use to define and to co-construct knowledge about obedience and disobedience in Austria. One hundred fifty four (106 females, 68.8%) Austrian young adults (Mean age = 22.9; SD = 3.5) completed a mixed-method questionnaire comprising open-ended questions and free word associations. Overall obedience and disobedience are respectively defined as conformity and non-conformity to regulations, ranging from implicit social norms to explicit formal laws. Authority is multi-faceted and has a central role in orienting obedience and disobedience. Further fundamental determinants of the authority relationship and relevant application of the results are discussed in this paper."

Thus, this study tried to assess pre-marital sexual debut and factors associated with it among in-school adolescents in Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional school-based study was conducted using a facilitator guided selfadministered questionnaire. Respondents were students attending regular school classes in fourteen high schools. The proportion of adolescents involved in pre-marital sexual debut and the mean age at sexual debut was computed. Factors associated with pre-marital sexual debut were assessed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: About one in four, 686 (24.8%) never married in-school adolescent respondents reported pre-marital sexual debut of these 28.8% were males and 14.7% were females (p < 0.001). Pre-marital sexual debut was more common among adolescents who had their parents in urban areas (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 1.42 [1.17-1.73]), who received higher pocket money per month (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 1.56 [1.19-2.04]), who perceived low self-educational rank (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 1.89 [1.07-3.34]) and who lived in rented houses (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 1.32 [1.03-1.70]). The females and those who were less influenced by external pressure were more protected against pre-marital sexual debut (Adjusted OR and [95% CI] = 0.44 [0.35-0.56; 0.62 [0.52-0.74, respectively]) than their counterparts. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of in-school adolescents were engaged in sexual relationship. Thus, public health interventions should consider the broader determinants of premarital sexual debut, including the ecological factors in which the behavior occurs."
2768294,1,a,"A life table analysis is made of the duration of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea in Orissa, India, taking one variable at a time using data from a baseline survey of fertility and mortality (BSFM) conducted on the lines of the World Fertility Survey. Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age. The durations of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea are strongly related."
27397825,0,a,"AIM: The objectives of this study were to describe the medication adherence of Chinese rural patients with hypertension and to investigate the factors associated with medication adherence. BACKGROUND: Medication adherence and associated factors for patients with hypertension have been widely explored in previous studies; however, these studies mainly focused on hypertensive patients in urban areas. More information regarding prevalence and the correlated factors for medication adherence for rural patients with hypertension is needed to better control blood pressure and prevent hypertension-related complications. METHODS: The study was carried out in three township hospitals in Shanxi Province (Northern China). A cross-sectional design was adopted to facilitate the survey of rural patients with hypertension. The sample consisted of 1159 participants from three township hospitals. Demographic and clinical characteristic variables, medication adherence and social support were investigated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test the determinants of adherence. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 21.3% of patients were adherents to medication and that 78.7% of patients were non-adherents. Most of the participants (71.4%) took medication more than three times daily; only 18.2% of patients took one antihypertensive tablet at a time. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the following variables were associated with medication adherence: age, household income, duration of diagnosis, number of antihypertensive tablets taken in each dose, daily frequency of taking medication, and social support. CONCLUSION: The medication adherence of Chinese rural patients with hypertension is suboptimal. Close attention and effective strategies targeting these patients are necessary; healthcare programs should be designed according to the factors affecting medication adherence."
29780586,0,a,"Objectives: This study evaluates social, behavioral, and environmental determinants to differentiate between active and inactive asthma and how predisposing, enabling, and need factors elucidate asthma-related health services and asthma control among women in Puerto Rico. Methods: This study analyzed secondary cross-sectional data from a subsample of 625 adult females who participated in the Asthma Call Back Survey in Puerto Rico. Logistic and multinomial regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between explanatory variables and asthma outcomes. Results: In total, 63% of women reported active asthma, from which 37.9% have not well controlled or very poorly controlled asthma. Women with active asthma were significantly more likely to be out of work, have middle income (US$25,000-<US$35,000), and be obese (>/=30 kg/m(2)). Perceived need of health status is a good predictor to know the odds ratio of women to use emergency room. Women with poorly controlled asthma were significantly associated with increased units of physician urgent visits and emergency room visits. Conclusion: The findings confirmed significant determinants for active asthma and adds information on odds ratio for sensitive subgroups that utilize asthma-related health services in higher proportion than their counterparts. These associations suggest a development of asthma management plan targeting women to control the condition and reduce health-care utilization."
3662409,1,a,"The primary purpose for identifying psychosocial risk factors is to prevent disease and disease complications. For 30 years, we have been doing research in this field and have been successful in identifying such risk factors as Type A behavior, social isolation, stressful life events, and various psychological patterns. However, our success in using this information to help prevent disease has been much more limited. One reason for this limited success is that we have focused virtually all of our attention on the study of individuals and almost no attention on the social environment within which people live. There are two major limitations of such a one-to-one approach: it is difficult for people to change their behavior and their life situation and even if some people do change, others enter the ""at risk"" population because no action has been taken to change those forces in society that stimulated the problem in the first place. In discussing the social determinants of disease, it is important that we develop a new approach that permits us to study not only individuals but also the social environment. An example of this approach is provided by researchers who were successful in preventing infectious diseases. The work of these researchers focused not on clinical entities or on individuals but on the environment. This resulted in a disease classification system that included concepts such as air-borne, food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases. We have no such system for the study of non-infectious diseases. Considerable data already are available to help us to think about such a new classification system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
24441832,0,a,"Limited data on smoking prevalence allowing valid between-country comparison are available in Europe. The aim of this study is to provide data on smoking prevalence and its determinants in 18 European countries. In 2010, within the Pricing Policies And Control of Tobacco in Europe (PPACTE) project, we conducted a face-to-face survey on smoking in 18 European countries (Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, England, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden) on a total of 18 056 participants, representative for each country of the population aged 15 years or older. Overall, 27.2% of the participants were current smokers (30.6% of men and 24.1% of women). Smoking prevalence was highest in Bulgaria (40.9%) and Greece (38.9%) and lowest in Italy (22.0%) and Sweden (16.3%). Smoking prevalence ranged between 15.7% (Sweden) and 44.3% (Bulgaria) for men and between 11.6% (Albania) and 38.1% (Ireland) for women. Multivariate analysis showed a significant inverse trend between smoking prevalence and the level of education in both sexes. Male-to-female smoking prevalence ratios ranged from 0.85 in Spain to 3.47 in Albania and current-to-ex prevalence ratios ranged from 0.68 in Sweden to 4.28 in Albania. There are considerable differences across Europe in smoking prevalence, and male-to-female and current-to-ex smoking prevalence ratios. Eastern European countries, lower income countries and those with less advanced tobacco control policies have less favourable smoking patterns and are at an earlier stage of the tobacco epidemic."
6486251,1,a,"On the basis of Western studies suggesting that infants with difficult temperaments are at greater risk for behavioral and physical disorders, the author postulated that Masai infants with difficult temperaments would be at greater risk in the harsh environment created by the sub-Saharan drought in 1974, which disrupted the life of the Masai people of East Africa and resulted in increased infant mortality. Two groups of infants with difficult and easy temperaments were defined and followed. Contrary to expectations, mortality was greater for the infants with easy temperaments. The infant's contribution, child-rearing orientation, and feeding practices were factors influencing survival."
10301136,1,a,"The mid-1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe--and other parts of the world--a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches."
6656327,1,a,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension."

People and their health are key elements of any health care system and are important for successful social and economic development."
23173332,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Self-rated health is a one-point measure commonly used for recognising subjectively perceived health and covering a wide range of individual's health aspects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine the extent to which self-rated health reflects the differences due to demographic characteristics, physical, psychical and social well-being, health disorders, occurrence of chronic disease and negative life events in Polish social and cultural conditions. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data were collected by non-addressed questionnaire methods from 402 Warsaw inhabitants. The questionnaire contained the questions concerning self-rated health, physical, psychical and social well-being, the use of health care services, occurrence of chronic disease and contact with negative life events. RESULTS: The analysis showed that worse self-rated health increased exponentially with age and less sharply with lower level of education. Pensioners were more likely to assess their own health worse then employed or students. Such difference was not found for unemployed. Compared to married, the self-rated health of divorced or widowed respondents was lower. Gender does not differentiate self-rated health. In regard to well-being, self-rated health linearly decreased for physical well-being, for social and, especially, for psychical well-being the differences were significant, but more complicated. Hospitalisation, especially repeated, strongly determined worse self-rated health. In contrast, relationship between self-rated health and sickness absence or frequency of contact with physician were lower. Chronic diseases substantially increased the risk of poorer self-rated health, and their co-morbidity increased the risk exponentially. The patients with cancer were the group, in which the risk several times exceeded that reported for the patients of other diseases. Regarding negative life events, only experience with violence and financial difficulties were resulted in worse self-rated health. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the usefulness of self-rated health for public health research."
7326949,1,a,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points."
27090246,0,a,"BACKGROUND: According to existing research, unemployment is related to health problems. The causal relationship is not yet fully understood. This secondary data analysis aims to study the interdependencies between unemployment and health. METHODS: This study is based on data from the German Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) panel study comprising a sample of beneficiaries of the Federal Employment Agency and their household members as well as a representative household sample. A total of 12,570 persons (aged 15 to 64 years) from 8,392 households were interviewed in wave 7 (2013) of PASS. RESULTS: The employed and unemployed differ substantially in terms of socio-demographic and health-related characteristics. Unemployed persons more often report worse or bad self-rated health (unemployed men: 31.0 % vs. employed men: 14.0 %; unemployed women: 37.7 % vs. employed women: 21.7 %) and feel being rather or much impaired by mental problems (unemployed men: 21.9 % vs. employed men: 7.2 %; unemployed women: 20.4 % vs. employed women: 15.8 %). For the unemployed, the proportion with an officially certified severe disability as well as another severe health impairment is much higher. They also more often report at least one hospital stay in the previous 12 months (unemployed men: 16.3 % vs. employed men: 9.9 %; unemployed women: 19.6 % vs. employed women: 12.2 %) and more contacts with physicians. In spite of that, unemployed persons do less exercise. Multivariate, longitudinal, logistic regression models demonstrate strong health-related selection effects on labour market transitions. Lower self-rated health is associated with a higher unemployment risk for employed persons as well as a lower probability of reintegration for unemployed persons. The most influential determinants of bad self-rated health are self-rated health status in the year before, while job loss and re-employment tend to influence the occurrence of bad self-rated health. DISCUSSION: The analyses show substantial health disparities to the detriment of the unemployed. They also refer to a need for prevention regarding healthcare and employment."
31794294,0,a,"In May 2019, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services warned that ""around one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction."" In September 2019, Naomi Klein, an astute writer on environmental change, described the interconnected social and ecological breakdowns on the planet in a new book. Ecological crises noted by these and other scholars speak well to the rise of planetary health as a new scholarship. Loss of biodiversity has manifold negative impacts on health, for example, rise of zoonotic infections and changes in healthy microbiome. But reducing our ecological footprints is not enough. We ought to change mindsets, the narrow science, and technology governance regimes that value nature and other life forms instrumentally by their usefulness to us. I describe three new, broader and critically informed, frames on governance for planetary health. First, I explain why we ought to acknowledge animal sentience, for example, as recognized in Article 13 of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. I describe how political determinants of health, power, and agency operate at multiple sociological and planetary loci, not only among human beings but also at human and nonhuman animal interfaces. Second, planetary health calls for a shift toward ecological and political determinants beyond a narrow anthropocentric view, while resisting the entrenched dogma of exponential growth with finite planetary natural resources. Third, for critically informed governance of emerging technologies in planetary health (e.g., glycomics, artificial intelligence, health care robots), I refer to a question highlighted recently (Frodeman, 2019): ""When Plato (more exactly, Juvenal) asked who guards the guardians, he was questioning whether any group can be trusted to look past its own interests for the common good."" Hence, it is time we broaden the question ""Who will guard the guardians?"" beyond the scientific community, to actors in science policy as well. Policy questions cannot be limited to ""which social issues emerge from a new technology?"" but ought to include, ""who should be framing science and technology policy, and why?"" Youth leaders of the global climate movement such as Greta Thunberg and others are now rightly asking these epistemological questions that might contribute toward a new social contract on health for all sentient beings on planet Earth. While ecological changes accelerate and a new space industry is emerging, governance for planetary health will continue to be at the epicenter of systems thinking, responsible innovation and science policy in the 21st century."
3434396,1,a,"Past research has indicated significant sex differences in determinants of male and female high school students' status as measured by how subjects would like to have been remembered from their high school years. In order to determine if remembrance preference is sex or gender role related, 671 subjects were administered the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) and a questionnaire asking if they most wanted to be remembered from high school as a brilliant student, leader in activities, athletic star or most popular. Using both the median split and t-ratio procedures in scoring the BSRI, 206 subjects were selected because they were sex-typed (masculine males, feminine females), cross sex-typed (masculine females, feminine males), or androgynous (scoring high on both masculine and feminine traits). To find a model of best fit, the data were subjected to a log-linear analysis. The variables included were sex, gender role, and remembrance preference. Rather than sex being the influential factor, the model of best fit was a gender role by remembrance preference interaction. If subjects were masculine, they were more likely to choose athletic star than were feminine or androgynous subjects. Most popular and leader in activities were both more likely to be chosen by feminine and androgynous subjects. All groups chose brilliant student more often than any other category. It was concluded that some previously designated sex differences may instead be differences in gender role. Further research should address the distinction between the two."
31704765,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: African American (AA) women have reported hair maintenance as a barrier to regular exercise; however, to our knowledge, this study is the first to identify primary care provider thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge regarding hair as a barrier to increased physical activity among AA females. METHODS: A 13-question electronic survey was sent via email to 151 clinicians working within a department of family medicine's 8 ambulatory clinics within a large urban academic medical center. RESULTS: A total of 62 primary care clinicians completed the survey, which is a response rate of 41%. The vast majority of respondents (95%) sometimes/often engage in discussions with AA female patients regarding physical activity. However, 76% of respondents have never included a hairstyling or maintenance assessment in that discussion and only 34% noted being comfortable discussing this topic. Among a list of potential barriers to exercise, hair maintenance/scalp perspiration was rarely endorsed as important by clinicians. DISCUSSION: This study highlights a need for increased education among primary care providers regarding AA hair care and maintenance practices as a barrier to increased physical activity in AA women. If specific barriers to increasing healthy habits among AA women are to be addressed, there must be a baseline knowledge of hair care and maintenance barriers, an understanding of the strong influence of cultural norms and practices as it relates to physical activity and exercise, and an increased comfortability when engaging in difficult cross-cultural conversations to ultimately improve health outcomes in AA females."
7143281,1,a,"Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae. Aspects of coping problems, primarily the disease-related, but also those of intra- and inter-personal nature are discussed."
28258420,0,a,"PURPOSE: Gender-related differences in life expectancy, prevalence of chronic conditions and level of disability in the process of ageing have been broadly described. Less is known about social determinants, which may have different impacts on quality of life in men and women. The investigation aims to reveal gender-related differences in social determinants on quality of life assessed by a multi-pathway model including health, social, demographic and living place characteristics. METHODS: The study group consisted of 5099 participants aged 50+ representing general populations of three different European regions (Finland, Poland, Spain) who participated in COURAGE in EUROPE Project. Standardized tools were used to measure quality of life (WHOQOL-AGE) and social determinants (COURAGE Social Network Index, OSLO-3 Social Support Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale, participation scale and trust). A multipath model considering exogenous predictors (demographic, economic), mediators (social) and endogenous outcome (QOL) was created to reveal the role of determinants. Gender-related differences were investigated across three age categories: 50-64; 65-79 and 80+. RESULTS: The model (RMSEA = 0.058; CFI = 0.939) showed the effects of all of the investigated determinants. Gender-related differences in the association between social constructs and QOL were observed for social networks in the group of 80+, for social support in the group of 50-64 and 65-79 years, and for social participation in the group of 65-79 years. Males benefited more (in QOL) from social networks and social support, and women from social participation. CONCLUSIONS: The research provides valuable knowledge about the role of social determinants in QOL considering complex relations between different social constructs. Additionally, the results showed gender-related differences in the associations between social networks, social support, social participation and QOL, suggesting that men might benefit more from the interventions in the first two. Although our research did not investigate the effects of interventions, the results show directions for future investigations, how to shape social interventions at the population level to improve quality of life of older adults, and thus help achieve successful ageing."
28065479,0,a,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several genome-wide-association-studies have identified genetic variants in a region on chromosome 9p21 that are associated with an increased risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Here we have explored the interaction of a genetic variant of the CDKN2A/B-rs10811661 gene locus with cardiovascular risk factors and environmental-exposures (e.g., diet and physical activity) in 1165 individuals recruited from the Mashhad-Stroke and Heart-Atherosclerotic-Disorders cohort. METHODS: Genotyping was carried out using TaqMan-real-time-PCR based method. The association of CDKN2A/B-rs10811661 locus and its interaction with dietary intake in association with the main determinants of dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular-risk-factors were assessed in 2 cohorts. RESULTS: Our data showed that obese subjects with a TT genotype had a higher level of TG, TG/HDL ratio and Hs-CRP, compared to the subjects with the wild type genotype, or individuals with a normal BMI. Moreover, the presence of a TT genotype was associated with increased risk of hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance and CVD. These effects were more pronounced in the sub-group with low physical activity and a high dietary energy intake (e.g., the interaction between TT genotype and total energy intake on serum cholesterol was positive (RERI: 0.2, 95%CI (-0.96-1.3), AP: 0.1, 95%CI (-0.5-0.7) and SI: 1.2, 95%CI (0.3-5.1))). CONCLUSIONS: We have found a significant association between the CDKN2A-rs10811661 polymorphism with cardiovascular risk factors and dyslipidemia in a non-diabetic population. It is possible that a low energy diet and high physical activity could ameliorate the unfavorable effects of T allele of CDKN2A/B locus. Functional analysis is warranted to investigate the value of this genetic biomarker of CVD risk in obese people."
3723341,1,a,"We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report."
27348099,0,a,"Spaces that encourage better health are increasingly seen as key to reducing the burden of chronic disease: many larger Canadian public health departments now include built environment (BE) teams, which work with municipalities and land use planners to promote and/or require the development of health-encouraging spaces. In many public health agencies, it is environmental health practitioners who have assumed the new healthy BE role, but at what cost to existing mandates? We argue that reinventing roles to increase BE capacities within environmental health practice would reinforce health protection mandates while building capacity in chronic disease prevention. Significant expansion into the design of healthier built environments may require some reallocation of resources. However, we anticipate that healthier built environments will reduce threats to health and so lessen the need for conventional health protection, while encouraging activities and behaviours that lead to greater population wellness."
3989430,1,a,"The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats."

29487163,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As a distinct group, 2- to 5-year-olds with severe obesity (SO) have not been extensively described. As a part of the Expert Exchange Workgroup on Childhood Obesity, nationally-representative data were examined to better characterize children with SO. METHODS: Children ages 2 to 5 (N = 7028) from NHANES (1999-2014) were classified as having normal weight, overweight, obesity, or SO (BMI >/=120% of 95th percentile). Sociodemographics, birth characteristics, screen time, total energy, and Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores were evaluated. Multinomial logistic and linear regressions were conducted, with normal weight as the referent. RESULTS: The prevalence of SO was 2.1%. Children with SO had higher (unadjusted) odds of being a racial and/or ethnic minority (African American: odds ratio [OR]: 1.7; Hispanic: OR: 2.3). They were from households with lower educational attainment (OR: 2.4), that were single-parent headed (OR: 2.0), and that were in poverty (OR: 2.1). Having never been breastfed was associated with increased odds of obesity (OR: 1.5) and higher odds of SO (OR: 1.9). Odds of >4 hours of screen time were 1.5 and 2.0 for children with obesity and SO. Energy intake and Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores were not significantly different in children with SO. CONCLUSIONS: Children ages 2 to 5 with SO appear to be more likely to be of a racial and/or ethnic minority and have greater disparities in social determinants of health than their peers and are more than twice as likely to engage in double the recommended screen time limit."
3585703,1,a,"This study examined personal and contextual predictors of active and avoidance coping strategies in a community sample of over 400 adults and in a sample of over 400 persons entering psychiatric treatment for unipolar depression. Sociodemographic factors of education and income (except for active-cognitive coping), personality dispositions of self-confidence and an easy-going manner, and contextual factors of negative life events and family support each made a significant incremental contribution to predicting active and avoidance coping. Among both healthy adults and patients, active and avoidance coping were positively associated with negative life events. Individuals who had more personal and environmental resources were more likely to rely on active coping and less likely to use avoidance coping. Moreover, for both groups, most of the predictors continued to show significant relations with active and avoidance coping strategies even after the stable component in coping was controlled in a longitudinal design. A comprehensive framework to understand the determinants of coping can be of practical value in suggesting points for therapeutic interventions aimed at fostering more adaptive coping efforts."

Based on the information from a mailed questionnaire sent to all incident diabetic children and for each diabetic child - two referent children matched according to age, sex, and county, we have analysed perinatal events and aspects of the social environment as possible risk factors for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in childhood. A significantly larger proportion of the mothers of the diabetic children were older than 40 years compared to those of the referent children (33% and 24%, p = 0.01 respectively). A smaller percentage of mothers of the diabetic children had a high educational level compared to mothers of referent children (10% and 15%, p = 0.03 respectively) and 39% of the fathers of the diabetic children were manual workers compared to 31% of the fathers of referent children (p = 0.03). Perinatal events did not differ between diabetic and referent children. In children 0-6 years, the duration of breast-feeding was significantly shorter in diabetic children than among referent children (median duration for diabetic children 5 months compared to 6 months for referent children p = 0.03). When considering the presence of Type 1 diabetes among relatives, maternal age over 40 years, low educational level of the mother, and the father being a manual worker as risk factors, the presence of 1 to 4 of any of these risk factors increased the relative risk for Type 1 diabetes cumulatively from 1.2-7.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3210110,1,a,"A prospective study was conducted to determine the effects of maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy on the birth weight of fetuses in an unselected study population. Several confounding factors were taken into account. The main factors associated with an increase of birth weight of both sexes were gestational age at birth and parity. Both maternal smoking and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy had the effect of decreasing the birth weight of female fetuses, whereas smoking, but not alcohol, had a decreasing effect on birth weight of male and female fetuses."
3205187,1,a,"A comparison of first-year medical students' attitudes to social issues in medicine with attitudes of non-medical first-year students in 1983 found that the medical group was less conservative towards general social issues but more conservative in relation to those areas which closely affect the doctor's role, particularly the place of allied health professions and government intervention in health care. This paper reports a follow-up study of the same groups of students when they had reached senior years in their respective courses. While medical student conservatism on general social issues continues to be no greater than other student groups there is a marked increase in conservatism of attitudes towards government involvement in health care and regulation of costs. Attitudes to allied health professions and preventive care remain unchanged but senior medical students are significantly less likely to recognize social factors as determinants of illness than they were when they commenced the study of medicine. Specific curricular attention to social and behavioural medicine does not appear to counteract the predominantly biomedical perspective students experience in teaching hospitals, the major venue for their clinical education."
30090819,0,a,"Objective: To investigate the epidemiological aspects of all-cause injuries in Hamadan province during a 6-year period. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on injured subjects admitted to private or governmental hospitals in Hamadan province during March 2009 to March 2015. The epidemiological characteristics were retrieved from a registry-based system including gender, residency, injury mechanism and date of injury occurrence, outcome of hospitalization (full recovery/disability/death). Results: Totally, 135,925 hospitalized injured cases were recorded. The majority of cases were male (72.6%) and were occurred in urban areas (60%), about 40% of patients were in 20-34 years' age group, and the highest proportion (30.13%) of injuries occurred in summer. Logistic regression showed that the odds of disability vs. recovery was significantly higher in rural areas [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =3.42] and the odds of death vs. recovery was higher among male gender (AOR=1.46). In addition, comparing to the 0-4-year age-group, odds of death were significantly higher in middle aged and elderly victims. Conclusion: Our findings showed that middle age groups, male gender and urban area increase the odds of death. Injured males and old age subjects had the highest odds of death and out of residential area injuries were common cause of leading death injuries."
28486959,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies on alcohol consumption in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and determinants of alcohol consumption in rural western Kenya. The study was conducted as a preliminary stage of a community-based intervention to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 478 participants aged 18-65 years residing in Ikolomani Sub-county, Kakamega County was conducted in April 2015. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. We defined current drinkers as participants who consumed any alcoholic product in the preceding one month, and hazardous/high-risk drinkers as participants with an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 8 and above. We summarised data using descriptive statistics and used logistic regression to explore for the correlates of each of current alcohol consumption and hazardous/high-risk alcohol consumption. RESULTS: The sex-standardized prevalence of current alcohol drinkers was 31.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 26.8%-37.2%). The prevalence was higher in men (54.6%) than in women (8.9%). The mean AUDIT score among current drinkers was 16.9 (SD 8.2) and the sex-standardized prevalence of hazardous/high-risk alcohol drinking was 28.7% (95% CI: 24.1%-34.0%). Traditional brews were the most commonly consumed types of alcohol and most drinkers took alcohol in the homes of alcohol sellers/brewers. In multivariate analyses, the number of drinkers in the family, the number of friends who are drinkers and the attitude towards alcohol intake were positively associated with current alcohol drinking status, and with hazardous/high-risk alcohol consumption. Women were less likely to be current drinkers and hazardous/high-risk drinkers than were men. Other socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of alcohol consumption in the study area was higher than the national level estimate of 13.3%. The results suggest that the social environment is the main determinant of alcohol consumption in this setting. These findings imply that interventions to mitigate alcohol consumption in this area will have to target the social networks of the alcohol consumers, change the drinkers' attitude towards alcohol, and tackle the issue of availability of unlicensed homemade brews."

31137811,0,a,"The aims of the study were: (1) compare sociodemographic characteristics among active tuberculosis (TB) cases and their household contacts in cold and hot spot transmission areas, and (2) quantify the influence of locality, genotype and potential determinants on the rates of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among household contacts of index TB cases. Parallel case-contact studies were conducted in two geographic areas classified as ""cold"" and ""hot"" spots based on TB notification and spatial clustering between January and June 2018 in Guangxi, China, using data from field contact investigations, whole genome sequencing, tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), and chest radiographs. Beijing family strains accounted for 64.6% of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains transmitted in hot spots, and 50.7% in cold spots (p-value = 0.02). The positive TST rate in hot spot areas was significantly higher than that observed in cold spot areas (p-value < 0.01). Living in hot spots (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.75, 95%, confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 2.50), Beijing family genotype (aOR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.81), living in the same room with an index case (aOR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.49), travelling time from home to a medical facility (aOR = 4.78, 95% CI: 2.96, 7.72), history of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination (aOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.13 3.62), and delay in diagnosis (aOR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.13, 5.80) were significantly associated with positive TST results among household contacts of TB cases. The findings of this study confirmed the strong transmissibility of the Beijing genotype family strains and this genotype's important role in household transmission. We found that an extended traveling time from home to the medical facility was an important socioeconomic factor for Mtb transmission in the family. It is still necessary to improve the medical facility infrastructure and management, especially in areas with a high TB prevalence."
26546016,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To examine socioeconomic and health system determinants of wealth-related inequalities in neonatal mortality rates (NMR) across 48 low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2012. Absolute and relative inequalities for NMR and coverage of antenatal care, facility-based delivery, and Caesarean delivery were measured using the Slope Index of Inequality and Relative Index of Inequality, respectively. Meta-regression was used to assess whether variation in the magnitude of NMR inequalities was associated with inequalities in coverage of maternal health services, and whether country-level economic and health system factors were associated with mean NMR and socioeconomic inequality in NMR. RESULTS: Of the three maternal health service indicators examined, the magnitude of socioeconomic inequality in NMR was most strongly related to inequalities in antenatal care. NMR inequality was greatest in countries with higher out-of-pocket health expenditures, more doctors per capita, and a higher adolescent fertility rate. Determinants of lower mean NMR (e.g., higher government health expenditures and a greater number of nurses/midwives per capita) differed from factors associated with lower NMR inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the financial burden of maternal health services and achieving universal coverage of antenatal care may contribute to a reduction in socioeconomic differences in NMR. Further investigation of the mechanisms contributing to these cross-national associations seems warranted."
2773911,1,a,"This study investigates the association of wartime stress variables and coronary artery disease as determined by coronary angiography in Lebanon in 1986, a country with an ongoing civil war for over a decade. A total of 127 patients who underwent coronary angiography at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were individually matched on age and sex with visitor controls free from any evidence of clinical coronary artery disease. Arteriographic cases (greater than or equal to 70% maximal stenosis) were compared with two control groups: arteriographic controls (entirely normal coronaries) and visitor controls. Findings suggest that there is a relation between exposure to both acute and chronic war events and coronary artery disease in this patient population. The reporting of exposure to acute war events was significantly higher in cases compared with both visitor controls (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.17-4.90) and arteriographic controls (OR = 2.8, 95% Cl 0.93-8.47). Crossing the ""green-lines"" that separate two belligerent sides, considered as an attribute of war-related chronic stress, was more frequent in cases compared with visitor controls (OR = 3.25, 95% Cl 1.54-6.89) and arteriographic controls (OR = 5.38, 95% Cl 1.65-17.6). The relation observed between wartime stress and coronary artery disease could not be explained by possible overreporting of stressful events in patients with suspected coronary artery disease or by an increase in clinical awareness for the disease for those under continuous stress. Adjusting for the effect of the well-established coronary artery disease risk factors did not alter the above findings."
31777854,0,a,"Objectives: The development of teeth is affected by genetic and environmental factors. Amoxicillin is a widely prescribed semi-synthetic antibiotic. Its most frequent side effects are gastrointestinal disorders and hypersensitivity reactions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect produced by amoxicillin administration on dental enamel and dentin in Wistar rats. Materials and Methods: Twelve pregnant adult Wistar rats were equally divided into four different groups. Negative controls were prescribed with a saline solution. Positive controls were prescribed with tetracycline (130 mg/kg). The other two groups were treated with amoxicillin doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg (every 8 hours), respectively. The treatments were daily administered by oral gavage from the 13th gestation day to the end of gestation. After birth, the offspring also received the same treatment as their mothers from day one to day twelve. After 24 hours, the newborns were sacrificed, the jaws were dissected, and the first molar teeth were collected. The samples were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution and were histomorphologically and histopathologically observed to determine enamel and dentin abnormalities. Results: The mean ameloblastic layer thickness, enamel thickness, odontoblastic layer thickness, and dentin thickness were significantly different in the tetracycline group and the amoxicillin 50 and 100 mg/kg groups compared to the control group. Also, dentin hypomineralization and vacuolization of the odontoblastic layer were observed in the tetracycline- and amoxicillin-treated groups. Conclusion: This study showed that amoxicillin interferes with amelogenesis and dentinogenesis and reduces enamel and dentin thickness."
26065144,0,a,"UNLABELLED: Summary To maximise successful completion of multi-drug therapy (MDT) and optimise treatment outcomes for people with leprosy, it is vital to understand the relative importance of perceived factors which prevent them from completing the required number of doses in time. OBJECTIVE: To explore personal, family, social, community, attitudinal, practical, geographical, cultural and traditional factors which may influence adherence to treatment, a two-phase study was undertaken comprising issue identification via focus groups, and a ranking exercise via individual interview. STUDY DESIGN: The perspectives of 895 respondents (320 people affected by leprosy who were not able to complete treatment, 302 of their 'operational heads of family', and 273 of their nearby community members) across four states of India namely i.e. Andhra Pradesh (Salur), Chhattisgarh (Chandkhuri), Maharashtra (Kothara) and Uttar Pradesh (Barabanki) were collected, using a checklist interview method. RESULTS: Findings suggest that seeing positive changes in their symptoms as well as not seeing improvement can lead to non-completion of MDT. Problems with scheduling and travel expenses were also key issues. Better management of the expectations of people affected by leprosy and reducing the burden of treatment may be important strategies. The importance of stigma and poverty were noted through a number of issues, none of which were particularly highly ranked. CONCLUSIONS: The nature and diversity of perceived issues identified across respondent type and particularly region, suggest that the determinants of adherence are complex and multi-factorial. More community based approaches with greater coordination at the community level are recommended."
31699030,0,a,"BACKGROUND: There is a controversy about the association between vitamin D and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The effect of serum 25-OH-vitD on the risk of CVDs was evaluated. METHODS: Major electronic databases including Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed were searched. All prospective cohort studies on the relationship between vitamin D status and CVDs conducted between April 2000 and September 2017 were included, regardless language. The study participants were evaluated regardless of their age, sex, and ethnicity. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. Two investigators independently selected the studies and extracted the data. The designated effects were risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR). The random effects model was used to combine the results. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 25 studies with 10,099 cases of CVDs was performed. In general, a decrease in the level of vitamin D was associated with a higher relative risk of CVDs (incidence-mortality combined) (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.24-1.69). This accounts for 54% of CVDs mortality rate (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.29-1.84(. However, no significant relationship was observed between the vitamin D status and incidence of CVDs (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1-1.39). In general, low serum vitamin D level increased the risk of CVD by 44% (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.24-1.69). It also increased the risk of CVD mortality (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.29-1.84) and incidence rates (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that vitamin D deficiency increases the CVDs mortality rate. Due to the limited number of studies on patients of the both genders, further research is suggested to separately evaluate the effect of vitamin D status on CVD in men and women."
2784327,1,a,"A survey of all registered deaths which occurred during 1981-1983 in women of reproductive age was carried out in Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause."
26310793,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the predominant cause of death globally. The large health disparities in the distribution of the burden of disease seen in developed and developing countries are of growing concern. Central to this concern is the poor outcome which is seen disproportionately in socially disadvantaged groups and racial/ethnic minorities. The aim of the study was to conduct a systematic literature review to investigate the nature of cardiovascular disease health disparities among Afro-Caribbean origin populations and identify current knowledge gaps. METHODS: A systematic literature review including a detailed search strategy was developed to search MEDLINE and other research databases. Using an a priori protocol peer-reviewed publications and grey literature articles were retrieved and screened and relevant data extracted by two independent review authors. Thematic analysis was done according to CVD outcomes and measures of disparity including age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: The search retrieved 665 articles of which 22 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in the United Kingdom and centered on the prevalence of CVD by ethnicity, age and sex. An important sub-theme identified was the disparities in health service utilization/hospital admission. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) were less prevalent among Afro-Caribbeans compared to Caucasian and South East Asian ethnic groups. The prevalence of CHD ranged from 0-7% in Afro-Caribbean to 2-22% in Caucasians. Strokes were more common among Afro-Caribbeans. There are inadequate data on morbidity and mortality from CVD, particularly across the socio-economic gradient, in Afro-Caribbean populations. CONCLUSIONS: There are important differences in morbidity and mortality from CVD across ethnic groups. Important knowledge gaps remain in understanding the social determinants of these disparities in CVD. More research exploring these gaps by varying disparity indicators needs to be undertaken."
29357164,1,a,"This study introduces a new approach to identify determinants of competitive success in small mammals. An experimental population of Clethrionomys rufocanus consisting of laboratory-raised individuals with known origin and life history was introduced to a realistic competitive situation in the field. Successful females could be distinguished from nonsuccessful females on the basis of four individual attributes measured 25 d after they were released on the study plot, whereas males could not. The most consistent determinant of competitive success seemed to be the sex ratio of the litters in which females were born. Successful females originated from litters with a strongly female-biased sex ratio. These results are considered in the light of recent research on the consequences of prenatal conditions on female social behavior."
2807934,1,a,"A national sample of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged was created by merging the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey and its counterpart, the National Health Interview Survey for the same year. A weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might be useful in calculating home- and community-based long-term care clients' risk of institutionalization. A model containing patient characteristics, nursing home bed supply, and a climate variable correctly classified 98.2 percent of cases residing in nursing homes or the community. Physical dependency, mental disorder and degenerative disease, lack of spouse, being white, poverty, old age, unoccupied nursing home beds, and climate all appear to be determinants of institutional residency among the aged."
31302503,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to figure out the difference between physical and social functioning in determining life satisfaction and self-perception of ageing among community-dwelling elderly people in China. METHODS: A representative random sample of 2161 participants aged 60 years or older was surveyed by face-to-face interview. Sociodemographic factors were measured by age, educational level, and marital status. Physical functioning was identified in terms of self-perceived health, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and number of chronic illnesses. Social functioning was characterized in terms of number of people living together, social support network, and sense of loneliness. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were performed to identify significant determinants of life satisfaction and self-perception of ageing. RESULTS: Older age and lower educational level were related to higher degree of life satisfaction; whereas younger age and higher educational level were related to higher level of self-perception of ageing. Social functioning took precedence over physical functioning in contributing to life satisfaction. In contrast, physical functioning outweighed social functioning in promoting a positive self-perception of ageing. CONCLUSION: A sense of companionship and a supportive social network are vital in enhancing life satisfaction, whereas perceived physical health and functional independence are essential in facilitating a positive self-perception of ageing. Understanding the underlying determinants can provide a novel insight into the mechanism involved in achieving successful ageing."
31744477,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions, is becoming more prevalent as the population ages. Primary care and home care providers play key roles in caring for older adults with MCC such as facilitating complex care decisions, shared decision-making, and access to community health and support services. While there is some research on the perceptions and experiences of these providers in caring for this population, much of this literature is focused specifically on family physicians. Little is known about the experiences of other primary care and home care providers from multiple disciplines who care for this vulnerable group. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of primary and home care healthcare providers in supporting the care of older adults with MCC living in the community, and identify ways of improving care delivery and outcomes for this group. METHODS: The study used an interpretive descriptive design. A total of 42 healthcare providers from two provinces in Canada (Ontario and Alberta) participated in individual semi-structured, face-to-face 60-min interviews. Participants represented diverse disciplines from primary care and home care settings. Inductive thematic analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The experiences and recommendations of healthcare providers managing care for older adults with MCC were organized into six major themes: (1) managing complexity associated with MCC, (2) implementing person-centred care, (3), supporting caregivers, (4) using a team approach for holistic care delivery, (5) encountering challenges and rewards, and (6) recommending ways to address the challenges of the healthcare system. Healthcare providers identified the need for a more comprehensive, integrated system of care to improve the delivery of care and outcomes for older adults with MCC and their family caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that community-based healthcare providers are using many relevant and appropriate strategies to support older adults living with the complexity of MCC, such as implementing person-centred care, supporting caregivers, working collaboratively with other providers, and addressing social determinants of health. However, they also identified the need for a more comprehensive, integrated system of care."
31909079,0,a,"Excessive alcohol use is a significant public health problem globally. Alcohol use typically begins in adolescence or early adult life, and effective prevention strategies focused on this age group are needed to avoid development of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). AUD is a worldwide problem resulting in millions of deaths, including hundreds of thousands of young lives lost. It is not only a causal factor in many diseases, but also a precursor to injury and violence. Furthermore, its' negative impacts can spread throughout a community or a country, and beyond, by influencing levels and patterns of alcohol consumption across borders [1]. This study sought to ascertain the influence of socio-cultural factors in AUD among adults. The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional study design. Stratified random sampling techniques were used to sample alcohol users across the county. Both descriptive (frequencies and percentages) and inferential (chi-square test) statistics were employed in data analysis. Content analysis was used to identify emerging themes in the interviews conducted. The study established that 65% of alcohol users in Muranga County have symptoms of AUD. Socio-cultural factors were found to influence AUD. Based on the findings, it was recommended that the Ministry of health and NACADA should organize sensitizations and awareness drives on alcohol abuse on the worrying trends of AUD together with their associated morbidities. The study also recommended deliberate efforts towards implementation of sound policies aimed at curbing the growth of the AUD."
23239079,0,a,"BACKGROUND: No previous study could be found that examined the longitudinal association between suicidal ideation and the factors associated with it and that considered both individual and contextual characteristics simultaneously. This study examined whether variation in suicidal ideation is attributable to the administrative-area level and examined suicidal ideation and the factors associated with it at multiple levels, especially focusing on social capital. METHODS: Longitudinal data of 5222 individuals and 2741 households in 25 administrative areas from the Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the Seoul Welfare Panel Study were used. RESULTS: In the study, 2.7% of variation in suicidal ideation was attributable to the administrative area. The results also suggested that perceived helpfulness at individual level (odds ratio (OR) = 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.43, 0.83) and organizational participation at administrative-area level were associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.53, 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers should consider laying down policies aimed at preventing suicide at administrative-area level as suicidal ideation of individuals is different between administrative areas. However, it should also be recognized that directing attention solely at administrative-area level is not efficient, as only small variations in suicidal ideation are attributable to this level. Decision makers need to consider policies promoting social capital, as it may play a role in reducing suicide risk."
2610569,1,a,"The results of a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of caries in a sample of 3,237 children aged 5 to 21 are described in relation to some objectives of the WHO program. The prevalence of caries is high in the sample: 1. 31.5% of the children aged 5 to 6 are free of caries (according to the WHO objectives, 50% of the children aged 5 to 6 should have no caries), 2. the mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMF/T index) in children aged 11 to 12 is 6.6 (The DMF/T should be less than or equal to 3). The frequency of toothbrushing is distributed as follows: 23% of the children brush their teeth once a week or less, 46% brush their teeth once a day, and 31% brush their teeth twice a day or more. The purpose and the frequency of the consultations at the dentist's office have been examined: 15% of the children never consult the dentist, 44% consult the dentist in case of toothache, and 41% go to the dentist's office for screening or control. Only 3.2% of the children use regularly and appropriately fluoride tablets. Since the variance of the results is large, it is difficult to distinguish explaining variables or determinants. However, the data indicate that social groups show differences in DMF indices as well as in the behaviors associated with dental hygiene and prevention."
12314663,1,a,"Dutch emigrant registration records for the nineteenth century are examined in an effort to shed light on the local circumstances of the Dutch emigration movement.

The quality and availability of these records vary from place to place, but generally speaking, in the case of the Netherlands, they are of high quality since population registration at the municipal level was required by law. The source of information for the local records are the population registers (Bevolkings Registers) which were originally constructed on the basis of information obtained from the 1850 population census...."""
31498010,0,a,"Studies that examined the impacts of inflammatory factors on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are very sparse. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and the risk of GDM. Pregnant women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and their gestational ages were below 10 weeks were recruited to this cohort study and were followed up until the 24-28 weeks of gestation. At the first pre-natal care visit blood samples were taken from all the pregnant women to investigate the serum concentration of CRP and fasting blood sugar. At 24-28 weeks of gestation, an oral glucose tolerance test was done to diagnose GDM as routine. About 5% of the women participating in the study were diagnosed as having GDM. There was a significant association between the increased serum concentration of CRP in the first trimester and the risk of GDM. The risk of GDM in women with the highest serum concentration of CRP is three times higher than that of women with the lowest serum concentration of CRP. Systemic inflammation can be associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Multiple studies have shown that chronic inflammation can increase the risk of developing type2 diabetes. There is incertitude as to the best attitude for screening and diagnosis of GDM. The studies were examined the impacts of inflammatory factors on GDM is very restricted. What do the results of this study add? CRP level measurement in the first trimester can be considered as a screening test. This is an easy and cost-effective test to make decision for performing oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The results of this study could give physicians and other health care providers the hint that increasing serum CRP levels in early pregnancy can be a risk factor for gestational diabetes."

2589474,1,a,"Data on nutritional intake and patterns of physical growth in the rural Andean community of Nunoa, Peru (elevation 4,000 m), are described and compared to data previously collected from this location. Food consumption data and selected anthropometric measures were obtained from a sample of 33 households. Estimates of caloric intake from this study are very similar to those obtained in Nunoa during the mid- and late 1960s. However, within the present sample, upper income (i.e., middle class) individuals have significantly higher caloric intakes than those of the lower income group and also appear to have an improved diet relative to individuals of 20 years ago. Anthropometric data show that children of the upper socioeconomic status (SES) group are significantly taller and heavier than the lower SES group children. Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not. These results indicate that nutritional factors have significantly contributed to the extreme pattern of slow growth previously reported for children of Nunoa and, moreover, demonstrate how social and environmental forces interact to create differential levels of stress that contribute to variation in biological well-being."

Therefore, the present dataset aimed to assess the level of rural housewives' awareness and attitudes towards the importance of residence and its compliance with health standards. To collect the present dataset, four villages were selected from the Gilan-e-Gharb township using the randomized cluster sampling method, then 25 subjects were chosen from each village (totaling 100 altogether). Furthermore, the subjects' awareness and attitudes were measured using a researcher-made questionnaire, and the data were then analyzed using the SPSS Statistical Software Version 21.0. The obtained data demonstrated that rural housewives' awareness and attitudes towards the subject were significantly different in terms of education and age group (P< 0.05), but the opposite was true in terms of the variables of marital status and training by health practitioners (P> 0.05). Based on the obtained data, the awareness and attitudes of rural women towards the importance and necessity of health standards of residence were low and moderate, respectively. In addition, providing rural women with effective training in various ways to raise their awareness and attitudes is of prime significance."
7239734,1,a,"Recent studies of job satisfaction, working conditions, and changes in the content of work indicate that problems of low productivity and dissatisfaction may be related to changes in the organization of work which have reduced the amount of autonomy and control which workers have over the labor process. At the same time, elements in the labor movement, which has traditionally focused almost exclusively on obtaining higher wages and greater benefits for union members, now seem to be directing their attention to issues of workplace democracy and worker control over the production process and company policies. The research reported here investigates the determinants of worker autonomy and of workers' desire for increased worker control over the workplace. This article describes what are viewed as the main hypotheses suggested by earlier research and reports the findings and new hypotheses derived from a preliminary analysis of data from the ISR National 1977 Quality of Employment Survey and pilot in-depth interviews with sixteen Baltimore workers."
3678537,1,a,"This research has expanded our understanding of the determinants of adolescent sexuality in several directions. We have used a study of mothers and children to construct and estimate a model of the intergenerational transmission of sexual attitudes and behavior. With data collected from both mothers and children, we were able to proceed further than most past research and to consider both the attitudes and behaviors of mothers as reported by the mothers themselves. These data permitted an investigation of the determinants of maternal attitudes concerning adolescent sexuality as well as an examination of the influences of the attitudes and experiences of mothers on the attitudes, perceptions, and behavior of children. Obviously, limiting the study to white families prevents generalization of our findings to other subgroups of the population. The findings demonstrate the importance and relevance of parental and adolescent attitudes in understanding adolescent sexuality. Premarital sexuality is a salient issue to both young people and their parents. There are, however, very important and substantial differences in the attitudes of parents and children. On average, the attitudes of young people today are much less restrictive than those of their parents, reflecting either life cycle differences or the impact of social change. The intergenerational difference is recognized by young people themselves and probably affects the ability of parents to assist their maturing children in adjusting to and dealing with their sexuality--a difficulty likely to be reflected in the relative lack of success sexually active young people have in preventing pregnancy. Our findings also add to the research literature in demonstrating that although children, on average, have more permissive attitudes than their parents, the attitudes of individual parents tend to be reflected in the attitudes of individual children. Children whose mothers have less restrictive attitudes have, on average, less restrictive attitudes themselves. Further, the attitudes of mothers are also reflected in the behavior of their children, so on average, mothers with more permissive attitudes have children who are more sexually active. The influence of maternal attitudes, however, is stronger for children's attitudes than for their behavior. Of course, variability in children's attitudes and behavior--and even their perceptions of maternal attitudes--can only be partially explained by the attitudes of their mothers; but presumably, if the attitudes of other important family members, including fathers and siblings, were known, the prediction of adolescent attitudes would improve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
12282631,1,a,"This paper reviews recent new trends in population structure in the world and its major regions in order to access the determinants of those trends and explore issues regarding the recent and projected changes in the age structure of population and the relationships of those changes to social and economic development. In particular, the paper compares the change in age structure projected by the Population Division of the UN Secretariat in its most recent 3 series--namely, those completed in 1984, 1986, and 1988. By and large, the most recent UN assessment projects that a larger proportion of the world population will be aged 60 and over in 2000 and 2025 than was previously estimated. Those changes in projections can be observed for the world and for the more developed countries as a whole, and for the regions of Africa, Latin America, Northern America, East Asia, Europe, and Oceania. While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries."
2892348,1,a,"The activity of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) and its determinants were studied in 17 patients with myotonic dystrophy. The gamma-GT activity was elevated in 11 patients and its mean value was five-fold higher than in healthy controls. The increase in gamma-GT could not be explained by factors generally known to result in a misleading elevation of gamma-GT. Most patients with elevated gamma-GT also had one or more other pathological laboratory tests related to hepatic function but none had a clinically significant liver disease. Serum gamma-GT activity was not related to the disability caused by dystrophy or to the level of serum creatine kinase suggesting that the elevation of serum gamma-GT is not an indication of a general cell membrane dysfunction. It is concluded that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity in patients with myotonic dystrophy is due to a real but mild liver involvement, which should be taken into account in the examination of these patients who often complain of gastrointestinal symptoms."
31968907,1,a,"Results of a long-term field study on the ecology and social organization of two groups of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in Peru are reported. Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets provide insight into some of the proximate determinants of fission-fusion social organization in this species and illustrate the different strategies used by males and females to gain access to critical resources. Longitudinal data on known individuals provide evidence for male natal philopatry and female emigration at sexual maturity in this population. Interbirth intervals are long (mean = 34.5 months) in comparison with most other primate species, and 5 of 15 infants seen within a few days of birth died or disappeared before they were a year old. Home ranges are large (150-250 ha) and fairly discrete; overlap with neighboring groups is on the order of 10-15%. Males and females differed substantially in their ranging patterns; females, particularly those with infants, restricted much of their ranging to a ""core area"" 20-33% the size of the total group range, whereas males ranged more evenly over the entire area occupied by the group. Daily path length varied over almost an order of magnitude from 465 m to 4,070 m, with a mean of 1977 m. Males spent more time traveling and less time feeding than most females. These results are compared with those obtained in previous studies of Ateles and with similar data from other primate species to assess their implications for the evolution of fission-fusion sociality in spider monkeys. The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of very similar social organizations in spider monkeys and chimpanzees are discussed."
23846857,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Developing categorical diagnoses that have biological meaning within the clinical phenotype of psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar I disorder with psychosis) is as important for developing targeted treatments as for nosological goals. The Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) was formed to examine a broad array of intermediate phenotypes across psychotic disorders and to test the hypothesis that intermediate phenotype characteristics are homogeneous within phenomenologically derived DSM-IV diagnoses. METHOD: The consortium recruited 933 stable probands with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic bipolar I disorder, 1,055 of their first-degree relatives, and 459 healthy comparison subjects for clinical characterization and dense phenotyping. Clinical, psychosocial, and family characteristics were contrasted. RESULTS: All proband groups showed lower psychosocial functioning than the relatives or comparison group. On average, schizophrenia probands showed more symptoms and lower psychosocial functioning than probands with psychotic bipolar disorder, but there was considerable overlap in clinical manifestations. The characteristics of schizoaffective disorder were more often similar to schizophrenia than to psychotic bipolar disorder. The rates of lifetime suicide attempts were high across all proband groups, with the highest reported frequencies in the schizoaffective and bipolar groups. Proband family lineages included both families with ""pure"" psychosis diagnoses and families with mixed schizophrenia-bipolar diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and familial lineage overlap across the three DSM-IV psychosis diagnoses used in B-SNIP. The comingling of psychosis diagnoses within families suggests overlapping genetic determinants across psychoses. These data provide scant evidence for distinct phenotypic clustering around traditional phenomenological diagnoses."
28901336,0,a,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D and probiotics are nutrients of interest in the context of type 1 diabetes (T1D). We assessed the prevalence of and factors associated with vitamin D and probiotic supplementations among young children with genetic risk of T1D. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Use of supplements during the first 2 years of life was collected prospectively from 8674 children in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. RESULTS: Single and/or multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplements were reported by 81% of the children. The majority of participants in Finland, Germany and Sweden (97-99%) and 50% in the United States received vitamin D supplements that were mostly MVMs. Probiotics use varied from 6% in the United States to 60% in Finland and was primarily from probiotics-only preparations. More than 80% of the vitamin D and probiotics supplementation was initiated during infancy, and more than half of the uses lasted longer than a year. Being the first child, longer duration of breastfeeding, born in a later year, older maternal age and higher maternal education level were associated with both vitamin D and probiotics use. Shorter gestational age and mother not smoking during pregnancy were associated with a higher likelihood of probiotics supplementation only. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D and probiotics supplementations are popular in children 0-2 years old and are associated with common factors. Data documented here will allow evaluation of the relationship between early childhood dietary intake and the development of islet autoimmunity and progression to T1D."
28410797,0,a,"In order to know about the health of the population, it is necessary to perform a systematic and continuous analysis of their health status and social and economic health determinants. The objective of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of the Infobarris tool, which allows to visualize a wide battery of indicators and social determinants of health by neighbourhoods in the city of Barcelona (Spain). For the development of the Infobarris tool, we used an agile methodology that allows the development of a project in iterative and incremental stages, which are the following: selection of indicators, design of the prototype, development of the tool, data loading, and tool review and improvements. Infobarris displays 64 indicators of health and its determinants through graphics, maps and tables, in a friendly, interactive and attractive way, which facilitates health surveillance in the neighbourhoods of Barcelona."
12266409,1,a,"""This study had two main goals. The first was to test the hypothesis that women who work in the informal sector of the labor force have better-nourished children, ceteris paribus, than women who work in the formal sector. A simple home production model for child nutrition incorporating this hypothesis was specified and the behavior of a utility-maximizing household investigated. The empirical estimates of the nutritional status production function provided no convincing support for the hypothesis."" The second goal was ""to investigate the joint determinants of child nutrition and of women's fertility and work choices....[It is suggested] that increases in women's education and formal sector wages will induce declines in fertility and improvements in child nutrition. Increases in informal sector wages will improve nutrition but have little impact on fertility, and income effects are minimal on all three variables."" Data are from a household survey conducted in Nicaragua in 1977 and 1978."
6520656,1,a,"Smoking during pregnancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including fetal and neonatal death. These consequences are tragic in many ways, but perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they are preventable if the smoker ceases to smoke during pregnancy. Although in some instances the so-called constitutional hypothesis is difficult to disprove, the available evidence seems more than convincing that it is smoking itself, and not the smoker's unique constitution, that is responsible. Cessation from smoking is clearly advisable at any time, but more so during pregnancy when every cigarette affects both the smoker and her unborn child."
26420183,0,a,"The effects of patient characteristics on reported adherence to dietary self-care behaviours in 184 Taiwanese outpatients 40 years or older with type 2 diabetes was assessed. Patient characteristics included the presence of predisposing factors affecting diabetes adherence (knowledge and attitudes about the disease, self-efficacy, and the absence of psychological problems), enabling factors (understanding of diabetes and environmental factors affecting it), and reinforcing factors (presence of medical and social support) which were evaluated using a 72 item self-administered questionnaire with 8 subscales. Adherence was assessed by patients' reports of carrying out 7 self-care behaviours (following a diabetic meal plan, following the diabetes exchange system, eating meals providing the same amount of carbohydrate every day, counting carbohydrates, reducing dietary fat, consuming high fiber foods, and keeping a daily food record). Reported adherence ranged from 17% to 74%. No single predisposing, enabling, or reinforcing factor predicted adherence to all of the dietary self-care behaviours. However, more self-efficacy, better understanding, and a better attitude toward diabetes were associated with performing five or more of the dietary self-care behaviours examined. With respect to specific self-care behaviours, women were more likely than men to count carbohydrates (OR=5.75) and reduce fat in their diets (OR=2.57). Patients who attended more nutrition education sessions were more likely to follow diabetes meal plans (OR=2.11) and the diabetes exchange system (OR=3.07). Efforts are needed to encourage providers to teach diabetes self-care behaviours to patients and to capitalize upon demographic and psychosocial characteristics that can enhance patient adherence."
25785579,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains a major health problem and causes high mortality in Northeastern Thailand. Patients with CCA have a poor prognosis, and little is known about their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its determinants. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate factors affecting HRQOL and its changes over time among CCA patients. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients with CCA were recruited during a 6-month period in 2011 in 5 tertiary hospitals in 4 provinces of northeastern Thailand. Health-related quality of life after diagnosis of CCA was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary questionnaire (Thai version 4). The HRQOL score of CCA patients at different times after diagnosis was compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Generalized estimating equation was used to identify factors affecting HRQOL among CCA patients. RESULTS: Of 237 eligible patients registered, 99 confirmed cases completed follow-up at 2 months. Overall HRQOL varied over time, with the score at baseline being significantly lower than 1 and 2 months later. An adjusted analysis showed that patients who were 60 to 69 years old had higher HRQOL scores than did younger patients. Patients using alternative medicine had lower HRQOL scores than did those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related quality-of-life scores among CCA patients changed over time and were related to age at recruitment and use of alternative medicine. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare providers should carefully communicate about the diagnosis and its implications. Patients with CCA, especially younger patients and those who have used traditional medicine, may benefit from counseling and help with mobilizing family and social support."
30362862,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Although causality is difficult to establish, the regular use of marijuana has been associated with many adverse physiological and sociological consequences. There is considerable concern regarding marijuana use among adolescents, as the likelihood of adverse consequences increases significantly for this age group. The most comprehensive data for identifying risk factors for adolescent marijuana use is typically self-report, which may be over- or under-reported for a variety of reasons, including stigmatization, peer-pressure, or fear of being discovered. OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence of adolescent marijuana use in Washington State, and the associated risk and protective factors, while controlling for and estimating the extent of misreporting, and its determinants. METHOD: Data came from the 2014 Washington State Healthy Youth Survey. We accounted for missingness using chained multivariate imputation equations, resulting in 33,320 complete observations. Our model was estimated using a maximum likelihood multiple regression designed to control for systematic misclassification in binary dependent variables. RESULTS: Approximately 12% of Washington adolescents claimed to have used marijuana in the past 30 days. Our estimates indicate this figure is likely closer to 18%. Determinants of use included use of other substances, gender, age, and measures of deviant social influences, personality/attitude, school and family bonds, bullying, and acquisition ease. Determinants of misreporting included use of other substances, gender, parental education, and family bonds. CONCLUSIONS: Failing to control for misreporting considerably underestimates the prevalence of marijuana use among adolescents. Our model allows us to better identify at-risk adolescents and inform focused prevention efforts."
