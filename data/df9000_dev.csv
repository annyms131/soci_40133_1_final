12073280,0,a,"1. The social function needs of persons with schizophrenia are similar to those of all individuals and include typical social roles, integration and contacts, and intimacy and sexual function. 2. Social function is essential to QOL, and aspects of social function are determinants of mental health and mental health outcomes. 3. Although intimacy and sexual function is found to be an important aspect of social function and QOL, health care workers neglect to discuss these issues with patients with schizophrenia. 4. Education, support, counseling, adequate transportation, safe environments, and treatment plans that include appropriate activities are important treatment interventions."
12224661,1,a,"Physical activity is a key component of energy balance and is promoted in children and adolescents as a lifelong positive health behavior. Understanding the potential behavioral determinants necessitates understanding influences from three fundamental areas: 1) physiologic and developmental factors, 2) environmental factors, and 3) psychological, social, and demographic factors. The literature to date has generally investigated potential predictors of physical activity in children and adolescents in each of these three general areas, although existing data rely largely on cross-sectional studies in which it is difficult to distinguish a determinant from a correlate. In all likelihood, aspects of each of these three areas interact in a multidimensional way to influence physical activity in youth. This article reviews evidence of potential determinants of physical activity in children and adolescents and provides recommendations for future work."
18434246,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of 2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors: perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal knowledge of health issues."
9195528,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and determinants of self-reported work disability in persons with fibromyalgia (FM). METHODS: A longitudinal, multicenter survey of 1604 patients with FM from 6 centers with diverse socioeconomic characteristics was begun in 1988. Assessments were by self-report questionnaire and telephone contact, and included work and disability events that occurred before and after 1988. Comparative analyses were performed on the entire data set and, separately, on the Wichita data set. RESULTS: More than 16% of patients reported receiving US Social Security disability (SSD) payments (highest center rate 35.7%; lowest center rate 6.3%) compared to 2.2% of the US population (US Social Security Administration data) and 28.9% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis seen at the Wichita outpatient rheumatology clinic. Overall, 26.5% reported receiving at least one form of disability payment when SSD and other sources of disability payments were considered. In Wichita, less than 25% of SSD awards were made specifically for FM, but after 1988 that figure increased to 46.4%. Work disability was greatest at the San Antonio and Los Angeles centers. Multivariate predictors (correlates) included pain, Health Assessment Questionnaire disability, and unmarried status. In addition, more than 70% of patients reporting being disabled did receive disability payments. On the other hand, 64% reported being able to work all or most days, and more than 70% were employed or were homemakers. CONCLUSION: Although most patients (64%) report being able to work, we found high rates of self-reported work disability awards among persons with FM followed in 6 rheumatology centers. But we also found great variability among centers as to awards and as to self-reported work ability. Center differences in work disability might reflect clinic referral patterns, physician beliefs, or socioeconomic status."
9107004,1,a,"Marital separation can be a time of extreme stress and can significantly disrupt support networks and support processes when they are needed most. The purpose of this investigation was to test mechanisms of support erosion in a multimethod study of 138 divorced mothers and their confidants. Previous work was extended by using observational measures of confidant support in a process model including (a) maternal characteristics over time, (b) support person characteristics, and (c) relationship characteristics (intimacy and confidant relationship type). A hypothesized mechanism of erosion was supported in which ongoing maternal distress was positively associated with levels of confidant negativity, which in turn was related to lower levels of observed support. Having a partner was related to more intimacy than was having family and friends. Contrary to expectation, however, having a partner was related to lower levels of support, and intimacy was not related to observed support."
11682918,0,a,"Given the longevity achievable with current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for persons with HIV infection, quality of life (QOL) has emerged as a significant medical outcome measure, and its enhancement as an important goal. This review highlights current knowledge about the relevance and complexity of physical, psychological, and social factors as determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected persons. Existing data suggest physical manifestations, antiretroviral therapy, psychological well-being, social support systems, coping strategies, spiritual well-being, and psychiatric comorbidities are important predictors of QOL in this population. Health care professionals are encouraged to become familiar with the full spectrum of predictors of HRQOL, which may eventually contribute to the development of multiple entry points for interventions in promoting QOL in these patients. Identifying variables influencing QOL among diverse groups, particularly women, injection drug users, and adolescents, and designing effective interventions specific to the social and psychological well-being of HIV-infected individuals are areas for research."
1950174,1,a,"Frequency and determinants of smoking cessation were analysed using data from two Italian National Health Surveys, conducted in 1983 and 1986-87 on samples of 89,753 and 77,155 individuals respectively, randomly selected within strata of region of residence, size of the municipality and of the household, in order to be representative of the general Italian population. Overall stopping ratios or ""quit ratios"" (i.e., ratios between ex- and ever-smokers) were 20.5% for males and 9.0% for females in the 1983 survey, and rose to 23.2 and 11.9% respectively in 1986-87. With reference to age, stopping rates were slightly higher for females than for males below age 35, but considerably higher for males in each subsequent age group, particularly in middle age. Ratios were apparently higher for the most recent survey for both sexes and each subsequent age group. After standardisation for age, ""quit ratios"" in both sexes were directly related with education. Cessation of smoking was more common in northern (and richer) areas of the country, and positively associated with the prevalence of smoking-related chronic diseases. The major, and most discouraging, finding from these analyses is the absolute low rate of stopping in Italy as compared to northern America or northern Europe, although some positive tendency towards increasing cessation was evident between the early and the late 1980s. These tendencies, together with some recent drops in smoking prevalence in younger women, first observed after decades of increase, indicate a change at least in attitudes towards reporting smoking, and hence social acceptance of the habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
11971047,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the quality of life in patients with cervical dystonia, although pain and depression are relatively common. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that an individual's ability to cope with the disease will modify the association of intrinsic, extrinsic, and disease related factors with quality of life. METHODS: Patients with cervical dystonia diagnosed by a movement disorder specialist were recruited from seven European countries. Data on quality of life (SF-36), measures of coping, and intrinsic, extrinsic, and disease related factors were collected by a self completed postal questionnaire. RESULTS: 289 patients (101 men and 188 women), mean age 55 years, completed the questionnaire. Both physical and mental quality of life scores were predicted by self esteem and self deprecation, educational level, employment status, social support, response to botulinum toxin, disease severity, social participation, stigma, acceptance of illness, anxiety, and depression. In multivariable analyses, the strongest predictors were anxiety and depression. Severe depression was associated with a 19.1 point decrement in the physical summary score (95% confidence interval, -31.7 to -6.6; p = 0.003); however, disease duration and severity remained predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Care for patients with cervical dystonia must not only focus on reducing the severity of the dystonia but also on the psychological wellbeing of the patient. Interventions aimed at treating depression or anxiety, especially of a cognitive nature, may have a large impact on improving quality of life."
18332501,0,a,"The Institute of Medicine's 2003 Unequal Treatment report raised the public's and policymakers' awareness of racial and ethnic health care disparities, but federal policy-makers have implemented few of the report's more than two dozen recommendations. State health care reform efforts, however, are gaining support around the country and have great potential to reduce health care inequality. This paper offers a policy framework to explore how states can move toward eliminating disparities by addressing health care access and quality, state health care infrastructure, patient and community empowerment, state policy infrastructure, and social and community determinants of health."
16783115,0,a,"The purpose of this study was to examine the demographic, medical, and social cognitive determinants of exercise intentions in a population-based sample of multiple myeloma cancer survivors. Using a cross-sectional survey, 70 multiple myeloma cancer survivors completed a questionnaire that assessed their medical and demographic characteristics, past exercise behavior, and social cognitive exercise beliefs using the theory of planned behavior. Seventy participants provided valuable data. Descriptive statistics indicated that participants had quite positive instrumental attitude, intentions, and subjective norms and moderate levels of perceived behavioral control and affective attitudes for exercise. Forced entry multiple regression showed that the theory of planned behavior explained 43% of the variance in exercise intentions. Instrumental attitude and perceived behavioral control were both independent predictors of exercise intentions. No demographic or medical variable moderated the association between the theory of planned behavior constructs and exercise intentions. The results of the present investigation support the growing body of evidence confirming the utility of the theory of planned behavior to understand the salient determinants of exercise in cancer survivors. Knowledge gained from this study provides important information to oncology practitioners who are responsible for delivering supportive care interventions, including exercise, to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma."
9150097,1,a,"Psychosocial variables were recognized as key clinical determinants and outcomes in rheumatic disease. Clinical interventions can produce clinically important improvement in psychological status, and clinicians regularly employ anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. Yet assessment of psychological status is rarely undertaken in routine clinical practice. In part, this failure stems from the fact that most formal psychological instruments are too complicated, take too much time to administer, cannot be administered in real time, and are difficult to interpret. A practical way to assess psychological status in the clinic is to use short depression instruments such as the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) or the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) anxiety and depression subscales. Another approach to psychological assessment is to measure surrogate variables, that is, variables that are not primarily psychological and have practical use in rheumatic disease care. The Clinical Health Assessment Questionnaire (CLINHAQ) assesses such surrogate variables via visual analog scales for pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, the helplessness subscale of the Rheumatology Attitudes index, a self-report measure of satisfaction with health, and the AIMS anxiety and depression scales. This instrument, which also contains the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index, a pain diagram, and assessment of global severity, can be completed in 5 minutes by almost all clinic patients."
10224633,1,a,"Age differences in the types of processing associated with impression change were examined. Young, middle-aged, and older adults formed an impression of a target based on a short vignette that described either positive or negative characteristics in 1 of 2 domains (ability vs. morality). Impression change was examined after presentation of additional behavioral information that was inconsistent with the original vignette. Replicating previous findings, younger adults changed their impressions in response to the consistency of the new information with the initial target description. In contrast, impression change in the 2 older groups was based on the trait diagnosticity of the original and new information, suggesting greater use of inferential, knowledge-based processing with age. The results indicate that qualitative difference exist in impression change processes, with different-aged individuals considering different types of information when constructing and updating social representations."

9629105,1,a,"BACKGROUND: High levels of mercury in the Cree population of James Bay, Que., have been a cause of concern for several years. This study examines changes in mercury levels within the Cree population between 1988 and 1993/94 and identifies potential determinants of high mercury levels. METHODS: Data on mercury levels among the Cree were obtained through a surveillance program undertaken by the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay. In 1988 and again in 1993/94 surveys were carried out in all 9 Cree communities of northern Quebec. Hair samples were obtained and analysed for mercury content. Analyses were carried out to determine the proportion of people who had mercury levels in excess of established norms. Changes in mercury levels between 1988 and 1993/94 and determinants of high levels were estimated by means of regression methods. RESULTS: The proportion of the Cree population with mercury levels in excess of 15.0 mg/kg declined from 14.2% in 1988 to 2.7% in 1993/94. Wide variations in mercury levels were observed between communities: 0.6% and 8.3% of the Eastmain and Whapmagoostui communities respectively had mercury levels of 15.0 mg/kg or greater in 1993/94. Logistic regression analyses showed that significantly higher levels of mercury were independently associated with male sex, increasing age and trapper status. There was a correlation between the mercury level of the head of the household and that of the spouse. INTERPRETATION: Mercury levels in the Cree of James Bay have decreased in the recent past. Nevertheless, this decrease in mercury levels may not be permanent and does not necessarily imply that the issue is definitively resolved."
9735512,1,a,"We evaluated the impact of the November 1994 ban on smoking on school property in Ontario. Telephone interviews were conducted at the end of the 1995-96 school year with 213 high school administrators. Almost all high schools (96%) prohibit smoking on school property. Although some smoking still occurs on school property, the location of smoking by students has changed, giving rise to perceptions of both benefits and risks, as well as varying complaints from parents, students, neighbours, and nearby businesses. Most of the problems arising from the ban are viewed as minor. Local conditions, particularly the geographic environment of the school, appear to be important determinants of complaints and problems. While sizeable minorities of school administrators felt the ban had favourable effects, the majority perceived little effect on either smoking behaviour or attitudes towards smoking."
11866324,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Recent major epidemiological studies have adopted increasingly multidimensional approaches to assessment. Several of these have included some assessment of perceived need for mental health care. The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, conducted in 1997, included a particularly detailed examination of this construct, with an instrument with demonstrated reliability and validity. METHODS: A clustered probability sample of 10641 Australians responded to the field questionnaire for this survey, including questions on perceived need either where there had been service utilization, or where a disorder was detected by administration of sections of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The confidentialized unit record file generated from the survey was analysed for determinants of perceived need. RESULTS: Perceived need is increased in females, in people in the middle years of adulthood, and in those who have affective disorders or co-morbidity. Effects of diagnosis and disability can account for most of the differences in gender specific rates. With correction for these effects through regression, there is less perceived need for social interventions and possibly more for counselling in females; disability is confirmed as strongly positively associated with perceived need, as are the presence of affective disorders or co-morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study underscore the imperative for mental health services to be attentive and responsive to consumer perceived need. The substantial majority of people who are significantly disabled by mental health problems are among those who see themselves as having such needs."
17903047,0,a,"BACKGROUND: To assess the inequity in seeking needed outpatient services in Iran and to investigate its influential factors. METHOD: The data were taken from a nation-wide Iranian health survey conducted in 2003. This study is based on individuals aged 15 years and over who had mentioned their need to seek outpatient care within two weeks prior to the day of the interview. The outcome was seeking needed outpatient care. The independent variables included respondents' age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, index of household economic status, health insurance status and residential place (urban vs. rural). RESULTS: Sixty-nine point five percent of those in need sought outpatient care. The rich (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.64 - 3.43) and the health insured (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.25 - 2.08), the pensioners and the retired (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.22 - 4.20), the housewives (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07 - 2.95) were more likely to seek outpatient care than other occupations. On the other hand, people living in remote rural areas (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 - 0.57) were less likely to seek their needed outpatient care than those living in main rural areas and urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: As in different parts of the world, differences in seeking needed healthcare still exist across different groups in Iran. Indeed, seeking outpatient care in Iran is related not only to health system functions--like health insurance and health facilities--but also on factors beyond the scope of health authorities such as economic status and occupation. This study can be instrumental for the recent five-year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan of Iran which identified the reduction of inequalities in social determinants of health [corrected]"
18720399,0,a,"Hurricane Katrina was the most devastating natural disaster to hit the United States in the past 75 years. The authors conducted interviews of 810 persons who were representative of adult residents living in the 23 southernmost counties of Mississippi before Hurricane Katrina. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since Hurricane Katrina was 22.5%. The determinants of PTSD were female gender, experience of hurricane-related financial loss, postdisaster stressors, low social support, and postdisaster traumatic events. Kaplan-Meier survival curves suggest that exposure to both hurricane-related traumatic events and to financial and social stressors influenced the duration of PTSD symptoms. Postdisaster interventions that aim to improve manipulable stressors after these events may influence the onset and course of PTSD."
2020883,1,a,"The relationship between urbanisation and measles control is examined. In urban settings in developing regions measles is a disease of particular importance, since it tends to affect children at a younger age and with greater severity than in rural settings. A further finding in urban areas, especially peri-urban slums, is the lower measles vaccination coverage rates compared with rural regions. Factors identified as determinants of measles vaccination coverage among children under 2 years of age in urban areas include: home delivery; being born outside the urban setting; and length of stay in the city. These factors are probably related to the low socioeconomic status and lack of social integration experienced by new urban immigrants. A number of additional obstacles, such as distance, economic and cultural barriers, and inconvenient clinic hours all prevent parents from gaining easy access to vaccination services. In order to address the problems of measles control in expanding urban settings, a regional approach--with full integration of curative and preventive services--is called for. A more effective use of existing services will probably go a long way towards improving urban vaccination coverage with resultant measles control."
12481209,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The Russian mortality crisis of the early 1990s attracted considerable attention, but information on possible covariates of mortality is lacking, and concerns have been raised about the validity of official mortality data. To help elucidate the determinants of mortality, we examined whether indirect demographic techniques could be used to study mortality in countries such as the Russian Federation, where mortality data are inadequate, using input data independent from official vital statistics. METHODS: A national sample of the population was interviewed (n = 1600, response rate = 67%). Participants who had ever been married (82% of the sample) were asked about the date of birth and vital status of their first spouse. Spousal mortality was then estimated indirectly for the 531 men and 710 women for whom valid data were available. FINDINGS: The estimated risk of death between the ages of 35-69 years was 57% for male spouses and 17% for female spouses. Corresponding figures derived from national data for 1990 were 52% and 25% for the Russian Federation, and 31% and 20% for the United Kingdom. According to spouses' reports, 38% of their husbands died from cardiovascular disease, 22% from cancer, and 14% from injuries and accidents. Mortality of male spouses was inversely related to the education level of their wives, and the age-adjusted hazard ratios for death from all causes, compared to primary education, were 0.77 for secondary education and 0.57 for university education (trend P = 0.03). Mortality was also inversely related to ownership of household items, but not to size of settlement, pride in Russia, membership in the Soviet Communist Party, nationality or self-assessed social status. CONCLUSIONS: Although the indirect estimates were imprecise (partly owing to the small population size of the study), and mortality in women was probably underestimated (owing to many factors, including poorer reporting by males and high male mortality), our results are nevertheless consistent with the mortality pattern observed in official mortality data. The indirect technique thus appears to be a useful tool to study the determinants of mortality in the Russian Federation and other populations, where reliable or sufficiently extensive data are not available."
18355407,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Few studies of the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have focussed on women who work as street sex workers to finance their drug use. METHODS: The investigators report the survey findings of such a population in Glasgow. All women attending the health and social care drop-in centre, situated in Glasgow's ""Red Light Area"", during a four-week period in 1999 were invited to participate in a survey involving the provision of a saliva sample for anonymous HCV testing and the self-completion of a questionnaire seeking demographic, sexual and injecting practice data. RESULTS: Of the 223 women who attended, 51% agreed to participate. Of the 98 women who provided a sufficient saliva sample, 64% (95% CI: 54%-74%) tested HCV antibody positive; 98% of those who tested positive had ever injected drugs. Adjusting for the 85% sensitivity of the saliva test, the HCV antibody prevalence among IDU sex workers sampled was 81%; a rate which is considerably higher than those recorded, contemporaneously, among Glasgow IDUs generally. Two factors were independently associated with HCV antibody positivity in saliva: ever shared needles and syringes (adjusted OR 5.7, 95% CI 2-16) and number of times imprisoned (adjusted OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.4-39, for more than five times compared to zero times). CONCLUSION: Women who engage in street sex work to finance their drug habit are a particularly desperate, chaotic and vulnerable population. This study demonstrates that their HCV infection risk may be greater than that for other IDUs. Those responsible for designing interventions to prevent HCV infection among IDUs should consider the special needs of this group."
15112009,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine factors predictive of the score on the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EQ-5D questionnaire. METHODS: The responses of 1159 residents of a socially and ethnically diverse suburb of Cape Town, South Africa, to the EQ-5D questionnaire were analysed using forward stepwise multiple regression. The variables entered included ethnic group, religious affiliation (Christian or Muslim), income level, unemployment, recent illness or disability and each level of the five EQ-5D domains. FINDINGS: The model developed accounted for an adjusted r(2) of 0.234 and included 11 variables. In addition to the EQ-5D domains, the presence of a disability, an income of less than 420 US dollars per month, unemployment and age in years were significant predictors of VAS score. CONCLUSION: The substantial contribution of health state to the VAS indicates that it is a valid measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across population groups. However, the subjects with lower social status reported a worse HRQoL than their health state alone warranted and this variable might need to be taken into account if the VAS is to be used to compare health states across populations. This paper provides empirical evidence of how HRQoL is perceived by different socioeconomic, cultural, ethnic and religious communities within a developing country."
23529205,1,a,"Existing models of attitude-behavior relationships, including the Health Belief Model, the Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Self-Efficacy Theory, are increasingly being used by psychologists to predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors. The authors briefly highlight some of the difficulties that might arise in applying these models to predicting the risk behaviors of African Americans. These social psychological models tend to emphasize the importance of individualistic, direct control of behavioral choices and deemphasize factors, such as racism and poverty, particularly relevant to that segment of the African American population most at risk for HIV infection. Applications of these models without taking into account the unique issues associated with behavioral choices within the African American community may fail to capture the relevant determinants of risk behaviors."
18787497,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To examine patient-perceived communication styles (empathic and dominant communication styles) of Korean physicians in rehabilitation and their effects on patient outcomes (patient satisfaction and compliance). DESIGN: A total of 150 rehabilitation patients from a large university hospital in Korea were interviewed with a 26 item-questionnaire. RESULTS: Only 30% of the patients considered their physicians as highly affective whereas about 55% of them viewed their doctors as highly dominant. Physicians' affective and cognitive empathic communication styles were significantly and positively correlated with both patient satisfaction and compliance. Correlation analysis showed that physicians' dominant communication style was significantly but negatively related to patient satisfaction. However, compliance, cross-tabulation, and regression analyses suggested that physicians' dominant communication style may not be a good predictor of patient satisfaction and compliance. Those patients who perceived their physicians as highly affective or highly cognitive showed the highest rates of being completely satisfied, whereas none of those patients who ranked their physicians as least affective or least cognitive said that they were completely satisfied. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the existing findings in the West that physician's communication styles were major determinants of the patient outcomes. Patients' highly negative view of their physicians' dominant communication style might raise some concerns about Korean physicians' authoritarian attitudes toward their patients."
15969760,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength and predisposition to increased risk of fracture, with consequent increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is therefore an important public health problem. International and Canadian associations have issued clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OP. In this study, we identified potential predictors of bone mineral density (BMD) testing and OP treatment, which include place of residence. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Quebec Health Insurance Board. The studied population consisted of all individuals 65 years and older for whom a physician claimed a consultation for a low velocity vertebral, hip, wrist, or humerus fracture in 1999 and 2000. Individuals were considered to have undergone BMD testing if there was a claim for such a procedure within two years following a fracture. They were considered to have received an OP treatment if there was at least one claim to Quebec's health insurance plan (RAMQ) for OP treatment within one year following a fracture. We performed descriptive analyses and logistic regressions by gender. Predictors included age, site of fracture, social status, comorbidity index, prior BMD testing, prior OP treatment, long-term glucocorticoid use, and physical distance to BMD device. RESULTS: The cohort, 77% of which was female, consisted of 25,852 individuals with fragility fractures. BMD testing and OP treatment rates were low and gender dependent (BMD: men 4.6%; women 13.1%; OP treatment: men 9.9%; women 29.7%). There was an obvious regional variation, particularly in BMD testing, ranging from 0 to 16%. Logistic regressions demonstrate that individuals living in long term care facilities received less BMD testing. Patients who had suffered from vertebral fractures, or who had received prior OP treatment or BMD testing, regardless of gender, subsequently received more BMD testing and OP treatments. Furthermore, increasing the distance between a patient's residence and BMD facility precluded likelihood of BMD testing. CONCLUSION: BMD testing rate was extremely low but not completely explained by reduced physical access; gender, age, social status, prior BMD testing and OP treatment were all important predictors for future BMD testing and OP treatment."
16902386,0,a,"BACKGROUND: With the widespread dissemination of the Internet throughout the world of health, it would be relevant to report on current knowledge about health information search on the Internet from the consumers' standpoint. METHODS: We conducted a bibliographical research over the past five years and distinguished between international and French studies. RESULTS: For a long time, the (mostly US) studies have been merely descriptive. The studies highlight that the factors associated with health searches on the Internet are similar to the factors underlying the digital divide. Consumer searches are deemed efficient although search skills are comparatively below standard. Attempts are underway to set up tools, circulate them widely, and ensure better quality information on the Internet. However, comprehension and literacy are still issues in some social groups. Regarding the impact on consumer health per se, a (positive) effect of the Internet seems to emerge but research should be continued. CONCLUSION: Many of the behaviors, uses or limits addressed in this paper pertain to any information search on the Internet but other problems or differences also occur in the specific area of health. Longitudinal investigations are needed, specifically to gain deeper insight into the impacts we have addressed, while rolling out a comprehensive approach to the temporal evolution of user practices and experiences. Specifically, the central issue is still to determine how (and for whom) the Internet alters information search behaviors and, in fine, to what extent this affects health behaviors and the recourse to healthcare."
16539970,0,a,"The main aim of screening is to identify people with an increased probability to benefit from preventive interventions, generally from secondary prevention but also from primary prevention activities. The goal is to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment in order to modify positively the prognosis (the former case), or to recognize people exposed to risk factors which increase the incidence rate of disease, and then to prevent the disease (the latter case). Good intentions are not enough to achieve good results in terms of effectiveness, safety, efficiency or equity. It is necessary to have a systematic assessment of the consequences of screening, particularly on the impact on peoples health and on the health services. Due to the diversity of types of screenings that are done, it is very difficult to estimate the net impact caused by their implementation. Moreover, the changes in the health of a population depend on many factors other than health service interventions. Thus, it is very important to determine the effectiveness and safety of the screening methods that are most frequently applied. Unfortunately, assessment of the benefits and the harm potentially caused by preventive interventions has not been done often. In Spain only a few partial assessments have been published, and they focus on the activities and the processes themselves rather than the final outcomes. Given that screening activities are carried out in health care services, and that the populations screened are mostly healthy people, the ethical issues have great importance when health policies are designed and implemented. Thus, it is recommended that screenings activities be analyzed applying the ethical principles of autonomy, benefit, safety and justice. If any screening program cannot reasonably satisfy these principles then they should be removed from the list of public health activities that are financed by public resources. In the same sense, all screening procedures offered to the population must be subjected to a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness, safety, efficiency and equity in terms of how the procedure would be applied. Lastly, to achieve an effective implementation of the principle of autonomy as well the desired goal of empowering the population to exercise some control over their determinants of health, it is recommended to explore new ways of achieving active citizen participation to establish preventive priorities and to assess the impact of screening interventions."
16704332,0,a,"Over the past few decades, there has been increasing interest in the study of social impairment in schizophrenia. However, the concept of social functioning has been poorly defined in the literature. This article highlights the global and multi-factorial nature of social functioning and reviews the theoretical determinants of social dysfunction in schizophrenia. Emphasis is placed on outlining the social cognitive deficits that may occur. The study of social cognition appears particularly promising in elucidating our understanding of the development of social impairment in schizophrenia and has the potential to improve current psychosocial interventions. However, continued advances depend upon the existence of reliable and well-validated measures of social functioning and social cognition. A selection of measures are reviewed in this article in an attempt to highlight the importance of assessing multiple aspects of social functioning in schizophrenia and to assist researchers in the selection of appropriate measures. Future efforts should be directed towards the continued validation of social functioning and social cognitive measures and their adaptation for use in at-risk and early psychosis populations."
15081207,0,a,"Gender-based inequalities in health have been frequently documented. This paper examines the extent to which these inequalities reflect the different social experiences and conditions of men's and women's lives. We address four specific questions. Are there gender differences in mental and physical health? What is the relative importance of the structural, behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health? Are the gender differences in health attributable to the differing structural (socio-economic, age, social support, family arrangement) context in which women and men live, and to their differential exposure to lifestyle (smoking, drinking, exercise, diet) and psychosocial (critical life events, stress, psychological resources) factors? Are gender differences in health also attributable to gender differences in vulnerability to these structural, behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health? Multivariate analyses of Canadian National Population Health Survey data show gender differences in health (measured by self-rated health, functional health, chronic illness and distress). Social structural and psychosocial determinants of health are generally more important for women and behavioural determinants are generally more important for men. Gender differences in exposure to these forces contribute to inequalities in health between men and women, however, statistically significant inequalities remain after controlling for exposure. Gender-based health inequalities are further explained by differential vulnerabilities to social forces between men and women. Our findings suggest the value of models that include a wide range of health and health-determinant variables, and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in health."
10155880,1,a,"Reproduction is a dual commitment, but so often in much of the world, it is seen as wholly the woman's responsibility. She bears the burden not only of pregnancy and childbirth but also the threats from excessive child bearing, some responsibility for contraception, infertility investigation and often undiagnosed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including AIDS. Failure to target men in reproductive health interventions has weakened the impact of reproductive health care programmes. The paper proposes that sophisticated and dynamic strategies in Africa and elsewhere which target women's reproductive health and research (such as control of STDs including AIDS, family planning, infertility investigation) require complementary linkage to the study and education of men. Men's perceptions, as well as determinants of sexual behavioural change and the socioeconomic context in which STDs, including AIDS, become rife, should be reviewed. There is a need to study and foster change to reduce or prevent poor reproductive health outcomes; to identify behaviours which could be adversely affecting women's reproductive health. Issues of gender, identity and tolerance as expressed through sexuality and procreation need to be amplified in the context of present risks in reproductive health. Researchers and providers often ignore the social significance of men. This paper reviews the impact of male dominance, as manifested through reproductive health and sexual decisions, against the background of present reproductive health problems. A research agenda should define factors at both macro and micro levels that interact to adversely impinge on reproductive health outcomes. This should be followed up by well-developed causal models of the determinants of positive reproductive health-promoting behaviours. Behaviour specific influences in sexual partnership include the degree of interpersonal support towards prevention, for example, of STDs, unwanted pregnancy or maternal deaths. Perceived efficacy and situational variables influencing male compliance in, say, condom use, form part of the wider study that addresses men. Thus preventive reproductive health initiatives and information should move from the female alone to both sexes. Women need men as partners in reproductive health who understand the risks they might be exposed to and strategies for their prevention."
1473065,1,a,"The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the relationship between women's exercise participation and their social roles as well as characteristics of these roles, and 2) to determine the relative importance of social roles compared to non-role-related determinants (including social support, perceived barriers, interest in exercise, and perceived importance of exercise). A cross-sectional survey was done among 1,113 randomly selected urban women aged 20-49. Social roles did not emerge as a major risk factor for exercise participation. Statistical modelling indicated that whether women exercise was only related to role overload in the presence of the non-role-related determinants. For women exercising, parenthood as well as role overload were related to the amount of exercise in the presence of the non-role-related determinants. These findings have important implications for exercise promotion for women."
16217003,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Despite its effectiveness in reducing mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are low, especially among low-income and minority groups; however, physician recommendation can increase screening rates. METHODS: We performed a multilevel analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data linked to Medicare claims and the Area Resource File to identify determinants of racial and socioeconomic disparities in CRC screening among 9985 Medicare Parts A and B beneficiaries with a usual physician. Recent CRC screening was defined as receipt of either a home fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy at recommended intervals. RESULTS: Unadjusted rates of screening were 48% for white and 39% for black beneficiaries (P<.001). Racial differences in CRC screening receipt were eliminated after adjustment for socioeconomic status as measured by income and education. Socioeconomic status disparities decreased but remained significant after adjustment for personal and health system factors. Awareness of CRC (adjusted odds ratio, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, 2.29-3.33) and having a primary care generalist (vs another specialist) as one's usual physician (adjusted odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.53) were associated with higher odds of screening, controlling for other factors. The odds of screening were also higher among those whose usual physician was rated more highly on information-giving skills. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in CRC screening rates among Medicare beneficiaries with a usual physician are explained by differences in socioeconomic status. Beneficiaries with a primary care generalist as their usual physician had higher rates of CRC screening receipt. Increased efforts to make Medicare beneficiaries aware of the benefits of CRC screening may capitalize on the associations found in this study between CRC knowledge, physician information giving, and timely screening."
16443184,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To implement and evaluate the effectiveness of scenario-based learning as a method for teaching systems-based practice to pediatric residents. METHODS: Twelve pediatric residents at the University of Florida/Jacksonville participated in an active learning scenario experience during their 1-month community pediatrics block rotation from January 2003 to April 2004. A scenario, developed in partnership with community-based organizations, required the residents to assume the role of a parent faced with multiproblem life situations requiring skills in prioritizing problems and identifying and accessing community resources to address them. Residents documented their assessment of the experience as they went through it by making entries into a learning portfolio and at the end of the experience through written evaluations and exit interviews. A case study design was used to assess resident-perceived impact of this experience. Qualitative methods were used to analyze data from resident portfolio entries, resident written evaluation surveys, and resident exit interviews. RESULTS: Five themes, some of which reflect competencies in systems-based practice, emerged from the data: development of empathy and compassion, increased understanding of the barriers facing patients and families, increased appreciation of social determinants of health, self-perceived increased ability to serve patients, and advantages of active learning. CONCLUSIONS: Active learning experiences that simulate patient situations can be incorporated into community pediatrics training for residents, increasing perceived competence in systems-based practice."
11029135,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to predict and explain nurses' adherence to Universal Precautions (UPs) when performing venipunctures. METHODS: Data were gathered from 156 registered nurses working at a regional hospital. A self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial variables (intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived control, etc) was completed at baseline, and behavior was self-reported 3 months later. RESULTS: The regression of intention on the variables yielded an adjusted R(2) of 0.68, with perceived barriers (beta =.62, P <.001), social norm (beta =.17, P <.01), and personal normative belief (beta =.19, P <.01) being the significant variables. With respect to the 3-month follow-up, 28% of the variance associated with UPs adherence was explained by intention (beta =.37, P <.001) and perceived behavioral control (beta =.23, P <.05). Moreover, high (n = 116) and low intenders (n = 40) differed on several normative beliefs (P =.0003) and perceived barriers (P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that perception of control, assessed either globally or by means of a belief-based measure, is a key factor in adherence. Specifically, the perceived difficulties associated with adherence to UPs appear to be related to a nurse's training on UPs and to the existence of suboptimal working conditions."
17488897,0,a,"We used geographic information systems and a spatial analysis approach to explore the pattern of Ross River virus (RRV) incidence in Brisbane, Australia. Climate, vegetation and socioeconomic data in 2001 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Brisbane City Council and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Information on the RRV cases was obtained from the Queensland Department of Health. Spatial and multiple negative binomial regression models were used to identify the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of RRV transmission. The results show that RRV activity was primarily concentrated in the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern regions in Brisbane. Multiple negative binomial regression models showed that the spatial pattern of RRV disease in Brisbane seemed to be determined by a combination of local ecologic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors."
16288659,0,a,"BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination are significant determinants of HIV transmission in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T), where the adult HIV/AIDS prevalence is 2.5%. T&T is a spiritually-aware society and over 104 religious groups are represented. This religious diversity creates a complex social environment for the transmission of a sexually transmitted infection like HIV/AIDS. Religious leaders are esteemed in T&T's society and may use their position and frequent interactions with the public to promote HIV/AIDS awareness, fight stigma and discrimination, and exercise compassion for people living with HIV/AIDS (PWHA). Some religious groups have initiated HIV/AIDS education programs within their membership, but previous studies suggest that HIV/AIDS remains a stigmatized infection in many religious organizations. The present study investigates how the perception of HIV/AIDS as a sexually transmitted infection impacts religious representatives' incentives to respond to HIV/AIDS in their congregations and communities. In correlation, the study explores how the experiences of PWHA in religious gatherings impact healing and coping with HIV/AIDS. METHODS: Between November 2002 and April 2003, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 religious representatives from 10 Christian, Hindu and Muslim denominations. The majority of respondents were leaders of religious services, while two were active congregation members. Religious groups were selected based upon the methods of Brathwaite. Briefly, 26 religious groups with the largest followings according to 2000 census data were identified in Trinidad and Tobago. From this original list, 10 religious groups in Northwest Trinidad were selected to comprise a representative sample of the island's main denominations. In-depth interviews with PWHA were conducted during the same study period, 2002-2003. Four individuals were selected from a care and support group located in Port of Spain based upon their perceived willingness to discuss religious affiliation and describe how living with a terminal infection has affected their spiritual lives. The interviewer, a United States Fulbright Scholar, explained the nature and purpose of the study to all participants. Relevant ethical procedures associated with the collection of interview data were adopted: interviews were conducted in a non-coercive manner and confidentiality was assured. All participants provided verbal consent, and agreed to be interviewed without financial or other incentive. Ethics approval was granted on behalf of the Caribbean Conference of Churches Ethics Committee. Interview questions followed a guideline, and employed an open-ended format to facilitate discussion. All interviews were recorded and transcribed by the interviewer. RESULTS: Religious representatives' opinions were grouped into the following categories: rationale for the spread of HIV/AIDS, abstinence, condom use, sexuality and homosexuality, compassion, experiences with PWHA, recommendations and current approach to addressing HIV/AIDS in congregations. Religious representatives expressed a measure of acceptance of HIV/AIDS and overwhelmingly upheld compassion for PWHA. Some statements, however, suggested that HIV/AIDS stigma pervades Trinidad's religious organizations. For many representatives, HIV/AIDS was associated with a promiscuous lifestyle and/or homosexuality. Representatives had varying levels of interaction with PWHA, but personal experiences were positively associated with current involvement in HIV/AIDS initiatives. All 4 PWHA interviewed identified themselves as belonging to Christian denominations. Three out of the 4 PWHA described discriminatory experiences with pastors or congregation members during gatherings for religious services. Nonetheless, PWHA expressed an important role for faith and religion in coping with HIV. CONCLUSION: Religious groups in Trinidad are being challenged to promote a clear and consistent response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; a response that may reflect personal experiences and respect religious doctrine in the context of sex and sexuality. The study suggests that (1) religious leaders could improve their role in the fight against HIV/AIDS with education and sensitization-specifically aimed at dismantling the myths about HIV transmission, and the stereotyping of susceptible sub-populations, and (2) a consultative dialogue between PWHAs and religious leaders is pivotal to a successful faith-based HIV intervention in Trinidad."
14757305,0,a,"The objective of the study was to examine the sociodemographic and clinical factors influencing gender-specific attempted suicide. Suicide attempters, 40 males and 88 females, seen on a consultation-liaison psychiatric service over a period of 42 months (from January 1, 1999 to June 30, 2002) were compared on sociodemographic and clinical variables. The female attempters [22.99 years (SD 8.1)] were younger than their male counterparts [25.15 years (SD 9.5)] [P = 0.0002]. A higher proportion of the male attempters were engaged in outside occupations, compared with their female counterparts who were mainly full-time housewives or engaged in domestic duties [P = 0.003]. Alcohol misuse was more associated with male suicide attempts [P = 0.001]. Ninety percent of male attempters and 54.6% of the female attempters had the intention to die [P = 0.001]. Although depressive episode was the most common psychiatric disorder in male attempters, followed by neurotic and stress-related disorders, while neurotic and stress-related disorders ranked first in female attempters followed closely by depressive episode, the difference was not significant. However, significantly more male attempters required pharmacotherapy and psychological intervention than their female counterparts [P = 0.002]. More females had marital difficulties, although comparing the two groups on social difficulties did not yield a significant difference. Method used, personality disorders, previous attempt, repeat attempt, race, religion, and marital status were not significant distinguishing factors. Younger age, lack of employment outside home, marital problems, and nondeath motives were more influential in female attempted suicide, while alcohol misuse and severe psychiatric morbidity were more frequently associated with male attempted suicide. The findings support gender-specific preventive and interventional strategies."
12343065,1,a,"""In this review I draw upon statistical demography and, to a lesser extent, reproductive endocrinology to formulate a coherent strategy for investigating fertility and reproduction in anthropological populations. The object, it must be emphasized, is not to reduce anthropology to demography or endocrinology, but rather to acquaint anthropologists with a powerful set of tools with which they can address issues of anthropological interest."" The author first discusses the concept of natural fertility. Next, he summarizes the most significant generalizations concerning variations in fertility among preindustrial societies using the concept of proximate determinants developed by John Bongaarts. Finally, he outlines an alternative approach that might be more suited to the analysis of such fertility variations."
19135287,0,a,"Although individual factors have been shown to predict weight gain, contextual determinants have also attracted attention, with some authors stressing the role played by deprivation, urban sprawl, social capital and safety. Recent evidence has implicated environmental factors that facilitate the consumption of excess calories and/or make it more difficult to expend them in routine physical activity. The interrelationships found in some places between physical and social environments (key mediators) and body mass index (BMI), as well as the potential that exists for the development of healthier places, mean that more research is required into the contextual determinants of health. In Portugal, particularly in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), the effects of physical and social environments on physical activity and BMI have not previously been explored in any detail. This study aims to highlight the associations between residential (physical and social) environment and the risk of weight gain and obesity, over and above individual attributes, assessing which indicators are the best predictors of excess weight in the LMA. The study involved data from 7669 individuals aged 18 and over from 143 neighbourhoods. Self-reported body height and weight were used to define overweight body mass index (BMI> or =25). BMI and individual (socio-demographic and behavioural) characteristics were linked to contextual data and analysed in a multilevel framework. Our findings show that different environmental factors are significantly associated with excess weight and obesity, either directly or indirectly (e.g. health-related behaviours such as eating patterns and physical activity, which are key mediators), after adjustment for individual characteristics. The results suggest that a deeper understanding of these mechanisms is critical if we want to tackle the obesity epidemic, and that policies aimed at weight control and obesity reduction must address people and places in order to bear fruit."
18194525,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Considering the high costs of sick leave and the consequences of sick leave for employees, an early return-to-work of employees with mental disorders is very important. Therefore, a workplace intervention is developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for employees with low back pain. The objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of one year. Employees eligible for this study are on sick leave for 2 to 8 weeks with common mental disorders. The workplace intervention will be compared with usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise approach that aims to reach consensus about a return-to-work plan by active participation and strong commitment of both the sick-listed employee and the supervisor. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome of this study is lasting return-to-work, which will be acquired from continuous registration systems of the companies after the follow-up. Secondary outcomes are total number of days of sick leave during the follow-up, severity of common mental disorders, coping style, job content, and attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal perspective. A process evaluation will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: Return-to-work is difficult to discuss in the workplace for sick-listed employees with mental disorders and their supervisors. Therefore, this intervention offers a unique opportunity for the sick-listed employee and the supervisor to discuss barriers for return-to-work. Results of this study will possibly contribute to improvement of disability management for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Results will become available in 2009. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN92307123."
10215116,1,a,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are an important public health problem, due to their medical, social and economic repercussions. Therefore, more knowledge is needed about the sexual behaviour that promotes their spread, in order to improve control and prevention strategies. Our aim was to determine the frequency of male condom use associated with sexual behaviour factors, a history of and knowledge about STDs in a sample of the male population in Mexico City. During 1994 a cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out, using multi-stage sampling with conglomerates, in 1377 men from 15 to 49 years old. The mean age was 34.5 years (SD 7.5 years). Mean age at first sexual relations was 17.7 years (SD 2.8 years). The global proportion of condom use during the last sexual relation was 24.6%; use according to type of female sex partner in the last year was 18.8% with regular partners and 62.5% with occasional partners. The principal predictors of male condom use, identified through statistical modelling, were: younger age (<25 years), middle and high education level (>9 years), middle and high socioeconomic level and type of sexual partners (occasional and regular). This population has risk factors for acquiring and transmitting some STDs, such as occasional sexual partners and a history of STDs. Characteristics which are important in relation to male condom use were identified, such as age (younger than 35), education (complete junior high school or more) and type of sexual partners (occasional and regular)."
17876483,0,a,"More than any other low- and middle-income country, Brazil has the longest research tradition of establishing, maintaining and exploiting birth cohort studies. This research pedigree is highlighted in the present issue of the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, which contains a series of twelve papers from the Ribeirao Preto and Sao Luis birth cohort studies from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, respectively. The topics covered in this raft of reports vary and include predictors of perinatal health and maternal risk factors, early life determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in childhood and adolescence, use of health services, and a description of dietary characteristics of young adults, amongst other topics. There is also a guide to the background, objectives, sampling and protocols employed across these studies, which, together with similar pieces published in past issues of the Brazilian Journal, serve as a very useful starting point, particularly for potential collaborators. In the fervent hope that further follow-up of these cohorts will take place--we provide our own justification for cohort maintenance and extension in this issue--future data collection could include: genetic material, atherosclerosis, ascertained, for instance, by intima-media thickness, and IQ testing in children--scores from which are emerging as potentially important predictors of adult health outcomes up to six decades later."
19036043,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The rates of initiation and duration of breastfeeding in France are low when compared with those in other European countries. The objective of this study was to determine attributions of breastfeeding determinants in a French population. METHODS: A self-report survey listing 68 reasons for or against breastfeeding was developed. Nine hundred nine participants from the general population rated their level of agreement with each reason by means of a Likert-type scale. The survey explored gender, age, parenthood, decision to breastfeed, having friends who had breastfed, having family members who had breastfed, and having been breastfed themselves when younger. Exploratory factorial analyses extracted six factors for breastfeeding and five factors against breastfeeding. All the factors were entered in regression analyses to predict demographic variables that determined attributions for and against breastfeeding. Individuals were measured at two points in time to account for test-retest reliability (28.1 days +/- 6.95 day lapse). RESULTS: Determinants varied significantly with respect to gender, age, parenthood, and breastfeeding history. High endorsement for breastfeeding involved breastfeeding to fulfill gender roles, to prevent health risks, and because of external encouragement; little endorsement was given for the physiological advantages for babies, pleasant sensations, and preference factors. In terms of not breastfeeding, high endorsement was observed in lack of support, negative attitudes, and infant formula reasoning factors; medical and physiological reasons for not breastfeeding showed low endorsement. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed a strong impact of society and cultural norms on feeding choice. If breastfeeding initiation and duration rates are to be increased, we suggest approaching the rest of the population in addition to pregnant women and mothers since society as a whole influences the decision to breastfeed."
1901487,1,a,"A field trial was conducted to compare the effects of eight health education and economic incentive interventions on the awareness and acceptance of cataract surgery. Cataract screening and follow-up surgery were offered to more than 19,000 residents age 40 years and older in a probability sample of 90 villages in south India. Eight months after intervention, an evaluation was conducted to identify those in need of surgery who had been operated on. Two principal measures of program effectiveness are examined: awareness of cataract surgery and acceptance of the surgery. The type of intervention had a negligible effect on awareness of cataract surgery. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals who were aware of surgery tended to be male, literate, and more affluent than those who were unaware of that option. Interventions that covered the complete costs of surgery had higher surgery acceptance rates. One health education strategy, house-to-house visits by a subject with aphakia, increased acceptance of the procedure more than others. In a multiple logistic regression analysis of acceptance rates, persons accepting surgery tended to be male; other factors were not important in explaining variation in acceptance rates."
17721671,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Psychoeducational groups are a common component of interventions in schizophrenia. AIMS: To explore patients' views about wanted and unwanted effects of group psychoeducation. METHOD: Subjective feedback of 103 participants of a psychoeducational intervention as well as data from two specific focus groups-one with ""enthusiastic"" and one with ""critical"" participants-were analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participants emphasized the importance of information received and of exchanging information with others suffering from the same disorder. Positive effects on coping, activation and social interaction were reported. Perceived overemphasis on illness related information produced defensive reactions, whereas the integration of quality of life topics was appreciated. A pleasant group atmosphere and clinical stability were suggested as important determinants of success. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative analyzses of participants' views help to understand the potentials of a psychoeducational intervention in schizophrenia."
7959400,1,a,"The main determinants of rehospitalization of elderly people were studied with a longitudinal sample of 264 persons older than 60 years at a midwestern, urban, university-affiliated hospital. Path analysis was applied to survey data collected for this study. Seventeen percent of subjects were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, the main determinant of readmission was the discharge placement; those placed back into the community for care in the home were more likely to be rehospitalized than those discharged to institutions. Contrary to predictions in the literature and the authors' expectations, patient involvement in discharge planning had no discernible effect on placement decisions and subsequent hospitalization. The implications of these findings for discharge planning by social workers are discussed."
9533739,1,a,"The paper focuses on the role of the spouse's occupation as a resource for mobile individuals, from the perspective that social positions are held by families, rather than by individuals. Three groups are confronted in terms of the role of the key variables and other relevant factors: men whose spouse does not have a paid job (group 1), men and women whose spouse has a paid job (group 2 and 3). The data set is provided by the national survey on social mobility in Italy, carried out in 1985; social achievements of members of the three groups are considered, including social origins and destinations, social position corresponding to respondent's first job, cultural background (educational achievement of respondent's father and mother found), respondent's education and spouse's social position. The techniques used are discriminant analysis and back propagation Neural Networks. Both techniques traced a clear boundary between group 1 and groups 2 and 3, which were discriminated mainly on the basis of the spouse's occupation; Artificial Neural Networks reached better classification results and allowed a deeper insight into the nonlinear effects of the discriminating variables for the three groups."
7487339,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Studies of adult antisocial behavior or criminality usually find genetic factors to be more important than the family environment, whereas studies of delinquency find the family environment to be more important. We compared DSM-III-R antisocial personality disorder symptoms before vs after the age of 15 years within a sample of twins, rather than comparing across studies. METHODS: We administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version III-revised by telephone to 3226 pairs of male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Biometrical modeling was applied to each symptom of antisocial personality disorder and summary measures of juvenile and adult symptoms. RESULTS: Five juvenile symptoms were significantly heritable, and five were significantly influenced by the shared environment. Eight adult symptoms were significantly heritable, and one was significantly influenced by the shared environment. The shared environment explained about six times more variance in juvenile anti-social traits than in adult traits. Shared environmental influences on adult antisocial traits overlapped entirely with those on juvenile traits. Additive genetic factors explained about six times more variance in adult vs juvenile traits. The juvenile genetic determinants overlapped completely with genetic influences on adult traits. The unique environment (plus measurement error) explained the largest proportion of variance in both juvenile and adult antisocial traits. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of the shared or family environment that promote antisocial behavior during childhood and early adolescence also promote later antisocial behavior, but to a much lesser extent. Genetic causal factors are much more prominent for adult than for juvenile antisocial traits."
15918661,0,a,"Our knowledge of juvenile delinquency has progressed considerably since the early 1980s, thanks to self-reported delinquency surveys. They teach us that the determinants of delinquent behaviors among teenagers are dependent on the facility with which the offense is committed, the internal motivation (frustration in the family and school, observational learning of the use of violence in the media) and the weakness of social reactions."
19577695,0,a,"The world's almost 400 million Indigenous people have low standards of health. This poor health is associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, poor hygiene, environmental contamination, and prevalent infections. Inadequate clinical care and health promotion, and poor disease prevention services aggravate this situation. Some Indigenous groups, as they move from traditional to transitional and modern lifestyles, are rapidly acquiring lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, and physical, social, and mental disorders linked to misuse of alcohol and of other drugs. Correction of these inequities needs increased awareness, political commitment, and recognition rather than governmental denial and neglect of these serious and complex problems. Indigenous people should be encouraged, trained, and enabled to become increasingly involved in overcoming these challenges."
12818312,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Despite great strides in improving prenatal care utilization among American women, key perinatal indicators have remained stagnant or worsened in the past decade, and the United States continues to rank near the bottom compared to other developed countries. A new approach is needed if we are to achieve improvements in perinatal health. METHODS: To propose a new framework that integrates a ""life span"" approach with a multiple determinants model. RESULTS: We recognize that (1) powerful influences on outcome occur long before pregnancy begins; (2) pregnancy outcome is shaped by social, psychological, behavioral, environmental, and biological forces; and (3) the demography of pregnancy has changed dramatically in the last few decades with more women delaying their first birth. Approaches that simultaneously consider the entire life span as well as multiple determinants may need to be adopted. We propose a framework that integrates these approaches and is supported by the research literature. The life span perspective focuses attention toward the preconceptional and interconceptional periods as targets for intervention in improving perinatal health. The multiple determinants model distinguishes among concepts of disease, health and functioning, and well-being for both women and their offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Our intent is to influence how policymakers, public health professionals, clinicians, and researchers approach perinatal health."
16996670,0,a,"This study investigates the geography of racial disparities in low birthweight in New York City by focusing on racial residential segregation and its effect on the risk of low birthweight among African-American infants and mothers. This cross-sectional multilevel analysis uses birth records at the individual level (n=96,882) and racial isolation indices at the census tract or neighborhood level (n=2095) to measure their independent and cross-level effects on low birthweight. This study found that residential segregation and neighborhood poverty operate at different scales to increase the risk of low birthweight. At the neighborhood scale residential segregation is positively and significantly associated with low birthweight, after controlling for individual-level risk factors and neighborhood poverty. Residential segregation explains neighborhood variation in low birthweight means and race effects across census tracts, which cannot be accounted for by neighborhood poverty alone. At the individual scale-increasing levels of residential segregation does not significantly reduce or exacerbate individual-level risk factors for low birthweight; whereas increasing levels of neighborhood poverty significantly eliminates the race effect and reduces the protective effect of being foreign-born on low birthweight, after controlling for other individual-level risk factors and residential segregation. These findings are contradictory to previous health research that shows protective mechanisms associated with ethnic density in local areas. It is likely that structural factors underlying residential segregation, i.e., racial isolation, impose additional stressors on African-American women that may offset or disguise positive attributes associated with ethnic density. However, as poverty is concentrated within these neighborhoods, differences between races in low birthweight cease to exist. This study demonstrates that residential segregation and neighborhood poverty are important determinants of racial disparity in low birthweight in New York City."
19121600,0,a,"This article examines the role of environmental and individual factors in the social epidemiology of chikungunya disease on the island of Mayotte (South-western Indian Ocean). In an epidemic setting, an interdisciplinary study combining interviews, observations, and serological tests was conducted to: (1) estimate the frequency and social distribution of chikungunya disease and (2) identify its principal cognitive, behavioral, and environmental determinants within a stratified random sample of the Mayotte population (n=888). Semi-parametric tests and multiple correspondence analyses were used to describe the statistical relationships between the different classes of variables examined in this study and the presence of antibodies attributable to chikungunya. These analyses highlighted differences between two main types of populations: one more autochthonous, more urban and better educated population, which shared 'legitimate' representations of the disease-from a biomedical viewpoint; and the other more migrant, more suburban, and more deprived, which is characterized by folk theories of chikungunya virus infection. Moreover, a series of logistic regression models revealed that social disparities in the distribution of virus infection were primarily structured by the housing conditions and cognitive representations of the disease held by the participants. These results suggest that environmental and individual factors are equally crucial in epidemic settings, and that they could explain, to a considerable extent, the social differences observed in morbidity associated with recent emerging infectious diseases in tropical countries."
19241490,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 5-year trajectory of physical activity among women with breast cancer, and to evaluate biopsychosocial variables (health status, physical symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), depressive symptoms, and social support), measured soon after breast cancer diagnosis, as predictors of the 5-year trajectory. METHODS: Women diagnosed with Stage II or III regional breast cancer (n=227), surgically treated and awaiting the start of adjuvant therapy completed baseline assessments of medical, psychological, and behavioral functioning. Follow-up evaluations were conducted every 4 months during the first year and every 6 months during the subsequent 4 years (12 assessments total during the 5-year study). Mixed-effects modeling was utilized to estimate the baseline level of physical activity as well as rate of change over time. Measures of physical health status, HRQL, depressive symptoms, and social support were included as predictors of the physical activity trajectory. RESULTS: A curvilinear pattern of change in physical activity was evident over the 5-year follow-up (p=0.002). Physical activity increased gradually during the first 18 months, then declined steadily over the subsequent 42 months. Poor physical health, depressive symptoms, and lower emotional HRQL were associated with less physical activity. Higher family support was associated with a slower decline in physical activity in the latter 42 months of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional HRQL following diagnosis with breast cancer appears to be important for sustaining physical activity in the first 1-2 years following diagnosis. Physical activity interventions among breast cancer survivors should address depressive symptoms early in the course of treatment."
29313991,0,a,"1. The spatial organization of a badger population (North Nibley) is described before and after it was subjected to a UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food badger removal operation (BRO) intended to control bovine tuberculosis. Comparison is made with an undisturbed badger population (Woodchester Park). 2. The Woodchester Park population was organized in group territories with clearly defined boundaries that remained stable during the 3 years of study (1995-97). In North Nibley, however, the badgers' spatial organization was severely perturbed in the first year and, to a lesser extent, also in the second year after the BRO, with badgers using latrines further away from their setts. This resulted in enlarged social group ranges that were difficult to define and overlapped considerably. 3. The disturbance was observed in the removal groups, those immediately adjacent, as well as those at a distance of one or two social groups from the removal area, with an unexpected indication that the latter groups may have been the most affected. 4. The apparent increase in the size of the group ranges in North Nibley was likely to have been caused by an increased proportion of badgers making extra-group excursions in the aftermath of the BRO. 5. Initial recolonization was almost exclusively by females. 6. Although such perturbation might be expected to facilitate disease transmission between badger social groups, there was no evidence that any infectious animals had survived the BRO. However, there were further cattle breakdowns in the area. 7. The behaviour of badgers after the BRO also provided an opportunity to test predictions made by competing hypotheses about the main determinants of the badger's socio-spatial behaviour."
10726937,0,a,"In order to understand and elicit the psychosocial factors influencing compliance with sexual partner referral, 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 40 individual interviews based on the attitude-social influence-self efficacy (ASE) model were held in Mbarara District of Uganda. The focus groups were derived from both rural and urban areas. Informal interviews were held with 20 men and 20 women presenting with symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) at the outpatient department of Mbarara Hospital. The emerging outcome of attitudinal beliefs regarding health consequences of partner referral were mainly positive. However, outcome beliefs relating to the relationship with the partners were mainly negative. Social influence for sexual partner referral was from health-care providers, partner(s), friends and relatives. The self-efficacy beliefs were mainly negative especially among women. Barriers hampering sexual partner referral were related to poor quality of health care, gender relations and type of sexual partners. There is a need to target these beliefs and self-efficacy expectations in health education and STD counselling and for more research to evaluate the psychosocial determinants of sexual partner referral quantitatively."
7664957,1,a,"The question of how postpartum sexual abstinence responds to social change in West Africa is important because declines in the practice could increase fertility levels and worsen child and maternal health. This study uses data from the late 1970s in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Cameroon to examine effects of modernization and women's status on the length of abstinence. The results show that modernization and female status should be associated with declines in abstinence, which could lead to an increase in fertility and deterioration in maternal and child health."
9632482,1,a,"We conducted three experiments to examine variables that might influence the longevity of socially induced food preferences in Norway rats. The duration of social influence on the food choices of 42-day-old rats (1) increased with both increasing numbers of demonstrators and increasing numbers of demonstrations by a single demonstrator, (2) varied with the temporal distribution of demonstrations, but (3) did not vary with the age of demonstrators. The results suggest that a single episode of social learning produces short-term, but not long-term, effects on a Norway rat's food choices.

15969760,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength and predisposition to increased risk of fracture, with consequent increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is therefore an important public health problem. International and Canadian associations have issued clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OP. In this study, we identified potential predictors of bone mineral density (BMD) testing and OP treatment, which include place of residence. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Quebec Health Insurance Board. The studied population consisted of all individuals 65 years and older for whom a physician claimed a consultation for a low velocity vertebral, hip, wrist, or humerus fracture in 1999 and 2000. Individuals were considered to have undergone BMD testing if there was a claim for such a procedure within two years following a fracture. They were considered to have received an OP treatment if there was at least one claim to Quebec's health insurance plan (RAMQ) for OP treatment within one year following a fracture. We performed descriptive analyses and logistic regressions by gender. Predictors included age, site of fracture, social status, comorbidity index, prior BMD testing, prior OP treatment, long-term glucocorticoid use, and physical distance to BMD device. RESULTS: The cohort, 77% of which was female, consisted of 25,852 individuals with fragility fractures. BMD testing and OP treatment rates were low and gender dependent (BMD: men 4.6%; women 13.1%; OP treatment: men 9.9%; women 29.7%). There was an obvious regional variation, particularly in BMD testing, ranging from 0 to 16%. Logistic regressions demonstrate that individuals living in long term care facilities received less BMD testing. Patients who had suffered from vertebral fractures, or who had received prior OP treatment or BMD testing, regardless of gender, subsequently received more BMD testing and OP treatments. Furthermore, increasing the distance between a patient's residence and BMD facility precluded likelihood of BMD testing. CONCLUSION: BMD testing rate was extremely low but not completely explained by reduced physical access; gender, age, social status, prior BMD testing and OP treatment were all important predictors for future BMD testing and OP treatment."
19459122,0,a,"Often missing from the discourse on alcohol use is that ""alcohol-related problems among college students"" appears to be a euphemism for ""white college men"" in that students who experience alcohol-related problems disproportionately tend to be white men. An important aspect of promoting social and behavioral change is to understand race-related mechanisms that structure desire for students to engage in alcohol use. This article presents findings based on undergraduate students attending a Midwest university. The current study contributes to the theoretical literature on alcohol use and race. We use logistic regression models which suggest race and attitudes pertaining to race relations matter in predicting non-binge drinking and abstinence behavior."
9642904,1,a,"This study examines the determinants of social support among a sample of 642 caregivers of persons with AIDS living in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Respondents include both traditional family caregivers (mothers, spouses, other relatives) and non-traditional caregivers (friends, homosexual partners). Multiple regression analyses are conducted to assess the independent effects of six sets of variables on emotional and instrumental support: social-structural factors (age, education, employment status), caregiver's relationship to the person with AIDS, situational variables (caregiver's HIV status, patient's functional disability, interpersonal conflict), social network factors (contact with family, contact with friends, community integration), personal resources (mastery, caregiving competence), and use of formal community services (patient-directed services, caregiver-directed services). A number of factors and conditions appear to be relevant for caregiver support. For example, results indicate that network factors, including frequency of contact, conflict, and community integration, are importantly related to caregivers' perceptions of emotional support. There is also a trend suggesting lower emotional support among traditional family caregivers, relative to nonfamily caregivers, within gender categories. With respect to instrumental assistance with caregiving, factors that place greater demands and time constraints on caregivers, such as being employed and caring for an AIDS patient with greater functional limitations, appear to increase the level of informal instrumental support the caregiver receives. Partners and spouses, however, receive significantly lower instrumental assistance, independent of other factors. Implications of the findings are discussed."
19577695,0,a,"The world's almost 400 million Indigenous people have low standards of health. This poor health is associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, poor hygiene, environmental contamination, and prevalent infections. Inadequate clinical care and health promotion, and poor disease prevention services aggravate this situation. Some Indigenous groups, as they move from traditional to transitional and modern lifestyles, are rapidly acquiring lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, and physical, social, and mental disorders linked to misuse of alcohol and of other drugs. Correction of these inequities needs increased awareness, political commitment, and recognition rather than governmental denial and neglect of these serious and complex problems. Indigenous people should be encouraged, trained, and enabled to become increasingly involved in overcoming these challenges."
19225218,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Studies have shown that interpersonal relations at work are important for several health related outcomes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether low social support, serious conflict, exclusion by superiors or by co-workers at work may be determinants of depression. METHODS: In a representative Swedish cohort study data were obtained in two waves three years apart. 4,040 women and men who did not change their jobs between the waves were chosen for the study. Exposure and confounders were obtained at Time 1 and outcome, depression according to Bech's MDI at Time 2. Previous depression was controlled for by adjusting for depression at Time 1. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Odds-ratios adjusted for possible confounders and depression at base-line showed significant effects for all four exposures on depression (adjusted OR, low social support 1.5 CI 95% 1.1-2.0, serious conflict 1.4 CI 95% 1.1-1.9, exclusion by superiors 1.6 CI 95% 1.2-2.1 and exclusion by co-workers 1.7 CI 95% 1.2-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: The present results support the conclusion that problematic interpersonal relationships at work can be determinants of depression. These prospective findings may be of relevance for prevention and when rehabilitating depressed patients."
10981477,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To describe a case study of a community-based intervention located in the Harlem community of New York City, one of the oldest African-American communities in the United States. Although not specifically designed to prevent HIV infection, the program, 'Family to Family', exemplifies a 'structural intervention' that was created to strengthen family functioning and to strengthen the bonds that connect families to each other. By fostering strong relationships within and between families in a community with high rates of violence, drug abuse, and HIV infection, the program seeks to improve the quality of neighborhood life and influence the social determinants of individual risk behavior. SOCIAL CAPITAL: Family to Family was created specifically to develop the 'social capital' that is available to children and families in the Harlem community. Social capital refers to resources that result from social relationships, and that enhance an individual's or a group's ability to function and achieve a given set of goals and objectives. In addition to fostering closer relationships between children and their parents, this program also works to help participating families develop closer relationships with other participating families and with Columbia University student and faculty volunteers. Finally, Family to Family is sustained through the efforts of volunteers; it receives no grant support and is entirely self-supporting. CONCLUSIONS: Family to Family has the potential to change the social dynamics that promote HIV risk behavior in communities such as Harlem. Should it prove successful in improving the relationships between families and children, and in increasing the social capital available to all of its participants, it may become an important asset to public health prevention specialists concerned about preventing the spread of HIV."
1562983,1,a,"In 1983, the National Cancer Institute began a social-epidemiologic study of possible behavioral and biologic determinants of black/white racial disparities in cancer survival. The design, methodology, underlying hypotheses, and patient accrual of this study are discussed. Survival differences in four organ sites are investigated: cancers of the uterine corpus, breast, bladder, and colon. The first three sites were chosen because of significant observed black/white differentials in survival. Although racial disparities in survival from colon cancer are less prominent, this site was included because it is a leading cause of deaths attributable to cancer, because regional variations have been observed in black/white survival disparities, and because colon data permit cross-gender comparisons. Data collection centers for the study included the Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics, the Louisiana Tumor Registry, and the California Tumor Registry. Probability samples of patients newly diagnosed with these cancers were drawn from the areas served by these registries. Diagnostic years of eligibility were 1985 to 1986 for breast and colon cancer, and 1985 to 1987 for bladder and uterine corpus cancer. Data were collected by personal interview, medical records abstract, physician records, and pathology review. Analyses focus on seven main explanatory hypotheses."

14722836,0,a,"A positive parent-child relationship is one of the most important determinants of a healthy cognitive, emotional and social development. The relationship from parent to child is determined by parenting styles. Parenting styles are characterised by the two dimensions parental attitudes and rearing practices. The development and the psychometric properties of a questionnaire on parental attitudes and rearing practices (FEPS), which contains an extended version of the Parental Bonding Instrument by Parker et al. (PBI, 1979) and two scales on parental reinforcement and punishment behaviour, is presented. In a sample of 457 women and 159 men factorial and item analysis revealed four scales (care, autonomy, low punishment and low material reinforcement). The care dimension contained items of immaterial reinforcement on the positive pole and items of coldness and ignorance as means of punishment on the negative pole. Based on findings from its first application in a clinical study it can be assumed that the FEPS differentiates between clinical and non-clinical populations. Additionally, varying patterns of the four scales may emerge as risk factors for the development of certain psychiatric/psychological problems."
12316385,1,a,"This review culls disparate elements from the theoretical and research literature on human migration to argue for the construction of a theory of migration that simultaneously incorporates multiple levels of analysis within a longitudinal perspective. A detailed review of interconnections among individual behavior, household strategies, community structures, and national political economies indicates that inter-level and inter-temporal dependencies are inherent to the migration process and give it a strong internal momentum. The dynamic interplay between network growth and individual migration labor, migration remittances, and local income distributions all create powerful feedback mechanisms that lead to the cumulative causation of migration. These mechanisms are reinforced and shaped by macrolevel relationships within the larger political economy."
8746967,1,a,"Psychosocial correlates of fruit and vegetable consumption were studied in an adult Dutch population (n = 367) based on the ASE model of attitudes, social influence and self-efficacy. Attitudes were a summation of beliefs about taste, different health consequences, and costs in time and money. Social influences were measured through the social stimulation respondents expected to get from important others to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables and by asking the subjects about the behaviour of important others. Self-efficacy reflected the respondents' ability to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables in various situations. Self-efficacy and attitudes were consistently and significantly associated with consumption of boiled or otherwise heated vegetables, of salads, and of fruit. Furthermore, respondents reporting low consumption of these food groups had lower self-efficacy expectations and less positive attitudes than subjects with relatively high consumption of fruit and vegetables. It is concluded that nutrition education aimed at stimulating fruit and vegetable consumption should focus especially on changing attitudes and self efficacy expectations."
9635219,1,a,"Accumulating evidence suggests that social contexts in early life have important and complex effects on childhood psychopathology. Spurred by the lack of an explicit operational definition that could guide the study of such effects, we define a social context operationally as ""a set of interpersonal conditions, relevant to a particular behavior or disorder and external to, but shaped and interpreted by, the individual child."" Building on this definition, we offer a series of recommendations for future research, based on five theoretically derived propositions: (a) Contexts are nested and multidimensional; (b) contexts broaden, differentiate, and deepen with age, becoming more specific in their effects; (c) contexts and children are mutually determining; (d) a context's meaning to the child determines its effects on the child and arises from the context's ability to provide for fundamental needs; and (e) contexts should be selected for assessment in light of specific questions or outcomes. As reflected in an increasingly rich legacy of literature on child development and psychopathology, social contexts appear to influence emerging mental disorders through dynamic, bidirectional interactions with individual children. Future research will benefit from examining not only statistical interactions between child- and context-specific factors, but also the actual transactions between children and contexts and the transduction of contextual influences into pathways of biological mediation. Because adverse contexts exert powerful effects on the mental health of children, it is important for the field to generate new, more theoretically grounded research addressing the contextual determinants of psychological well-being and disorder."
9041742,1,a,"The study reported here sought to assess Pap test coverage of a group of asymptomatic Argentine women from the poor urban district of La Matanza in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area Initially, all 2495 women who voluntarily enrolled in a program for early detection of breast cancer between January 1991 and June 1993 were included. After removing those who did not meet various study criteria, there remained 779 study subjects with no gynecologic or mammary symptomatology. Two subgroups of these 779 were established-women who had received a Pap test at any time and those who had received such a test within the previous three years. Using these subgroups, the influence of certain sociodemographic and other variables upon the likelihood of Pap testing was assessed. The results indicated significant associations between past Pap testing and age, formal education, parity, and a family history of cancer Likewise, significant associations were found between Pap testing within the preceding three years and age, formal education, and parity. The study findings affirm the idea that it would be advisable to seek Pap testing for all study population women once every three years instead of every year. Since the study population was not necessarily representative of Buenos Aires population, however, and the findings could have been affected by self-selection and other biases, additional studies are needed to determine actual Pap test coverage among women of the metropolitan area."
15053395,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To establish the relationship between seroprevalence for antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi and its relationship with biotic and abiotic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between August 2000 and September 2001. The study population consisted of a simple random sample of 390 volunteers residing in Palmar de Bravo, Puebla, Mexico. Sample and data collection procedures included assaying antibodies against T. cruzi with validated assays, and searching for domestic reservoirs and triatomine bugs. The relationship between biotic and abiotic factors with seropositivity was assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted using Kappa values for diagnostic tests; statistical significance was assessed with 2 x 2 tables, chi-squared test with Yates' correction, Fisher exact test, and odds ratios. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in humans was 4%; in domestic reservoirs (horses, pigs, and dogs) only 10% of canine reservoirs were positive. Vector species recognized were T. borberi and T. pallidipennis, with a Dispersion Area Index and a Colonization Index of 55% and 40%, respectively. The most important risk factors associated with positive serology were altitude (>2,150 and <2,180 meters above sea level), presence of triatomines, age, time of residence, and participation in a social assistance program. CONCLUSIONS: T. cruzi infection was identified in human beings, vectors, and possibly in domestic reservoirs, in communities located over 2,000 meters above sea level."
17028277,0,a,"The expression of virulence determinants in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is coordinately regulated in response to both the social environment--commonly referred to as quorum sensing--and to environmental cues. In this study we have dissected the various independent regulation levels for pyocyanin production, which is influenced by the homoserine lactone- and Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS)-mediated quorum-sensing systems as well as by iron and phosphate availability. We demonstrate that the phosphate regulon is involved in the transcriptional activation of rhlR and the augmentation of PQS and pyocyanin production under phosphate limitation. However, we also observed an enhancement of rhlR transcription under low-iron medium conditions and after the addition of PQS that was independent of the phosphate regulon. These results highlight the complexity of secondary metabolite production in P. aeruginosa via environmental cues and the quorum-sensing system."
12048146,0,a,"Neurocognitive deficits are believed to be important predictors of functional outcome in chronic psychotic disorders, but few supporting studies have utilized prospective designs and adequate control. The aim of this study was to estimate the relative influence of symptoms and neurocognitive deficits on the development of social behavior skills in a cohort of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder recovering from acute symptom exacerbations. Forty-six individuals were recruited upon discharge from an inpatient unit and completed assessments of symptoms, neurocognitive function, and social behavior at 3-month intervals for 1 year. Correlational analyses and random regression models were used to model social behavioral capacities longitudinally. Social behavior improved modestly (10% improvements in ratings) over the follow-up period for the group as a whole. Disorganized and negative symptoms, as well as neurocognitive deficits in short-term and working memory predicted changes in social behavior over time. Individuals with better working memory function showed significantly greater abilities to recover social behavior skills, whereas those with working memory deficits showed no functional improvement over time. Both symptoms and neurocognitive deficits are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia. It is proposed that clinicians should consider neurocognitive thresholds for treatment response when developing rehabilitation plans."
12975677,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: Senescence for some elderly people is a phase of with development and satisfaction, whereas for others is a negative stage of life. The determinants of a good quality of life in old age vary from person to person. The aims of this study were to identify 1) the prevalence of octogenarian people who evaluate their current life as being mainly characterized by a positive quality and 2) which were the domains that they identified as being the determinants of this positive quality. A same parallel study was conducted with subjects who evaluated senescence as a preponderantly negative experience. METHODS: A random and representative sample of 35% of the octogenarian people, living residing in the community, was selected among the dwellers of the city of Veranopolis, state of Rio Grande do Sul. A semi-structured questionnaire on quality of life quality was applied as well as the scale of depressive symptoms Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the index of general health Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). RESULTS: Slightly more than half of the studied sample (57%) defined their current quality of life with positive evaluations, whereas 18% presented a negative evaluation of it. A group 0f 25% defined their current lives as neutral or having both values (positive and negative). Those who were dissatisfied presented more health problems according to the CIRS and more depressive symptoms when evaluated by the GDS. Satisfied subjects ones had different reasons to justify this state, however, the dissatisfied had mainly the lack of health as a reason for their suffering. The main source of reported daily well-being was the involvement with rural or domestic activities. Among the interviewed, lack of health was the main source for not presenting well-being, although there was interpersonal variability regarding what each subject considered as loss of health. CONCLUSION: Possibly, for the elderly subjects a negative quality of life is equivalent to loss of health and a positive life quality is equivalent to a greater range of categories such as activity, income, social life and relationship with the family, categories which differed from subject to subject. Therefore, health seems to be a good indicator of negative quality of life, though an insufficient indicator of successful elderliness."
16679219,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To determine the influence of the family risk factors (parental weight, socioeconomic status and cultural level) on the distribution of overweight or obesity in prepubertal children and the dynamics of their weight gain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred forty-one children (183 boys) attending the second grade of primary school (age 7.4+/-0.5 years) were enrolled in a longitudinal study in Southern Italy. Overweight and obesity status were defined by a body mass index (BMI) above the percentile having respectively the value of 25 and 30 kg/m(2) at 18 years, according to national reference data; overweight extent was expressed as BMI standard deviation score (BMI-SDS). Information about BMI and socioeconomic conditions (occupation and educational level) of parents were collected. Distribution of overweight and obese schoolchildren and variations of BMI-SDS were evaluated over a 3-year period; relationships with family risk factors were also sought. The distribution of overweight/obese children at baseline was high (40%). Tracking rates of overweight and obesity were 73% and 80%, respectively. The higher the BMI-SDS at 7 years, the higher the BMI-SDS at 10 years (r 0.86, P=0.0001). The highest BMI value and the highest distribution of overweight/obese children were observed in subjects with the highest amount of family risk factors. Children exhibiting accelerated weight gain (delta BM I>1/year) showed higher male/female ratio, higher baseline BMI values, higher maternal BMI values, lower maternal educational level and a dramatic increase in the percentage of overweight/obese children than children with normal weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Children who are overweight/obese at 7 years tend to maintain this condition during prepubertal age. Paediatricians should be alerted when dealing with a child showing a BMI increase above than 1U/year during primary school. Targeted intervention should be directed at young children with overweight parents and low socio-cultural level."
17826170,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Depression is an important public-health problem, and one of the leading causes of disease burden worldwide. Depression is often comorbid with other chronic diseases and can worsen their associated health outcomes. Few studies have explored the effect of depression, alone or as a comorbidity, on overall health status. METHODS: The WHO World Health Survey (WHS) studied adults aged 18 years and older to obtain data for health, health-related outcomes, and their determinants. Prevalence of depression in respondents based on ICD-10 criteria was estimated. Prevalence values for four chronic physical diseases--angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes--were also estimated using algorithms derived via a Diagnostic Item Probability Study. Mean health scores were constructed using factor analysis and compared across different disease states and demographic variables. The relation of these disease states to mean health scores was determined through regression modelling. FINDINGS: Observations were available for 245 404 participants from 60 countries in all regions of the world. Overall, 1-year prevalence for ICD-10 depressive episode alone was 3.2% (95% CI 3.0-3.5); for angina 4.5% (4.3-4.8); for arthritis 4.1% (3.8-4.3); for asthma 3.3% (2.9-3.6); and for diabetes 2.0% (1.8-2.2). An average of between 9.3% and 23.0% of participants with one or more chronic physical disease had comorbid depression. This result was significantly higher than the likelihood of having depression in the absence of a chronic physical disease (p<0.0001). After adjustment for socioeconomic factors and health conditions, depression had the largest effect on worsening mean health scores compared with the other chronic conditions. Consistently across countries and different demographic characteristics, respondents with depression comorbid with one or more chronic diseases had the worst health scores of all the disease states. INTERPRETATION: Depression produces the greatest decrement in health compared with the chronic diseases angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes. The comorbid state of depression incrementally worsens health compared with depression alone, with any of the chronic diseases alone, and with any combination of chronic diseases without depression. These results indicate the urgency of addressing depression as a public-health priority to reduce disease burden and disability, and to improve the overall health of populations."
7945681,1,a,"The authors raise questions regarding the wide-spread calls emanating from lay and medical audiences alike to intensify the formal teaching of ethics within the medical school curriculum. In particular, they challenge a prevailing belief within the culture of medicine that while it may be possible to teach information about ethics (e.g., skills in recognizing the presence of common ethical problems, skills in ethical reasoning, or improved understanding of the language and concepts of ethics), course material or even an entire curriculum can in no way decisively influence a student's personality or ensure ethical conduct. To this end, several issues are explored, including whether medical ethics is best framed as a body of knowledge and skills or as part of one's professional identity. The authors argue that most of the critical determinants of physician identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a more subtle, less officially recognized ""hidden curriculum."" The overall process of medical education is presented as a form of moral training of which formal instruction in ethics constitutes only one small piece. Finally, the authors maintain that any attempt to develop a comprehensive ethics curriculum must acknowledge the broader cultural milieu within which that curriculum must function. In conclusion, they offer recommendations on how an ethics curriculum might be more fruitfully structured to become a seamless part of the training process."
10475862,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of immobilization upon vitamin D status and bone mass in chronically hospitalized, disabled, elderly patients following stroke. DESIGN: cross-sectional study. SETTING: Department of geriatric neurology in a Japanese hospital. SUBJECTS: 129 chronically hospitalized, disabled, elderly stroke patients and 28 age-matched controls. RESULTS: We observed a deficiency of both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-[OH]2D; 24.3 pg/ml) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (25-OHD; 11.7 ng/ml) in stroke patients compared with controls. A high serum ionized calcium (mean; 2.648 mEq/l) was an independent determinant of the Barthel index (66) and 1,25-[OH]2D. When the patients were categorized into three groups by 25-OHD level (deficient, insufficient and sufficient), there was no difference in the mean 1,25-[OH]2D levels. Parathyroid hormone levels were normal or low and did not correlate with 25-OHD. Serum bone turnover variables and bone mineral density (BMD) of the second metacarpal in patients were significantly decreased compared to control subjects. Independent determinants of BMD included Barthel index, 25-OHD and 1,25-[OH]2D. CONCLUSIONS: 1,25-[OH]2D deficiency in immobilized stroke patients is not caused by substrate (25-OHD) deficiency but by hypercalcaemia. Immobilization-induced hypercalcaemia may inhibit parathyroid hormone secretion and thus 1,25-[OH]2D production, resulting in decreased BMD. Immobilization itself also may be responsible for decreased BMD. Exogenous 1,25-[OH]2D (calcitriol) rather than dietary vitamin D supplementation may be required in disabled elderly stroke patients who have a deficiency of 1,25-[OH]2D in order to prevent hip fractures, which frequently occur in this population."

Keeping in line with the literature, three types of variables have been identified as the possible determinants of migration. These variables relate to the possession of human capital, commitment to job and place of residence, and cost-related factors. After controlling for other variables, it was observed that, in general, migrants were selective especially in terms of age, education, and choice of occupation. These findings are consistent with the evidence from other developing countries."""

A questionnaire was used to collect data on health, demographics, work-history, work characteristics, work satisfaction and social support at work. The questionnaire was mailed to 471 hygienists; 77.3% responded. 70% of the hygienists are highly or very satisfied with their work tasks. Active leisure and working in large cities were significantly related to high work satisfaction. The best linear regression model explained 48% of the variance in work satisfaction. Thirty percent of the variance was explained by work tasks perceived to be skills developing. Skills development in the profession appears low (median = 44%). After controlling work factors, work satisfaction increased with growing skills development for all hygienists, even for those less satisfied with their work. The findings suggest that the opportunities for developing professional skills should increase to improve satisfaction among dental hygienists. Measures should also be taken to improve the work climate, work stimulation, and job variation as well as reduce the collegial pressure at work."
9538699,1,a,"This is a descriptive, exploratory study which aimed at identifying the factors that are associated with pre-eclampsia in teenagers. The study also aimed at assessing the quality of midwifery care during labour in teenagers with pre-eclampsia so that recommendations can be made based on empirical findings. The study was done within Health Region H of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa. A structured interview schedule was designed to tap information from pre-eclamptic teenagers in an attempt to identify factors associated with pre-eclampsia. A checklist was also designed and administered to assess the care of a pre-eclamptic teenager during labour. The study revealed that factors like age, nulliparity and socio-economic status were associated with pre-eclampsia. In as far as the rest of the factors, there was no relationship as indicated in previous studies. The study also revealed that teenagers affected by pre-eclampsia delayed in attending the antenatal clinic resulting in the control of the disease being difficult. In as far as midwifery care, the study revealed that psychological and social care, as well as the hygienic state of patients was not satisfactory. Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that health education on prevention of pre-eclampsia should be done on an ongoing process, while carers for teenage mothers should be given inservice education programmes on psychosocial care. The physical environment for maternity units must be improved."
16872670,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the motivational determinants of the continuation of breast-feeding until 3 months postpartum. METHODS: A prospective cohort study using the Integrated Change Model in 341 women in 5 child health care centers. RESULTS: At birth, 73% of the mothers started with breast-feeding and 39% of them continued at least 3 months postpartum. Mothers who continued for 3 months differed in almost all the motivational determinants from mothers who discontinued. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, social support for formula feeding from significant others and situational self-efficacy for breast-feeding made a significant independent contribution to the continuation of breast-feeding. Among the predisposing determinants, the strongest positive predictor of continuation was the intention to return to work at 1 month postpartum. CONCLUSION: The Integrated Change Model is valid to explain and predict the continuation of breast-feeding. Hence, the results may be used to tailor future interventions aimed at promoting breast-feeding. In the discussion, we use the results to target interventions."
8909107,1,a,"From retrospective survey reports 1985-87, the study examined the determinants of neonatal and post-neonatal survival in three provinces in China. Conditional logistic regression models were employed to estimate the effects of macro- and micro-level factors (such as socioeconomic conditions, familial relationships, as well as biosocial determinants) on the survivorship of neonatal and post-neonatal infants in China. The study yielded two findings: (1) Social changes in Chinese society had a strong positive effect on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship; and (2) the magnitude of such social changes differed across regions which, in turn, led to the differential effects on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship across provinces in China."
9459066,1,a,"Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) may be an independent predictor of cardiovascular endpoints, but little is known about its psychosocial determinants. The acute effects of psychosocial processes on cardiovascular activity during daily life were examined by random-effects regression. Healthy adults (N = 120) were monitored over a 6-day period with ABP monitors and computer-assisted self-report assessments. Task strain, social conflict, and emotional activation were rated following each ABP measurement, as were activity, posture, and other covariates. Results show that blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were elevated during periods of emotional activation (high negative affect or high arousal). Diastolic BP was lower during periods involving high decisional control, and HR was lower during high-control, low-demand activities. There were substantial individual differences in the effects of psychosocial influences on ambulatory cardiovascular activity. Psychological factors are reliable determinants of ABP, which may account in part for the unique predictive value of ABP."
8488711,1,a,"The Military Medical Consortium for Applied Retroviral Research Program's (MMCARR) Behavioral Medicine Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Research component is conducting a tri-service, comprehensive, and longitudinal research study in military HIV-infected personnel at all stages of infection. Identification of neuropsychiatric and psychosocial outcomes and their determinants will help the military minimize the impact of the HIV epidemic on military readiness and function. Neuropsychiatric and psychosocial findings are among the most common complications seen in early HIV disease and among the most likely to have an adverse impact on military readiness and function. The study has demonstrated that the average HIV-infected service person experiences at least transient military occupational difficulty following notification of HIV status. More than 15% at any given time have levels of clinical or subclinical anxiety or depression that are referrable for mental health intervention. Ten per cent of study subjects have a current major mood disorder and 5% have a psychoactive substance use disorder. Finally, 17% of study subjects have experienced serious suicidal ideation or behaviours at least once since notification of seropositivity. Fortunately, however, data also indicate at least partial effectiveness of current primary, secondary and tertiary preventive efforts. Only about 1% of Air Force HIV-infected persons are discharged for psychiatric reasons prior to eventual medical discharge. Further, a large majority of active-duty patients demonstrate solid military occupational and social performance. Though military HIV neurobehavioural research is still in progress, preliminary data identify social support and pre-HIV psychiatric predisposition as important factors associated with current neuropsychiatric status."
15193571,0,a,"PURPOSE: To: (a) establish criteria for defining positive health behaviors and lifestyle; and (b) identify characteristics of adolescents who practice a healthy lifestyle. METHODS: Responses from a 1998 survey via questionnaire, of 1487 students, from a public high school, Cambridge, Massachusetts, were used to assess correlates of healthy lifestyle choices. Strict and broad assessments of healthy behaviors were defined for students: use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs; sexual behavior; attempted suicide. Whereas the ""strict"" criteria included only those adolescents who did not practice any of the behaviors in question, the broad criteria reflected experimentation and moderate risk-taking. The prevalence of positive behaviors was assessed by demographic and student characteristics. In addition, logistic regression models were created to predict determinants of teenagers' healthy lifestyles using both strict and broad definitions. RESULTS: Using strict criteria of healthy lifestyle, significant predictors were being female, born outside the United States, higher academic performance, and fewer stressful life events. Using a broad definition of a healthy lifestyle, significant predictors were being non-Caucasian, in the lower grade levels at the school, higher academic performance, and fewer stressful life events. In both models, peers' approval of risky behaviors negatively influenced teens' lifestyles, whereas parents' disapproval of risky behaviors was a positive influence. CONCLUSIONS: These results reinforce the importance of school, peer, and parent support of positive behaviors. It is important for public health workers and families to understand and define healthy lifestyles choices for adolescents."
11154248,0,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate ethnic differences in self reported health in the city of Malmo, Sweden, and whether these differences could be explained by psychosocial and economic conditions. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The public health survey in Malmo 1994 was a cross sectional study. A total of 5600 people aged 20-80 years completed a postal questionnaire. The participation rate was 71%. The population was categorised according to country of origin: born in Sweden, other Western countries, Yugoslavia, Poland, Arabic speaking countries and all other countries. The multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model in order to investigate the importance of possible confounders on the differences by country of origin in self reported health. Finally, variables measuring psychosocial and economic conditions were introduced into the model. MAIN RESULTS: The odds ratios of having poor self reported health were significantly higher among men born in other Western countries, Yugoslavia, Arabic speaking countries and in the category all other countries, as well as among women born in Yugoslavia, Poland and all other countries, compared with men and women born in Sweden. The multivariate analysis including age and education did not change these results. A huge reduction of the odds ratios was observed for men and women born in Yugoslavia, Arabic speaking countries and all other countries, and for women born in Poland after the introduction of the social network, social support and economic factors into the multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant ethnic group differences in self reported health. These differences were greatly reduced by psychosocial and economic factors, which suggest that these factors may be important determinants of self rated health in certain minority groups."

Its functions are to promote, support, and produce health care technology assessments and to advise the Minister of Health. An independent review of the council's first four years of operation was commissioned. The evaluation team concluded that the council showed very good results in terms of the scope, quality, and impact of its production and succeeded in establishing its credibility. However, the evaluation team suggested that the council adopt a more active strategy toward the promotion and diffusion of its reports. Some critical determinants of success of the Quebec experience in technology assessment are discussed."
15647133,1,a,"Distrust and suspicion are common and recurring problems at all levels of social organization, ranging from the interpersonal to the collective. Unfortunately, our understanding of the origins and dynamics of such distrust and suspicion remains far from complete. A primary aim of this research, accordingly, was to articulate a new framework for conceptualizing a form of exaggerated distrust and suspicion termed paranoid social cognition. Drawing on recent psychological theory and research, this framework identifies the social cognitive underpinnings of paranoid cognitions. It also specifies some of the situational determinants of such cognition and elaborates on the psychological, behavioral, and social dynamics that sustain them."
7747681,1,a,"The present study identified factors that distinguish early responders (i.e., requested medical assistance < 60 minutes after the onset of acute myocardial infarction [AMI] symptoms) from late responders (i.e., request made > or = 60 minutes after symptom onset). A questionnaire developed to assess demographic characteristics, contextual factors, antecedents to symptom onset, and behavioral, affective, and cognitive responses was administered in the hospital to 501 patients with documented AMI. Patients who believed that their symptoms were cardiac in nature were more likely to be early responders, whereas patients who attributed their symptoms to indigestion, muscle pain, fatigue, or another cause responded later (p < 0.0009). Early responders believed their symptoms to be more serious (p < 0.0001), felt more comfortable seeking medical assistance (p < 0.0001), were more anxious or upset when they first noticed symptoms (p = 0.0118), and perceived that they had less control of their symptoms (p < 0.0001) than late responders. A stepwise multiple regression analysis further suggested that unmarried patients responded significantly later than married patients, and patients who first experienced their symptoms at work responded significantly later than those who first experienced their symptoms outside of the home but not at work. These results suggest that situational and psychological variables are important determinants of lengthy decision delays in responding to symptoms of AMI."
15503071,0,a,"Personal resources represent important determinants of life-long development. Since the use of the resources is a decisive factor, the perception of resources and changes in them is presumably crucial for the developmental success. In the present study, we investigated whether the perception of resources (i. e., cognition, health, social network) differs between young and old individuals, whether the resource perception is related to well-being and whether these relations are identical among young and old adults. Young and old individuals did not differ with respect to subjective resource status and resource importance; however, the young experienced more gains and the old reported more losses. Resource status explained the highest proportion of variance in well-being in both age groups. Resource loss was of relevance to well-being only in the young, but not in the old group. Thus, the significance of resource loss seems to vary across the life span, which puts the notion of a universal role of resource loss into question. For future studies, domain-specific analyses and the investigation of protective mechanism are proposed."
16174346,0,a,"Some propositions on male and female sexual orientation will be considered. Some of these are established; others are more speculative. The aim is to offer some notes towards a coherent, comprehensive theory of sexual orientation. 1. The distinction between butch and femme lesbians seems real rather than a social construct. 2. High levels of prenatal steroid hormones seem to be causally associated with the sexual orientation of butch lesbians. However it is not established whether the causal process operates prenatally or postnatally (or both). This is so because prenatal hormone levels are thought to correlate positively with postnatal hormone levels. And high postnatal hormone levels may facilitate homosexual behaviour as a consequence of sensation-seeking. 3. Male bisexuals also are interpreted to have been exposed to high prenatal testosterone levels. But (for reasons similar to those outlined above in regard to butch lesbians) it is unclear whether these have a direct prenatal effect on the brain or whether they are precursors of high postnatal testosterone levels, which are associated with male bisexual orientation by promoting sensation-seeking behaviour. 4. Postnatal learning processes seem to be causally involved in the sexual orientation of some femme lesbians and some exclusive male homosexuals. 5. Some homosexual men have genes that predispose to their sexual orientation. 6. The same may apply to some lesbians, but such genes have not, as far as I know, been identified. 7. People (of both sexes) who engage in same-sex sexual behaviour may be classified simultaneously in two ways, viz (1) 'active' vs 'passive' and (2) those who do and those who do not engage (or consider engaging) in sex with members of the opposite sex. Ex hypothesi, some of the 'active' ones initiate some of the 'passive' ones. The active ones are driven more by hormones and the passive ones by psychosocial factors. The active males contain a substantial proportion of self-identified bisexuals; and the active females a substantial proportion of self-identified butches. 8. These two active categories (butch lesbians and male bisexuals) share a number of endocrinological, psychological, morphological and behavioural features vis-a-vis their exclusively homosexual and heterosexual peers. Methods of testing some of these ideas are presented."
16492623,0,a,"AIMS: The aim of the present study is to identify self-rated health predictors of return to work (RTW) within the study population as a whole as well as in three subgroups, namely musculoskeletal complaints, other physical health complaints, and psychological complaints. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 862 employees on sickness absence (maximum duration of 12 weeks). The employees filled out a baseline questionnaire and were subsequently followed until the tenth month after listing sick. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify determinants of RTW. RESULTS: For the study population as a whole type of complaint, earlier sickness absence, subjective severity of complaints and several RAND-36 subscales were predictive of RTW. Furthermore, the RAND-36 subscales physical functioning, physical role limitations, mental health, and health change were predictive of RTW among employees with musculoskeletal complaints. For employees with other physical health problems subjective severity of complaints and the RAND-36 subscales physical and social functioning, general health perception, and health change were associated with RTW. Finally, with regard to the group with psychological complaints the RAND-36 subscales mental health and general health perception predicted RTW. CONCLUSION: Several aspects of self-rated health predict RTW for employees on long-term sickness absence. Variables related to functional status predict RTW for employees with physical complaints in contrast to psychological problems."
16497606,0,a,"Although a number of studies have shown that various measures of religiosity are inversely correlated with smoking behavior, none of these studies have used genetically informative samples to test for a gene-environment interaction between the determinants of smoking initiation and religiosity. We tested the moderating effects of three measures of religiosity (religious affiliation, organizational religious activity, and self-rated religiousness) on the genetic and environmental determinants of smoking initiation in 237 monozygotic twin pairs, 315 dizygotic twin pairs, 779 full-sibling pairs, and 233 half-sibling pairs in young adults surveyed from the third wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Primary analyses incorporated all sibling pairs, irrespective of whether they were concordant or discordant for the environmental moderator, in models designed to account for the confounding effects of a gene-environment correlation. High levels of self-rated religiousness attenuated the additive genetic component for smoking initiation and were associated with a lower prevalence of smoking initiation. Although all three measures of religiosity were associated with lower rates of smoking initiation, only self-rated religiousness moderated genetic influences on the liability for smoking."
2344434,1,a,"Both dispositional and attributional perspectives on perceptions of control assume that people have some idea of outcome determinants. This, however, may not always be so. This study tested the hypothesis that pupils do not always understand the determinants of their learning outcomes, and that such a sense of unknown control will be associated with poor achievement in school. The study was unusual in that it tapped both dispositional control perceptions, using the new MMPCC, and causal attributions for success and failure in a school examination. Subjects were 186 10-year-old Israeli pupils of heterogeneous SES. Results confirmed that unknown control emerged as a distinct dimension of perceived control in both dispositional and attributional measures, and was consistently associated with poor achievement in school. Attributions of test outcomes to unknown causes were strongly related to dispositional unknown control, and were not affected by success or failure. In contrast, dispositional and attributional internality were unrelated, and did not predict achievement. It is argued that internal beliefs reflect internalised social-educational norms, and as a result have less impact on motivation than perceptions of unknown control. The implications of these findings for educational practice and motivational interventions are discussed."
15827917,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To study the employment rate and determinants of return to work for persons with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in Taiwan. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Taiwan community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-nine people who had sustained traumatic SCI, had been completely rehabilitated in a university hospital between 1989 and 2002, and who were between 18 and 60 years of age at the time of interview in 2003. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A structured questionnaire was used to identify demographic and injury-related status, functional status, and pre- and postinjury work-related information. RESULTS: At the time of survey, only 47% of the participants were engaged in remunerative employment. Cox regression analysis, with time elapsed between injury and survey as the underlying time axis, showed that education and functional independence were associated with employment. Subjects with a high school education had a 2.2-fold higher chance (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.8) of returning to work than those without. Subjects with higher scores on the Barthel Index and ability to use public or private transport independently had a 2.7-fold higher chance (95% CI, 1.5-4.9) of returning to work than those unable to travel independently. Other factors significantly associated with employment included marital status, with marriage having a favorable influence; age at injury, with age below 25 years being favorable; preinjury occupation; and vocational training after injury. The importance of functional independence training in rehabilitation is stressed. CONCLUSIONS: Functional independence was a strong factor predicting return to work. Rehabilitation focused on education, vocational training, self-care ability, community mobility, and environmental modifications could improve employability after SCI."
15296585,0,a,"Understanding determinants of mothers' decisions regarding long-term breastfeeding is important for the promotion of breastfeeding for up to 12 months postpartum and beyond. In this longitudinal infant feeding study, the theory of planned behavior was used to explain the intended and actual breastfeeding duration of 80 participants who were breastfeeding 9-month-old infants. Participants perceived less approval for breastfeeding the longer they breastfed. Perceived approval did not explain prenatal intended duration but strongly explained intended duration at 9 months postpartum. The amount of control mothers perceived they had over breastfeeding, however, explained both prenatal and 9-month breastfeeding duration intentions. Reasons for weaning between 9 and 12 months reflected the effects of perceived control but not of perceived approval. These results suggest the need for (1) interventions to increase the social acceptability of long-term breastfeeding and (2) ongoing breastfeeding guidance and support for long-term breastfeeders."
8105905,1,a,"Reports of clinical outcomes after commencement of dialysis treatment among elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are not been numerous. This paper describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the elderly treated for ESRD in Canada using the Canadian Organ Replacement Register data. Comparisons with younger age groups are also presented. Analyses of data for the period 1981-1991 indicated that the elderly (65+) represent an expanding portion of all new ESRD patients in Canada. Distributions of dialysis modalities showed no major differences by age groups (45-54, 55-64, 65-75, 75+). However, the overall usage of intermittent peritoneal dialysis has decreased over time (from 17% of patients in 1981-83 to 7% in 1990-91). Deaths from social causes were slightly more frequent among the elderly (15.9% of all deaths among those aged 65+ vs 10% among those aged 45-64). Moreover, deaths from infections were more common among patients on dialysis for a longer period of time and more common among patients on peritoneal dialysis than among those on hemodialysis. Discontinuations of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of the inability to cope increased with age. Patients with comorbid conditions were more likely to receive hemodialysis, and, as expected, the presence of these conditions increased with age and significantly reduced survival. Other determinants of survival included calendar period of registration, renal center size, and treatment modality. This paper illustrates the many changes over time in the elderly population treated for ESRD. Also of importance, however, is the elderly Canadian population with ESRD which is not presently treated."

17448554,0,a,"This paper uses the British Health and Lifestyle Survey (1984-1985) data and the longitudinal follow-up of May 2003 to investigate the determinants of premature mortality in Great Britain and the contribution of lifestyle choices to socio-economic inequality in mortality. A behavioural model, which relates premature mortality to a set of observable and unobservable factors, is considered. A maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) approach for a multivariate probit (MVP) is used to estimate a recursive system of equations for mortality, morbidity and lifestyles. Health inequality is explored using the Gini coefficient and a decomposition technique. The decomposition analysis for predicted mortality shows that, after allowing for endogeneity, lifestyles contribute strongly to inequality in mortality, reducing the direct role of socio-economic status. This contradicts the view, which is widely held in epidemiology, that lifestyles make a relatively minor contribution to observed socio-economic gradients in health."
12856126,0,a,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To describe the clinical, psychological and social factors affecting diabetes knowledge of veterans with established Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted an observational study of 284 insulin-treated veterans with stable Type 2 diabetes. All subjects completed the University of Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Centre Knowledge Test, the Diabetes Care Profile, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Diabetes Family Behaviour Checklist. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop a model for the diabetes knowledge score based upon clinical and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: One hundred eighty subjects were evaluated in a derivation set. The mean age +/- SD was 65.4+/-9.6 years, 94% were men, and 36% were members of a minority group. Performance on the diabetes knowledge test was poor (64.9+/-15.3% correct). Self-perceived understanding of all management objectives explained only 6% of the variance in the knowledge scores. Multivariate analysis showed that age, years of schooling, duration of treatment, cognitive function, sex, and level of depression were independent determinants of the knowledge score. When the model was applied to 104 subjects in a validation set, there was a strong correlation between observed and predicted scores (r=0.537; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Stable, insulin-treated veterans have major deficiencies in diabetes knowledge that could impair their ability to provide self-care. A multivariate model comprised of demographic variables and psychosocial profiling can identify patients who have limited diabetes knowledge and be used to assess individual barriers to ongoing diabetes education."
1529379,1,a,"In light of current concerns over nursing shortages and productivity, voluntary turnover among hospital nurses in the United States has assumed renewed importance as a managerial issue. This study examines the thesis that the social organization of work in hospitals is an important determinant of the voluntary turnover rate among registered nurses. This perspective differs from previous work in this area in that both turnover and its determinants are conceptualized at the organizational rather than individual level, thus opening the way for administrative intervention to reduce turnover. The conceptual model is tested using multiple regression techniques on a sample of 435 hospitals. Results suggest that organizational characteristics and environmental conditions are important contributors to turnover. Organizational characteristics are stronger predictors of turnover than are economic factors."
18430691,0,a,"This review examines the impact of Global Health Initiatives (GHIs) on health equity, focusing on low- and middle-income countries. It is a summary of a literature review commissioned by the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. GHIs have emerged during the past decade as a mechanism in development assistance for health. The review focuses on three GHIs, the US President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the World Bank's Multi-country AIDS Programme (MAP) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. All three have leveraged significant amounts of funding for their focal diseases - together these three GHIs provide an estimated two-thirds of external resources going to HIV/AIDS. This paper examines their impact on gender equity. An analysis of these Initiatives finds that they have a significant impact on health equity, including gender equity, through their processes of programme formulation and implementation, and through the activities they fund and implement, including through their impact on health systems and human resources. However, GHIs have so far paid insufficient attention to health inequities. While increasingly acknowledging equity, including gender equity, as a concern, Initiatives have so far failed to adequately translate this into programmes that address drivers of health inequity, including gender inequities. The review highlights the comparative advantage of individual GHIs, which point to an increased need for, and continued difficulties in, harmonisation of activities at country level. On the basis of this comparative analysis, key recommendations are made. They include a call for equity-sensitive targets, the collection of gender-disaggregated data, the use of policy-making processes for empowerment, programmes that explicitly address causes of health inequity and impact assessments of interventions' effect on social inequities."
10181142,1,a,"PURPOSE: The study examines associations of five healthy workplace attributes with trade unionism and nine other industrial and sociodemographic factors. The aims were to illustrate the measurement of workplace health promotion indicators in Western Australia and to identify associations leading to a better understanding of determinants of the healthy workplace. DESIGN: Personal and telephone cross-sectional surveys were performed using population-based sampling frames. The overall response rate was 72%. SETTING: Workplaces in Western Australia. SUBJECTS: Random samples of household respondents aged 16 to 69 years in 1992 (n = 1310) and 1994 (n = 1113). MEASURES: Measures of association between healthy workplace attributes and trade unionism were adjusted for workplace location, size, sector, and industrial classification. RESULTS: Trade unionism was strongly associated with healthy catering practices (adjusted OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.30 to 3.23), sun protection practices (2.66; 1.69 to 4.17), disability access (1.47; 1.10 to 1.95), and worksite health promotion programs (2.56; 2.07 to 3.17). A weak and nonsignificant association was observed with restrictive smoking policies (1.21; .95 to 1.55). Generally, healthy workplace attributes were reported less often by respondents working in rural locations, in the private sector, and at small worksites. There was no consistent relationship with sociodemographic factors, including an index of social disadvantage, but members of blue-collar occupations experienced a low prevalence of restrictive smoking policies. CONCLUSIONS: The study raises the hypothesis, but cannot confirm, that trade unions could provide a means for employees to pursue the creation of a health-promoting workplace. Small business represents an excellent target for health promotion activities."

7983098,1,a,"This paper examines the effects of a child's place of birth, mother's education, region of residence and rural and urban residence on infant mortality in Nigeria between 1965 and 1979, using data from the 1981/82 Nigeria Fertility Survey. Infant mortality rates declined in all regions between 1965 and 1979. Children born in modern health facilities, irrespective of their mothers' place of residence, experienced significantly lower rates of infant mortality than those born elsewhere. Logistic regression analysis showed that all other variables tested were also significant, although some to a lesser degree. Efforts to reduce infant mortality in Nigeria should include policies that rectify rural and urban differentials in the distribution of health facilities and encourage their use."
12233625,1,a,"""Arguing that conventional indices of poverty (such as the head-count ratio) do not capture all aspects of deprivation that large segments of the population experience in developing countries, the present paper concentrates on progress in reducing infant and child mortality, and the underlying factors. The role of public policy in reducing infant and child mortality is emphasised. While income matters, (independently) aspects of maternal care and access to certain basic health services also have a significant role. In particular, female literacy (as a proxy for mother's literacy) has a substantial negative effect. In the context of the concern for cost-effectiveness of public expenditure during structural adjustment, a case is made for reordering of priorities in educational and health expenditure, and for specific policy interventions designed to promote female literacy."""
10428192,1,a,"The Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterized by the presence of complex visual hallucinations in psychologically normal people. The syndrome occurs predominantly in the visually handicapped elderly. Little is known about its etiology and pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of CBS with psychological and social determinants. All subjects were patients older than 64 years from a low-vision unit. Using a case-control approach, 50 patients with CBS and 80 patients without visual hallucinations were interviewed about their educational level, social circumstances, number of social contacts, and ability to cope with visual handicap. Loneliness was measured with the De Jong-Gierveld-Kamphuis loneliness scale, and personality traits were examined with the Dutch-language short version of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ([MMPI] Nederlandse Verkorte MMPI [NVM]). Compared with the control group, significantly more CBS patients were lonely. Mean scores on the NVM shyness scale and extraversion scale were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in CBS patients. In multiple logistic regression analysis for the three determinants simultaneously, loneliness and low extraversion were significant predictors for CBS, but shyness was not. It is concluded that loneliness, low extraversion, and shyness are risk indicators for CBS in elderly visually handicapped people. The findings suggest that CBS is associated with a low quality of social contacts."
12283970,1,a,"To study the biological and behavioral process of the recent drastic fertility decline in China, the authors reviewed relating factors (proximate determinants) and applied the Bongaarts model to the population of China for the years 1971 and 1981, during which the fertility rate dropped most rapidly and substantial population control policies were performed. By application of the model, the decrease of TFR of 2.78 between 1971 and 1981 was estimated to be contributed by widespread of contraception (68%), later marriage (49%), and increase of induced abortion (28%), through shortening of the length of postpartum breastfeeding showed negative effects (-32%), on the assumption that local data could be substituted for some national data. Compared with other countries, China was characterized by coexistence of strong fertility-inhibiting effects of nonmarriage, contraception, induced abortion, and relatively strong fertility-inhibiting effects of breastfeeding. It strongly suggested that the fertility transition in China was realized by powerful population policies in the context of insufficient socioeconomic development to lead to the transition."
10434847,1,a,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance of social status and lifestyle for dietary habits, since these factors may influence life expectancy. We studied the association of four indicators for healthy dietary habits (fruits and vegetables, fibre, fat and Hegsted score) with sex, age, socio-economic status, education, physical leisure exercise, smoking and personal attention paid to keeping a healthy diet. Data were gathered with a self-administered quantitative food-frequency questionnaire distributed to a representative sample of Norwegian men and women aged 16-79 years in a national dietary survey, of whom 3144 subjects (63%) responded. Age and female sex were positively associated with indicators for healthy dietary habits. By separate evaluation length of education, regular physical leisure exercise and degree of attention paid to keeping a healthy diet were positively associated with all four indicators for healthy dietary habits in both sexes. Socio-economic status, location of residence and smoking habits were associated with from one to three indicators for healthy dietary habits. In a multiple regression model, age, education and location of residence together explained from 1 to 9% of the variation (R2) in the four dietary indicators. Length of education was significantly associated with three of four dietary indicators both among men and women. By including the variable 'attention paid to keeping a healthy diet' in the model, R2 increased to between 4 and 15% for the four dietary indicators. Length of education remained correlated to three dietary indicators among women, and one indicator among men, after adjusting for attention to healthy diet, age and location of residence. Residence in cities remained correlated to two indicators among men, but none among women, after adjusting for age, education and attention to healthy diet. In conclusion, education was associated with indicators of a healthy diet. Attention to healthy diet showed the strongest and most consistent association with all four indicators for healthy dietary habits in both sexes. This suggests that personal preferences may be just as important for having a healthy diet as social status determinants."
7818975,1,a,"This article utilizes constructs of the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM) to examine condom use in a sample of 215 HIV-infected women in New Jersey. We find evidence that processes affecting condom use in HIV-infected individuals are similar to those found in HIV-negative individuals. Results suggest that partner-related factors are important to consistent condom use in HIV-infected women. Women are more likely to use condoms consistently if they have high perceived power to influence their partner's condom use, have partners who are HIV seronegative, and have partners who do not want more children. Conflicts with the partner decrease the probability of consistent condom use. Also negatively associated with condom use are the woman's use of drugs and/or alcohol and her belief that condoms reduce sexual enjoyment. Implications of these findings for designing interventions for HIV-infected women are considered."
1434562,1,a,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a serious health problem for adolescents, occurring in an estimated one-quarter of sexually active teen-agers. Many of the health problems--including STDs--result from specific risk-taking behaviors. Determinants of STD risks among adolescents include behavioral, psychological, social, biological, institutional factors. Education is an important component in STD control in adolescents. The goal of education is to increase adolescent self-efficiency in practicing STD prevention and risk-reduction. A comprehensive approach including quality, theory-based education, accessible and effective health clinics, and improved social and economic conditions has the most promise of controlling STDs in adolescents."
10369495,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess current habits of using salt and other seasonings in food preparation, and to investigate the psychosocial determinants of salt use. In addition we examined differences in salt consumption and psychosocial determinants with respect to stages of change and socio-economic classes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 400 adults were interviewed to determine: 1) use of salt and other seasonings in food preparation; 2) added table salt; 3) consumption of foods with high salt content; and 4) psychosocial determinants of salt consumption. Subjects were divided into 5 stages of change for salt content of the cooked meal: precontemplation, contemplation, decision, action and maintenance. RESULTS: Salt appeared to be the type of seasoning mostly added in food preparation. Frequently used seasonings containing no added salt were pepper, onion, nutmeg, garlic, curry, sweet pepper powder, parsley, and bay-leaf. Spearman correlation coefficients between added cooking salt and taste attitude, health attitude, social influence and self-efficacy were 0.51, 0.14, 0.36, and 0.32 respectively. Correlations between consumption of foods with high salt content and convenience attitude, taste attitude, health attitude and self-efficacy were 0.41, 0.27, 0.18 and 0.21 respectively. Subjects in maintenance of low salt consumption, used less salt than subjects in precontemplation. Socio-economic status only showed an effect on the use of foods with high salt content. CONCLUSION AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Health aspects did not play a major role in salt intake, whereas taste attitude was an important predictor of added cooking salt. Attempts to reduce cooking salt should be directed at satisfying taste. Nutrition education tailored to stages of change may be very helpful in decreasing salt consumption."
9327590,1,a,"In this study we tested relations among personality characteristics, social network properties, and perceived social support both concurrently and prospectively. A sample of 294 men in treatment at a Department of Veterans Affairs Alcohol Treatment Unit was assessed during treatment and 3 months after discharge. Results of the cross-sectional structural equation analyses indicated that the personality characteristics of extraversion and neuroticism were related to both social network properties and perceived social support. Characteristics of the alcoholic's social network were also related to perceived availability of support. Longitudinal analyses of perceived social support after treatment indicated that two social network properties (size of the network and the proportion of confidants) were predictive net of initial levels of social support. Extraversion and neuroticism were found to be indirectly related to perceived social support at Time 2 through their effects on social network properties and perceived social support during treatment. Implications of these findings for models of the nature and determinants of perceived social support are discussed."
24390608,1,a,"Retirement has become a very important stage of life for persons in developed countries. Life expectancy for those over age 60 has increased markedly. Rising real income and the institution of broad based social security systems have encouraged older workers to leave the labor force at younger ages. p]Reductions in older age mortality have also affected the less developed regions. Increases in the number of older persons, coupled with continuing high fertility, have increased the size of the working age population through both large entry cohorts and longevity of current workers. The capacity of the economy to absorb this growth is severely limited. As a result, labor force decisions by older individuals will be of increasing importance.This study provides new evidence on labor force decisions in four developing countries in the Western Pacific: Fiji, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines. A uniform survey sponsored by the World Health Organization in the four countries of persons aged 60 and over is employed to estimate the determinants of work decisions."
10163567,1,a,This paper argues that health promotion needs to develop an approach to evaluation and effectiveness that values qualitative methodologies. It posits the idea that qualitative research could learn from the experience of quantitative researchers and promote more useful ways of measuring effectiveness by the use of intermediate and indirect indicators. It refers to a European-wide project designed to gather information on the effectiveness of health promotion interventions. This project discovered that there was a need for an instrument that allowed qualitative intervention methodologies to be assessed in the same way as quantitative methods.
14686137,0,a,"Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient."

15639629,0,a,"In the past decade, significant debate has surrounded the relative contributions of genetic determinants versus environmental conditions to certain types of human behavior. While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria. Bacteria exhibit many social activities and they represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level. Therefore, we introduce the term 'sociomicrobiology'."

Data were collected by questionnaires, and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken. Most students were not satisfied with their situation in terms of accommodation, health and support. About 86% ate unhealthy diets, 33.8% were physically inactive, 25.3% were overweight or at risk of becoming overweight, 17.5% of male students were current smokers and 32.2% had poor sleep behaviours. About 28% of the students adopted 3 or more risk behaviours. About 23% reported low perceived health status and 80.3% felt they had low to moderate social support. There were significant sex differences regarding some behaviours."

The authors conducted interviews of 810 persons who were representative of adult residents living in the 23 southernmost counties of Mississippi before Hurricane Katrina. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since Hurricane Katrina was 22.5%. The determinants of PTSD were female gender, experience of hurricane-related financial loss, postdisaster stressors, low social support, and postdisaster traumatic events. Kaplan-Meier survival curves suggest that exposure to both hurricane-related traumatic events and to financial and social stressors influenced the duration of PTSD symptoms. Postdisaster interventions that aim to improve manipulable stressors after these events may influence the onset and course of PTSD."
10672101,0,a,"Midwives practice within the normal childbirth paradigm. It is argued that midwives failure to define normality has allowed increasing technicalization and medicalization of the normal physiological process of birth because doctors so closely define abnormality. A concept analysis model is used to clarify what is meant by the term 'normal labour'; the emphasis being on understanding what normal labour is as it applies to midwifery practice today. This analysis highlights the importance of movement and the sequential nature of normal labour, and reveals how this is implicit within the other uses of both the words normal and labour. The final definition of normal labour offered is intended to be complimentary to existing medical determinants of progress of normal labour, because as the body of the text stresses, medical knowledge is fundamentally enmeshed in midwifery care."
19040699,0,a,"Understanding patient dissatisfaction is essential as it provides information on how to improve the relationship between healthcare users and medical professionals. The aim of this paper is to determine how Polish patients verbally express negative opinions of their healthcare services, and to compare the patterns of opinion-giving behaviour between patients in Poland and Western Europe. A qualitative approach employing in-depth interviews was used. Nine primary healthcare centres were chosen in various regions of Poland, taking into account both type of practice, i.e. small and large, and location of residence, i.e. urban (small and large towns) and rural. In every centre, interviews were performed with four patients coming consecutively to their family physician. Thirty-six patients aged 20-78 years were interviewed. Their views could be categorised into eight reasons for avoiding expressing negative opinions: unpleasant emotions induced by giving a negative evaluation; avoiding offending healthcare providers; fear that their utterances could have a negative effect on their further medical care; fear of giving a hasty evaluation based on their own inexpert medical knowledge; determinants from recent Polish history; prestige of the medical profession; entrusting the most important aspect of life, i.e. health, to a doctor; and lack of faith that their opinions could cause change for the better. The respondents used certain rhetorical tricks to soften their criticisms. Patients face cultural barriers to expressing dissatisfaction about their health care. In the Polish context, these are the high social status of the physician and the low position of the patient. In their spontaneous utterances, the respondents gave detailed suggestions for raising the level of patient satisfaction with health care."
15052398,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with receipt of different levels of shared care, and the effect of shared care on patient outcomes. METHOD: A total of 349 patients with severe mental illness were selected from general practice lists. Patient functioning was assessed using standardised questionnaires, and GPs completed a questionnaire about patients' shared care arrangements at baseline (response-rate 79%). Patients were followed up at 12 months. RESULTS: Receipt of high shared care was associated with greater patient satisfaction with services and social functioning at baseline (p < 0.005). Patients receiving high shared care showed greater improvements in SF-12 mental health scores at follow-up compared to low shared care groups (p = 0.02). This effect was abolished after adjustment for age, sex and psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Receipt of high shared care was not associated with demographic or clinical characteristics. High shared care had limited value for patients in terms of improved clinical, social or general health functioning over one year."
16151029,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A large proportion of disabled stroke survivors live at home and are supported by informal caregivers. Identification of determinants of caregiver burden will help to target caregiver interventions. METHODS: Data on patient, caregiver, and health and social support characteristics were collected prospectively over 1 year in 232 stroke survivors in a randomized trial of caregiver training. The contribution of these variables to caregiver burden score (CBS) and quality of life (QOL) measures at 3 months and 1 year was analyzed using regression models. RESULTS: Stroke patients had a mean age of 74+/-11 years, and 120 (52%) were men. The mean age of caregivers was 65.7+/-12.5 years, 149 (64%) were females, and 116 (50%) had received caregiver training. The mean CBS was 48+/-13 and 38+/-11 (score range of bad to good 88 to 22) and QOL score was 75+/-16 and 75+/-15 (score range of bad to good 0 to 100) at 3 months and 1 year, respectively. CBS and QOL correlated with each other and with patient (age, dependency, and mood), caregiver (age, gender, mood, and training), and support (social services and family networks) variables. Of these, only patient and caregiver emotional status, caregiver age and gender, and participation in caregiver training were independent predictors of either outcome at 3 months. Patient dependency and family support were additional independent predictors at 1 year. Social services support predicted institutionalization but not caregiver outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Advancing age and anxiety in patients and caregivers, high dependency, and poor family support identify caregivers at risk of adverse outcomes, which may be reduced by caregiver training."
9446197,1,a,"This is the burning issue of the hour. In attempting to resolve it within the context of advanced age, it is important to clarify the meaning of the words involved: Independence and autonomy are far from being synonyms. Independence refers to the ability to perform physical activities of daily living (bathing, eating, preparing meals, shopping, money management), whereas the second word, autonomy, refers more to the ability to make decisions, to reason, to express an appropriate opinion in a given situation. Hazard and inevitability are totally at variance. Hazard implies the likelihood of occurrence of an event harmful to health, or to the length or quality of life. Hazard is more or less predictable, whereas inevitability is the expression of a supernatural power controlling all events. To find out whether ""dependency is a hazard or an inevitability"", it is necessary to conduct a historical review of the extension in human longevity and in particular of the current ""weight"" of aging both on individuals and on society at large. In Geneva, the proportion of the over 65-year-olds grew from 5.1 percent in 1880 to 13.4 percent in 1990. During that time, the gain in life expectancy was 52.4 percent for Geneva males of 80 years of age and 93 percent for Geneva females of the same age. This drastic change in age groups was coupled with a noteworthy change in household sizes. In 1860, the number of persons per household was 4.5. In 1990, it was down to 2.2. Conversely, the number of inmates in Geneva's medico-social institutions went up from 649 to 1168 between 1982 and 1992. In this socio-economic and cultural perspective, the concept of ""globality of the individual"" throughout his lifetime explains: age-related physiological changes; the long-term repercussion of physical, professional or leisure activities; the consequences of the accumulation of such varied risk factors as overweight or its opposite, malnutrition, tobacco or stress. Such frailty caused by aging is an ideal breeding ground for disease. For now, what matters most is the functional consequence of disease. Is the disease acute or chronic? Two out of three deaths result from a chronic disease, which caused loss of function by organs (impairment), loss of function by the subject himself (disability) or loss of function by the individual in society (social handicap or disadvantage). Raising the question ""Dependency: a hazard or an inevitability?"" boils down to asking oneself about the place of disease in our society and its determinants, and about all aspects of medicine and especially of prevention. When detected, a susceptibility brings into play primary prevention, aimed at averting the onset of the disease. After a disease has set in, measures to prevent recurrence, or secondary prevention, are required. Lastly, prevention of dependency and of loss of autonomy is part of tertiary prevention. Except for violent traumatic accidents, the formulation of the above concepts proves that dependency is essentially ""a hazard"". Therefore, let us anticipate!"
1512443,1,a,"Determinants of economic well-being among men 25-44, 45-64, and 65+ were examined using data from the 1984 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. A path analysis explored race, education, and occupational history effects on income adjusted for annuitized assets, household composition, and underreporting of unearned income. Direct and total education effects were undiminished among elderly persons, whose income derived mainly from benefits and assets, as compared with the nonelderly subjects whose income was dominated by earnings; education explained more of the variance in adjusted income for the elderly group than for the nonelderly. While Social Security income exerts an equalizing effect across educational attainment groups, private pensions and other important retirement income sources were highly education-dependent, producing a high overall degree of stratification on early-established socioeconomic characteristics."

METHODS: 1,441 female high school students responded to a survey questionnaire containing quantity frequency measures of alcohol consumption and two sex roles scales. The Australian Sex Role Scale and the Women in Society Questionnaire. FINDINGS: Frequency of heavy drinking behaviors such as bingeing and getting drunk were a common occurrence. Levels of alcohol consumption and patterns of bingeing and getting drunk were related to the respondents frequency of drinking. Comparison between the two sex role scales and drinking behavior revealed that frequent and heavy drinkers were more likely to have masculine type personality traits and more liberal and contemporary views on the role of women in society. CONCLUSIONS: Young women who do not conform to traditional sex role stereotyping are likely to engage in what is considered to be risky health behaviors that have traditionally been associated with males."
7785474,1,a,"This study followed 592 alcoholics (180 women and 412 men) after discharge from inpatient treatment. Multiple measures of treatment outcome were used to broaden our understanding of the process of recovery from alcohol abuse, and how that process differs for men and women. Patients were interviewed by telephone between 3 and 15 months after discharge to gather information about post-treatment experiences including: relationship with family, role performance, psychological impairment, and effort toward recovery. Additionally, if any alcohol use took place after treatment, information was collected about the pattern of alcohol consumption. Results indicated being married is consistently related to less drinking for men, while for women, being married contributes to relapse in the short term. The determinants of each measure of outcome were different for women and men, indicating that the process of recovery is not the same for both genders. The study confirms that drinking is related to other adverse outcomes for men, but not necessarily for women. It is evidence that women and men have different post-treatment functioning, and that different characteristics are predictive of these outcomes."

16981446,0,a,"Agriculture is one of the most hazardous occupational sectors, with a high prevalence of occupational injuries and work-related health problems. Most of these problems are caused by the interplay of human behavior and ergonomic factors and are thus preventable. Interventions to prevent occupational injuries and diseases among agricultural workers should aim to change risk behaviors and conditions by addressing specific behavioral determinants. To identify these factors, social cognitive models can be use that explain and predict health-related behavior. This study reviews the literature on the application of social cognitive models for the prevention of occupational injuries and diseases among agricultural workers. Studies are reviewed that apply the Health Belief Model, Theory of ReasonedAction, Theory of Planned Behavior, Transtheoretical Model of Change, or their subcomponents, to predict or change preventive behavior. Only a limited number of studies were found describing interventions that make use of these models, and those that do are often poorly documented with regard to the effect sizes and the explanatory or predictive value. It is concluded that the application of social cognitive models could significantly contribute to the effectiveness of preventive interventions in agriculture."

These factors are rapidly giving rise to new ecological paradigms of environmental stewardship and in healthcare environments that express sustainable theories and practices. This has given rise to a systematic system for promoting and assessing the energy performance and efficiency of healthcare facilities known as Leadership in Energy Efficient Environmental Design (LEED), and a parallel certification program, the Green Guide for Heath Care. These developments are examined in direct relation to the functions of managerial ethics. A series of ten sustainability-based ethical dilemmas are presented. Each is examined in relation to the need to inculcate in future healthcare administrators a critical understanding and appreciation of the need to reposition contemporary healthcare organizations at the center--as leading civic participants and role models in relation to the emerging movement towards carbon neutrality in the healthcare industry."

Sixty-seven patients also completed a comprehensive assessment of cognitive and voluntary motor functioning and chorea. The latter measures were correlated with HD-ADL total score and with most HD-ADL items, but not with those items dealing with marital and family relationship adjustment. Findings suggest that psychomotor speed and the ability to regulate attention may be particularly important determinants of everyday functioning in mild HD. Consistent with previously reported observations, this appears to be true even after accounting for individual differences in the severity of chorea and voluntary motor impairment."
8062177,1,a,"Major strides in early detection research can be attributed to social and behavioral research. Social scientists have been involved in research determining the epidemiologic basis of and the cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic disease. The availability of well accepted screening tests has been a barrier to early detection research, especially in the area of men's health. Early detection research has focused on the individual and system levels. Theoretical models are being adapted for early detection from smoking research and are a strength of current work. These models explain why people participate in early detection and how behavior change can occur. In studying system barriers to early detection, intervention efforts have been focused in the community and in the medical care delivery system. Methodologic issues are beginning to emerge, including measuring of program outcomes, and the appropriate research designs for community studies. Except for immigrant populations, initial screening rates are high, and the periodicity of screening becomes the outcome of choice. Some of these problems are the direct result of the success of research and public education efforts to increase cancer screening. The following are priorities for the next decade: theory driven research on behavior change and on interventions; the social determinants of physicians' participation in screening; process evaluation to relate community efforts to outcomes; and reductions in the stage at which cancer is diagnosed as an outcome measure."
8180289,1,a,"The concerns of relatively powerless groups may not be adequately addressed by health-care decisions based on market forces and on considerations of the general population. Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal. Available data are limited in their ability to assess impacts on small groups of health-policy decisions made for the population as a whole. A mechanism for surveilling such effects needs to be established to protect the interests of such groups, particularly when they have restricted alternatives."
9653610,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine on a large scale the multiple medical and nonmedical factors that influence glycemic control in the general population of children with diabetes, we performed a nationwide French cross-sectional study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 2,579 patients aged 1-19 years with type 1 diabetes of > 1 year's duration. The study was center based: 270 centers were identified, 206 agreed to participate, and 147 included at least 90% of their patients. Questionnaires were completed by physicians interviewing patients and family, and HbA1c measurements were centralized. To identify explanatory variables for HbA1c level and frequency of severe hypoglycemia, we performed multiple regression analysis using all the quantitative variables collected and stepwise logistic regression for the qualitative variables. RESULTS: Mean HbA1c value for the whole population was 8.97 +/- 1.98% (normal 4.7 +/- 0.7% [SD]). Only 19 children (0.7%) had ketoacidosis during the 6 months before the study, whereas 593 severe hypoglycemia events occurred in 338 children (13.8%). Control was better in university-affiliated hospitals and centers following > 50 patients, reflecting the importance of access to experienced diabetologists. Children had a mean of 2.3 injections, allegedly performed 2.8 glucose measurements per day, and were seen an average of 4.6 times per year at the center. In the multiple regression analysis, 94% of the variance of HbA1c was explained by our pool of selected variables, with the highest regression coefficient between HbA1c and age (Rc = 0.43, P < 0.0001), then with daily insulin dosage per kilogram (Rc = 0.28, P < 0.0001), mother's age (Rc = 0.26, P < 0.0001), frequency of glucose measurements (Rc = 0.21, P < 0.0001), and diabetes duration (Rc = 0.14, P < 0.0001). Logistic regression identified quality of family support and dietary compliance, two related qualitative and possibly subjective variables, as additional explanatory determinants of HbA1c. The frequency of severe hypoglycemia was 45 per 100 patient-years and correlated with diabetes duration, but not with HbA1c levels or other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall results remain unsatisfactory, 33% of studied French children with type 1 diabetes had HbA1c < 8%, the value obtained in Diabetes Control and Complications Trial adolescents treated intensively. Diabetes management in specialized centers should be encouraged."
16687381,0,a,"Understanding and enhancing adherence to HIV medications has been identified as a major challenge. The purpose of this study was to explore patterns and determinants of non-adherence among individuals receiving HIV care in a medical clinic. Seven focus groups were conducted with 42 HIV+ patients, and verbatim transcripts of focus group sessions were analyzed through a combination of ethnographic and content analysis. Of the participants currently on combination therapy, 68% reported at least one recent instance of non-adherence. The most commonly cited reasons for non-adherent behavior were grouped into four categories: (1) problems with side effects; (2) conflicts with daily life activities; (3) feelings of aversion toward the medications themselves; and (4) deliberate alterations to the prescribed regimen. Findings based on structured analysis of patient responses in each category differ from past research which defines adherence as a treatment problem and emphasizes logistical characteristics of the treatment regimen itself and patients' ability or willingness to follow specific instructions. In contrast, our focus group data suggest an alternative frame for understanding barriers to adherence which focuses on: (1) the meaning that adherence/pill-taking behavior has for individuals experiencing chronic illness; and (2) the impact that this behavior has on their identity. Because adherence behavior is integral to patients' experience of their disease, non-adherence is no longer a treatment problem, but is an illness problem. Framing adherence as an illness problem rather than a treatment problem is a critical shift that can be applied to the creation of assessments and interventions designed to support patient adherence; this article ends with a series of specific recommendations for programs, policy, and research."
16204363,0,a,"CONTEXT: Ghrelin may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying risk factor clustering observed in the metabolic syndrome, but this has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to study the association between ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome and identify social and behavioral determinants of ghrelin. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: The setting of this work was the Rancho Bernardo Study. PARTICIPANTS: Study subjects included 1513 men and women, aged 51-90 yr in 1984-1987. OUTCOMES: Total ghrelin, measured by RIA, and the metabolic syndrome, defined using Adult Treatment Panel III diagnostic criteria, were the outcome measures. RESULTS: Levels of ghrelin (mean +/- SD) did not differ between the 848 men (1451 +/- 532 pg/ml) and the 665 women (1459 +/- 672 pg/ml) or by age. Education, alcohol intake, and smoking history were each significantly and positively associated with ghrelin in a dose-related manner, independent of body mass index (BMI). Compared with participants with the lowest third of ghrelin levels, the age- and sex-adjusted odds of having the metabolic syndrome were 18% lower in the middle third and 53% lower in the highest third. This corresponds to a 21% decrease per SD increase in ghrelin (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.69, 0.89; P < or = 0.001); this was attenuated to 13% (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.75, 1.01; P = 0.07), after adjustment for BMI. Of the five metabolic syndrome components, only the association between ghrelin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was independent of BMI. A significant association independent of BMI was also observed between insulin and ghrelin. CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin levels are influenced by lifestyle factors. The inverse association between endogenous ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome is largely explained by the strong ghrelin-BMI association."

The committee reached consensus in finding considerable evidence supporting the association between psychological distress, childhood trauma and recent environmental stress, and several of the FGIDs but noted that this association is not specific to FGIDs. There is also considerable evidence that psychosocial variables are important determinants of the outcomes of global well-being, health-related quality of life, and health care seeking. In line with these descriptive findings, there is now increasing evidence that a number of psychological treatments and antidepressants are helpful in reducing symptoms and other consequences of the FGIDs in children and adults. The FGIDs are a result of complex interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors, and they can only be treated satisfactorily when all these factors are considered and addressed. Therefore, knowledge about the psychosocial aspects of FGIDs is fundamental and critical to the understanding, assessment, and treatment of these disorders. More extensive physician training is needed if these aspects of treatment are to be used effectively and widely in clinical practice."
18519873,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that independently contribute to disability and quality of life (QoL) in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: A group of 190 patients with PD recruited from outpatient clinics and the Dutch Parkinson's Disease Association participated in this cross-sectional study. Data on demographic and clinical factors, motor symptoms, cognitive functions, affective symptoms, comorbidity, and social support were collected during neurologic and neuropsychological examinations. Disability was rated using the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (SE-ADL), the AMC Linear Disability Score (ALDS), and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). QoL was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire (PDQL) and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to identify determinants of disability and poor QoL. RESULTS: Axial impairment (postural instability and gait difficulty) explained the largest proportion of variance in disability. Bradykinesia and comorbidity contributed to disability, but to a lesser extent. Self-reported mood symptoms and axial impairment were the two factors most closely associated with poorer QoL, but comorbidity and bradykinesia additionally contributed to the explanatory power. Semantic fluency and psychomotor skills were the only cognitive variables related to some aspects of functional outcome. CONCLUSION: Axial impairment is strongly associated with disability in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease (PD). Self-report indices of mood status and axial impairment are identified as the main determinants of poor quality of life (QoL). The results of this study may help to identify patients with PD at risk for functional dependence and reduced QoL."
18777671,0,a,"There exists a lot of research on the reservation wages of the unemployed as a determinant of unemployment duration. Little is known about the reservation wages of those who are not in the labor force but might be potential labor force returnees, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries. The main objective of this article is to assess what can be learned from the subjective reservation wages of DI beneficiaries. Using the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS), the article assesses the magnitudes of reservation wages compared to the last wage earned and the benefit amount, as well as the determinants of reservation wages in a regression framework. The NBDS is unique in that it provides the reservation wages and the work history of DI beneficiaries before and after joining the DI rolls. The article has several noteworthy results and policy implications: *Data show that a significant portion of beneficiaries report being likely to accept a job if offered one. Based on the NBDS, 13 percent of DI beneficiaries who did not work since joining the rolls in 1981-1982 reported in 1991 that they would be willing to work if offered a job and provided their reservation wages. *DI beneficiaries do not appear to price themselves out of the labor market. Half of them would want a wage that is 80 percent or less of the last wage earned before receiving DI. It is estimated that approximately 7 percent of long-term DI beneficiaries may potentially return-to-work if they search for jobs and have a wage offer distribution with a mean at 80 percent of their last wage. *The nonlabor income in addition to the benefit is positively and significantly associated with the reservation wage, while the benefit amount per se is not. However, this result needs to be treated with caution given that nonlabor income is endogenous to the model. *Heterogeneity exists between persons still under the DI program and those that have moved to the Old-Age program. The subsamples of persons who have shifted to the Old-Age program and those who are still under the DI program have median reservation wage to the last wage ratios of 0.69 and 0.93, respectively. A significantly lower reservation wage for persons who have moved to the Old-Age program was also found in a regression framework. This heterogeneity between the two groups may result in part from the different program characteristics both groups face, for instance, in terms of benefit termination and Medicare eligibility rules. *Subjective reservation wage data can be useful to study populations that are out of the labor force. This article is innovative in that it focuses on a group of persons who are typically considered as being out of the labor force, and therefore are not asked reservation wages in general household surveys such as the Current Population Survey. It would be of great interest to collect more reservation wage data for DI beneficiaries in a longitudinal data set to expand this analysis, for instance, to assess conclusively the effects of changing program characteristics on reservation wages and return-to-work outcomes as beneficiaries transition to the Old-Age program or as new return-to-work programs are put in place."
17959411,0,a,"The influence of socio-economic determinants among the elderly is a complex subject. Although they rely on pension income, the wealth that they have accumulated over their lifetime (primarily housing assets), jointly with housing-related determinants, could have a more significant effect on health production. Hence, owning a house has more potential than income for reducing health inequalities. This study makes use of a representative cross-sectional database on the Spanish population aged 55 or over. Using a continuous variable to measure health and a measure of disabilities in old age, the study explores some socio-economic determinants of health and disability and provides a breakdown of inequalities in socio-economic status and in aggregate individual health. The study's findings indicate that housing equity overrides the effect of income as a determinant of health and (absence of) disability in old age. Furthermore, housing assets account for more than 90% of socio-economic inequalities and 54% of inequalities in disability."
15868185,0,a,"The mechanism of final cessation of the reproductive life span has not been solved yet. It is generally assumed that the most important factor is ovarian follicular reserve. In ovaries at intrauterine period, a major factor that determines the number of the primordial follicle is the mitotic ability as well as the number of primordial germ cells, which migrate to gonadal ridge. The telomere length is one factor that determines the number of mitosis of the cell. The differences between the telomere lengths of same aged healthy women reflect the difference of the telomeres of the primordial germ cells at the intrauterine period. Women with long telomeres supposedly have had their primordial germ cells at the beginning of life with long telomeres. So, these cells should have had more mitotic division and more follicle numbers in the ovaries than the short ones. The aim of this study was to analyse the relation of the reproductive life span and telomere length. The telomere lengths of 37 women volunteers aged 50 years were measured by fiber FISH technique. A positive correlation was found between reproductive life span and the telomere length."
16448303,0,a,"This study investigated the association between 2 distinct personal coping resources (mastery and sense of coherence) and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. During follow-up (up to 6 years), 994 deaths were recorded among 20,323 participants, ages 41 to 80 years, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer Study in the United Kingdom. A strong sense of mastery was associated with lower rates of mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, after adjusting for age, sex, and prevalent chronic physical disease. The association with all-cause mortality was observed for both men and women and remained following further adjustment for cigarette smoking, social class, hostility, neuroticism, and extroversion. Analysis of the joint association between mastery and sense of coherence revealed both personal coping dispositions to be independently associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality. In addition, these data suggested that the association for mastery was specific to cardiovascular mortality, whereas the association for sense of coherence was specific to cancer mortality. These results may aid future study of coping resources as determinants of persistent well-being."
19351401,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Cholera remains a serious public health problem in low-income countries despite efforts in the past to promote oral rehydration therapy as major treatment. In 2007, the majority of worldwide cases (94%) and deaths (99%) were reported from Africa. To improve cholera control efforts in addition to maintaining and improving existing water supply, sanitation and hygiene behaviour measures, the World Health Organization has recently started to consider the use of vaccines as an additional public health tool. To assess this new approach in endemic settings, a project was launched in Zanzibar to vaccinate 50,000 individuals living in communities at high risk of cholera with an oral two-dose vaccine (Dukoral). Immunisation programmes in low-income countries have suffered a reduced coverage or were even brought to a halt because of an ignorance of local realities. To ensure the success of vaccination campaigns, implementers have to consider community-held perceptions and behaviours regarding the infectious disease and the vaccine of interest. The main aim of this study is to provide advice to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Zanzibar regarding routine introduction of an oral cholera vaccine from a socioeconomic and behavioural perspective as part of a long-term development for a sustained cholera prevention strategy. METHODS AND DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative methods of health social science research will be applied on four stakeholder levels before and after the mass vaccination campaign. Rapid assessment individual interviews and focus groups will be used to describe cholera- and vaccine-related views of policy makers, health care professionals and community representatives. The cultural epidemiological approach will be employed on the individual household resident level in a repeated cross-sectional design to estimate determinants of anticipated and actual oral cholera vaccine acceptance. DISCUSSION: The study presented here is designed to inform about people's perceptions regarding cholera and about socioeconomic and behavioural factors determining anticipated and actual oral cholera vaccine acceptance in Zanzibar. Its pre- and post-intervention design using a mixed-methods approach on different stakeholder levels in communities at high risk of cholera outbreaks will ensure the collection of locally valid data relevant for public health action and planning."
9611901,1,a,"This paper examines the determinants of hip fracture costs and further evaluates potential savings in costs when the occurrence of hip fracture is prevented. The costs of hip fracture are comprised of direct costs from health care and the social welfare system. Data were collected for 1,080 postmenopausal women admitted from private residence for primary hip fracture surgery during the year of 1992 in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. It was found that the cost of hip fracture is significantly related to age, mortality the year after a fracture, type of fracture, costs 1 year before a fracture, and hospital admission. The savings in direct costs for an average woman surviving the year after a fracture amount to SEK 210,000."
9010897,1,a,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated clinicians' compliance with delivering written advice and information against tobacco use (prevention prescriptions) to adolescent patients. METHODS: Clinicians in 77 orthodontic offices were trained (and asked) to provide anti-tobacco counseling and prescriptions to 10- to 18-year-olds for 2 years. Each of eight prescriptions was provided for distribution to adolescent patients. Information concerning prescription-tracking methods and operant learning theory variables such as modeling and feedback was obtained using a cross-sectional interview of clinical staff. The proportion of prescriptions written was regressed on possible ""determinants."" Analyses were replicated for two time periods. RESULTS: Mean anti-tobacco prescription compliance was 66 and 73% for two separate time periods. Multiple regression analyses were computed for the first (R = 0.45, F(7,63) = 2.29, P < 0.001) and second (R = 0.48, F(7,63) = 2.76, P < 0.001) time periods. Prescription tracking and praise from patients were significant correlates for the first time period; praise and modeling were significant for the second time period. Twenty and twenty-three percent, respectively, of the variance in office prescription rate was explained. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that compliance with primary prevention procedures may be influenced by feedback from patients, staff modeling, and formal office tracking information."
10158455,1,a,"The impact of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) on the recent decline in diarrhoea mortality in the northeast of Brazil was studied. Proportionate infant mortality fell from 32% in 1980 to 17% in 1989 and infant deaths attributed to diarrhoea dropped from 41% to 25%, resulting in an overall reduction of 57%. Similar decreases were observed for children aged 1-4 years. Diarrhoea admissions also fell from 57% of infant hospitalizations in 1980 to 30% in 1990. None of the other major causes of death or admissions showed such decline. ORT was introduced in the early 1980s, being used in 35% of all episodes in 1991 and in 62% of those regarded as severe by the mother. Other changes included a worsening of socioeconomic conditions and increases in water supply, vaccine coverage, breastfeeding duration and nutritional status. A simulation model estimated that changes in factors other than ORT would lead to a 21% reduction in infant diarrhoea mortality, or about one-third of the actual decline. Finally, an ecological analysis showed that ORT use rates were inversely correlated to infant diarrhoea mortality (r=-0.61; p=0.04). Despite the shortcomings of the available data, these findings suggest an important impact of ORT on diarrhoea mortality."
7500175,1,a,"International health organizations have recommended exclusive breast-feeding (EBF) (i.e., breast milk as the only source of food) as the optimal infant feeding method during the first 4-6 mo of life. Therefore, it is important to document the determinants of EBF in different populations. Low-income urban women from Brazil (n = 446, 2 maternity wards), Honduras (n = 1582, 3 maternity wards) and Mexico (n = 765, 3 maternity wards) were interviewed at birth and in their homes at 1 mo and 2-4 mo after delivery. Multivariate survival analyses (Cox model) indicated that planned duration of EBF (all 3 countries), having a female infant, and not being employed (Brazil and Honduras), lower socioeconomic status (Honduras and Mexico) and higher birth weight (control hospital in Brazil and Honduras) were positively associated (P < or = 0.10) with EBF. Women who delivered in the maternity wards that had more developed breast-feeding promotion programs were more successful with EBF. The association between maternal education and EBF was modified by the maternity ward in Mexico and Honduras. Being > or = 18 y and having a partner living (Brazil) or not (Mexico) living at home were positively associated with EBF. These findings can contribute toward the design of EBF promotion efforts in Latin America."
11028281,0,a,"In a community sample of 394 elderly aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed. Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed. The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person. In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time. 88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year. 55.8% took at least one medicine each day. The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine. Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor. Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life. Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support. There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine."
18922241,0,a,"INTRODUCTION: Anhedonia is defined as the loss of the capacity to feel pleasure and there is no consensus with its relationship with depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, no study has investigated the problematic of anhedonia in the context of HIV-infection, which concern a lot of patients with depressive symptoms. Depressive symptomatology presents a major challenge in the management of HIV-infection due to its central role in clinical progression. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to disentangle relationship between determinants of anhedonia, depression and anxiety in order to optimise mental management of HIV infection. METHOD: In 2003, a face-to-face survey (ANRS-EN12-VESPA) was conducted among patients selected in a random stratified sample of 102 French hospital departments delivering HIV care. Eligible respondents were HIV-infected outpatients, aged 18 or older living in France and diagnosed for at least six months. Among solicited patients, 2932 agreed to participate (response rate: 59%) and data about anhedonia, anxiety and depression are available for 1427 patients. The face-to-face gathered information on sociodemographic characteristics, such as education level, gender, partner, children, financial situation or housing and also psychosocial and sociobehavioural characteristics, such as drug use. Self-reported side effects of treatment were also available. ASSESSMENT TOOLS: Anxiety and depression were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale. Physical anhedonia was assessed using the French version of the Chapman scale. Three regression models were used to identify factors associated with anhedonia, anxiety and depression among demographic, psychosocial and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Factors independently associated with anhedonia were older age (>50), lower education level, unemployment and men HIV contaminated by heterosexual relation or injecting drug use. Women, with lower education level, unemployment, without steady partner, with a detectable viral load and who reported side effect of HAART presented more frequently anxiety. Unemployment, uncomfortable housing, no social support from friends, self-reported side effect and lipodystrophy were independently associated with depression. CONCLUSION: Our results underline the multiplicity of factors associated with mental disorders related to depression. These results can be explained by the fact that the anxiety and anhedonia are two cardinal symptoms of depression. Determinants of anhedonia and anxiety reported in this study may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in the context of HIV infection in order to optimize long-term psychological follow up of concerned patients."
1830689,1,a,"Several factors were studied for their association with the prevalence of chronic low-back syndromes, sciatica, and unspecified low-back pain (LBP) in 2,946 women and 2,727 men (age range, 30-64 years) participating in the Mini-Finland Health Survey, a project aimed at comprehensive evaluation of the population's health. On the basis of a standardized clinical examination, a physician diagnosed sciatica in 5.1% and LBP in 11.6% of the subjects. Those with a previous traumatic back injury had a 2.5-fold risk of having sciatica or LBP. The fractions of sciatica and LBP attributable to such back injuries were estimated to be 16.5% and 13.7%, respectively. Sum indices of both physical and mental stress at work were found to be directly proportional to the prevalence of sciatica and LBP. Smokers had an increased risk of LBP, and body height was related positively to the prevalence of sciatica. These associations, however, were inconsistent between sex and age subgroups. In the presence of osteoarthritis in the knee, hip, or hand, LBP was prevalent (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-6.9), but sciatica was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.7). Diabetics were found to have a significantly decreased prevalence of LBP (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). Many factors, independent of each other, determine the occurrence of chronic low-back syndromes. The determinants of sciatica and LBP are different to some extent."
7949803,1,a,"Using the prospective Hungarian childhood diabetes register, a nationwide case-control study was carried out to investigate the possible role of various non-genetic factors as risk determinants for type 1 diabetes in childhood. A questionnaire (covering family characteristics, social status, fetal and perinatal events, breast-feeding habits, infectious diseases and stressful life events) was sent by mail to all incident diabetic children in 1990 (n = 163) and to two referent children (for each diabetic child), matched for age, sex and county. Diabetic children had a tendency to have mothers > 35 years of age (odds ratio (OR) = 3.52; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.74-16.79), a lower proportion of their mothers had higher education (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 0.95-3.0) and these children tended to move home more frequently (OR = 1.99; 95% CI 0.97-4.1). Although the duration of exclusive breast feeding was similar in both groups, the proportion of diabetic children who received no breast milk tended to be higher (OR = 1.76; 95% CI 0.91-3.4). A higher proportion of diabetic children reported non-specific infections (OR = 2.94; 95% CI 1.19-7.21) and the number of stressful life events was higher in diabetic children aged 10-14 years (OR = 3.9; 95% CI 1.14-13.27). As the risk determinants for childhood insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus identified in our low-risk population appear to be similar to those detected in the genetically different, high-risk Swedish population, our study strongly supports an etiological role for these non-genetic risk factors in IDDM."
15687086,0,a,"CONTEXT: Adolescents have among the highest sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates. Rich data are now available to characterize the social and behavioral factors that affect adolescent STD risk. METHODS: Data from Wave 1 (1995) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) are used to estimate school, neighborhood, family and individual level effects on acquiring an STD. Data from Waves 1 and 2 (1996) of Add Health are also used to estimate the effects of prior STD acquisition and other factors on STD occurrence between waves. Random intercept logistic regression and random intercept piecewise exponential hazard regression are used to account for possible clustering in the Add Health data. RESULTS: Seven percent of sexually experienced teenagers reported ever having had an STD as of Wave 1, and almost 7% reported having had an STD between Waves 1 and 2. Respondents' age, gender, race or ethnicity, and their family background, neighborhood and school characteristics affect STD acquisition at Wave 1. Among teenagers who were sexually experienced at Wave 1, younger age at first intercourse elevates STD risk. Other factors contribute, but to a lesser degree. For acquisition of an STD between Waves 1 and 2, females, blacks, teenagers with lower levels of mother's education and those who have had a prior STD are at higher risk. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple social and behavioral factors influence lifetime history of STD. Age at first intercourse and STD history affect subsequent STD acquisition. Self-reports of STD acquisition in probability samples of the general population are useful."
7871551,1,a,"This article examines the determinants of first-time use durations of the injectable contraceptive Depo Medroxy Progesterone Acetate (DMPA) for rural Bangladeshi women. The method's side effects were defined by 200 first-time users in Matlab district during lengthy, open-ended interviews. Women with many children used the method longer than did women of low parity. Those who experienced side effects had shorter use durations than those who did not, and those who cited heavy bleeding as their main problem discontinued use soonest. Women whose husbands approved of family planning had significantly longer use durations than those whose husbands disapproved. Respondents who adopted DMPA because of perceived positive aspects of the drug used it longer than those who chose it for other reasons. Results of the study underscore the importance of viewing side effects in a specific social and cultural context. Expanded side-effects counseling for women and their husbands is needed."
18032810,0,a,"Poverty and social exclusion are important socio-economic variables which are often taken for granted while considering ill-health effects. Social exclusion mainly refers to the inability of our society to keep all groups and individuals within reach of what we expect as society to realize their full potential. Marginalization of certain groups or classes occurs in most societies including developed countries and perhaps it is more pronounced in underdeveloped countries. In the Indian context, caste may be considered broadly as a proxy for socio-economic status and poverty. In the identification of the poor, scheduled caste and scheduled tribes and in some cases the other backward castes are considered as socially disadvantaged groups and such groups have a higher probability of living under adverse conditions and poverty. The health status and utilization patterns of such groups give an indication of their social exclusion as well as an idea of the linkages between poverty and health. In this review, we examined broad linkages between caste and some select health/health utilization indicators. We examined data on prevalence of anaemia, treatment of diarrhoea, infant mortality rate, utilization of maternal health care and childhood vaccinations among different caste groups in India. The data based on the National Family Health Survey II (NFHS II) highlight considerable caste differentials in health. The linkages between caste and some health indicators show that poverty is a complex issue which needs to be addressed with a multi-dimensional paradigm. Minimizing the suffering from poverty and ill-health necessitates recognizing the complexity and adopting a perspective such as holistic epidemiology which can challenge pure technocentric approaches to achieve health status."
8696125,1,a,"The concept of voluntarism, as it applies to models of health education, underpins the nursing care of people who are chronically confused and their relatives. This article argues that voluntarism needs to be balanced by the notion of collectivism which takes full account of the contribution made by sociopolitical determinants of health. The central concepts of voluntarism and health education are defined and then the article proceeds to examine the extent to which voluntarism has underpinned various models of health education which can be used to support nursing practice. A critique of the concept of voluntarism, as used in health education, is provided. It is argued that models of health education which are polarized towards either voluntarism or collectivism are based on an inadequate understanding of human social action and that this polarization undermines the usefulness of these models of health education."
10563479,1,a,"QT interval prolongation not attributed to long QT syndromes is reported to be associated with increased risk of sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. Genetic and environmental determinants of QTc interval were investigated in an unselected free living population sample of 80 kindreds residing in kibbutz settlements in Israel. The sample included 214 males and 227 females aged 15-97 years. There was a significant familial aggregation of adjusted QT interval levels, as indicated by inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients significantly different from zero. Complex segregation analysis applied to the sex- and age-adjusted data was not conclusive and heterogeneous etiologies for individual differences were suggested. There was evidence for a single recessive locus (q = 0.173) with a major effect in addition to polygenic effects (h2 = 0.41) that explained the mixture of distributions. In parallel, a nontransmitted environmental major factor in addition to polygenic effects that explained the adjusted variation in QTc could not be rejected. Similar results were obtained upon the adjustment for sex, age, and environmental covariables. The major factor, either genetic or environmental, and polygenic-loci accounted for about 20 and 33% of the adjusted QTc variation, respectively. Furthermore, sex, age, measured environmental covariables, the unmeasured major factor, and the unmeasured polygenes could account for 63% of the variation of QTc in these families. Our data provide evidence for a major factor, either genetic or environmental, in addition to a polygenic background, influencing QT interval levels in a population-based sample of pedigrees."
15778630,0,a,This study examined the relationship between early childhood caries (ECC) and measures of socioeconomic status as environmental determinants of oral health inequalities. Dental caries and quality of oral hygiene were reported on 384 young inner-city children (24-35 months) by clinical examination. Early childhood caries was diagnosed in 18.5% of children. Ethnicity (P < 0.001) and neighborhood (P < 0.001) were the social variables significantly predictive of ECC in a logistic regression model. Living in a deprived neighborhood and the mother being of East European descent were the social variables with strongest association with ECC. These variables can be considered adequate criteria to identify groups at risk within the overall population.
8715683,1,a,"Using gender as an analytic category, this paper shows the way the social relations between men and women operate historically and how the female values give place to the male ones. In such context, the educational process has a special importance as one of the determinants of the woman social inclusion/exclusion."
9683377,1,a,"This paper contributes to debates on the broad determinants of health and on the policy shift from curative to preventive and protective interventions. It addresses empirically the relative importance of influences on health with a multiple regression analysis of ecologic data from the 49 counties of Ontario. One model achieved high predictive power (that is, Adj R2 > 75%, p < 0.0001). Educational levels were a strong predictor of population health, showing a consistent inverse relationship with premature mortality ratios for both sexes and it was the strongest predictor for females. A low income variable supplied the strongest prediction for male mortality. This variable displayed a positive association with male mortality. Municipal expenditures on environmental protection exerted a negative effect on male mortality. These findings raise questions about the current directions of health policy in Ontario where the provincial government has reduced funding to social and environmental programs, while promising to maintain health care funding."
20131685,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined correlates of tobacco use among Hmong people residing in Wisconsin. METHODS: Surveys of youth (ages 12-17) and adults (ages > or =18), available in English and Hmong, were distributed in 14 communities through Hmong Mutual Assistance Associations and analyzed centrally. Surveys assessed daily and ever use of tobacco, as well as other sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of those contacted, 2856 people completed the survey (1460 youth and 1396 adults). Among youth, 15% reported daily use (18.8% for males, 11.7% for females); 32% reported ever use (36.3% for males, 28.2% for females). Education and birth location were significant predictors of tobacco use. Youth who reported someone in their household smoked were more likely to use tobacco. The odds of ever use of tobacco increased as the percent of life lived in the United States increased (OR = 3.7). Among adults, prevalence of daily use was 20% (25.3% for males, 12.4% for females) and ever use was 35.9% (45% for males, 23.2% for females.) Adults born in the United States were 3.4 to 3.7 times more likely to use tobacco. The less education reported, the more likely they were to be a daily tobacco user. Adults who reported that someone in their household smoked were 2.8 to 3.4 times more likely to use tobacco. CONCLUSION: Overall, Hmong males are at higher risk of smoking than females, although this difference is smaller for youth than adults. Education and household exposure are strong predictors of smoking prevalence."
18484442,0,a,"While imposing research has been conducted with respect to the biological determinants of painful menstruation, little is known about the psychosocial factors, including work-related stress that might influence menstrual pain. We conducted a study in which we aimed to determine besides the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea whether menstrual pain was associated with job control, co-worker social support, job security and dissatisfaction with the job. Data of 2772 working women aged 18-55 years, participants in the Hungarostudy 2002 nation-wide representative survey was analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between work stress factors and menstrual pain. Altogether 15.5% of women reported to experience menstrual pain that limits their daily activity. Low job control, low co-worker social support and low job security were found to be associated with a higher risk for menstrual pain even after controlling for the effect of age, educational attainment, parity status, smoking, body-mass index and treatment for gynecological problems. Job dissatisfaction was also related to dysmenorrhoea, albeit not significantly. The relationship between work-related psychosocial factors and painful menstruation deserves further investigation in order to determine the possible pathways of this association."
19852186,0,a,"Most sociological theories consider murder an outcome of the differential distribution of individual, neighborhood, or social characteristics. And while such studies explain variation in aggregate homicide rates, they do not explain the social order of murder, that is, who kills whom, when, where, and for what reason. This article argues that gang murder is best understood not by searching for its individual determinants but by examining the social networks of action and reaction that create it. In short, the social structure of gang murder is defined by the manner in which social networks are constructed and by people's placement in them. The author uses a network approach and incident-level homicide records to recreate and analyze the structure of gang murders in Chicago. Findings demonstrate that individual murders between gangs create an institutionalized network of group conflict, net of any individual's participation or motive. Within this network, murders spread through an epidemic-like process of social contagion as gangs evaluate the highly visible actions of others in their local networks and negotiate dominance considerations that arise during violent incidents."
18569355,0,a,"The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the merits of evaluating new public health campaign materials in the developmental phase using an experimental design. This is referred to as experimental pretesting. In practice, most new materials are tested only after they have been distributed using nonexperimental or quasiexperimental designs. In cases where materials are pretested prior to distribution, pretesting is usually done using qualitative research methods such as focus groups. Although these methods are useful, they cannot reliably predict the effectiveness of new campaign materials in a developmental phase. Therefore, we suggest when pretesting new materials, not only qualitative research methods but also experimental research methods must be used. The present study discusses an experimental pretest study of new campaign materials intended for distribution in a national sexually transmitted infection (STI) AIDS prevention campaign in the Netherlands. The campaign material tested was the storyline of a planned television commercial on safe sex. A storyboard that consisted of drawings and text was presented to members of the target population, namely, students between the ages of 14 and 16 enrolled in vocational schools. Results showed positive effects on targeted determinants of safe sexual behavior. The advantages, practical implications, and limitations of experimental pretesting are discussed."
7500175,1,a,"International health organizations have recommended exclusive breast-feeding (EBF) (i.e., breast milk as the only source of food) as the optimal infant feeding method during the first 4-6 mo of life. Therefore, it is important to document the determinants of EBF in different populations. Low-income urban women from Brazil (n = 446, 2 maternity wards), Honduras (n = 1582, 3 maternity wards) and Mexico (n = 765, 3 maternity wards) were interviewed at birth and in their homes at 1 mo and 2-4 mo after delivery. Multivariate survival analyses (Cox model) indicated that planned duration of EBF (all 3 countries), having a female infant, and not being employed (Brazil and Honduras), lower socioeconomic status (Honduras and Mexico) and higher birth weight (control hospital in Brazil and Honduras) were positively associated (P < or = 0.10) with EBF. Women who delivered in the maternity wards that had more developed breast-feeding promotion programs were more successful with EBF. The association between maternal education and EBF was modified by the maternity ward in Mexico and Honduras. Being > or = 18 y and having a partner living (Brazil) or not (Mexico) living at home were positively associated with EBF. These findings can contribute toward the design of EBF promotion efforts in Latin America."
1860024,1,a,"""To isolate and quantify possible determinants of any increased prevalence of depressive disorders in women we studied a select group of men and women, initially similar in terms of a number of putative social determinants of depression, and reviewed the sample five years later when social role diversity was anticipated. We used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) to generate DSM-III and RDC diagnoses to estimate lifetime depressive disorders, and established (via corroborative reports) the likely accuracy of those data. Despite lifetime depression being a relatively common experience, no significant sex differences in depressive episodes were demonstrated, suggesting the possible irrelevance of biological factors in determining any sex difference. As there was not major social role divergence over the five year study, we interpret the lack of a sex difference as a consequence, and suggest that findings support the view that social factors are of key relevance in determining any female preponderance in depression described in general population studies."""
7660042,1,a,"The quality of official information on underlying causes of infant deaths was studied on the basis of data collected for a population-based study of the surveillance of infant mortality in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil in 1989. The survey included the analysis of a sample of infant deaths carried out by comparing the underlying causes of death as coded on death certificates to those recorded by a group of doctors who abstracted information from hospital records. We verified that 11.7% of neonatal deaths did not have the underlying cause of death confirmed by the investigation (kappa = 0.61), and neither did 44.0% of post-neonatal deaths (kappa = 0.47). It is believed that this major disagreement among post-neonatal deaths is due to the close correlation observed among the major causes of death within this group (pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition). For example, associated malnutrition was observed in 76.9% of those cases in which diarrhoea was coded as the underlying cause of death. It was concluded that the quality of the death certificates is not satisfactory. However, the composition of the main groups of causes presented no significant alteration after investigation and may be used in public health surveillance, especially if we regard pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition as a group with the same determinants. Unfortunately, this group still accounts for a great number of otherwise avoidable deaths in Brazil."
9059478,1,a,"BACKGROUND: As more developing countries adopt a westernised style of living, an increase in the prevalence of asthma can be expected to occur in these areas. A study was undertaken to establish the normal response to exercise in Ghanaian children and to use these normal values to determine the prevalence of exercise induced bronchospasm (EIB) in urban rich (UR), urban poor (UP), and rural (R) school children. Skin test reactivity to common inhalant allergens in UR, UP, and R children with and without EIB was also investigated. METHODS: Two hundred children aged 9-16 years without a previous history of respiratory symptoms were randomly selected and underwent free running exercise testing. A normal response to exercise was defined as the group mean change in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) +/- 2 standard deviations. This value was used to identify the prevalence of EIB in UR, UP, and R schoolchildren. A total of 1095 children from three different schools underwent exercise testing (220 UP, 599 UR, 276 R), after which 916 children underwent skin prick testing to six common inhalant allergens (D farinae, D pteronyssinus, cat, dog, Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans). RESULTS: From the results of exercise testing in asymptomatic children the normal range was defined as a fall in PEFR of < 12.5% after exercise. Thirty four children were classified as having EIB on the basis of the above definition, giving an overall prevalence of 3.1%. The prevalence of EIB was significantly higher in UR children (4.7%) than in both UP (2.2%; p < 0.05) and R children (1.4%; p < 0.01). However, the prevalence rates in the UP and R children were similar. The prevalence of atopy in the whole population was 4.4%. Of the children with EIB, 10% were skin test positive to at least one of the allergens tested. The prevalence of atopy was significantly higher in UR children (6.55%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.5% to 9.2%) than in UP (2.9%, 95% CI 0.9% to 6.7%) and R children (1.5%, 95% CI 0.4% to 3.7%), respectively (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EIB and atopy is higher in urban rich than in urban poor or rural children suggesting that, in addition to genetic predisposition, social and environmental factors such as wealth, life style, and housing are important determinants of these phenotypes."

18441275,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: . Objectives were to study the effects of socioeconomic factors on transitions in living arrangements and mortality for men and women. METHODS: We used a sample of Finns aged 65 years and older living alone or with a partner at the end of 1997 (N = 250,787) drawn from population registers, and followed them up for transitions in living arrangements (with partner, alone, with others, institutionalized) and death at the end of 2002. RESULTS: Health conditions associated with functional difficulties were major determinants of institutionalization and death and were associated with transitions between private households. Low income among men and in particular not owning a home were independently associated with institutionalization and death among those living alone or with a partner at baseline. Among those living with a partner, the transition to living alone was associated with all socioeconomic factors but most strongly with a low income and not owning a home. Transitions to living with others were associated in particular with low occupational social class and education. DISCUSSION: Variations in the associations of different socioeconomic indicators with living arrangement transitions imply different social pathways. However, material socioeconomic indicators dominated other measures of socioeconomic status in determining such transitions, and their effects were only partly mediated by chronic conditions."
11818587,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mental health among severe hearing-impaired adults in the Netherlands, separately by prelingual and postlingual age of onset. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-three face-to-face interviews were carried out by persons with practical skills in communication with hearing-impaired people. RESULTS: Of prelingually and postlingually deaf men, 27.1% and 27.7%, respectively, reported mental distress (scores on the General Health Questionnaire > or = 2), and among women these figures were 32.4% and 43.2%. These rates are higher than in the general population (men: 22.0%; women: 26.6%). Among the prelingual category, none of the demographic or hearing loss-related characteristics was associated with mental health status as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Of these variables, only additional impairment or serious illness was associated with the brief Symptom Checklist (SCL-8D). Among the postlingual category, female gender and equilibrium disturbance was associated with both the GHQ and SCL-8D, and additional impairment or serious illness with the SCL-8D. For both categories, the risk of mental distress also was higher in those with more communication problems, lower levels of self-esteem, and poorer acceptance of the hearing loss. Opportunities for identification in youth and social support were not associated with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health status differs between the hearing-impaired and the general population, but not as much as is sometimes suggested. Mental distress is greater in those in certain categories of the hearing-impaired."
12348273,1,a,"""This paper reopens the debate between Weekley (1988) and Rowsell (1989) over why pockets of depopulation have persisted within parts of rural Britain which have experienced net growth through counterurbanisation. It argues that Weekley has not fully appreciated the context for local population losses, namely the emergence of a new structural relationship between people, households, and dwellings, and the growing tension between production and consumption interests in rural locales. Moreover, the paper disputes claims that depopulation is triggered by the actions of either the landowner or the planner. Drawing on case study material informed by critical realism, it argues that planners and landowners have been drawn into an asymmetrical power relationship. This has tended to buttress landed interests and, in so doing, reproduce mechanisms which protect the less populous communities from growth and change."""
18202085,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Parenting and parent-child relationships influence children's emotional and social development and evidence exists that they may be life-course determinants of health. This study tests the hypothesis that adverse parenting in the early years predicts poor health in mid-childhood. METHODS: A prospective study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Health data on over 8000 children (60% of those recruited) were available for analysis at 6.9 and 7.7 years. EXPOSURES: self-reported maternal hostility, resentment and hitting/shouting in early childhood. OUTCOMES: maternal report of child's health in general and number of health problems when the child was 6.9 and 7.7 years, adjusting for socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Sub-optimal parenting, as measured here, was observed among 62, 80 and 83% of families for hostility, resentment and hitting/shouting, respectively. Resentment was more common among older mothers in owner-occupied housing. Resentment and hostility predicted health at both ages independently of socioeconomic circumstances. 'Hitting/shouting' was weakly predictive of number of health problems. A greater proportion of variance was explained by parenting variables than by socio-economic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting and parent-child relationships in the early years predict health in mid-childhood in a way consistent with a causal role. If further studies replicate this finding, policies to improve parenting could be expected to have a modest beneficial impact on health as well as emotional and social development. As some aspects of sub-optimal parenting show reverse social class distribution, initiatives targeted at those living in social deprivation may not achieve the optimum impact on health."
9785712,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: To consider the power of principles derived from evolutionary biology to explain the causes and determinants of some forms of child and adolescent mental disorders. METHOD: The authors reviewed the scientific literature for evolutionary mechanisms proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of early-onset disorders. RESULTS: A diverse set of evolutionary mechanisms has been proposed. With the exception of certain genetically determined conditions, many of the proposed mechanisms have little empirical data to support them. One mechanism focuses on the vulnerabilities associated with conserved behavior patterns, such as separation anxiety and other alarm responses. These behavioral patterns are adaptive if they appear in some situations, but not in others. Other attractive theories include a co-optation of underlying neurobiology systems (substance abuse), environmental shifts (transformation of present day environments away from primeval environments), and evolutionary arms races as may occur in putative autoimmune disorders with neuropsychiatric sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Evolutionary biology provides a potentially powerful framework for understanding disease pathogenesis in child psychiatry and should permit the integration of new knowledge from a broad range of scientific disciplines. Evolutionary explanations are typically population-based and fail to account for why a particular individual is disciplines. Evolutionary explanations are typically population-based and fail to account for why a particular individual is affected. Consequently, any adequate account of disease pathogenesis requires that environmental events that impinge on CNS development be considered. Finally, the empirical testing of specific theories may prove to be difficult if not impossible."
1601126,1,a,"Two-thirds of a sample of 535 young women from the state of Washington who became pregnant as adolescents had been sexually abused: Fifty-five percent had been molested, 42 percent had been victims of attempted rape and 44 percent had been raped. Compared with adolescent women who became pregnant but had not been abused, sexually victimized teenagers began intercourse a year earlier, were more likely to have used drugs and alcohol and were less likely to practice contraception. The abused adolescents were also more likely to have been hit, slapped or beaten by a partner and to have exchanged sex for money, drugs or a place to stay. Young women in the abused group were also more likely to report that their own children had been abused or had been taken from them by Child Protective Services."
7639909,1,a,"The population survey is an important tool in community health assessment, including the physical and psychological aspects of family health. It provides data on health status and health determinants not available from vital statistics and health service utilization. The Keewatin Health Assessment Study (KHAS), which was designed in collaboration with the Keewatin Regional Health Board (KRHB), surveyed a representative sample of the predominantly Inuit population in 8 communities in the central Canadian Arctic. The entire survey included 874 individuals in all age groups, of whom 440 were children and adolescents under 18 years of age, and consisted of questionnaires, clinical examination and laboratory tests. Of the large number of variables on which data were collected, some were of particular relevance to the health of children and the well-being of the family, including: (1) Child growth and development; (2) Nutrition and diet; (3) Social pathologies: suicide attempts and sexual abuse; (4) Oral health; and (5) Audiologic health. In addition to providing cross-sectional data, survey participants constitute a cohort which, if followed up longitudinally, can be used to determine the incidence of specific conditions and identify risk factors which promote or prevent their occurrence. An example of such a cohort study is one on acute respiratory infection. Surveys serve many functions--providing data for planning and evaluation, promoting community awareness of health issues, and addressing basic research questions. The KHAS is one of several surveys launched over the past several years which jointly will begin to provide a circumpolar perspective on the health of Inuit people."
7987750,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the determinants of selected behavioural predispositions toward HIV prevention among injection drug users. METHOD: An exploratory factor analysis was used to group attitudinal, behavioural intention and change statements into five predisposing factors and the correlates with these were examined using general linear regression. RESULTS: The analysis demonstrates that many IDUs have responded to AIDS and highlights the characteristics of those who are predisposed to unsafe practices. Predispositions toward safer sex appear to be contextually determined, and needle-sharing determined by socio-behavioural history. CONCLUSIONS: The data emphasize the need for prevention programs in educational and correctional systems along with community-wide harm reduction and HIV prevention strategies, especially for younger persons. For older drug users, there may be a need for more intensive rehabilitation programs. Some evidence suggest that greater attention be given to the type of drug dependence when focusing programs."
17056454,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: There might be a difference between non-working and working women in their perception of rights and privileges which may influence their contraceptive behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine contraceptive behavior among non-working and working women in Bangladesh determining associated factors. METHOD: Analysis was based on data from the 1999-2000 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey which employs nationally representative sample. RESULTS: The prevalence of current contraceptive use (any method) was 58.2% among non-working women and 65.5% among working women. Both rates are still low for the country. Some factors, such as discussed family planning with husband, husband approves family planning, desire for more children, and husband lives together, were influential determinants of lower contraceptive prevalence among the non-working women. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a necessity for social activities promoting husband-wife communication and women's participation in employment to enhance the use of contraceptives among Bangladeshi women, especially non-working women."
11035460,0,a,"The paper aims to improve our understanding about the prevalence and determinants of child abuse in rural Bangladesh. Data from the 1995 sample survey of 4643 children aged 10-15 y in 150 villages were used. Findings revealed that 21% of the children were in the labour force although the Bangladeshi laws prohibited child labour. The prevalence of child abuse and exploitation was widespread in Bangladeshi villages as 2.3% of all children were physically abused, 2% were financially exploited, 1.7% were forced to involve in inappropriate activities, and 3% were forced to work for long hours. The prevalence of physical assault was much higher among younger children although the probability of other types of abuse was higher among older children. Boys were more exposed than girls to abuse of any kind. Poverty was also significantly associated with child abuse. Multivariate analysis suggested that the out-of-school children and the children of illiterate, landless and unskilled labourers were more likely to be abused than others when age and sex of children were controlled. The paper concludes that raising public awareness against child abuse and promoting preventive measures should be adopted to reduce child abuse in Bangladesh."
9589525,1,a,"The aim of this study was to assess and compare spinal cord injured (SCI) and traumatic brain injured (TBI) persons and people from the general population concerning partner relationships, functioning, mood and global quality of life. One hundred and sixty seven SCI persons, 92 TBI persons and 264 controls participated in the study. The median age was: SCI persons 33 years (range 19 to 79 years), TBI persons 40 years (range 20 to 70 years), and controls 31 years (range 19 to 79 years). Age at injury ranged among SCI persons from 14 to 76 years (Md 28 years), and among TBI persons from 16 to 56 years (Md 32 years). Half of the SCI group (51%), 58% of the TBI group and 59% of the controls had a stable partner relationship at the time of the investigation. Many of these SCI and TBI relationships (38% and 55% respectively) were established after injury. Both SCI and TBI persons showed significantly more depressive feelings compared with the controls. Perceived quality of life (global QL rating) was significantly lower in the SCI group compared with the controls, whereas the ratings of TBI persons and controls did not differ significantly. SCI and TBI persons did not differ significantly in level of education, perceived quality of life or distress. In all three groups, global quality-of-life ratings were significantly lower among single persons compared to those with a partner relationship. It was concluded that both SCI and TBI appear to affect overall quality of life and mental well-being negatively. The number of partner relationships contracted after injury among both SCI and TBI persons indicates, however, that the injury is not a major barrier to establishing close partner relationships. Being in good spirits, that is, lack of depressive feelings has a profound impact on the perception of a high quality of life in all three groups. For the SCI and TBI persons, a high level of physical and social independence were further positive determinants of a perceived high quality of life."
14531507,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To know more about the characteristics of long-term users of hypnotic and tranquillising drugs in a primary health care area in The Netherlands. DESIGN: A questionnaire was applied to users of benzodiazepines and the computerised medical records were analysed. SETTING: Nine general practices affiliated to the Registration Network Family Practices (RNH) of the University of Maastricht (UM). SUBJECTS: A sample of 506 users, aged > or = 30 years, was divided into four categories: short-term (< 3 months) users (once-only and episodic) and long-term users (episodic and continuous). RESULTS: In 1992/93, 81% were long-term users and 42% of these took their drug continuously. All groups investigated had a preponderance of women. Health problems more so than social problems led to use of the drug. Long-term use was associated with older age, depressive behaviour in handling problems, a higher score on the medicine addiction index, problems with children or housing, and satisfaction with the effects of the drug. CONCLUSION: Most people taking benzodiazepines are long-term users. Age, depressive behaviour, addiction, satisfaction and problems with children or housing are risk factors for long-term use. Gender is not risk factor."
10176379,1,a,"Several studies have noted that, besides inadequate availability of health care services in many areas, especially the less developed countries, certain disease-specific and non-disease-specific cultural beliefs may influence people's health seeking behaviour. It has even been noted that health services may be underutilized and several health and child care instructions may be ineffective or ignored in traditional and transitional societies where people's ideas and behavioural patterns conflict with the knowledge being passed to them (Feyisetan and Adeokun 1992; Feyisetan 1992). Feyisetan and Adeokun (1992) argued that non-adoption of modern preventive and curative measures cannot be attributed to poverty alone since the costs of some preventive and curative measures are not exorbitant in several of these societies. Rather, they suggested that the gap between awareness of modern health measures and health seeking behaviour must be sought in the social and cultural determinants of behaviour in such matters as child care and disease management. Earlier studies have noted that children in Nigeria die mainly from malaria, diarrhoea, measles, neonatal tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, and bronchopneumonia (Morley and MacWilliam 1961; Ogunlesi 1961; Morley, Woodland and Martin 1963, 1966; Baxter-Grillo and Leshi 1964; Animashaun 1977; Tomkins 1981). Because these diseases are preventable at low cost to the individual, there is a need to investigate why large percentages of children are still subjected to many episodes of these diseases. In this paper, we examine (1) the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the three most cited childhood diseases in our study areas, measles, diarrhoea and fever, and the effect of these perceptions on the mothers' suggested curative measures; and (2) the persistence of the belief in abiku and how this cultural belief can influence mothers' management of childhood diseases. Since, for most mothers, perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases are rooted in cultural beliefs, a brief review of disease-specific cultural beliefs is undertaken. In order to determine the effect of socio-economic factors, the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases, their recommended curative measures and the belief in abiku are examined according to selected socio-economic variables."
12321105,1,a,"""Based on the argument that values and expectations underlie behavioral motives, this study explores the determinants of migration-related values and expectations, and whether they are intervening factors in explaining intentions to move among residents of rural northeast Thailand. Data from the 1992 National Migration Survey of Thailand identify four migration-related value-expectancy dimensions: income, affiliation, stimulation, and comfort. Logistic regression analysis shows that landownership and being married are associated with higher expectations, while a diversified village economy, a village economy development program, and a younger and extended household structure are associated with lower expectations of attaining valued goals in the local rural village. The analysis also shows that value-expectancy concepts are only partial intervening explanations for intentions to move or stay."""
17320253,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: to explore the perceptions among post-delivery mothers of skin-to-skin contact and newborn baby care. DESIGN: a qualitative design using focus-group discussions. Five focus groups were conducted with post-delivery mothers who had had normal deliveries. A latent content analysis was used to derive the themes from the focus-group discussions. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: 30 post-delivery mothers were purposely sampled from 249 mothers in the postnatal ward at St Francis Hospital, Nsambya, which is located in a periurban area in Kampala, Uganda. FINDINGS: two main themes emerged from the focus-group discussions: 'acceptability of health practices are influenced by knowledge and sensitisation' and 'pregnant women's choices are dependent on social, cultural and economic factors'. Mothers expressed varying opinions about the usefulness of skin-to-skin contact: some knew about its use to reduce the risk of hypothermia; others were ignorant, whereas some believed skin-to-skin contact was an intervention used to distract them from the pain in the post-delivery period. The vernix caseosa and the mixture of amniotic fluid with blood in the post-delivery period were perceived as dirty and infectious. The best informants for helping mothers understand the skin-to-skin intervention were the health-care providers. Social, cultural and economic factors, as well as the dominant role of the husband, were identified as important determinants for their choice and place of delivery. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: the gap between the knowledge and practice of skin-to-skin contact in hospital needs to be bridged. Health-care providers need to be encouraged to continuously advocate for, educate and implement regular skin-to-skin contact."

12707496,0,a,"The evidence-based approach has become the mantra of health care and service delivery. But just what it means, whether it is feasible, how to build it and the outcome of its use are not well understood. The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of an evidence-based approach to the prevention of oral disease, to examine the assessment of clinical trial evidence, to examine emerging approaches to assessing population-wide interventions and oral health promotion, and to illustrate some principles and issues through examples from preventive dentistry. The evidence-based approach to prevention is presented using an evidence loop, which emphasizes that the evidence-base should begin with an understanding to the burden of oral disease and its determinants, rather than a consideration of the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions in clinical dental research. A systematic review of evidence from clinical dental research is compiled and assessed, after which the intervention is decided upon and implemented. The evidence loop is completed by the monitoring of outcomes and reassessment of the intervention process. Attention is also given to steps in assessing non-randomized population-wide interventions and evidence on oral health promotion based on expert opinion. The requirement for evidence creates a substantial challenge which can only be met by increased research activity, improved quality of information and the appropriate application of the outcomes of research to policy making for the prevention of oral disease."
2014409,1,a,"The determinants of self-evaluated general health status were examined in a comprehensive population study of 9408 men aged 20-61 and 9152 women aged 20-56. Reduced self-evaluated health was in both sexes closely related to symptoms and diseases connected to the musculo-skeletal system and psycho-social problems and less to age and some of the major chronic diseases. Physical activity at leisure time and workload were positively associated with self-evaluated health. Our findings indicate that an important dimension reflected by self-evaluation of health is the individual's perception of own physical performance and suffice in general. There is a striking gap between the conditions which reduce the population's subjective perceived health and our ability to offer these conditions effective treatment through the health care system. This suggests differences in health concept between the medical society and the population. The association between our applied measure and coronary risk profile, based on serum cholesterol, blood pressure and cigarette smoking, was found to be almost non-existent. This supports previous findings of self-evaluation of health as an independent predictor of survival."
14658092,0,a,"AIM: The paper is aimed at investigating what the actual topics of social-psychiatric research in German speaking countries are. METHOD: German and international journals covering psychiatry and adjacent disciplines were screened for articles dealing with social-psychiatric topics. All in all, 426 relevant articles were identified and subjected to a content analysis. RESULT: Almost one third of all articles was dealing with research on mental health services. Another research area that was strongly represented was epidemiology. By contrast, articles devoted to the study of psycho-social causes of mental disorders and psycho-social determinants of its course were rather rare. DISCUSSION: Possible reasons for the observed trends in social-psychiatric research are discussed. Potential risks for social psychiatry resulting from a too one-sided emphasis on health service research are pointed out."
9866093,1,a,"Health policy changes intended to achieve cost control in OECD countries run the risk of reintroducing financial barriers to health care. However, although the problems faced are similar, different countries are dealing with the situation in different ways. For example, Canada and Australia, which share many similarities, have taken quite different policy paths in the last decade: Canada has preserved universal access, whereas Australian policy is promoting a two-tier system through the provision of public subsidies for private insurance. The evidence is that country-specific factors such as institutional arrangements, attitudes, and values intersect with economic and financial factors to shape policy outcomes. Moreover, the Canadian and Australian experiences suggest that in relation to access issues, attitudes and values are the key policy determinants."
17682571,0,a,"This study was carried out to determine the association between body mass index and age related cataract among patients attending eye clinic. We conducted a case control study. The outcome of clinical eye assessment determined the patient's status. Mean body mass index among the cases was shown to be higher (25.4 +/- 4.5) than the control group (24.4 +/- 3.9) (p < 0.01). Crude analysis showed that only obese respondents were 2.4 times more likely to develop age related cataract, however this association was not seen in the multivariate analysis after adjusting for other determinants (aOR 1.81; 95% CI 0.91 - 3.62). We conclude that there is no association between body mass index and age related cataract."
15081204,0,a,"This new study goes beyond the well-established correlation between mortality differentials and occupational status, to focus on the impact of professional careers on mortality risk. It shows heterogeneity in the mortality risks within occupational classes, strongly related to the type of occupational moves experienced. The occupational data are taken from the French longitudinal census sample-using 1968 and 1975 census records-and mortality risks are estimated over the 1975-1980 period, for both occupational classes and pathways between classes. Results show a close relationship between occupational mobility and mortality. For men, favorable occupational moves-e.g. from clerks to upper class-put them less at risk of mortality than their counterparts who remained in their class. An inverse relationship is found for unfavorable moves. In most cases, the mortality risks of the movers are in between the risks in the class left and in the class joined. Similar patterns apply to specific groups of women only (upper classes, manual workers, clerks) for which occupational moves are probably driven, as for most men, by mortality related determinants (level of education, qualifications, health, etc.). The findings strongly support the use of a dynamic approach, based on individuals' experiences, to improve our understanding of mortality differentials."

METHODS: 1078 tenth grade high school students, 15-16 years old answered an anonymous questionnaire including, perceived concerns and risk behaviors, (e.g., smoking, alcohol, drugs, and sexual activity). Concerns were grouped into six domains. RESULTS: The most frequently reported concerns related to school, weight, coping with aggression, fatigue, war, enlistment into army, and relationships with peers. Girls had more concerns in the domains of self-image, anxiety, and relationships with peers (p < .05). Adolescents with mothers who had less education had significantly more concerns in the domains of anxiety and relationships with peers and adults (p < .05). Forty-seven percent engaged in at least one risk behavior (boys 63% and girls 34%). The Guttman scalogram indicated the following sequence of risk behaviors: alcohol, cigarettes, sex, and drugs. There were statistically significant associations between concerns and risk behaviors in the domains of anxiety, sex, and relationships with adults and peers. CONCLUSION: Many adolescent concerns are universal, although the ranking and prevalence may vary based on different regional and population characteristics (e.g., in this population a high rate of concerns relating to aggression and war were identified). The results support the need to develop prevention and health promotion programs relating to the concerns and risk behaviors in the school and community, and individual counseling programs in primary care settings."
16529597,0,a,"The older population is the single largest demographic group at disproportionate risk of inadequate diet and malnutrition. Ageing is associated with a decline in a number of physiological functions that can impact nutritional status, including reduced lean body mass and a resultant decrease in basal metabolic rate, decreased gastric secretion of digestive juices and changes in the oral cavity, sensory function deficits, changes in fluid and electrolyte regulation and chronic illness. Medication, hospitalization and other social determinants also can contribute to nutritional inadequacy. The nutritional status of older people is an important determinant of quality of life, morbidity and mortality. This review critically examines the factors that contribute to the development of poor nutritional status in older people and considers the consequences of malnutrition."
17920743,0,a,"Increased risk of tuberculosis is widely recognized to be associated with increased poverty, yet there have been few analyses of the social determinants of tuberculosis, particularly in high-burden settings. We conducted a multilevel analysis of self-reported tuberculosis disease in a nationally representative sample of South Africans based on the 1998 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Individual and household-level demographic, behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors were taken from the DHS; data on community-level socioeconomic status (including measures of absolute wealth and income inequality) were derived from the 1996 national census. Of the 13,043 DHS respondents, 0.5% reported having been diagnosed with tuberculosis disease in the past 12 months and 2.8% reported having been diagnosed with tuberculosis disease in their lifetime. In a multivariate model adjusting for demographic and behavioral risk factors, tuberculosis diagnosis was associated with cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and low body mass index, as well as a lower level of personal education, unemployment and lower household wealth. In a model including individual- and household-level risk factors, high levels of community income inequality were independently associated with increased prevalence of tuberculosis (adjusted odds ratio for lifetime tuberculosis comparing the most unequal quintile to the middle quintile of inequality: 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.59-3.53). These results provide novel insights into the socioeconomic determinants of tuberculosis in developing country settings, although the mechanisms through which income inequality may affect tuberculosis disease require further investigation."
17477777,0,a,"PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of psychosocial stressors, social support and socio-demographic variables on quality of life of breast cancer patients. TOOLS AND METHODS: The study was conducted between December 2004 and May 2005 and included 101 patients, treated in the Oncology Departments of Ege and Pamukkale University Hospitals and Denizli State Hospital. Patients' demographic data were collected by questionnaire. The methods used in the interviews were the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Psychosocial stressors were classified according to life events using the DSM-IV multi-axial diagnostic system. RESULTS: It was found that increase of cancer stage triggers a decrease in psychological quality of life (p<0,05); overall global life quality (p<0,001), perceived social support and performance status (p<0,05), all of these being negatively affected by family stressors. The patients with increased social support, better psychological and overall quality of life (p<0,01) and younger age had more physical wellness besides overall quality of life (p<0,05); lower incomes negatively affected overall global life quality (p<0,01) and working at a job decreased the psychological stressors (p<0,05). CONCLUSION: From these results, it can be postulated that psychosocial stressors, social support and some socio-demographic variables mostly affected quality of life of the breast cancer patients."
17963491,0,a,"BACKGROUND: The fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy determine the postpartum evaluation of birth. However, researchers have seldom considered the multiple determinants in one analysis. To explore to what extent the results can be generalised between countries, we analyse data of Belgian and Dutch women. Although Belgium and the Netherlands share the same language, geography and political system and have a common history, their health care systems diverge. The Belgian maternity care system corresponds to the ideal type of the medical model, whereas the Dutch system approaches the midwifery model. In this paper we examine multiple determinants, the fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy, for their association with satisfaction with childbirth in a cross-national perspective. METHODS: Two questionnaires were filled out by 605 women, one at 30 weeks of pregnancy and one within the first 2 weeks after childbirth either at home or in a hospital. Of these, 560 questionnaires were usable for analysis. Women were invited to participate in the study by independent midwives and obstetricians during antenatal visits in 2004-2005. Satisfaction with childbirth was measured by the Mackey Satisfaction with Childbirth Rating Scale, which takes into account the multidimensional nature of the concept. Labour pain was rated retrospectively using Visual Analogue Scales. Personal control was assessed with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire and Pearlin and Schooler's mastery scale. A hierarchical linear analysis was performed. RESULTS: Satisfaction with childbirth benefited most consistently from the fulfilment of expectations. In addition, the experience of personal control buffered the lowering impact of labour pain. Women with high self-efficacy showed more satisfaction with self-, midwife- and physician-related aspects of the birth experience. CONCLUSION: Our findings focus the attention toward personal control, self-efficacy and expectations about childbirth. This study confirms the multidimensionality of childbirth satisfaction and demonstrates that different factors predict the various dimensions of satisfaction. The model applies to both Belgian and Dutch women. Cross-national comparative research should further assess the dependence of the determinants of childbirth satisfaction on the organisation of maternity care."
10173402,1,a,"A population-based case control study was conducted to ascertain whether the process of primary care can be a determinant of infant mortality due to Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Cases were 118 infants who died from ARI, individually matched with 118 infants who suffered an ARI episode and recovered. Information was gathered through interviewing mothers. Study variables were assembled into five subsets: children's characteristics; mothers' characteristics; access to medical services; process of primary care, and; sociodemographic variables. An index per subset was built to analyze the independent influence of each on ARI death risk. The index was constructed upon the weighted sum of the adjusted odds ratios (OR) within each subset. Then, the values of each index were collapsed into high/low values with the 50 percentile as a cut-off value. Next, by means of a conditional logistic regression procedure, an explanatory model of ARI mortality was obtained. The final multivariate model included the indexes that showed an independent effect: I) Process of care (OR 9.68, CI 95% 3.59-26.1): inadequate referral, attention provided by more than one physician and being attended by a private physician; II) children's characteristics (OR 7.22, CI 95% 2.35-22.2): perinatal history, lack of breast-feeding and incomplete immunization scheme; III) access to medical services (OR 5.27, CI 95% 2.02-13.7): geographic and economic barriers, lack of confidence in public health services, and; IV) mothers' characteristics (OR 4.03, CI 95% 1.18-13.8), mainly represented by untimely care seeking. We conclude that the management of the disease is a key determinant in which factors relating to the mother and the health services are strongly related. Our study reveals untimely care seeking, difficult access and inadequate disease treatment as important factors which deserve careful attention in the future. We also confirm the importance of biological determinants previously described. A main strategy to reduce infant mortality due to ARI should be to encourage training of primary care physicians, including private practitioners, focused on providing effective case management and emphasizing the education to mothers."
8372490,1,a,"This study examined the influence of educational achievement and occupational position on changes in risk behavior. Study population were 3753 men and women aged 25-64 years who were sampled by the first MONICA Augsburg Survey (Monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). The subjects were sampled in 1984-85, were followed up for three years, and were reexamined in 1987-88. The baseline findings showed for both men and women a statistically significant inverse association between current cigarette smoking and educational level. During the follow-up period the differences between highest and lowest educational levels increased significantly among men. In 1987-88 only 21% of the best educated men were smokers compared to 38% of those with the lowest educational level. Men with low educational levels also drank more alcohol than better educated men, whereas among women those with lowest educational level drank less alcohol than the better educated. Statistically independent of education and age it was found that male civil servants and farmers had the lowest proportion of smokers in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses. Among women, smoking was and remained most prevalent in simple white-collar occupations. In general, the findings indicate that the type of occupation and the actual working conditions have effects on life-style related risk factors which are in part independent of a social gradient. The results also suggest that the tendency to change unhealthy behavior is less pronounced in ""high risk"" groups."
15385696,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and their partners, and the role of personality factors and social support as determinants of distress. METHODS: Of all surviving patients (n = 221) having had an ICD implanted between October 1998 and January 2003, 182 patients and 144 partners completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Type D Personality Scale, and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Type D personality defines those who tend to experience increased negative distress and who do not express these negative emotions in social interactions. Clinical variables for the patients were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients versus 42% of partners suffered from symptoms of anxiety (p =.048); symptoms of anxiety were particularly prevalent in male partners. Twenty-eight vs. 29% suffered from depressive symptoms (p =.901). In patients, Type D personality was independently related to anxiety (OR: 7.03; 95% CI: 2.32-21.32) and depressive symptoms (OR: 7.40; 95% CI: 2.49-21.94) adjusting for all other variables. Underlying cardiac disease pathology did not explain differences in patient distress. In partners, Type D personality was independently associated with increased symptoms of anxiety (OR: 8.77; 95% CI: 3.19-24.14) and depression (OR: 4.40; 95% CI: 1.76-11.01). CONCLUSION: Partners experienced similar levels of depression but higher levels of anxiety compared with ICD patients. Personality was an important explanatory factor of distress in both ICD patients and their partners. Research is now warranted to investigate the implications of this finding for the clinical course of ICD patients, as Type D personality has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease."
14765475,0,a,"This article is one of a series commissioned to mark the tenth anniversary of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, discussing past developments and future directions in areas of policy and law related to HIV/AIDS. It takes a critical look at Canada's drug policy. Despite calls for a balanced approach focused on reducing drug-related harm, Canada's method of dealing with problems of illicit drug use has remained prohibitionist in nature, and by far the greatest part of federal funding is devoted to supply-reduction initiatives. Considerable changes in policy and law are needed to significantly reduce the harms associated with injection drug use in Canada. These include developing a comprehensive and integrated strategy, exploring alternative legal frameworks, piloting innovative approaches to reducing injection-related harms, and investing in broad social policies that address the determinants of injection drug use."
8654535,1,a,"Rats housed in an enriched environment allowing both social interaction and physical activity improve more than rats housed in standard laboratory cages after focal brain ischemia. To determine the relative importance of social and physical activity, rats that sustained ligation of the middle cerebral artery were kept in an enriched environment with opportunities for various activities (group A), housed together in the same size of cage as group A but with no activity-stimulating equipment (group B), or housed in individual cages with a running wheel (group C). There was no significant difference in infarct size between the groups. Limb placement, climbing, balance on an inclined plane, and ability to traverse a beam and a rotating pole were repeatedly tested 2-13 weeks after the operation. During the entire postoperative period, group A performed significantly better than group C in all tests and better than group B on the rotating pole. With time they also performed significantly better than group B in limb placement, climbing, and on the inclined plane. Group B performed significantly better than group C on the inclined plane and in climbing at all times, and by 13 weeks also in the limb placement test and on the beam. Thus, social interaction was superior to wheel-running but an enriched environment allowing free physical activity combined with social interaction resulted in the best performance."
9780811,1,a,"The significance of a western woman's social supports to postnatal depression is well documented. We examine which deficits in components of their social support network are associated with postnatal depression in women from a non-English-speaking background. The social support network and postnatal mood of 105 Anglo-Celtic, 113 Vietnamese and 98 Arabic women were assessed at 6 weeks postpartum. The role of social supports in determining scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was analysed using multiple regressions. For Anglo-Celtic women, low postnatal mood was associated with perceived need for more emotional support from partners and mothers. For Vietnamese women, low postnatal mood was associated with poor quality of relationship with the partner and a perceived need for more practical help from him. For Arabic women, low postnatal mood was associated with perceived need for more emotional support from partners. We conclude that cultural factors mediate the relation between social supports and postnatal depression more likely to become clinically depressed (Lovestone and Kumar 1993) and infants may have adverse cognitive, behavioural and emotional outcomes, which can be linked to the postnatal depression (Murray and Cooper 1996)."
10904352,1,a,"This article deals with Occupational Health Surveillance as a health action induced by the workers' knowledge. In order to develop this conception, it adopts the notion of Health Surveillance, especially the concept of problem, and the notion of common-sense knowledge under the perspective used by social psychology. Supported by these considerations, we assume that the formulation of a health problem is a social representation. These considerations are used to examine the practice of ""workers' investigations"" as conceived by the Italian experience, pointing to its implications for the formulation of problems and identification of strategies in order to act on its determinants."
16451892,0,a,"Students' beliefs and attitudes towards the medical profession have been studied in relation to career choices, but most research has been restricted to either predetermined aspects or to a limited number of specialties. This study aimed at getting unprompted insight in the students' perceptions of their future profession in dimensions that may be determinants of study success and career choice. Undergraduate and graduated medical students were interviewed and asked to characterize the medical profession in general and four contrasting specialties in particular. Grounded Theory methodology was used to analyse the data. Participants were medical students at the start of their training (n = 16), during clerkships (n = 10) and after graduation (n = 37). Beginning students perceive the medical profession in limited dimensions: the activities of a physician, their relationship to patients and the physician's knowledge, skills and personality. They do not see many differences between specialties, in contrast with students with clinical experience and graduate students. Undergraduate students' perception is focussed more on social aspects of the profession compared to graduates."
12320037,1,a,"This study analyses an economic model of pregnancy resolution; that is, a model of the choice by a pregnant woman to abort her fetus or carry it to term. This analysis, using an analytical model derived from the household utility framework, adds to previous research by presenting race- and residence-specific estimates of how individual characteristics, history of abortion, and the community-based factors determine women's choices of giving birth vs. aborting. The main data for estimating the model were drawn from the 1984 vital statistics of all induced abortions and live births in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The major findings indicate that low parental education, high maternal age, previous early abortions, and the availability of abortion providers all significantly reduce the probability of choosing the live birth option. Married status and the availability of family planning clinics significantly increase the probability of the live birth option. The findings also suggest that women's choices between abortion and live birth vary substantially with race (White vs. Black) and residential (urban vs. rural) location."
12064266,0,a,"This article explores whether the impact of marital status on the risk of preterm birth varies in relation to marital practices in the population, defined by the proportion of out-of-marriage births. Data come from a case-control study of the determinants of preterm birth in 16 European countries (5456 cases and 8234 controls). There is a significantly elevated risk of preterm birth associated with both cohabitation (OR = 1.29 [1.08, 1.55]) and single motherhood (OR = 1.61 [1.26, 2.07]) for women living in countries where fewer than 20 of births occur outside marriage. In contrast, there is no excess risk associated with marital status when out-of-marriage births are more common. This overall result does not apply to all subgroups of preterm births: different patterns emerge for early preterm births and preterm births induced for medical reasons. It is important to consider social context in the analysis of individual risk factors."

In the article are discussed the difficulties involved in assessing the impact of such political measures, when at the same time the chances of people being able to return to work after extended sick leave are reduced owing to the recession. An evaluation model is presented which, in addition to variables related to monetary savings to the community, incorporates indicators capable of identifying gains due to a rehabilitation programme that are important determinants of the changes of target groups returning to a productive and meaningful life."
12347792,1,a,"""Hypotheses about remigration by immigrants are investigated using longitudinal data from the 1970s for immigrants to Israel. The main finding is that experience of unemployment during the first year in Israel does not, on the whole, help predict subsequent remigration. The propensity to remigrate varies inversely with age for most groups, and it increases if the immigrant has not acquired permanent housing. Immigrants on temporary resident visas are naturally more prone to remigrate in the short run. The well-educated and the young are more likely to be temporary residents."""
12521802,0,a,"This study examines the determinants of Mission House Delivery among booked patients in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. During the 12 months of the study (1 May 199930 April 2000) 196 booked patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife who delivered at mission houses were analysed. All ages and parity groups, educational level and social classes were involved. The majority (73%) were of low socio-economic class. The reasons for mission house delivery included financial constraints (41%), fear of possible caesarean section (46%), industrial action by health-care workers (39%), transport difficulty at night (26%), previous deliveries in mission houses (16%) and communal feud (12%). Four maternal deaths occurred (MMR 978/100 000 births) and 20 perinatal deaths (PNMR 118/1000 total births). Reduction of hospital user fees, provision of transportation and efficient telecommunication facilities at all times, conflict resolution and proper remuneration of health care workers are urgent needs to be addressed. Legislation against delivery in unsafe places and establishment of appropriate facilities by churches interested in maternity services is highly recommended."
19369822,0,a,"Disclosure of HIV serostatus remains an important tool for the prevention of new infections and early initiation of treatment for HIV-positive individuals' regular sexual partners. Our aim is to identify factors associated with disclosure to partner in patients taking antiretroviral treatment, with a gender- and sex-based approach. In this study conducted in Mali and Burkina Faso, men (154) and women (164) who reported being in a marital or cohabitating relationship were included. Sex-specific bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify determinants of disclosure. Disclosure to partner was 72.1% in men and 79.9% in women. Results of bivariate and multivariate analyses indicated that cohabiting with partner was strongly associated with disclosure in both men and women. In men only, older age, literacy and having good communication with the treating doctor were significantly associated with disclosure. Among women, disclosure was associated with having children and high self-reported importance of religion. Future research and interventions promoting disclosure should take into account these differences reflecting the social construction of gender roles in these settings."
8910029,1,a,"The theory of reasoned action (TRA) provides useful information when designing health education interventions. In this study, 703 heterosexual STD clinic clients responded to a TRA-based survey. With steady partners, social norms and attitudes toward condom use were significant predictors of intention for both men and women. The interaction of attitude and norm increased prediction for men (R = .64, p < 0.001) and women (R = .70, p < 0.001). With casual partners, attitude was a predictor for men and social norm was a predictor for women. Prior use of condoms increased prediction for men (R = .38, p < 0.001) and women (R = .47, p < 0.001). Findings suggest that, in addition to traditional TRA model variables, the relationship between sexual partners and the individual's prior experience with condom use should be incorporated into attempts to understand this complex, dyadic behavior. Examining specific outcome and normative beliefs also provides important information for intervention design."
7953876,1,a,"Based on the health conception viewed from the literature on nursing and by the clients, health is defined as a living experience, or as a perception of wellness in this study. That is, it is the perceived wellness that the individual obtains by wholistically integrating all dimensions of health where ever the individual stands in the health continuum. Thus health exists independently, regardless of illness or disability, because the individual is able to perceive the wellness within limitations imposed to him/her. Also, based on the health conception defined in this study and the literature review on health promotion, health promotion is defined as the process of enhancing the perception of wellness (i.e., living experience), where ever the individual stands in the health continuum. Therefore, health promotive care represents the process of making client help himself to improve health experience/perception of wellness by selecting and/or integrating the individual or social health parameters (determinants) based on his reality. After analyzing the data which is provided from the related literature and the results from the descriptive/exploratory research on this group of clients, and then applying those analysis results to the PRECEDE model, planning process for health promotion program is established. However, as planning process is only based on data from literature in the first stage, it will be modified appropriately according to the assessment feedback from the direct participation of client in the following study. Based on the planning model refined through this assessment process, health promotion program is to be developed, implemented and evaluated. Planning process of health promotion for clients with arthritis is begun from the assessment of health outcome as the first phase. It is analyzed from this study that clients with arthritis indicates lower quality of life/satisfaction than the other groups from the several research findings indicate. In the second phase, according to the analysis results in the first phase, clients' health problems (perceived seriousness about illness, uncertainty in illness, helplessness, difficulty of movement), which affect the low quality of life, are identified and then program objective for each problem is demonstrated. As an objective for the perceived seriousness about illness, relief of the mistrust on the general effects of treatment for illness is determined through appropriate data analysis. And clients' accumulation of accurate knowledge on the nature of illness is determined as an objective, for reducing uncertainty in the illness. Also enhancement of distraction ability and self-efficacy perception is defined as objectives for reducing physical, psychological and social helplessness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
11493044,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Low-energy fractures among the elderly may be prevented by measures aimed at reducing the risk of falling or increasing the strength of the skeleton. Acceptance of these interventions in the target population is necessary for their success. METHODS: The total elderly population in a Danish municipality 7,543 community-dwelling persons aged 66+ years, were offered participation in one of three intervention programs: 2,550 persons were offered a home safety inspection, evaluation of prescribed medicine, and identification of possible health and food problems (Program I); 2,445 persons were offered 1000 mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU (10 microg) of vitamin D(3) per day in combination with evaluation of prescribed medicine (Program II); and 2,548 persons were offered a combination of the two programs (Program III). Acceptance was defined as willingness to receive an introductory visit by a nurse. RESULTS: Acceptance of Program I was 50%; of Program II, 56% (P < 0.00005 as contrasted with Program I); and of Program III, 46% (P < 0.005). Acceptance was associated with gender (females, 53%; males, 47%) and did not change from ages 66 to 84 but decreased significantly after the age of 85. Widows aged 66-84 had the highest acceptance (57%) and never married males aged 66-84 the lowest (30%). An important determinant, however, was the individual social service center that communicated the specific program. Acceptance varied from 39 to 66% between the social centers. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of a fall and fracture prevention program varies with intervention type; with gender, age, and social status of the target population; and with the motivation and attitude of the health workers involved in the implementation of the program."
17347035,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In complying with required life style changes Heart Failure (HF) patients often depend on their partners. However providing care may cause burden and affect the health of these partners. The aim of this study was to investigate determinants of caregiver burden in order to identify caregivers who are at risk. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, caregiver burden and potential determinants were measured in partners of HF patients. Demographic and clinical data were assessed in HF patients, partners completed questionnaires on caregiver burden (the Caregiver Reaction Assessment, CRA), caregiving tasks performed, physical and mental health status and quality of the marital relationship. RESULTS: In total 357 partners (75% female, mean age 67 years) participated. The physical health status of HF patients was only significantly associated with two domains of caregiver burden, 'disruption of daily schedule' (p<0.01) and 'loss of physical strength' (p<0.01). No associations were found with age, co-morbidity and LVEF. All domains of the CRA were mainly associated with the partner's own mental health (p<0.01) and with providing personal care to HF patients (p<0.01). Gender differences were only found with regard to the domain of 'feeling a lack of family support'. CONCLUSION: The assessment of caregiver burden should focus on the mental strength of partners. Furthermore when assistance in personal care is needed, additional support, either informal or professional, may be indicated."
2088762,1,a,"We are prospectively examining the relation between environmental lead exposure and pregnancy outcome in cohorts of women exposed to a wide range of air lead concentrations. Titova Mitrovica, Yugoslavia, is the site of a large lead smelter, refinery, and battery factory. At midpregnancy, 602 women in T. Mitrovica and 900 women in Pristina, a non-lead-exposed control town, were interviewed. Blood was obtained for blood lead (PbB), hemoglobin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin measurements. Women were seen again at delivery, at which time maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were obtained. While many demographic and social characteristics were similar across the two towns, women in Pristina were more likely to report employment outside the home, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use during pregnancy. As expected, PbB levels were substantially higher in the smelter town. At midpregnancy, PbB geometric means were 17.1 micrograms/dL in T. Mitrovica and 5.1 micrograms/dL in Pristina; 86% of the pregnant women in T. Mitrovica, compared to 3.4% of those in Pristina, had PbB levels greater than 10 micrograms/dL. Within T. Mitrovica, distance between the home and the smelter was the most important predictor of PbB at mid-pregnancy and delivery. Husband's employment in the lead industry was associated with a significant increase in maternal PbB levels independent of place of residence. Higher maternal serum ferritin concentrations were associated with lower PbB levels, suggesting that dietary iron inhibits lead absorption. Overall, the placenta was a poor barrier to lead; the relationship between maternal PbB and umbilical cord PbB was linear across a wide range of PbB levels."

8404749,1,a,"In an incidence cohort, remission and relapse rates and determinants were studied in 178 patients followed long-term. A comparative study of predictive factors was performed in 40 patients with histories of antiepileptic (AED)-drug-refractory epileptic seizures in the last 10 years of follow-up and compared with the other 138 cohort subjects. The two groups were cross-tabulated with 353 variables of family history, obstetric, developmental and seizure histories, and current medical and social status. Multivariate analyses were applied for control of confounding. Defined or probable remote symptomatic etiology of seizures, abnormal neurologic development/status, high initial seizure frequency, occurrence of status epilepticus, and poor short-term effects of AED therapy were significantly associated with long-term AED refractoriness. On logistic regression analyses, poor short-term outcome of AED therapy [odds ratio (OR) 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-10.4], occurrence of status epilepticus (OR 11.4; 95% CI 3.2-41.0), high initial seizure frequency (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.1-19.3), and remote symptomatic seizure etiology (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.1-8.2) remained the only independent predictors of seizure intractability.

19789061,0,a,"While global prevalence of obesity continues to increase dramatically, treatment options remain less than optimal. The etiology of obesity is multifactorial, ranging from lifestyle choices such as excess food intake and insufficient physical activity, to use of medications that have weight gain as an undesirable side effect. Economic and political determinants of available foodstuffs and even social networks may also contribute to obesity. Successful management of obesity requires the understanding and acceptance of a new paradigm that identifies obesity as a disease--one defined by waist circumference--that requires treatment. Obesity meets all accepted criteria of a medical disease, including a known etiology, recognized signs and symptoms, and a range of structural and functional changes that culminate in pathologic consequences. Excess adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ to produce excess free fatty acids, as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, leptin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. These bioactive molecules are associated with hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, development of diabetes, endothelial damage, and the onset and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Options for treating obesity include lifestyle modifications (dietary changes, increased physical activity, behavior modification) and, for the morbidly obese, surgery. Lifestyle modification is rarely successful over the long term; therefore, addition of pharmacotherapy should be considered for obese individuals who have difficulty achieving and maintaining weight goals with lifestyle modifications alone. Several weight loss drugs are available for long-term use, with others in various stages of clinical development."
12287675,1,a,"""This article aims to analyze the factors which led to the transition in international migration in [the Republic of] Korea. Three issues are explored. First, it is argued that Korea has passed the turning point since Korea needs to accept foreign labor for unskilled jobs for some sectors of the economy. Second, we analyze factors which led Korea to reach this turning point in international migration in the context of demographic change and industrial upgrading. Third, Korea's overseas employment as well as its policy of guestworkers are also discussed in the context of the country's structural adjustment. Then, policy options concerning foreign labor import are suggested."""
2209182,1,a,"A total of 407 males and females in 4 different age groups (M age = 8.0, 10.8, 15.2, and 20.3 years) completed questionnaires requiring self-ratings of 5 emotions (angry, happy, sad, fearful, and loving), on a 5-point scale, for 10 affect-laden sentences. Each of the 5 emotions was targeted as a key emotion by 2 sentences. The resulting patterns indicate that children as young as 8 can discriminate between affect-eliciting statements, differentially rate up to 5 concurrent emotional responses, and predict response patterns similar to those predicted by adults. Furthermore, sex differences occur during adolescence whereby males predict more varied but less intense secondary emotions, whereas females predict fewer but more intense secondary emotions."
19357732,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for placenta praevia presenting with severe vaginal bleeding in Mulago hospital, Kampala, Uganda. DESIGN: A case control study. SETTING: Mulago hospital labour suite PARTICIPANTS: Between 15th November 2001 and 30th November 2002 we identified and recruited thirty six parturients with placenta previa who developed severe bleeding and 180 women with normal delivery. The risk factors were studied. VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Socio demographic characteristics, social and family history, gynaecological operations, blood transfusion, medical conditions, past and present obstetric performance and HIV status. RESULTS: Significant predictors for severe bleeding in parturients with placenta praevia were: previous history of evacuation of the uterus or dilation and curettage (O.R. 3.6, CI: 1.1-12.5), delivery by caesarean section in previous pregnancy (O.R. 19.9, CI: 6.4-61.7), residing more than ten kilometres from Mulago hospital (O.R. 2.4, CI: 1.0-5.7) and recurrent vaginal bleeding during the current pregnancy (O.R. 7.3, CI 2.4-63.7). CONCLUSION: Severe bleeding in placenta praevia is associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality. The determinants of severe bleeding in placenta praevia can be used in the antenatal period to identify mothers at risk. These, with prompt interventions to deliver the women can be used to reduce the maternal morbidity associated with this condition."
16277821,0,a,"This paper discusses possible consequences of energy excess throughout the life cycle. Firstly we consider the effects of foods on hunger, satiety and satiation. Also, the changes in food availability and consumption in relation to changes in social and economic determinants of energy excess. The relationship between physical activity and energy intake (EI) is also considered. Secondly we explore the definition of energy excess and the metabolic effects of macronutrients (mainly in relation to fuel partitioning oxidation/storage) on energy balance. The cellular and molecular regulation determined by specific genes involved in lipogenesis, fuel partitioning and/or in energy dissipation are explored. Thirdly, we examine the main consequences induced by energy excess and positive energy balance, starting with the alterations in glucose utilisation (insulin resistance) leading to type 2 diabetes and the linkage of energy excess with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Biological, social and psychological consequences during perinatal, childhood and adolescence periods are specifically analysed. Fourthly, the transition from energy deficit to excess, under the optic of a developing country is analysed with country examples drawn from Latin America. The possible role of supplementary food programmes in determining positive energy balance is discussed especially in relation to pre-school and school feeding programmes. Fifthly, we deal with the economic costs of energy excess and obesity related diseases. Finally, some areas where further research is needed are described; biological and genetic determinants of individual and population energy requirements, foods and food preparations as actually consumed, consumer education and research needs on social determinants of energy imbalances."
11426265,0,a,"Factors related to the characteristics of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina are described. Factors from different scientific fields converge to form the syndrome's analytical framework. Some of these factors are the history of spatial occupation, work and production structures, human migration patterns, ethnic composition, reservoir dynamics and its relationship to the different circulating viruses, and human behavior. Furthermore, the multiple factors are expressed in three ecological frameworks, associated with three different geographical regions of Argentina: 1) Northwest; 2) Central (""wet Pampa""); and 3) South Andean. In order to understand the actual causality of health or disease as an interaction of many factors, research on the primary biological, social, and environmental determinants of diseases should attend to the complexity of variable relationships in each region. The multiple-factor convergence approach allows for the design of appropriate strategies to improve the population's health status. Therefore, strategies should be developed and transferred by multidisciplinary teams, while their sustainability should be assured by community participation beginning with the earliest steps of research onward."
8045133,1,a,"A study of the acceptability of two once-a-month injectable contraceptives, Cyclofem and Mesigyna, in Egypt included 1091 women participating in the clinical trial of the two methods carried out during the period from November 1989 to July 1992. The acceptability of the two contraceptives proved to be high when measured by the rate of continuation at 12 months of injectable use, by method satisfaction, service satisfaction, rec recommending use to others, intent of future use, as well as willingness to pay for them when the injectables are marketed. The most important determinants of use discontinuation were young age, large family size, first time contraceptive use, previous experience with menstrual problems, dissatisfaction with clinic services, lack of counseling, lack of social support, as well as the husband's negative attitude towards contraceptive use. Side effects were more frequently reported by discontinuers; however, continuers appeared to be more tolerant of the same side effects. This study provided in-depth information about the social aspects affecting the acceptability of monthly injectable contraceptives in the different Egyptian localities, in addition to its being useful in monitoring activities in the clinical setting during these trials."
19635735,0,a,"Few prospective studies of smoking initiation have investigated a wide range of time-varying and invariant predictor variables at the individual and contextual levels concurrently. In this study (1999-2005), 877 Canadian students (mean age = 12.7 years) who had never smoked at baseline completed self-report questionnaires on cigarette smoking and 32 predictor variables in 20 survey cycles during secondary school. Height and weight were measured in survey cycles 1, 12, and 19. School administrators completed questionnaires on school tobacco control policies/activities, and trained observers collected data on access to tobacco products in commercial establishments near schools. Younger age, single-parent family status, smoking by parents, siblings, friends, and school staff, stress, impulsivity, lower self-esteem, feeling a need to smoke, not doing well at school, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, alcohol use, use of other tobacco products, and attending a smoking-tolerant school were independent determinants of smoking initiation. Independent determinants of daily smoking onset among initiators of nondaily smoking included smoking by siblings and friends, feeling a need to smoke, susceptibility to tobacco advertising, use of other tobacco products, and self-perceived mental and physical addiction. Adolescent tobacco control programs should address multiple individual and contextual-level risk factors. Strategies that address nicotine dependence symptoms are also needed for adolescents who have already initiated smoking."
17159594,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate, patterns and predictors of HIV disclosure in the French Antilles and French Guiana. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a 15% random sample (n=398) of the hospital caseload in hospitals providing HIV care. Determinants of disclosure to a steady partner and other members of the individual's social network were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: From the time of diagnosis, 84.6% of those in a couple (n=173) disclosed their HIV-positive status to their steady partner, 55.6% disclosed to others, and 30.3% did not tell their status to anyone. Disclosure within a steady partnership was less likely among non-French individuals [Haitians: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.72; other nationalities: AOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.68]; and among those diagnosed with HIV after 1997 (AOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.86). Determinants of disclosure to others were found to be sex (women: AOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.24-3.36), age at diagnosis (>or=50 versus<30 years: AOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90), nationality (Haitians versus French: AOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.77), transmission route (non-sexual versus sexual: AOR 3.38, 95% CI 1.12-10.23) and hospital inpatients (hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients: AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.17-3.37). After disclosing, social and emotional support from confidants was common and discrimination was infrequent. CONCLUSION: One third of PLWHA had kept their HIV status secret. Interventions targeting the general population and social institutions, and support for PLWHA by healthcare staff are needed to improve the situation."
1795152,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the patterns of black-white differences in stroke mortality across communities with varying levels of occupational structure in the southern region of the United States DESIGN: Annual age adjusted race-sex specific rates for stroke mortality were calculated for the years 1979-1981 and related to socioeconomic conditions. SETTING: The study involved 211 state economic areas comprising the southern region of the USA. STUDY POPULATION: Data on stroke mortality for black and white men and women between the ages of 35 and 74 years living in the study area were acquired from the National Center for Health Statistics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Occupational structure was measured as the proportion of white collar workers in each state economic area, and is an indicator of the employment opportunities and related social and economic resources of a community. Stratified analyses and linear regression modelling indicate that communities of lower occupational structure have (a) higher levels of stroke mortality for all four race-sex groups (p less than 0.05) and (b) larger racial inequalities in stroke mortality (p less than 0.01). For men and women, the excess stroke mortality among blacks compared to whites is larger in communities of lower occupational structure. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of occupational structure and related patterns of economic development is crucial for understanding the distribution of stroke mortality within and between racial groups, as well as for planning effective public health interventions. The larger racial inequalities in communities of lower occupational structure in the south suggest that aspects of the black experience which are conducive to high rates of stroke mortality are exacerbated in those communities. Public health interventions to reduce the racial and social inequalities in stroke mortality should recognise the social context within which nutritional, occupational, medical care, and environmental determinants of stroke are distributed."
11264431,0,a,"The compelling evidence linking small size at birth with later cardiovascular disease has renewed and amplified a clinical and scientific interest in the determinants of fetal growth. Although the effects of maternal nutrition on fetal growth have been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about the effects of maternofetal hypoxia. This study tested the hypothesis that in highland regions, high altitude rather than maternal economic status is associated with reduced and altered fetal growth by investigating the effects of high altitude versus economic status on birth weight and body shape at birth in Bolivia. Bolivia is geographically and socioeconomically unique. It contains several highland (>3500 m above sea level) and lowland (<500 m) cities that are inhabited by very economically divergent populations. Birth weight, body length, and head circumference were compared between a high- (n = 100) and low- (n = 100) income region of La Paz (3649 m; largest high-altitude city) and a high- (n = 100) and low- (n = 100) income region of Santa Cruz (437 m; largest low-altitude city). In addition, the frequency distribution across the continuum of birth weights was plotted for babies born from high- and low-income families in La Paz and Santa Cruz. Mean birth weights were lower in babies from La Paz than in babies from Santa Cruz in both high- and low-income groups. The cumulative frequency curve across all compiled birth weights was shifted to the left in babies from La Paz compared with those from Santa Cruz, regardless of economic status. The frequency of low birth weight (<2500 g) was higher in babies from La Paz than from Santa Cruz in both high- and low-income groups. In addition, at high altitude but not at low altitude, high income was associated with an increase in the head circumference:birth weight ratio. These findings suggest that high altitude rather than economic status is associated with low birth weight and altered body shape at birth in babies from Bolivia."
17020784,0,a,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in identifying and managing patients with suicidal tendencies. Few studies, however, examine both GP and patient characteristics and GP practices associated with suicide assessment. This article aims to evaluate 1) GPs' success in early identification of suicidal ideation (SI) in patients starting antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment, and 2) patient- and GP-related factors associated with this success. METHODS: Survey of 144 GPs practising in southeastern France and of consecutive adults consulting them during June-October 2004 and prescribed antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment. Data were collected from GPs (consultation-questionnaires focusing on their prescription, diagnosis and detection of SI) and patients (self-administered questionnaires including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and social and demographic characteristics). We used multilevel logistic regression to analyse factors associated with SI detection. RESULTS: GPs completed consultation-questionnaires for 713 patients, 405 of whom completed self-administered questionnaires. Eighty-nine patients (22%) reported SI; in 43 cases (48%) SI had not been detected by the GP. GPs detected SI more frequently when they had completed continuing medical education about depression, when patients had higher depressive symptom scores, and when consultations were relatively long. LIMITATIONS: Study limited to patients receiving initial prescriptions for antidepressants or anxiolytics. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of undetected SI in this study population was high. Additional training of GPs increases the chances of detecting SI. Medical training and continuing medical education should include better instruction about SI risk factors and diagnosis, including non-major depressions, and stress that screening requires sufficient consultation time."
10419794,1,a,"OBJECTIVE: The rate and determinants of tobacco prevention and cessation counseling to youth were examined for orthodontists participating in a controlled trial to decrease the incidence of tobacco use among adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional interview design in private practice offices throughout Southern California was used. The survey was completed with 126 (82%) orthodontists. Clinicians randomly assigned to the experimental group (N = 77) received a 1.5 h workshop, anti-tobacco materials, reimbursement for provision of anti-tobacco prescriptions, and quarterly checkup visits. Control group clinicians (N = 77) did not receive training, materials, or visits. RESULTS: Experimental group clinicians talked to more adolescent nonsmokers about never beginning tobacco use than did control group clinicians (P < 0.05). Experimental group clinicians talked to more adolescent tobacco users than did control group clinicians; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Content and determinants of counseling were affected by participation in the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Though training and support increased prevention and cessation counseling, absolute rates remained less than optimal. Social learning factors were associated with prevention and cessation counseling."
14761816,0,a,"Culture determines the different ways that patients understand cancer, the ways they explain it, and their attitudes towards it. These factors affect the patient's emotional response to the disease and health behaviour in terms of prevention and treatment. In this paper we review the explanatory models for cancer in several cultural groups. These models range from metaphysical to interpersonal and physical. Cultural explanations of health and health behaviour could detract from social and economic factors that might be more important as determinants of these behaviours."
1468852,1,a,"The deaths of children aged 1-4 years were studied in a cohort of 5914 Brazilian liveborns. A total of 29 early childhood deaths were recorded (cumulative mortality risk of approximately 6 per 1000), 17 of which (59%) were due to infectious diseases. The death rate was highest in the second year. Deaths were highly concentrated in children from low income (< US $50/month) families, where the cumulative risk of early childhood death was about 10 per 1000; on the other hand, there were no deaths among the 616 children from families with a monthly income of US $300 or more. Birthweight was also associated with mortality: the cumulative risk of children weighing less than 2000 g at birth was 21 per 1000, compared to 4 per 1000 among those with birthweights of 3500 g or more. Simultaneous adjustment for income and birthweight did not substantially change these differentials. These findings confirm the strong association between early childhood mortality and socioeconomic conditions, but also make evident the long-term effects of low birthweight."
16273992,0,a,"Most studies investigating correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver burden have focused on the role of objective factors as opposed to subjective factors. Although objective variables (e.g., caregiver age, patient dementia severity, functional status) have been shown to be significantly associated with burden, the correlations generally are modest and explain relatively little of the variability in caregiver outcomes. Moreover, many of these objective variables are not modifiable and are of limited use in the development of caregiver interventions. Thus, there continues to be a need to identify powerful and modifiable determinants of caregiver burden. This study examined the role of two subjective factors-self-efficacy and depressive symptoms-as predictors of AD caregiver burden. Based on a sample of 80 AD caregivers, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy and depressive symptoms each had a significant independent effect on the experience of burden even after accounting for objective factors. These findings suggest that caregiver interventions aimed to reduce burden may benefit from the incorporation of specific strategies to increase self-efficacy and decrease depressive symptoms."
17128623,0,a,"AIMS: To describe the epidemiology of Suicide in Tuscany according to the triad of time, place and person. METHODS: The 4,764 cases of suicide, defined according to categories E950-E959 of ICD-9 in Tuscany over the period 1988-2002, were obtained from the Tuscan Mortality Register. Mortality indicators were calculated and analyzed. The spatial analysis was carried out by deriving Empirical Bayes Estimates for the 287 municipalities. RESULTS: The crude mortality rate in the 2000-2002 is 7.8 per 100000 population (male: 12.4; female: 3.5). The age-standardized rate in the 2000-2002 is 5.8 per 100,000 population (male: 9.6; female: 2.6). The highest risk for suicide, especially in the case of males, are concentrated in the southern hinterland Tuscany, in a cluster of rural municipalities that represent the old mining district of Tuscany. The SMRs according to residential municipality (population per square kilometre), confirm a greater risk of suicide for males residing in rural communities. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster of excessive mortality from suicide in Southern Tuscany could be the consequence of social determinants, related to the urban and social crisis following agriculture decline and mine closure."
9603277,1,a,"In a sample of 88 drug-using Mexican-American arrestees, we examined demographic factors, drug-problem severity indicators, and personal and social resources as correlates of self-reported desire for help with problems related to drug use. Ethnicity-related attitudes, perceptions, and experiences were among the factors tested. Among 35 potential correlates in this dataset, recognition of drug-related interpersonal problems was the sole significant correlate of desire for help in a multivariate regression analysis. This finding was interpreted in comparison to previously identified correlates of Mexican-American drug users' desire for help specifically in the form of drug user treatment. We derive implications regarding drug-use-associated problem recognition and other potential determinants of help-seeking and success in drug user treatment among Mexican-American drug users."
17876483,0,a,"More than any other low- and middle-income country, Brazil has the longest research tradition of establishing, maintaining and exploiting birth cohort studies. This research pedigree is highlighted in the present issue of the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, which contains a series of twelve papers from the Ribeirao Preto and Sao Luis birth cohort studies from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, respectively. The topics covered in this raft of reports vary and include predictors of perinatal health and maternal risk factors, early life determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in childhood and adolescence, use of health services, and a description of dietary characteristics of young adults, amongst other topics. There is also a guide to the background, objectives, sampling and protocols employed across these studies, which, together with similar pieces published in past issues of the Brazilian Journal, serve as a very useful starting point, particularly for potential collaborators. In the fervent hope that further follow-up of these cohorts will take place--we provide our own justification for cohort maintenance and extension in this issue--future data collection could include: genetic material, atherosclerosis, ascertained, for instance, by intima-media thickness, and IQ testing in children--scores from which are emerging as potentially important predictors of adult health outcomes up to six decades later."
10116946,1,a,"Critical review of the health and social service use literature reveals a need to elaborate on the dynamics of factors identified in the behavioral models applied to this field. In particular, research has tended to omit direct measures of attitudes and awareness of social services, including their interrelationships. This study examines determinants of knowledge, use, and future use of local home support agencies among a sample of community-dwelling elderly over the age of 74 living in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. Measures of domestic self-reliance, independent living and perceptions of futurity are incorporated into the analysis. Logistic regression is used to test the models. The results show that attitudes regarding domestic self-reliance and independent living influence use of home support agencies largely through their impact on service awareness. Interestingly, these relationships are opposite to those hypothesized. Education is also found to be a predictor of knowledge of home support, and living arrangement, health status measures, and knowledge arise as important predictors of use and future use. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the underlying behavioral models, and for service providers and policymakers."
17955705,0,a,"This paper analyses the determinants of self-reported health in Ireland, conditioning self-reported health on a set of socio-economic, labour market and social capital variables. Ireland has the highest self-reported health rate in Europe, a finding backed-up by other studies. Data were derived from the 2002 and 2005 European Social survey. The full 87,915 observations from both rounds were pooled and used to estimate mean self-rated health across Europe. The Irish data were isolated, totalling 2,049 individuals for 2002 and 2,286 individuals for 2005. The 2002 data were used to analyse the determinants of subjective health state, as it had a richer array of social capital variables. The results demonstrate statistically significant effects of income on self-reported health that are robust to different statistical specifications and statistically significant though modest effects of social capital variables such as associational membership and frequency of social meeting and labour market variables such as being on a limited as opposed to permanent contract."
19286838,0,a,"BACKGROUND: We used case-control design to compare utilization of health and social services between older decedents and survivors, and to identify the respective impact of age and closeness of death on the utilization of services. METHODS: Data were derived from multiple national registers. The sample consisted of 56,001 persons, who died during years 1998-2000 at the age of > or = 70, and their pairs matched on age, gender and municipality of residence, who were alive at least 2 years after their counterpart's death. Data include use of hospitals, long-term care and home care. Decedents' utilization within 2 years before death and survivors' utilization in the same period of time was assessed in three age groups (70-79, 80-89 and > or = 90 years) and by gender. RESULTS: Decedents used hospital and long-term care more than their surviving counterparts, but the time patterns were different. In hospital care the differences between decedents and survivors rose in the last months of the study period, whereas in long-term care there were clear differences during the whole 2-year period. The differences were smaller in the oldest age group than in younger age groups. CONCLUSION: Closeness of death is an important predictor of health and social service use in old age, but its influence varies between age groups. Not only the changing age structure, but also the higher average age at death affects the future need for services."
12660214,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This article describes Canadian civil servants' awareness of, attitudes toward, and self-reported use of ideas about the determinants of health. METHODS: Federal and provincial civil servants in departments of finance, labor, social services, and health were surveyed. RESULTS: With civil servants in finance departments a notable exception, most Canadian civil servants see the health of populations as a relevant outcome for their sectors. Many (65%) report that ideas about the determinants of health have already influenced policymaking in their sector, but most (83%) say they need more information about the health consequences of the policy alternatives their departments face. CONCLUSIONS: Civil servants should consider developing accountability structures for health and researchers should consider producing and transferring more policy-relevant research."
10190343,1,a,"We examined differences between school classes with respect to three aspects of psychosocial adjustment at school, namely the extent that children in the class liked to play with each other, the number of teacher-reported behaviour problems, and children's feelings of wellbeing at school. The sample consisted of 1282 4- to 5-year-olds from 94 school classes and 51 schools, but due to nonresponse actual sample sizes were somewhat smaller for most analyses. Multilevel analyses showed that on average 87% of the variance was at the child level, 11% at the class level, and 3% at the school level. This indicated that a non-negligible amount of variance could not be accounted for by factors at the child level. Furthermore, this variance was mainly associated with differences between classes instead of differences between schools. A set of variables that pertained to sociodemographic characteristics of schools, school facilities, organisational aspects of classrooms, and the teacher did not provide an adequate explanation for the differences in adjustment levels. In contrast to these traditional variables, social network indices yielded substantial correlations, showed consistent trends across the different adjustment measures, and fulfilled the necessary requirement that to explain differences between school classes the predictor variables themselves should differ for classes within the same school. These results suggested that aspects of the interpersonal relations of children in the classroom such as proximity, integration, and the amount of contact could be determinants of differences between school classes in psychosocial adjustment."

9578991,1,a,"Normal brain development requires the precise interactions of environmental signals with genes that drive cellular differentiation and circuit formation. Experimental studies in animal models reveal that early environmental influences in utero can modulate cell fate choice and neuronal growth. Modification of the determinants can have long-lasting consequences. Studies using transplant and cell culture methods have examined the development of the limbic system, regions of the brain that mediate cognition, emotion, memory, and learning. The results show that growth factors in the environment of progenitor cells control long-term gene expression that characterizes neurons in limbic brain regions. Other studies in which the cellular environment is altered by prenatal cocaine exposure result in modified fetal neurotransmitter function and specific pharmacological and structural alterations in the cerebral cortex that lead to abnormal behavior. The cellular milieu of the developing central nervous system prenatally thus serves functions as critical as environmental stimuli postnatally that promote synaptic development and refinement."
17263036,0,a,"Some categories of immigrants run an increased risk of suffering from schizophrenia Such vulnerability might be determined by virus infections, diabetes mellitus and obesity during pregnancy, racism, socio-economic disadvantage, a lack of social support/network, stressful events and alienating environments, culture shock (as in the cases of immigrants and refugees), technological dominance, lack of coping skills (wrong coping strategies), social-emotional adjustment and acculturation problems. The governments and mental health services of our civilized countries should prepare prevention and intervention programs that are geared to deal with the correlates and causes of schizophrenia in immigrants."
9110831,1,a,"This research has been carried out in order to evaluate cues to action in health behavior. Which cues produce changes and how does the process of change proceed? In-depth qualitative interviews based on the Grounded Theory Method were made with 21 40-year-old men. Ten men were interviewed three times during a 1-year period to trace the process of change. In total 40 interviews were carried out during 1989-1990. All the interviewees were randomly selected from the population registers in the municipalities of Aarhus and Vejle. The main themes of the interviews are changes in previous health behavior, motivation for intentions to change in health behavior, and the role of health education in the process of change. Health behavior determinants seem to be knowledge, attitude, confidence, social influence, experiences and possibilities for change. Individuals typically exhibit a wide range of these determinants which makes it difficult to affect behavioral change through health education. Cues to action seem to arise from social influence, experiences, or underlying shifts in the possibilities of change. Experiences and social influence due to the health behavior in question seem to initiate changes in confidence, attitude and thereby motivation to change. Cues to action arising from these determinants are categorized as own illness or illness among friends and relatives, changes in self-perception, exceeded limits determined by the behavior in question, and social pressure. Shifts in the possibilities for change, such as change of partner or other life events, produce changes also affecting health behavior. A strategy to initiate changes in health behavior could be to create cues to action through personal experiences in the context of a specific health behavior or to establish contact to people when they are experiencing new life circumstances."

1943097,1,a,"Genetic models were fitted to self-report data on frequency of alcohol consumption and average quantity consumed when drinking, from 3,810 adult Australian twin pairs. Frequency of consumption is determined both by an abstinence dimension, which is strongly influenced by shared environmental effects but not by genetic effects, and by an independent frequency dimension, which is influenced by genetic effects in both sexes and possibly by shared environmental affects in men. Quantity of alcohol consumed is likewise determined by an environmental abstinence dimension and by an independent and partly heritable quantity dimension. The best-fitting model allowed for two routes to abstinence: those who were not abstainers by virtue of their position on the abstinence dimension could nonetheless become abstainers by their position on the second, frequency (or quantity) dimension. Heritability estimates were 66% in women and 42-75% in men, for frequency; and 57% in women and 24-61% in men, for quantity."
11888046,0,a,"The present study analyzed what determinants are important to describe and explain the intention of testicular self-examination (TSE) for young men aged 15-19 attending senior high school (response rate 80%, n = 274). The questionnaire assessed determinants, including knowledge, attitude (positive and negative consequences, anticipated regret, and moral obligation), social influence (social norm, social support and modeling) and self-efficacy. Knowledge of testicular cancer and TSE was very low. Only 2% of the subjects reported regularly performing TSE. After hearing of TSE (through the questionnaire), 41% of all young men had a positive intention to start performing TSE regularly. The various intention groups (positive, neutral and negative) differed significantly on almost all of the determinants. Multiple regression analysis showed that young men who where anxious about TSE and those who were not anxious had different determinants explaining the variance in the intention to perform TSE regularly (R2 = 41-57%). Differences in determinants of intention between young men who are anxious about TSE and young men who are not can be used to design health education interventions that may therefore be more effective for these different subgroups."
8668745,1,a,"Although virtually all major theories of health-protective behavior assume that precautionary behavior is related to perceived vulnerability, the applicability of this assumption to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preventive behavior has recently been called into question. This article uses qualitative and quantitative methods to review and integrate the literature relevant to the relation between perceived vulnerability to HIV and precautionary sexual behavior. Specifically, the purpose of the article is to determine whether the extent research supports 2 hypotheses regarding this relation; (a) Perceptions of personal vulnerability to HIV are reflections of current and recent risk and precautionary behavior, and (b) these perceptions motivate precautionary sexual behavior. In addition, it examines the conceptual and methodological strengths and weaknesses of the empirical literature on these questions and provides recommendations for future research."
7833551,1,a,"The epidemic of HIV infection and disease in women, adolescents and children represents a complexly intertwined biological and social challenge to health care workers and researchers alike. When considering various issues in confronting this epidemic, women must be viewed as individuals important in their own right, as the primary caretaker of their family members (both infected and uninfected), and as the sexual partners of men who may or may not be infected. Of the myriad of compelling biological questions facing AIDS researchers today, two of the most interesting involve the timing and determinants of vertical transmission and the natural history of HIV infection and disease in women. Scientifically, confronting this epidemic involves research into pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection. Primary emphasis in the research arena in HIV/AIDS in the United States is focused on therapeutic and prophylactic research. Other research issues are very important, including studies of early diagnostic techniques, behavioral research concerning reproductive choices, the role of breastfeeding in HIV transmission, HIV-specific adolescent issues, and surrogate markers of disease progression."
15113642,0,a,"Informal care is an indispensable element in the care for many patients. In order to maintain a sustainable input of informal care, it seems important to identify measures to alleviate the burden of care giving for caregivers at risk of burn out or other serious health problems, such as support and respite care. Thus, far research has focused on the burden of caregiving and on the supply of respite care. The demand side: what type of care is preferred by informal caregivers and what determines their preferences, is virtually unknown. We analysed the preferences and the underlying determinants for several types of support and respite care in a sample of 950 Dutch informal caregivers. Almost 80% of the respondents desire support or respite care in general, 42-47% would prefer more communication with other informal caregivers or more information of professional caregivers. Some time off is preferred by 40% of the respondents. The results show that caregiver characteristics, care recipient characteristics, elements of the caregiving situation and institutional variables determine the desire for support and respite care. Especially, the subjective burden of caregiving is important, whereas the number of caregiving tasks and the time invested (objective burden) hardly affect the desire for support and respite care."
17202818,0,a,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The very elderly constitute a subgroup of elderly who may respond differently than the younger elderly to medical intervention. This possibility has not previously been investigated. Our study investigates whether successful rehabilitation of the very elderly is possible within the current processes of care and also whether factors that help predict successful rehabilitation in all age elderly are applicable to the oldest old. METHODS: A retrospective case note analysis of all very elderly people (>or=90 years old) treated within in-patient elderly person rehabilitation facilities at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield. Potential predictive factors analysed: Barthel index, main presenting illness, number of co-morbid conditions, number of regular prescribed medications, abbreviated mental test score, prior formal social services input, previous hospital admission within 1 year and serum albumin (g/l). Outcome measures reflecting success of rehabilitation: duration of rehabilitation (days), discharge destination to the same ('good outcome') or increased ('poor outcome') level of social and/or nursing care, readmission to hospital within 30 days of discharge and death during rehabilitation or within 120 days of discharge. RESULTS: Of 230 nonagenarians admitted to inpatient elderly rehabilitation 47% required no increase in social support following their admission and 76% of those admitted from their own home were able to return there. Barthel index and the number of co-morbid conditions were the most influential predictors of success, with Barthel index predicting length of stay (p < 0.001), discharge destination (p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (p < 0.01) and co-morbidity predicting readmission to hospital (p = 0.05), in-hospital mortality (p = 0.04) and survival (p = 0.05). On multi-variate analysis all other predictive factors analysed, except for presenting illness, were associated with at least one outcome measure (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Successful inpatient rehabilitation of the very elderly is possible. Factors that predict the success of rehabilitation of nonagenarians are similar to those associated with success in the younger elderly. The factors that most broadly predict success are Barthel index and the number of co-morbid conditions identified at admission to rehabilitation. Main presenting illness did not emerge as a predictor within this group."
17706756,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: Smoking increases the risk for influenza and pneumococcal disease, but vaccination uptake is lower among smokers than non-smokers. We therefore aimed to determine reasons for not complying with vaccination among smokers and non-smokers. METHOD: In 2005 a self-administered questionnaire was sent to a random sample of Dutch patients (n=4,000) assessing medical, social and behavioural determinants. Independent factors associated with not complying with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among smokers and non-smokers were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In all, 1,725 of 4,000 patients returned the questionnaire (response rate: 43%), 426 (25%) were smokers. Among smokers self-reported flu vaccine uptake was 42% and among non-smokers 52% among both only 0,2% received both vaccines. Most important predictors of not complying in smokers and non-smokers were patient's beliefs not to be susceptible to disease (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0, 8.0 and OR 2.8, CI: 2.0, 3.9), finding it difficult to go to the GP for vaccination (OR 2.5, CI: 1.3, 4.8 and OR 1.8, CI: 1.3, 2.6) and being against vaccination (OR 2.4 CI: 1.3, 4.4 and OR 1.8, CI: 1.3, 2.6), respectively. CONCLUSION: There are no substantial differences in determinants associated with not complying with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination between smokers and non-smokers but there is a trend towards stronger associations in smokers."
17157105,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In France, the 1999 introduction of a dedicated emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) available without a prescription has resulted in a 72% increase in its use over the past 5 years, especially among younger women. METHODS: We used a population-based health survey conducted in 1999 and in 2004 to examine the changes in the determinants of lifetime ECP use among women aged between 15 and 24 years. We also explored the determinants and circumstances of recent use of ECPs in 2004 among women aged between 15 and 44 years who are at risk for unplanned pregnancy. RESULTS: In 1999, 14.6% of women aged between 15 and 24 years had ever used ECPs; this proportion rose to 31.7% in 2004. Results show consistent patterns of lifetime ECP use in 1999 and in 2004, with greater use among higher-educated women and women living in large cities. In 2004, 22% of women were using no contraceptive at the time they used ECPs and 84% resumed use of a regular contraceptive after ECP use. However, 5.5% had unprotected intercourse after taking ECPs in the same menstrual cycle and in the next. CONCLUSION: Despite direct pharmacy access, differences in ECP use remain by social and residential status. Emergency contraceptive pills were used as a backup method in case of contraceptive failure and did not impede the use of subsequent regular contraception."
10452207,1,a,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the well-being of women with endometrial versus cervical cancer before treatment, and its determinants at 12 to 15 months follow-up. The subjects were interviewed before treatment, then 6 and 12 to 15 months after initiation of treatment. Simultaneously, they completed questionnaires on psychological symptoms and social support. It appeared that well-being at baseline and at the follow-ups were highly correlated. Furthermore, cervical cancer patients reported significantly more symptoms on all occasions. After discriminant function analysis, the following three variables remained in the analysis: (a) well-being before treatment, (b) diagnosis, and (c) children at home. This allowed 81% of the patients to be classified as having a favorable versus an unfavorable outcome. The results of this study highlight the importance of well-being before treatment as a predictor of well-being after treatment. The necessity of individualized intervention measures is warranted."
1920063,1,a,"Four experiments examined freely interacting groups to investigate the determinants of group members' reactions to opinion deviates and conformists. In the 1st experiment, the deviate was rejected more when he or she articulated the dissenting opinion in close proximity to the group-decision deadline versus at an earlier point in the group discussion. In the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th experiment, the deviate was rejected more when the group discussion was carried out in a noisy versus a quiet environment. Furthermore, when the conformist's contributions to the group's attempts to reach consensus were made salient (in Experiment 4), he or she was evaluated more positively in a noisy versus a quiet environment. The results were discussed in terms of the notion that group members' tendency to denigrate a deviate or extol a conformist may be stronger when their need for collective cognitive closure is heightened."
16953359,0,a,"The article provides an overview of the contemporary literature on the social and psychological factors which are associated with migration. Derived from the operationalisation of ""migration"" and an examination of the methodological peculiarities of migration research, a (transactional) stress model of migration is proposed incorporating potentially stress-eliciting influences of migration including occupational pressures, social isolation and/or family-related problems and their impact on psychological and physical health. There are inconsistencies in the findings regarding psychological health, which can in part be explained through the phenomena of the ""healthy migrant effect"", duration of stay in the host culture or the culture-specificity. Moreover, a discussion is provided of the extent that disorders associated with differentially stressed migrants will be manifested in the health care system. Finally, concluding remarks are offered together with a short discussion of the implication of these findings for future research and social and health policy decision-making."
15798125,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: We examined a community-based participatory diabetes intervention to identify facilitators of and barriers to sustained community efforts to address social factors that contribute to health. METHODS: We conducted a case study description and analysis of the Healthy Eating and Exercising to Reduce Diabetes project in the theoretical context of a conceptual model of social determinants of health. RESULTS: We identified several barriers to and facilitators of analysis of social determinants of a community-identified disease priority (in this case, diabetes). Barriers included prevailing conceptual models, which emphasize health behavioral and biomedical paradigms that exclude social determinants of health. Facilitating factors included (1) opportunities to link individual health concerns to social contexts and (2) availability of support from diverse partners with a range of complementary resources. CONCLUSIONS: Partnerships that offer community members tangible resources with which to manage existing health concerns and that integrate an analysis of social determinants of health can facilitate sustained engagement of community members and health professionals in multilevel efforts to address health disparities."

9990494,1,a,"AIM: To describe medico-social functioning after total gastrectomy and the factors determining it. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In three medical rehabilitation centres, 173 consecutive patients (female/male = 62/111) after potentially curative total gastrectomy for gastric malignancy 206 days earlier (median, interquartile range = IQR 56-644) were evaluated for different pre- and post-operative parameters with potential influence on post-operative medico-social functioning as measured with the Edinburgh Rehabilitation Status Scale (ERSS). Parameters evaluated were: gender, age, time since operation, tumour stage, type of operation, clinical centre of admittance, haemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, presence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, rapid oro-coecal transit, dyspepsia, early satiety, reflux, dysphagia, vomiting, a symptom based score, body mass index in health, at operation and on admission, weight loss since operation, calorie intake, bowel habits, and fat malassimilation. Independent influential factors for the ERSS were identified in a linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The median ERSS-score was 4 (IQR 2-6) on a scale from 0 (best) to 28 (worst). There was a significant difference in the ERSS-scores between the three different clinics. The ERSS-scores improved significantly with time since operation (ca. 22% per year). ERSS-scores were higher in patients with intestino-oesophageal reflux (+71%), with dyspepsia (+65%), or with dysphagia (+62%). CONCLUSION: Medico-social functioning was acceptable in this patient population. After total gastrectomy, dyspepsia, dysphagia, and intestinal reflux into the oesophagus need special attention."
9088636,1,a,"This paper discusses results from a project which aims to document the maternity hospital practices in istanbul within the context of Ten Steps for Successful Breastfeeding. Instruments developed for use in hospital level implementation of the WHO/UNICEF baby friendly hospital initiative were used in five hospitals (two public and three private). No hospital was implementing all Ten Steps. A core hospital team on lactation management and a sufficient number of health personnel skillful in breastfeeding counselling and adequate delivery room conditions are required to implement the Ten Steps. It is very difficult to provide these conditions in public hospitals with an excessive patient load. On the other hand, the fee for service system and the policy of changing practices according to the wishes of the clients can also become barriers to successful breastfeeding, as may occur in some private hospitals."
16088090,0,a,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The importance of careful theory-based intervention planning is recognized for fruit and vegetable promotion. This paper describes the application of the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol to develop the Pro Children intervention to promote consumption of fruit and vegetable among 10- to 13-year-old schoolchildren. METHODS: Based on a needs assessment, promotion of intake of fruit and vegetable was split into performance objectives and related personal, social and environmental determinants. Crossing the performance objectives with related important and changeable determinants resulted in a matrix of learning and change objectives for which appropriate educational strategies were identified. Theoretically similar but culturally relevant interventions were designed, implemented and evaluated in Norway, the Netherlands and Spain during 2 school years. RESULTS: Programme activities included provision of fruits and vegetables in the schools, guided classroom activities, computer-tailored feedback and advice for children, and activities to be completed at home with the family. Additionally, optional intervention components for community reinforcement included incorporation of mass media, school health services or grocery stores. School project committees were supported. CONCLUSION: The Pro Children intervention was carefully developed based on the IM protocol that resulted in a comprehensive school-based fruit and vegetable promotion programme, but culturally sensible and locally relevant."
17144765,0,a,"In 2 studies, the authors investigated the determinants of anger and approach-related intentions and behavior toward outgroup members in interracial interactions. In Study 1, White and Black participants who were led to believe that their interracial interaction partner was not open to an upcoming interaction reported heightened anger and approach-related intentions concerning the interaction, including viewing their partner as hostile, intending to ask sensitive race-relevant questions during the interaction, and planning to blame the partner if the interaction went poorly. Results of Study 2 showed that White participants who received negative feedback about their Black partner's openness to interracial interactions behaved in a hostile manner toward their interaction partner. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the quality of interracial interactions."

10982476,0,a,"Informed probands are key actors for disclosing genetic information to their relatives when a mutation has been identified in the family. The objectives were to study women's attitudes towards the family disclosure of positive breast cancer genetic testing results and to determine the predictive factors of the diffusion patterns observed. A national multi-center cross-sectional survey was carried out at five French cancer genetic clinics during a 1-year period. Self-administered questionnaires were completed after the consultation by 84.5% (398/471) of women attending breast cancer genetic clinics for the first time. Among the 383 respondents who had at least one living first-degree relative to inform, 8.6% would inform none, 33.2% would inform at least one of them, and 58.2% would inform all of them. The sibship would be the most frequently informed blood relatives, sisters in 86.9% and brothers in 79% compared with mother in 71.4%, children in 70.4%, and father in 64.9%. Women of the family would be more frequently informed than men (P < 0.05). After multivariate adjustment, age, the fact to be affected by cancer, the number of daughters, and the emotional disturbance due to cancer in a close relationship were the main determinants (P < 0.05) of the diffusion patterns observed. The first step of the relatives' attendance to genetic counseling and the proband's willingness to disclose breast cancer genetic tests results was high in this study and was clearly dependent on the women's personal and emotional characteristics."
19968876,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A large proportion of people living with hip or knee pain do not consult health care professionals. Pain severity is often believed to be the main reason for help seeking in this population; however the evidence for this is contradictory. This study explores the importance of several potential risk factors on help seeking across different practitioner groups, among adults living with chronic hip or knee pain in a large community sample. METHODS: Health care utilization, defined as having seen a family doctor (GP) during the past 12 months; or an allied health professional (AHP) or alternative therapist during the past 3 months, was assessed in a community based sample aged 35 or over and reporting pain in hip or knee. Adjusted odds ratios were determined for social deprivation, rurality, pain severity, mobility, anxiety/depression, co-morbidities, and body mass index. RESULTS: Of 1119 persons reporting hip or knee pain, 52% had pain in both sites. Twenty-five percent of them had seen a doctor only, 3% an AHP only, and 4% an alternative therapist only. Thirteen percent had seen more than one category of health care professionals, and 55% had not seen any health care professional. In the multivariate model, factors associated with consulting a GP were mobility problems (OR 2.62 (1.64-4.17)), urban living (OR 2.40 (1.14-5.04) and pain severity (1.28 (1.13-1.44)). There was also some evidence that obesity was associated with increased consultation (OR 1.72 (1.00-2.93)). Factors were similar for consultation with a combination of several health care professionals. In contrast, seeing an alternative therapist was negatively associated with pain severity, anxiety and mobility problems (adjusting for age and sex). CONCLUSION: Disability appears to be a more important determinant of help-seeking than pain severity or anxiety and depression, for adults with chronic pain in hip or knee. The determinants of seeking help from alternative practitioners are different from determinants of consulting GPs, AHPs or a combination of different health care providers."
10048726,1,a,"BACKGROUND: In the Copenhagen Male Study men with the Lewis blood group phenotype Le(a+b-), non-secretors of ABH antigen, and men with the O or the A phenotype in the ABO blood group have been found to have a significantly higher lifetime prevalence of peptic ulcer than others. We investigated the importance of the association of these genetic markers, life-style factors, and social class with lifetime risk of peptic ulcer, testing specifically the hypothesis that the strength of the association of risk factors with peptic ulcer depends on genetic susceptibility. METHODS: Three thousand three hundred and forty-six white men 55-74 years old were included for study. From a questionnaire validated during an interview information was obtained about life-style factors and peptic ulcer history (gastric or duodenal). Potential non-genetic risk factors examined were smoking history, alcohol consumption, physical activity level, consumption of tea and coffee, and use of sugar in tea or coffee. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-four men (11.5%) had a history of peptic ulcer; 120 (3.6%) had had an operation due to peptic ulcer. Non-genetic peptic ulcer risk factors identified were ever having been a smoker, use of sugar in tea or coffee, abstention from tea consumption, and low social class. On the basis of these and the genetic factors, it was possible to identify a low-risk group (n = 142) with a lifetime prevalence of 4.2%, several intermediate-risk groups, and a high-risk group (n = 55) with a prevalence of 29%; the odds ratio with 95% confidence limits (OR) was 9.3 (3.4-25.3). Corresponding values with regard to operation were 1.4% and 20.0%; OR = 17.5 (3.7-82.0). Several significant interactions were found; for example, the use of sugar was associated with peptic ulcer risk only when interacting with genetic risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the role of Helicobacter pylori, it is interesting that the factors identified in this study were able to identify groups with extremely different lifetime risks. This finding and also the finding of strong interactions between genetic and life-style factors and between genetic factors and social class for the risk of peptic ulcer may have both public-health and clinical implications."
18036211,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Health and well-being are the result of synergistic interactions among a variety of determinants. Family structure and composition are social determinants that may also affect health behaviours and outcomes. This study was performed to examine the associations between family structure and health and to determine the protective effects of support mechanisms to improve quality of health outcome. METHODS: Six hundred people, selected by multistage sampling to obtain a representative population of men and women aged 20-60 living in communities in Japan, were included in this study. Data regarding subjective views of one's own health, family structure, lifestyle and social support were collected through structured face-to-face interviews on home visits. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, height and weight were measured by trained examiners. The associations between family structure and health after controlling for demographics, lifestyle and social support were examined using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Subjects living alone were significantly more likely to be in ill health, as determined using the General Health Questionnaire, in comparison to those in extended families (OR = 3.14). Subjects living alone or as couples were significantly more likely to suffer from severe hypertension in comparison to those living in extended families (OR = 8.25, OR = 4.90). These associations remained after controlling for the influence of lifestyle. Subjects living only with spouse or in nuclear family had higher probabilities of mental ill health in the absence than in the presence of people showing concern for their well-being. CONCLUSION: The results of this study infers that a support mechanism consisting of companionship and the presence of family or other people concerned for one's well being acts as a buffer against deleterious influence of living in small family that will lead to improved quality of health outcome."
8888156,1,a,"This paper explores barriers to the use of standard screening and breast cancer treatment that result in systematic differences in health outcomes. We review available data on individual, socioeconomic, and health system determinants of access to standard breast cancer care, including screening, diagnostic, and treatment services. Based on this review, we discuss the combination of factors which result in underservice. We argue that a broad framework which considers health system and social class as well as individual factors is useful for analyzing how structures of health care delivery tend to provide less than standard care to women who are older, have less income, or are less educated, black, or Hispanic. Data collection efforts which do not include structural and socioeconomic variables may result in an incomplete or misleading understanding of the determinants of underservice. These factors also need to be considered in the design and evaluation of public health policies and interventions meant to ameliorate the effects of underservice."
12899910,0,a,"This paper represents an investigation into the determinants of young children's quality of life (QOL) in Thailand. The empirical work is based upon a sample of 498 children (aged 5-8); 220 were urban children and 278 children of construction workers in Bangkok. Their QOL was assessed using a new self-report QOL measure for children. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the father's income and education, type of school, mode of transportation to school, and the amount of time that the child spent on extra study courses were significant explanatory variables. It was found that these factors had different influences on the QOL of urban children and those of construction workers. Extra sport-related activities and extra work (other than housework) improved the QOL of urban children, while the QOL of construction workers' children was directly linked to father's education and income. This result is consistent with income having a diminishing marginal effect on the QOL of children. There is also evidence that amongst construction workers' children, boys have a lower QOL than girls. The different causal explanations for the QOL of urban and construction workers' children suggests that it is context specific, and what impacts one group of children's QOL within a particular context may not impact another group in a different situation. This has important policy implications. Throughout the study we could find no significant impact of health on QOL-neither chronic, acute nor severe illness has any significant impact on QOL. This is consistent with the hypothesis that QOL is influenced by expectations (Social Science and Medicine 41 (10) (1995) 1403). Findings of the effects of social and environmental factors on children's QOL are new in this field and should be further investigated."
10786724,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyse the associations between the food variety score (FVS), dietary diversity score (DDS) and nutritional status of children, and to assess the associations between FVS, DDS and socioeconomic status (SES) on a household level. The study also assessed urban and rural differences in FVS and DDS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional studies in 1994/95, including a simplified food frequency questionnaire on food items used in the household the previous day. A socioeconomic score was generated, based on possessions in the households. Weight and height were measured for all children aged 6-59 months in the households, and anthropometric indices were generated. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Three hundred and twenty-nine urban and 488 rural households with 526 urban and 1789 rural children aged 6-59 months in Koutiala County, Sikasso Region, Mali. RESULTS: Children from urban households with a low FVS or DDS had a doubled risk (OR>2) for being stunted and underweight. Those relations were not found in the rural area. There was an association between SES and both FVS and DDS on the household level in both areas. The FVS and DDS in urban households with the lowest SES were higher than the FVS and DDS among the rural households with the highest SES. CONCLUSIONS: Food variety and dietary diversity seem to be associated with nutritional status (weight/age and height/age) of children in heterogeneous communities, as our data from urban areas showed. In rural areas, however, this association could not be shown. Socioeconomic factors seem to be important determinants for FVS and DDS both in urban and rural areas. FVS and DDS are useful variables in assessing the nutritional situation of households, particular in urban areas."
7867772,1,a,"The increased risk of infant mortality associated with single motherhood is neither consistent among social and demographic subgroups nor inevitable, according to data from national linked birth and infant death files for 1983-1985. Maternal age is the only variable found to have a significant interaction with marital status among black mothers, and the risk associated with unmarried status increases with age. Among white mothers, age, educational level and receipt of prenatal care all show significant interactions with marital status; the increased risks of infant mortality attributed to unmarried motherhood are concentrated among subgroups usually thought to be at lower risk. For example, the risks of infant mortality among unmarried white women relative to married white women are highest among 25-29-year-olds. However, being unmarried did not affect the risk of infant mortality among babies born to college-educated white women."
15768772,0,a,"This is an exploratory study to examine the social and cultural determinants of the teaching of HIV/AIDS sex education among secondary school teachers in Eastern Nigeria. The research analyses how teachers perceive passing their knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention measures to their students in the context of their cultural and social norms, which restrict open discussion of sex. This is a qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with 60 teachers drawn from secondary school teachers in Eastern Nigeria, supplemented with five focus group discussions, and content analysis of teachers' lesson preparatory notes. The findings show a high level knowledge of HIV/AIDS preventive measures among teachers. However, teachers are not passing on this knowledge because of cultural and social inhibitions. In addition, teachers have not been receiving adequate training and motivation on information, education and communication for HIV/AIDS sex education. The situation calls for serious policy intervention."
1827639,1,a,"Anxiety and depression symptom scores from the SCL-90 questionnaire were observed in a large sample of nuclear families, and the effects of genes or family environment were estimated. Assuming no environmental transmission from parents to offspring, heritability was estimated at 0.43 for both anxiety and depression scores, and common sibling environment or reciprocal sibling influence explained 19% of the variances for both scores. Most of the (genetic or environmental) family effect seemed to be common for the two scores. There was no evidence of common determinants in the family for the symptom scores and alcohol consumption, not even of any substantial relationship within persons between symptoms and consumption. The spouse correlations were 0.25 for anxiety and 0.38 for depression. Similar values for the correlations between anxiety in one person and depression in his/her spouse implies a mate selection based on a single latent variable to which the two observed traits contribute."
12287674,1,a,"""This article critically examines the Lewisian turning point [concerning the availability of unlimited manpower resources] in light of Japan's experience since the mid-1800s. Japan reached its Lewisian turning point around 1960. Contrary to the assumptions of the theory however, the findings for Japan indicate that political factors have been more determinative of the rate of migration than purely economic ones. Prior to its turning point in 1960, international relations, war and forced repatriation were the decisive factors. Recently, though the inflow of foreign workers to fill labor shortages has increased, so also has the outflow of Japanese to accompany direct foreign investment."""

Controlling for a range of socio-economic variables, derived from the 1991 British Census Sample of Anonymised Records (SAR), at both the individual and area level, the distance moved by household heads in public, privately rented and owner-occupied housing within Britain is assessed.... It is confirmed that migrants in public housing are less likely to migrate long distances than owner-occupiers and that the proportion of public housing in a SAR area, and the absolute reduction in public housing in a SAR area between 1981 and 1991, does not have a significant effect on the distance that in-migrants have moved."""
16203507,1,a,"The health effects of alcohol are determined not only by level of intake but also by patterns of alcohol use and many other health determinants. This study seeks to identify groups of individuals who share various features in terms of drinking styles and other health indicators. Data used are a subset of the 1990 Ontario Health Survey, corresponding to men and women aged 20-64 with complete data in four substantive areas: alcohol use; demographic characteristics; current health status; and various behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Cluster analysis was used to groups of male and female respondents who were similar in terms of their style of alcohol use, along with other constructs relevant to health risk and health status. For both sexes, clusters were identified which matched expectation in terms of drinking patterns and other relevant variables. For both sexes, clusters were found with generally higher social class indicators, generally positive health behaviours and health status and drinking patterns which did not include drinking to excess. Clusters were also found for which high-volume drinking occasions corresponded with poor health status and high levels of risk factors for chronic disease. Other unanticipated patterns were also identified. This information may assist in identifying confounding effects in epidemiological studies as well as identifying the characteristics of unique sub-populations which are likely to be the focus of primary prevention efforts."
18477747,0,a,"BACKGROUND: This paper analyses gender inequalities in health status and in social determinants of health among the elderly in western Europe. METHODS: Data came from the first wave of the ""Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe"" (2004). For the purposes of this study a subsample of community-residing people aged 65-85 years with no paid work was selected (4218 men and 5007 women). Multiple logistic regression models separated by sex and adjusted for age and country were fitted. RESULTS: Women were more likely to report poor health status, limitations in mobility and poor mental health. Whereas in both sexes educational attainment was associated with the three health indicators, household income was only related to poor self-rated health among women. The relationship between living arrangements and health differed by gender and was primarily associated with poor mental health. In both sexes, not living with their partner but living with other people and being the household head was related to poor mental health status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.14; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.14 for men and aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.72 for women). In addition, women living with their partner and other(s) and those living alone were more likely to report poor mental health status (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.41 and aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities persist among the elderly. Women have poorer health status than men and in both sexes the risk of poor health status increases among those with low educational attainment. Living arrangements are primarily associated with poor mental health status with patterns that differ by gender."
9916298,1,a,"Since the introduction of the Austrian tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination program in 1981 vaccination coverage of children has not been investigated sufficiently. Numerous socioeconomic and demographic factors have been identified as being associated with low vaccination coverage in childhood for most vaccinations. This study focuses on parental educational status and on resources for child care as determinants of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination coverage of schoolchildren in an endemic TBE area of Austria. The target population were children in the first, fourth and seventh year of school education in Styria, Austria. Therefore, the sample consisting of 2470 children was divided into three age groups, children aged 7, 10 and 13 years. We performed a representative cross-sectional study. The information concerning the vaccination status of each child was recorded by means of an anonymous questionnaire given to the parents by the classroom teachers. This procedure ensured a high overall response rate of 79.8%. The prevalence of at least one TBE vaccination was 93.9% for the 7 year old, 97.8% for the 10 and 97.9% for the 13 year old. The lowest vaccination rates were found in families with four or more children (94.0%) and for those children who had unemployed parents (92.9%). The multivariate analysis indicates that TBE vaccination coverage is affected by a large number of children in the family (p = 0.0003), an urban place of residence (p = 0.0001) and by a low level of education of the mother (p = 0.013). The results suggest that, though overall high coverage in schoolchildren, vaccination programmes should be focused on large and socially deprived families."
8266845,1,a,"This study evaluates the ability of a four-factor psychosocial model to explain adolescent drug involvement. Subjects are a representative sample of seventh- and eighth-grade public school students. A cross-sectional sample of data was extracted from a multiyear longitudinal assessment of a statewide drug education program. Data were collected through administration of the Youth Life-Styles Inventory, a specially designed drug-involvement assessment instrument. The belief that substance use has both external (sociological) and internal (psychological) causes guided the selection of independent variables. Factor analysis was used to disclose the interrelated structures of the psychosocial variables. A four-factor model was produced offering a concise theoretical paradigm of the underlying psychosocial determinants of adolescent drug use. This model was regressed on two indexes of drug involvement. Findings should prove useful in policy formulation and design of adolescent drug education and treatment programs. The explanatory potency of the four-factor model should aid in the investigation of adolescent drug use. The results indicate the need for children to bond with peers, parents, and others who have drug-resistant attitudes, and with conventional institutions such as schools."
11620426,1,a,"This article presents an analysis of the levels, trends and determinants of infant mortality in various regions of Finland between the late seventeenth and early twentieth centuries. Nursing habits were of critical importance as were diet and hygiene. It is suggested that there were differences in the frequency of breastfeeding with the landless being more and the farmers being less likely to breastfeed their children. In areas where cows milk was readily available as a substitute for breast milk other influences on infant mortality were the contamination of drinking water and the water in which feeding utensils were washed. At the end of the eighteenth century, in the south-west of Finland, the introduction of the potato created a suitable food for women and children and lowered the mortality rate of infants aged 3-6 months. By contrast, in the regions where the first solid food given to infants was chewed by the mothers, infant mortality remained high. In the part of Finland adjacent to St Petersburg infant mortality actually increased as local mothers were engaged as wet-nurses by the city's foundling hospital."
11322845,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A carbose is the first of a new class of antidiabetic agents, the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. This study characterizes and identifies predictors of persistence of use of acarbose. METHODS: Medical, pharmaceutical, and demographic records were extracted for 2 cohorts of patients (social assistance recipients and seniors) from the databases of Quebec's provincial health plan. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had received their first dispensation of acarbose between August 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997. The observation period included at least 1 year before the first dispensation and a minimum of 4 months after. RESULTS: New users of acarbose included 216 social assistance recipients and 677 seniors who were followed up for 82 914 and 270 041 person-days, respectively. Median persistence with acarbose treatment was 83 days (95% confidence interval, 75-105 days) for social assistance recipients and 105 days (95% confidence interval, 90-119 days) for seniors. In both cohorts, treatment by an endocrinologist vs another physician predicted longer treatment persistence. In the seniors cohort, additional determinants of (earlier) treatment discontinuation included a higher initial daily dose, previous treatment with insulin, and consultation with a gastroenterologist after treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: New users of acarbose showed low persistence in 2 cohorts of beneficiaries of Quebec's provincial health plan. Prescribing specialist was an important predictor of persistence in seniors and the socially assisted. The importance of 4 additional factors in seniors only led to hypotheses concerning population differences in treatment expectations and in the occurrence and tolerance of adverse effects."
10677678,0,a,"The production, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials are processes of vital economic importance for any advanced and technologically complex society. Although the production and distribution of hazardous materials is associated with economic development, there is a significant potential danger to the natural and social environment in the event of their accidental release, a fact that prompts for the development and implementation of methods and techniques that aim to improve hazardous materials risk management decisions. The objective of this paper is to present a unified framework for developing a Decision Support System (DSS) for supporting a vital function of risk management, namely the management of emergency response operations. The proposed framework recognizes the peculiarities of the hazardous materials decision-making environment which is characterized by: (i) multiple stakeholders, i.e., persons and organizations involved in and affected by hazardous materials risk management decisions; (ii) lack of a formal management structure for monitoring and controlling in a unified manner all Emergency Response Resources; (iii) lack of clear distinction and fragmentation of responsibilities of the actors involved in risk management operations; and (iv) dynamic/real-time decisions, i.e., risk determinants change over time. The proposed framework was used in order to develop a DSS for managing emergency response operations for large scale industrial accidents in Western Attica, Greece."

10641810,1,a,"Primordial prevention seeks to prevent future disease by influencing its social determinants. Henry Blackburn's writings are prime portrayals of social factors causing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). His classic paper, Diet and Mass Hyperlipidemia, identified changes needed in professional attitudes, medical economics, food production, food labeling, and food advertising. The 1982 WHO report, Coronary Heart Disease (Blackburn, rapporteur), introduced the term ""primordial prevention,"" starting a cycle of initiatives, all with considerable influence worldwide. He participated in the now widely disseminated Victoria Declaration on Heart Health (1992), which contained 64 policy recommendations, many focussing on broad social forces that influence modern CVD epidemics. The path he initiated led to the Catalonia Declaration: Investing in Heart Health (1996), which echoed many of his pleas for resources necessary to influence CVD rates. Some roots of CVD's recent decline in many countries are thus clearly attributable to Blackburn's prescient wisdom and visionary scholarship."
2004868,1,a,"As the AIDS epidemic in Africa assumes major proportions, the need to understand the social context in which heterosexual transmission occurs takes on urgent importance. In this article we explore how the intersection of traditional culture with the colonial legacy and present-day political economy has influenced family structure and sexual relations, and particularly the social position of women. Drawing on Zimbabwe's historical experience, we show how land expropriation, rural impoverishment, and the forcible introduction of male migrant labor fostered new patterns of sexual relations, characterized by multiple partners. Traditional patriarchal values reinterpreted in European law resulted in further subjugation of women as even limited rights to ownership were withdrawn. For many women, sexual relations with men, either within marriage (for the majority) or outside, become inextricably linked to economic and social survival. In this setting, all sexually transmitted diseases became rampant, including genital ulcer, which facilitates transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Intervention programs to halt the spread of AIDS need to take into the account the epidemic's historical roots and social nature. For example, efforts to reduce risk of HIV transmission should seek to expand women's limited options, both technically (e.g., by providing alternatives to condoms) and socially (e.g., by promoting employment)."
15768774,0,a,"Child mortality (the mortality of children less than five years old) declined considerably in the developing world in the 1990s, but infant mortality declined less. The reductions in neonatal mortality were not impressive and, as a consequence, there is an increasing percentage of infant deaths in the neonatal period. Any further reduction in child mortality, therefore, requires an understanding of the determinants of neonatal mortality. 209,628 birth and 2581 neonatal death records for the 1998 birth cohort from the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were probabilistically matched. Data were from SINASC and SIM, Information Systems on Live Births and Deaths of Brazil. Logistic regression was used to find the association between neonatal mortality and the following risk factors: birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, delivery mode, plurality, sex, maternal education, maternal age, number of prior losses, prenatal care, race, parity and community development. Infants of older mothers were less likely to die in the neonatal period. Caesarean delivery was not found to be associated with neonatal mortality. Low birth weight, pre-term birth and low Apgar scores were associated with neonatal death. Having a mother who lives in the highest developed community decreased the odds of neonatal death, suggesting that factors not measured in this study are behind such association. This result may also indicate that other factors over and above biological and more proximate factors could affect neonatal death."
11018394,0,a,"PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between social class factors and squamous cell esophageal cancer and the extent to which alcohol, tobacco, diet, and social class contribute to the five-fold higher incidence among black than white men in the United States.METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 347 incident cases of squamous cell esophageal cancer (119 white males and 228 black males) and 1354 population-based controls (743 white males and 611 black males) from Atlanta, Detroit, and New Jersey. Risks were estimated using unconditional logistic regression controlling for potential confounders.RESULTS: Elevated risks of squamous cell esophageal cancer were associated with indicators of low social class, especially low annual income. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for subjects with incomes < $10,000 versus incomes of $25,000 or more were 4.3 (95% CI = 2.1-8.7) for whites and 8.0 (95% CI = 4.3-15.0) for blacks. The combination of all four major risk factors: annual income less than $25,000, moderate/heavy use of alcohol, use of tobacco for six months or longer, and consumption of less than 2.5 servings of raw fruits and vegetables per day accounted for almost all of the squamous cell esophageal cancers in whites (98%) and blacks (99%), and for 99% of the excess incidence among black men.CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle modifications, especially a lower intake of alcoholic beverages, would markedly decrease the incidence of this cancer in both races and narrow the racial disparity in risk. Further studies into the determinants of social class may help identify a new set of exposures for this tumor that are amendable to intervention."

The theoretical approach highlights regional differences in the returns to skills: regions that pay higher returns to skills attract more skilled workers than regions that pay lower returns. Our empirical results suggest that interstate differences in the returns to skills are a major determinant of both the size and skill composition of internal migration flows. Persons whose skills are most mismatched with the reward structure offered by their current state of residence are the persons most likely to leave that state, and these persons tend to relocate in states which offer higher rewards for their particular skills."""
17945162,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacy is a dynamic, growing, and increasingly diverse profession. It has a new patient orientation, especially in developed countries. There is a paucity of work examining pharmacists' satisfaction and professionalization in developing nations, such as Lebanon. OBJECTIVE: The purpose this study is to explore the Lebanese pharmacists' professional satisfaction and applicable needs regarding their profession. Specific objectives aimed to examine Lebanese pharmacists' satisfaction and determine whether the Lebanese Order of Pharmacists helps pharmacists to meet their professional needs. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of Lebanese pharmacists working in all pharmacy practicing environments in Lebanon. A random sample was drawn from the list of registered pharmacists provided by the Lebanese Order of Pharmacists. Selected individuals were visited and interviewed in their workplace. Pharmacists who had no registered address were contacted and interviewed face to face. RESULTS: Newly graduated pharmacists seemed more likely to work in community pharmacies or as medical representatives. Most interviewed pharmacists had no difficulty finding a job, but they all thought that the Order of Pharmacists should get more involved in advising and providing job opportunities, because the market is currently saturated. Most were financially satisfied, especially owners of community pharmacies. Although half of the pharmacists were psychologically satisfied, a great number of community, hospital, and medical representative pharmacists were not physically satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is necessary for a thorough evaluation of Lebanese pharmacists' professional satisfaction and its specific determinants, with the ultimate goal of finding adequate solutions for their needs."
9300522,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Most studies of social support appear to assume that it is something that the external environment provides to an individual. However, longitudinal and genetic studies are beginning to question this assumption. The purpose of the present study is to differentiate quantitatively the intra-individual determinants of social support from its extra-individual components. METHODS: The subjects were 103 high school exchange students who were enrolled in a 1-year placement with a host family in various countries of the world. The People In Your Life scale, a reliable and validated self-report measure of perceived social support, was administered before their departure from home, after 6 months of stay in a completely unfamiliar foreign community and 6 months after their return home. Structural equation models were examined that partitioned the intra-individual and extra-individual components of social support, and the best fitting models were selected. RESULTS: Between 24% and 69%, or up to 86% depending on the situation, of the variances of social support measures were stable across situations and considered intra-individual; 31% to 76% of what is measured as social support was of extra-individual origin. Moderately strong correlations were noted between the intra-individual components and the trait extraversion. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of social support, which is usually tacitly understood as something extrinsic to an individual, in fact may not be measures of the external environment only."
15189215,0,a,"Mating systems are important determinants of genetic structure in cooperative groups, and their effects can influence profoundly the interactions of group members. The primitively eusocial wasp, Ropalidia revolutionalis, has an interesting genetic and social structure that makes it an excellent model system for examining the evolution of more complex societies. In particular, its colonies sometimes have multiple queens, a key characteristic of more advanced wasp societies. In this study, we have characterized the mating system of the social wasp Ropalidia revolutionalis to understand better its colony genetic structure. R. revolutionalis females nearly always mate singly and they are unrelated to their mates. However, different females in the same colony do mate with males, on average, who are related as cousins. Single mating will help to maintain high relatedness, which should be important for continued cooperation in multiple queen societies, but it creates potential conflicts in single queen colonies over the production of males as well as over the timing of male production. We have also characterized the population structure of R. revolutionalis from Townsville, in tropical north Queensland, to Brisbane in the subtropics. Even at such a large scale, the population is remarkably unstructured with an average F(ST) of 0.0546. There is weak isolation by distance, and evidence for subtle differentiation between a southern region with no dry season, which extends as far north as Rockhampton, and a northern region with a severe to moderate dry season. This may reflect historical effects of extreme aridity on the population structure."
11338939,0,a,"Flashbulb memories are vivid and long-lasting memories for the reception context of an important public event (Brown & Kulik, 1977). They are assumed to be triggered by emotional factors (i.e., intensity of emotional feeling, appraisal of the original event) and by social factors (i.e., social sharing of the news, following media debate about the event). The present study investigated the memory for the death of the former President of France F. Mitterrand in two social groups, i.e., French and Belgian people. This study tests whether the flashbulb memory attributes, the memory for the original event, and the impact of the emotional and social determinants of flashbulb memory differed across groups. The results indicated that the flashbulb memory for Mitterrand's death is affected by group provenance, as French people showed higher levels of recall for the flashbulb memory attributes and their determinants than Belgian people. Time impaired recollections in both groups, so that flashbulb memories appear prone to decay and share the same destiny as ordinary memories. The theoretical construct of concern--as the most basic antecedent of emotional experiences and its related appraisal (Frijda, 1994)--is discussed in order to explain the differences in memory of the two social groups."
12321105,1,a,"""Based on the argument that values and expectations underlie behavioral motives, this study explores the determinants of migration-related values and expectations, and whether they are intervening factors in explaining intentions to move among residents of rural northeast Thailand. Data from the 1992 National Migration Survey of Thailand identify four migration-related value-expectancy dimensions: income, affiliation, stimulation, and comfort. Logistic regression analysis shows that landownership and being married are associated with higher expectations, while a diversified village economy, a village economy development program, and a younger and extended household structure are associated with lower expectations of attaining valued goals in the local rural village. The analysis also shows that value-expectancy concepts are only partial intervening explanations for intentions to move or stay."""
18347970,0,a,"This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine the extent to which school-level social and institutional factors moderate genetic tendencies to smoke cigarettes. Our analysis relies on a sub-sample of 1,198 sibling and twin pairs nested within 84 schools. We develop a multilevel modeling extension of regression-based quantitative genetic techniques to calculate school-specific heritability estimates. We show that smoking onset (h2 = .51) and daily smoking (h2 = .58) are both genetically influenced. Whereas the genetic influence on smoking onset is consistent across schools, we show that schools moderate the heritability of daily smoking. The heritability of daily smoking is the highest within schools in which the most popular students are also smokers and reduced within schools in which the majority of the students are non-Hispanic and white. These findings make important contributions to the literature on gene-environment interactions."
7579984,1,a,"The use of anti-psychotic medication with an adult population of people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours was investigated as part of an epidemiological study covering seven district health authorities and corresponding local authorities in North West England. The study found a high rate of prescription of anti-psychotic drugs (48.1%). Chlorpromazine was the most frequently prescribed drug, followed by Thioridazine and Haloperidol. Three variables, psychiatric diagnosis, where the person was resident (hospital disturbed ward, hospital non-disturbed ward, hostel or family home) and district of origin were found to be significant determinants of prescriptions when all other variables were controlled. Of the variables reflecting individual characteristics those significantly related to prescription suggested that the socially disruptive effects of challenging behaviour were determining prescription. The results are discussed in the context of differing prescription practices across residence and district in the context of the management of socially disruptive behaviour."
8550270,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Mortality was compared in the Jewish populations of Montreal and Israel and the overall Canadian population, to investigate whether the Israeli pattern of low male mortality and relatively high female mortality is replicated among Jews living elsewhere. METHODS: In Montreal, death certificates were obtained from Jewish funeral homes (where all Jewish deaths are believed to be handled) for 1986-1990 and coded. RESULTS: All-cause cumulative mortality for ages 35-74 (CM), was exceedingly low in Montreal Jews, both in males (CM = 0.312, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.274-0.350) and females (CM = 0.202, 95% CI: 0.172-0.232), compared to all Canadians (CM = 0.425; 95% CI: 0.414-0.435 and 0.251; 95% CI: 0.243-0.253) and Israeli Jews (CM = 0.406; 95% CI: 0.379-0.434, and 0.299; 95% CI: 0.276-0.322), for males and females. Sex ratios (male:female) were 1.36, 1.54, and 1.69 for Israeli Jews, Montreal Jews, and Canadians, respectively. Differences were due mainly to substantially lower cumulative mortality from circulatory diseases in Montreal Jews (CM = 0.139, 0.043 versus 0.203, 0.125 in Israeli Jews and 0.199, 0.081 in Canadians, in males and females, respectively); these differences were all highly significant. Sex ratios for circulatory deaths were lowest in Israel (1.63), highest in Montreal (3.23) and intermediate in Canadians (2.47). Among men, the circulatory diseases mortality ratio for Canadians versus Montreal Jews was 1.43, and 1.46 between Israeli and Montreal Jews; in women, these ratios were 1.87 and 2.90, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the mortality pattern characteristic of Israeli Jews is not a universal Jewish phenomenon and may be affected by modifiable environmental factors. Similar studies conducted in other Jewish communities would aid in confirming these observations."
16902386,0,a,"BACKGROUND: With the widespread dissemination of the Internet throughout the world of health, it would be relevant to report on current knowledge about health information search on the Internet from the consumers' standpoint. METHODS: We conducted a bibliographical research over the past five years and distinguished between international and French studies. RESULTS: For a long time, the (mostly US) studies have been merely descriptive. The studies highlight that the factors associated with health searches on the Internet are similar to the factors underlying the digital divide. Consumer searches are deemed efficient although search skills are comparatively below standard. Attempts are underway to set up tools, circulate them widely, and ensure better quality information on the Internet. However, comprehension and literacy are still issues in some social groups. Regarding the impact on consumer health per se, a (positive) effect of the Internet seems to emerge but research should be continued. CONCLUSION: Many of the behaviors, uses or limits addressed in this paper pertain to any information search on the Internet but other problems or differences also occur in the specific area of health. Longitudinal investigations are needed, specifically to gain deeper insight into the impacts we have addressed, while rolling out a comprehensive approach to the temporal evolution of user practices and experiences. Specifically, the central issue is still to determine how (and for whom) the Internet alters information search behaviors and, in fine, to what extent this affects health behaviors and the recourse to healthcare."
18631388,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Health professionals, policy-makers and researchers need to be able to explore potential associations between prevalence rates and quality of care with a range of possible determinants including socio-economic deprivation and morbidity levels to determine the impact of commissioning and service delivery. In the UK, data in England are only available nationally at practice postcode level. In Scotland, such data are available based on an aggregate of the practices population's postcodes. The use of data assigned to the practice postcode may underestimate the association between ill health and income deprivation. Here, we report on the impact of using data assigned to the practice population by comparing analyses using English and Scottish data. RESULTS: Income deprivation based on data assigned to the practice postcode under-estimated deprivation compared to using income deprivation data assigned to the practice population for the five least deprived deciles, and over-estimated deprivation for the five most deprived deciles. The biggest differences were found for the most deprived decile. A similar trend was found for limiting long-term illness (LLTI). Differences between the QOF prevalence rates of the least and most deprived deciles using practice postcode data were similar (0.2% points or less) in England and Scotland for 8 out of 10 clinical domains. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences in the prevalence rate between the least and most deprived deciles increase for all clinical domains. A similar trend was again found for LLTI. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences for population achievement increase for all CHD quality indicators with the exception of beta-blockers (CHD10). With practice postcode assigned deprivation, significant differences between the least and most deprived deciles were found for 2 out 8 indicators, compared to 5 using practice population assigned deprivation. For LLTI differences between the lowest and most deprived deciles increased for all indicators when ill health assigned to the practice population was used. CONCLUSION: We have found, through comparing deprivation and ill health data assigned to either the practice postcode or the practice population postcode in Scotland, that analyses based on practice postcode assigned data under-estimated the relationship between deprivation and ill health for both prevalence and quality care. Given the importance of understanding the effect of deprivation and ill health on a range of determinants related to health care, policy makers should ensure that practice population data are available and used at national level in England and elsewhere where possible."

10024209,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Childhood diarrhoea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Nicaragua. Amongst the risk factors for its transmission are 'poor' hygiene practices. We investigated the effect of a large number of hygiene practices on diarrhoeal disease in children aged <2 years and validated the technique of direct observation of hygiene behaviour. METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was carried out in a rural zone of Nicaragua. From the database of a previously conducted case-control study on water and sanitation 172 families were recruited, half of which had experienced a higher than expected rate of diarrhoea in their children and the other half a lower rate. Hygiene behaviour was observed over two mornings and diarrhoea incidence was recorded with a calendar, filled out by the mother, and collected every week for 5 months. RESULTS: Of 46 'good' practices studied, 39 were associated with a lower risk of diarrhoea, five were unrelated and only for two a higher risk was observed. Washing of hands, domestic cleanliness (kitchen, living room, yard) and the use of a diaper/underclothes by the child had the strongest protective effect. Schooling (>3 years of primary school) and better economic position (possession of a radio) had a positive influence on general hygiene behaviour, education having a slightly stronger effect when a radio was present. Individual hygiene behaviour appeared to be highly variable in contrast with the consistent behaviour of the community as a whole. Feasible and appropriate indicators of hygiene behaviour were found to be domestic cleanliness and the use of a diaper or underclothes by the child. CONCLUSION: A consistent relationship between almost all hygiene practices and diarrhoea was detected, more schooling producing better hygiene behaviour. The high variability of hygiene behaviour at the individual level requires repeated observations (at least two) before and after the hygiene education in the event one wants to measure the impact of the campaign on the individual."

The provider model demonstrates the critical role played by provider perceptions, which are influenced more by work environment than by client problems."
18272938,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential risk factors for developing complications and their magnitude during the antenatal period. METHODOLOGY: The data used in this paper came from a prospective survey in rural areas of Bangladesh conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Research for Promotion of Essential and Reproductive Health and Technologies (BIRPERHT) between November 1992 and December 1993. The differential patterns were analyzed for respondents' selected characteristics, and multivariate analysis was performed employing logistic regression and proportional hazards models for life-threatening and high-risk complications during pregnancy. RESULTS: For life-threatening complications during pregnancy, several factors emerged as potential risk factors, such as number of the pregnancy, age at marriage, duration of pregnancy, economic status and history of anemia prior to the index pregnancy. The last two covariates were associated only in the proportional hazards. Potential risk factors for high-risk complications during pregnancy were level of education, age at marriage, wanted pregnancy, duration of pregnancy and economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Health planners and policy makers in developing countries are trying to facilitate health services at the doorsteps of rural people. Our findings will help them understand the magnitude and underlying determinants of maternal morbidities and help their health planning process to reduce both life-threatening and high-risk complications during the antenatal period. Early age at marriage needs to be prevented through encouragement of girls' education as well as through increased social awareness programs. An effective quick referral mechanism should be developed to provide emergency services to high risk-groups. Finally, the importance of additional food supplements needs to be promoted during antenatal care visits as well as through mass media in order to reach people living in remote areas of rural Bangladesh."
12573077,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: With the aim of diagnosing the nutritional status and nutritional social-economic determinants in children aged 0-59 months, 2194 children were studied in the three Health Districts of the city of Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained through a random sampling survey performed in the city's vaccination centres. Variables collected were maternal schooling, family income, dwelling's connection to safe water, dwelling's sewage connection, birthweight and the anthropometric indicators height/age (H/A; for stunting), weight/height (W/H; for wasting) and weight/age (W/A; for underweight). Undernutrition risk factors were identified with the help of logistic regression models for the age ranges 0-12 and 13-36 months. RESULTS: Stunting and underweight levels were found to be above those of the NCHS reference, although, in general, at levels better than those frequently found in Third World countries. Low birthweight prevalence in the city was 9%, also above common levels in more developed countries. Undernutrition risks were, in general, higher for the younger age range. The variables family income, maternal schooling, water connection and birthweight could be characterized as important undernutrition risk factors, being most noticeable the effects of family income and birthweight both for the '0-12 months' and for the 'above 13 months' age ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Although the city's problems are mostly concentrated on chronic undernutrition, more attention should be given to children's birthweight deficits, which appear to have effects on children's growth that extend for years after birth."
16162117,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life is a popular measure of outcomes and its widespread use has led to recent calls for a better understanding of the construct, emphasizing the need to build a substantial body of knowledge around what determines perceptions of life quality. Three widely reported and used conceptual principles are examined in this study. METHODS: Self-ratings of life quality and three likely determinants at an individual level (stress), an interactional level (social support) and a community level (neighbourhood belonging) were used. The study involved two groups of young adults from an urban community, one identified as having an intellectual disability (ID). RESULTS Young adults with ID rated their satisfaction with health significantly higher and intimacy and community involvement lower than the comparison group. Social support emerged as the strongest predictor of life satisfaction across both groups. CONCLUSION: The conceptual principles of subjective quality of life provide a useful framework to discuss findings and to stimulate further research."
9801018,1,a,"There are no recent population-based data on the prevalence of hearing loss in older adults using standard audiometric testing. The population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study was designed to measure the prevalence of hearing loss in adults aged 48-92 years, residing in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Hearing thresholds were measured with standardized protocols using pure-tone air- and bone-conduction audiometry in sound-treated booths. The examination also included an otoscopic evaluation, screening tympanogram, and a questionnaire on hearing-related medical history, noise exposure, other potential risk factors, and self-perceived hearing handicap. Of the 4,541 eligible people, 3,753 (82.6%) participated in the hearing study (1993-1995). The average age of participants was 65.8 years, and 57.7% were women. The prevalence of hearing loss was 45.9%. The odds of hearing loss increased with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.88 for 5 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-1.97) and were greater for men than women (OR = 4.42, 95% CI 3.73-5.24). The male excess of hearing loss remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, education, noise exposure, and occupation (OR = 3.65). These results demonstrate that hearing loss is a very common problem affecting older adults. Epidemiologic studies are needed to understand the genetic, environmental, and sex-related determinants of age-related hearing loss and to identify potential intervention strategies."
7837959,1,a,"This paper has two purposes. It first prefaces a symposium titled ""Exercise adherence and behavior change: prospects, problems, and future directions."" The symposium describes the progress made during the past 5 years toward understanding the adoption and maintenance of physical activity and exercise. Specifically, research is discussed that has tested the applicability to physical activity of four psychological models of behavior: Reasoned Action, Planned Behavior, Social-Cognitive Theory, and the Transtheoretical Model of stages of change. Recent exercise interventions in clinical/community settings also are discussed to illustrate how theoretical models can be implemented to increase and maintain exercise. The second purpose of this paper is to provide a brief summary of the contemporary literatures on the determinants of physical activity and interventions designed to increase and maintain physical activity. The summary focuses on the measurement problems that have limited the advances made in theory and application in these areas of research. Progress toward resolving the measurement problems during the past 5 years is contrasted with earlier scientific consensus."
19938924,0,a,"Alcohol intoxication is a risk factor for being a perpetrator or victim of sexual coercion. Environmental factors (e.g., misperception of social cues), as well as dispositional factors (e.g., personality, gender), are believed to play an important role in linking alcohol consumption and sexual coercion. Sixty-three participants, chosen on the basis of being high or low on scales of hypermasculinity (men) or hyperfemininity (women), were randomly assigned to either an alcohol or nonalcohol condition. After viewing a video of an ambiguous heterosexual interaction, participants responded to questions assessing their accuracy of recall of cues from the interaction, positive bias in their recall of cues, and expectancies regarding 1) the future sexual behavior of the characters in the video and 2) their own conduct if they were in a similar situation. Alcohol was negatively related to accuracy in recall and positively related to the belief that the characters in the video would engage in sexual intercourse (both volitionally and forced). Gender was also important as women were less accurate in recalling cues and intoxicated women evinced a positive bias for cue recall. Traits of hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity were not robust predictors. Hypermasculine men did, however, endorse a substantially higher likelihood that they would have sexual intercourse if in a similar situation. Findings are placed in the context of potential preventive interventions."
9427096,1,a,"AIM: The objective of this study was to examine service utilization figures among a representative sample of demented patients and to determine whether sociodemographic and health-related variables are associated with care utilization. METHOD: The study population was derived from a population-based, two-stage cross-sectional study in The Netherlands and consisted of 102 demented subjects. Four levels of care intensity were used: level 1, no use of professional care; level 2, use of one or more types of professional care by community-dwelling subjects; level 3, residential living in homes for the aged; level 4, long-term care in specialized nursing homes. Sociodemographic variables and variables related to mental and physical health, functional dependency and severity of dementia were studied as determinants of levels of care. RESULTS: Eighty-two per cent of the study subjects used one or more types of formal care and 55% were institutionalized. Multivariate analysis yielded age, severity of dementia, somatic disorders, dependency in terms of ADL and martial status as predictors of higher levels of care. Sets of predictors differed across different care levels. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the importance of the social network and the relevance of general medical treatment and an active approach towards decreasing the impact of ADL dependency in demented subjects."
15885866,0,a,"Time preferences for health has a role in informing discounting practice in economic evaluation of health care interventions. Yet virtually no empirical evidence on time preferences for health are available for sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this paper are therefore to estimate time preferences for health in Tanzania, and to explore the relationship between time preferences for one's own private health and for others health. Determinants of time preference rates are also explored. A sample of the general population participated, and each person was asked to indicate the maximum duration of more distant ill-health they would be willing to accept in return for a specified delay in the onset of the condition. People were randomised to answer either questions in the context of their own health or in the context of others health. Estimations were done using clustered least squares regression with robust standard errors. The implied mean and median discount rates were 0.07 and 0.058, respectively. Time preferences for one's own and others' health--conceptualised as social health--seem to be roughly the same in this sample, but people seem to discount the most severe health condition at a significantly lower rate than the least severe condition."
9049796,1,a,"This case-control study (n = 100 dental patients, matched for age and sex) investigated the role of life-events in periodontitis. Data collected included life events, tobacco use, oral health behaviours and socio-demographics. The results of conditional simple logistic regression analysis showed that periodontitis was associated with the negative impact of life-events (p < 0.01), the number of negative life-events (p < 0.05), high levels of dental plaque (p < 0.01), tobacco smoking (p < 0.01) and being unemployed (p < 0.05). These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for oral health behaviour and socio-demographic variables, but not tobacco smoking (p > 0.05). Marital status became statistically significant after adjusting for the other variables (p < 0.05). A model is suggested to explain the pathways through which life events may affect periodontal health. It was concluded that psychosocial factors and oral health risk behaviours cluster together as important determinants of periodontitis."
8816208,1,a,"In order to design injury-preventive programmes aimed at parents, an understanding of injury-preventive behaviour is essential. Questionnaires were obtained from 870 mothers of 3, 4 and 9-year-olds. The perceived social norm and other determinants for injury-preventive behaviour were analysed using three multivariate logistic regression models. The final logistic models classified 73.2-82.7% of respondents correctly. Perceived norms of relatives and friends were found to be the most important determinants of mothers' injury-preventive behaviour. Injury-preventive behaviour could neither be explained by mother's perception of injury risks, nor by the perceived norms of professionals within child health care and schools. This study indicates that in order to design injury-prevention programmes, an understanding of social norms is crucial."
19740642,0,a,"Wastes, which are the by-products of consumption, are a growing problem in the urban and peri-urban areas of the Lake Victoria region largely due to high urban population growth rates, consumption habits, low collection rates and hence waste accumulation. Whereas the biodegradable proportion is high and could be reutilized, a few have tapped the economic potential of this waste. This study was conducted to explore the potential alternatives and determinants of waste separation and utilization among urban and peri-urban households in the Lake Victoria crescent. A random sample of households in five urban and peri-urban areas of the crescent were selected and surveyed. Logit models were used to establish the factors influencing waste separation and utilization in urban and peri-urban areas of the lake crescent. Results indicate that, gender, peer influence, land size, location of household and membership of environmental organization explain household waste utilization and separation behaviour. Campaigns for waste separation and reuse should be focused in the peri-urban areas where high volumes of wastes are generated and accumulate. Social influence or pressure should be used to encourage more waste reuse and separation."
10724741,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: Determining the predictors of demand for emergency prehospital care can assist ambulance services in undertaking policy and planning activities. HYPOTHESIS: Demand for prehospital care can be explained by demographic, health status, and economic determinants. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design to investigate the association of demographic, health status, and insurance factors with the use of prehospital, ambulance care. Core data items including age, gender, marital status, country of origin, triage score, diagnosis, time of presentation, method of arrival, and patient disposition were collected for every patient who presented at the Emergency Department of the study hospital over a four-month period. Ambulance usage was analysed using Poisson regression. RESULTS: For the 10,229 patients surveyed, only a small number were triaged as having the highest level of urgent medical need (0.8%), but the majority of these used prehospital emergency medical care (90.2%). Predictors of ambulance use included age > 65 years (Prevalence Ratio [PR] = 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.35-3.63), being married or in a de-facto relationship (PR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.60-0.79) or divorced, separated, or widowed (PR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-0.98), triage score level 1 or 2 (PR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.68-2.28), or triage score level 3 (PR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.38-1.72), diagnosis involving either mental (PR = 4.29; 95% CI: 1.84-10.01), nervous (PR = 2.74; 95% CI: 1.19-6.31) or trauma (PR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.03-5.27) conditions, and insurance status (PR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.40-1.71). Ethnicity, gender, and time of day were not associated with usage. CONCLUSION: Demand for ambulance services can be predicted by a number of demographic, medical status, and insurance variables. Age and triage levels are key influences on demand for ambulance services. Ambulance insurance status provides an economic incentive to use ambulance services regardless of the urgency of the medical condition."
1737808,1,a,"There has been a dramatic increase in age at marriage for women in a rural area of north India. Age at marriage rose from under 12 years before 1930 to about 19 years in 1988, mainly as a result of socioeconomic development and advances in education of women."
16954510,0,a,"ISSUES: The Health Care Quality Indicator (HCQI) Project of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is aimed at developing a set of indicators for comparing the quality of health care across OECD member countries, requires a balanced conceptual framework that outlines the main concepts and domains of performance that should be captured for the current and subsequent phases of the project. ADDRESSING THE ISSUES: This article develops a conceptual framework for the OECD's HCQI Project. It first argues that developing such a framework should start by addressing the question, 'performance of what-and to what ends?' We identify at least two different major classes of frameworks: (i) health and (ii) health care performance frameworks, both of which are in common use. For the HCQI, we suggest a conceptual framework that is largely a purposeful modification of the existing performance frameworks and which is driven by the health determinants model. CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual basis for performance frameworks can be traced back to the health determinants model. A health performance framework takes a broader, societal or public health view of health determination, whereas a health care performance takes a narrower, mostly clinical or technical view of health care in relation to health (needs). This article proposes an HCQI framework that focuses on the quality of health care, maintains a broader perspective on health and its other determinants, and recognizes the key aims of health policy."
1890782,1,a,"There are two different views on gathering information about self. According to ""self-assessment"" view, individuals choose tasks that are diagnostic about themselves, regardless of self-esteem implications. On the other hand, according to ""self-enhancement"" view, individuals choose tasks that are diagnostic only when they have positive self-esteem implications. Present research tested these predictions in Japanese college students, using for tasks with high or low diagnosticity of success and failure. In subjects with low uncertainty of self-esteem, task preference increased with diagnosticity of success and diagnosticity of failure. This was consistent with self-assessment view. However, in subjects with high uncertainty of self-esteem, task preference didn't increase with diagnosticity of failure. In subjects with high self-esteem, task preference is high with high diagnosticity of failure than that of subjects with low self-esteem. The results suggest large individual differences in gathering information about self. They also suggest that not only self-esteem but also uncertainty of self-esteem should be considered in studies of self-enhancement motivation."
14624964,0,a,"The purpose of this investigation was to identify determinants of alcohol consumption based on a number of demographic and psychosocial variables in a group of pregnant women at risk for alcohol consumption. Data were collected on a sample of 232 pregnant females who agreed to participant in a multistate alcohol prevention intervention. The variables of interest included demographic measures of race, age, education, marital status, health status, employment status and if they had been involved in physical abuse during the past year. Additionally, psychosocial variables were collected on social support, family functioning, mental health and illicit drug use. The dependent variables of interest were any alcohol use during the pregnancy and an abuse measure that was based on a composite score generated from questions related to problems associated with alcohol behavior. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to see if the independent variables (demographic and psychosocial variables) were predictive of any alcohol use. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to ascertain if the independent measures were predictive of alcohol abuse. The results showed that race, age, physical abuse and to a lesser extent health were associated to any alcohol use and alcohol abuse. The findings with the psychosocial variables were not as robust. Nevertheless, problematic psychiatric and drug use composite scores were associated with alcohol abuse."

17824939,0,a,"AIM: This paper is a report of a study to identify the determinants of physical activity (PA) in patients with venous leg ulcers to develop recommendations for behavioural interventions aimed at enhancing physical activity. BACKGROUND: Physical activity promotes wound healing and prevents the recurrence of wounds in venous patients with leg ulcers. Many patients with leg ulcers, however, have a sedentary lifestyle. METHOD: A random sample of 25 patients from two clinics were interviewed in 2003 using a combination of prestructured and open-ended questions. All these patients were being treated at an outpatient dermatology clinic and had a leg ulcer with venous or mixed aetiology at the time of the interview or in the month prior to the interview. FINDINGS: Only nine of the 25 patients (36%) reported sufficient levels of moderate strenuous physical activity, defined as 30 minutes a day on at least 5 days a week. The results show limited knowledge about the relationship between physical activity and leg ulceration, and low self-efficacy for increasing physical activity. In addition, multi-morbidity, pain and social support were identified as main determinants of physical activity. CONCLUSION: Suggestions for improving physical activity levels include influencing knowledge, beliefs and self-efficacy. Patient's individual physical limitations, pain, adequate footwear and social support should be taken into account. Programmes offered by specialized dermatology nurses to stimulate physical activity might fulfil patient needs and help enhance physical activity levels."
19678974,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To assess anaemia prevalence and correlated social and biological determinants among pregnant women in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (oPt). DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey conducted among pregnant women attending/accessing UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) health centres in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in September and October 2006. SETTING: Fifty-five UNRWA health centres in the oPt (eighteen in the Gaza Strip and thirty-seven in the West Bank). SUBJECTS: A random sample of 1740 pregnant women. RESULTS: Overall anaemia prevalence was 38.6 % (95 % CI 36.3, 40.9 %). A substantial difference in anaemia prevalence was observed between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (44.9 % v. 31.1 %, respectively), as well as a significant increase in anaemia prevalence in the Gaza Strip compared with an Agency-wide survey conducted in 2004 (44.9 % v. 35.7 %, respectively). Anaemia prevalence was found to increase with age, parity and trimester of gestation. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia still appears to be a public health problem among pregnant women in spite of UNRWA interventions. The West Bank shows prevalence rates similar to those observed in neighbouring countries, while the Gaza Strip has higher rates. Prevalence rates of anaemia among pregnant Palestinian women are more than two times higher than those observed in Europe."
1966685,1,a,"Treatment of alcohol problems typically focuses on the cessation of drinking. Although cessation is necessary and important to achieving sobriety, this article suggests that maintenance of sobriety is a crucial, but oft ignored, component of effective treatment. Alcohol relapse is discussed in the context of aftercare treatment employing a relapse prevention approach. Within this model, relapse is not automatically defined as a treatment failure but as an opportunity for intervention and the interruption of the relapse process. Determinants and predictors of relapse are discussed, and assessment and intervention strategies provided. A case study illustrates the components of the relapse process and the interventions employed to maintain continued sobriety."
12815083,0,a,"Racial and ethnic disparities in health care continue to be a major impediment to improving the health of many communities in the United States. Efforts must be directed at the multiple social, economic, and historic determinants of health disparities. In addition, health care providers must be aware of these determinants and must have the tools to address them in their individual relationships with patients. This article describes a partnership that arose out of the mutual recognition by a community organization and public hospital of the need to (a) teach physicians how to recognize the root causes of health disparities, (b) improve their cross-cultural understanding and communication, and (c) enhance their awareness of the capacity of community resources to positively impact their patients' lives."
9674763,1,a,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are common degenerative disorders in the elderly. Most AD patients are cared for at home by family members, usually elderly spouses. Although caregiving is associated with significant psychological and physical morbidity, there are wide individual differences among caregivers in how well they adapt to caregiving demands. In addition, recent data suggest that caregiver variables can be important determinants of AD patient institutionalization and that AD patients living with highly distressed caregivers may exhibit higher frequencies of behavioral problems and agitation than those living with less distressed caregivers. Predictors of caregiver outcome, predictors of institutionalization, and the effect of the caregiver on the course and symptomatology of dementia are described. A model of assessment and intervention for the physician, referral processes, and resources for the caregiver are presented."
1417626,1,a,"This study explored family factors associated with Expressed Emotion (EE) in families with a member diagnosed with schizophrenia. Drawing on an attributional model of expressed emotion it was predicted that high EE relatives would have less knowledge of the illness and would attribute negative symptoms to the personality, rather than the illness, of the sufferer. Thirty-one caregivers of schizophrenic patients were interviewed. Results indicated that EE status was related to knowledge, coping and causal attributions of negative symptoms. Low EEs, as compared with High EEs, tended to have more knowledge of the illness and to cope better with the patient, and were less likely to attribute the cause of negative symptoms to the sufferer's personality. Support was therefore obtained for the utility of an attributional model in attempting to understand the determinants of levels of EE."
18095183,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: General practitioners and pharmacists do not properly educate their patients about the disadvantages of benzodiazepines. In order to increase and improve education, this study will investigate which psychological factors (i.e., beliefs, outcome expectation, social norm and self-efficacy) predict the intention to educate. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in which 339 general practitioners and 149 pharmacists in the Netherlands completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: The Results show that the above-mentioned factors play an important role in forming intentions to educate. However, differences exist between general practitioners and pharmacists. CONCLUSION: General practitioners and pharmacists intend to educate in cases where they think that benzodiazepines have well-defined disadvantages, when the education they undertake leads to success, when they feel pressure to educate from their surroundings and when they are capable of educating. Implications for practice These findings contribute to a better understanding of patient education and are of great value in developing new interventions to improve education."
11063059,0,a,"This study examines the effectiveness of the PSI/PMSC Horizon Jeunes youth-targeted social marketing program for improving adolescent reproductive health in urban Cameroon. The program targeted adolescents through peer education, youth clubs, mass media promotion, and behavior change communications. After about 13 months of intervention, knowledge of the program was nearly universal, and the majority of youths had direct contact with the program. Program effectiveness is examined using a quasi-experimental research design with a preintervention and postintervention survey in an intervention and comparison site. The intervention had a significant effect on several determinants of preventive behavior, including awareness of sexual risks, knowledge of birth control methods, and discussion of sexuality and contraceptives. The intervention increased the proportion of female youths who reported using oral contraceptives and condoms for birth control. However, condom use is not yet consistent. Although the proportion of young men who reported using condoms for birth control also increased, this change could not be attributed to the intervention. Although this short intervention successfully increased the reported use of various birth control methods, including condoms, there is no evidence that the intervention increased use of condoms for STD prevention of sexually transmitted diseases."
17896745,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To describe community-based stakeholders' views of how safe and responsive care ""makes a difference"" to health and well-being for pregnant and parenting Aboriginal people. Community-based stakeholders included community members, providers of health and social care, and health care and community leaders. METHODS: A postcolonial standpoint, participatory research principles and a case-study design were used to investigate two Aboriginal organizations' experiences improving care for pregnant and parenting Aboriginal people. Data were collected through researcher field notes, exploratory interviews and small group discussions with purposively selected community-based leaders, members and providers. Data were analyzed using an interpretive descriptive method. RESULTS: Community participants' views of ""making a difference"" emphasized: recognizing relevant outcomes of care; acknowledging progress over time; and using a strengths-based approach in which providers appreciate individuals' efforts and the challenges of their contextual circumstances. DISCUSSION: ""Making a difference"" to pregnant and parenting Aboriginal people would facilitate Aboriginal peoples' efforts to tackle the deeply embedded socio-historical determinants of well-being and capacity, and thus shift priorities for care upstream to focus on such determinants. Such a paradigm for care would integrate multiple perspectives on desirable outcomes within local frameworks based on values and priorities of Aboriginal parents, while also incorporating the benefits and wisdom of existing yet further downstream approaches to care. CONCLUSION: Design and evaluation of care based on community values and priorities and using a strengths-based approach can improve early access to and relevance of care during pregnancy and parenting for Aboriginal people."
12355987,0,a,"The main clinical presentation of osteoporosis is fracture and its consequences. However a number of diseases and factors can induce bone loss and increase the risk of fracture. Therefore the clinical approach should be initially directed to exclude secondary osteoporosis. Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures; they are characterized by back pain, typical physical changes such as kyphosis and height loss, functional impairment and social decline. On the other hand, hip fracture is the most severe consequence of osteoporosis, because of its higher morbility and mortality. The main pathogenetic determinants of hip fracture are represented by both bone loss and several factors contributing to fall in the elderly. Moreover, a number of conditions are responsible for the high mortality rate following hip fracture. Colles' fracture is rarely hospitalized; however, most patients complain a complex algodystrophic syndrome which impairs the quality of life."
1506099,1,a,"In a rural cohort of 625 children registered from 1981 to 1983 in 10 villages of K.V. Block, Varanasi, 196 children were assessed for physical growth, development, intelligence and concept development between 1 and 3 years of age. Home environment was also assessed using Caldwell Home inventory. These rural children remained below 3rd centile of NCHS standard for weight, height, skull and mid-arm circumferences throughout the study. Malnourished children scored poorly in all the areas of development, i.e., motor, adaptive, language and personal social, 9% in Grade I and 16.6% children in Grade II + III had IQ less than 79 (inferior). Concept for color shape and size was poorly developed in malnourished children. Maternal involvement and stimulation was strongly associated with better behavior development and intelligence. Multiple regression analysis showed that the effect of home environment on development and intelligence was of a higher magnitude as compared to status and family variables and nutritional status during 1-3 years of age."
18030822,0,a,"BACKGROUND: In 2006, the city of Milwaukee ranked worse than any Wisconsin county for health outcomes and worse than all but 1 county for health determinants. METHODS: To further examine disparities in health, Milwaukee city ZIP codes were stratified into 3 groups (lower, middle, and upper) by socioeconomic status (SES). Health determinants (15 measures) and health outcomes (2 measures) were compared across these ZIP code groups, and to the rest of Wisconsin. RESULTS: The risk ratio for the lower SES group in comparison to the upper SES group was at least 2.0 for 5 of the 17 measures examined, and was at least 1.5 for 13 of the 17 measures. The upper SES group in Milwaukee, while the healthiest in the city, was worse than the state average in 6 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Large health disparities within the city of Milwaukee are associated with geographic regions of differing socioeconomic status. As the state's largest urban center, Milwaukee's relatively poor health and significant health disparities have a considerable impact on the overall health of the state. To improve population health in Wisconsin, substantial efforts and resources are needed to address these disparities, and their related upstream factors."

The effect of level of education is negative. That is, it increases the age of entry into marriage. However, the size of the effect is small and seems limited to the passage from youth to adulthood, because the longer time the woman spends in the educational system increases the age at which she feels herself ready to marry. As far as the timing of the first child, it is almost independent of educational attainment, once marital status is taken into account."" (SUMMARY IN FRE AND ITA)"
19253847,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To undertake a research into the maternal health care services and its determinants in poor regions in Sichuan province. METHODS: Stratified cluster sampling strategy was employed to select the participants who had pregnancy since 1998 to complete the interview administered ""maternal health care questionnaire"". A total of 462 women participated in the study. RESULTS: Of the 462 women, 387 received prenatal care services, the most common maternal health care services. Only 144 women got post-natal visits at least once. Maternal age and education had significant impacts on the use of maternal health care services including prenatal examinations and birth in hospitals (P<0.05). Low-income (< Yen 1000) women used less maternal health care services than the high-income (> Yen 5000) women (P<0.05). The women who were covered by the cooperative medical insurance scheme and poverty alleviation scheme used more prenatal care and post-natal services and were more likely to deliver babies in hospitals than those who paid the services entirely out of pocket (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Poor social and economical situation has a detrimental impact on the use of maternal health care services, which might be associated with poor education and low financial capacities of the women."
10990339,0,a,"China's dual employment system plays a crucial role in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV-related safe and unsafe sexual practices among young Chinese people. Social and psychological determinants of safe and unsafe sexual practices for HIV infection among young people in Sichuan, China were examined. Our findings indicate that changes in China's social structure and employment system impact upon the social contextual involvement and socio-sexual practice of young Chinese people. The findings in the study suggest that the employment-related contextual involvement was a major predictor in the relationships between demography, information, and psychological risk-taking factors on one hand and the people's safe and unsafe sexual practices on the other. Self-employed people (officially called 'getihu') were more likely than the state-employed people to engage in unprotected sex with casual sexual partners. As China undergoes social restructuring and many state-employed people are laid off, the risk may also extend into the broader non-self-employed population as more state-employed people become involved not only in the self-employed getihu's socioeconomic activities but also in their unconventional socio-sexual practices. Collective vulnerability to STI and HIV, due to the current socio-sexual practices of the getihu young people, has created a new frontier for STI and HIV prevention in today's China, as well as demonstrating the importance of collective action with STI and AIDS prevention strategies within relevant social and sub-cultural contexts."
8211276,1,a,"Although regional differences in lung cancer mortality are likely to be attributable to regional differences in tobacco smoking, studies in various countries found only weak relationships. This paper aimed at explaining regional differences in lung cancer mortality in the Netherlands. In a first step, clues for the role of smoking were obtained from a detailed description of regional mortality differences. These differences were found to be strongly determined by cohort effects: they vary between birth cohorts, and have been stable for over 30 years. Regional mortality differences reflect a diffusion of the lung cancer epidemic from high-income regions to low-income regions. These findings are suggestive of a relationship with regional differences in trends in cigarette smoking. In a second step, by means of multiple regression analysis, mortality differences in 1980-84 were related to available data on cigarette smoking and two other possible risk factors: work in transport and manufacturing industry, and air contamination. The independent variables referred to the 1970s. Positive associations with various smoking measures were found for women, but for men the associations were weak or non-existent. Mortality differences among men 45-64 years were associated with work in transport and manufacturing industry. Strong associations with air contamination were found for men and women 65 years and older. Additional analysis showed that regional differences in lung cancer among old men were strongly associated with smoking in 1930, i.e. half a century before. Changes in the regional pattern of tobacco consumption between 1930 and 1970 explain why smoking in 1970 is not associated with mortality differences in the 1980s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
16365074,0,a,"Size at birth and early postnatal growth are determinants of adult height and BMI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of birth weight on body composition and fat distribution in a group of Spanish adolescents. Current body composition was assessed by both skinfold thickness and dual X-ray absorptiometry in 234 adolescents born at term (140 girls and 94 boys), now aged 13-18 y and living in the city of Zaragoza. Relative fat distribution was estimated using the ratio of the subscapular to triceps skinfolds (S:T). Birth weight and gestational age were assessed by a questionnaire. Birth weight was inversely associated with the S:T ratio (P < 0.05) in boys and directly associated with bone mass (P < 0.01) and fat-free mass (P < 0.05) in girls. This association was independent of factors such as age, Tanner stage, gestational age, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and height. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that impaired fetal growth, measured by birth weight, may be related to central fat distribution in boys and decreased bone and fat-free mass in girls."
8192221,1,a,"The author cites significant changes in the conduct of the psychiatric profession between the fourth and ninth decades of this century. Determinants of the changes included the impact of World War II, the National Mental Health Act of 1946, the evolution of multiple modes of psychotherapy, the move from a system of involuntary incarceration and treatment in public institutions to a voluntaristic and pluralistic system, the provision of public and private insurance support for office, outpatient, and inpatient psychiatric care, the resurgence of psychopharmacology, and the pursuit of research in biological and psychosocial fields. The social goals of the profession are also discussed."
8266845,1,a,"This study evaluates the ability of a four-factor psychosocial model to explain adolescent drug involvement. Subjects are a representative sample of seventh- and eighth-grade public school students. A cross-sectional sample of data was extracted from a multiyear longitudinal assessment of a statewide drug education program. Data were collected through administration of the Youth Life-Styles Inventory, a specially designed drug-involvement assessment instrument. The belief that substance use has both external (sociological) and internal (psychological) causes guided the selection of independent variables. Factor analysis was used to disclose the interrelated structures of the psychosocial variables. A four-factor model was produced offering a concise theoretical paradigm of the underlying psychosocial determinants of adolescent drug use. This model was regressed on two indexes of drug involvement. Findings should prove useful in policy formulation and design of adolescent drug education and treatment programs. The explanatory potency of the four-factor model should aid in the investigation of adolescent drug use. The results indicate the need for children to bond with peers, parents, and others who have drug-resistant attitudes, and with conventional institutions such as schools."
12320554,1,a,"""In the Netherlands, the social meaning of both marriage and cohabitation has changed. Cohabitation started as an alternative way of living, developed into a temporary phase before marriage, and finally became a strategy for moving into a union gradually.... This article addresses the question whether or not individual past and current life-course experiences become increasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into marriage across female birth cohorts, and yet become decreasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into cohabitation across female birth cohorts. This question is examined using a non-proportional hazard model. Empirical evidence supports this hypothesis strongly, in that both past determinants such as family size or religion and current life-course determinants such as work or education change in their impact on cohabitation and marriage across birth cohorts."""
17446793,0,a,"Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) has changed from a disease of middle-aged men in the late 1970s to a disease of elderly women in the 2000s. Most clinical studies during the past three decades have been conducted with men. Cardiac rehabilitation programmes were also developed with special regard to improving the rate of return to work in middle-aged men. The rehabilitation needs of older patients and women in particular have been largely neglected. The aim of this review is briefly to outline our present knowledge on gender issues in cardiac rehabilitation, and to specify barriers with regard to physical activities especially in (older) women. Coping with a cardiac event, women tend to minimize or play down the impact of their health situation and avoid burdening their social contacts. After a first cardiac event, women report greater psychological distress and lower self-efficacy and self-esteem. In addition, older age, lower exercise levels and reduced functional capacity or co-morbid conditions such as osteoporosis and urinary incontinence are barriers to physical activities in women with IHD. Recent studies on psychosocial intervention revealed less favourable results in women compared with men. These findings have not yet been well explained. This emphasizes our current lack of knowledge about the processes and determinants of successful psychosocial interventions in men and women with IHD. A large (European) trial on gender-specific coping styles, needs, and preferences of older women, and the effects of psychosocial intervention is proposed."
2344434,1,a,"Both dispositional and attributional perspectives on perceptions of control assume that people have some idea of outcome determinants. This, however, may not always be so. This study tested the hypothesis that pupils do not always understand the determinants of their learning outcomes, and that such a sense of unknown control will be associated with poor achievement in school. The study was unusual in that it tapped both dispositional control perceptions, using the new MMPCC, and causal attributions for success and failure in a school examination. Subjects were 186 10-year-old Israeli pupils of heterogeneous SES. Results confirmed that unknown control emerged as a distinct dimension of perceived control in both dispositional and attributional measures, and was consistently associated with poor achievement in school. Attributions of test outcomes to unknown causes were strongly related to dispositional unknown control, and were not affected by success or failure. In contrast, dispositional and attributional internality were unrelated, and did not predict achievement. It is argued that internal beliefs reflect internalised social-educational norms, and as a result have less impact on motivation than perceptions of unknown control. The implications of these findings for educational practice and motivational interventions are discussed."
19629855,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: This paper explores the presence of sex preference and its influence on contraceptive use among the Garo, a matrilineal community, of Bangladesh. METHODS: In this study, 223 currently married Garo women were interviewed, selected purposively from two districts of Bangladesh, where most of the Garo people live. A binary logistic regression model was fitted to explore the determinants of current use of contraceptives among the Garo community. RESULTS: About 80% of the Garo women were currently using contraceptive methods, which was much higher than the contraceptive prevalence at the national level (55.8%). However, the use of modern male methods was very low in that community. Regression analysis revealed that the strong preference for girls was a significant determinant of contraceptive use. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the Garo apply contraception more than the Bangladeshi community in general, their strong preference for girls may restrain its success. Family planning information can be designed so as not to challenge the matrilineal structure of the society and both spouses counselled together to promote also modern male methods."
12319425,1,a,"""In this paper we examined the interdistrict variations in mean age at marriage of males and females in Karnataka [India] in two points of time, 1971 and 1981, and also the possible factors influencing this variation....A multivariate analysis of the determinants of mean age at marriage in Karnataka showed that literacy rate, sex ratio of the population and percentage of villages electrified are important in explaining the regional and time variation in age at marriage of both sexes.... Our regression results indicated that a 10 per cent increase in female literacy rate is associated with approximately one-year increase in female age at marriage. However, neither the increase in female literacy nor the changes in the sex ratio of the population could explain all the increase in female age at marriage during 1971-81. This indirectly suggests that there was an increase in female age at marriage among all socio-economic groups."""
8966105,1,a,"Significant gains both for the individual patient and for the community can be made by preventing relapse and new depressive episodes. The depth of depression and the presence of other psychiatric problems are the most significant determinants of the duration of a depressive episode. The number of previous depressive episodes and age at first depression are the most significant determinants of the risk of future depression. However, the presence of interpersonal and social problems, other psychiatric or physical disorders, and the type of depression (e.g. depression as one ""pole' in a bipolar disorder, dysthymia) are also factors of importance. The aim of maintenance treatment (i.e., continued treatment after the patient's recovery) is to prevent recurrence of the depressive episode, whereas the purpose of preventive treatment is to impede the occurrence of new depressive episodes."
12511400,0,a,"A joint urban planning and public health perspective is articulated here for use, in health impact assessment. Absent a blueprint for a coherent and supportive structure on which to test our thinking, we are bound to fall flat. Such a perspective is made necessary by the sheer number of people living in cities throughout the world, the need for explicit attention to land use and transportation systems as determinants of population health, and the dearth of useful indicators of the built environment for monitoring progress. If explicit attention is not paid to the overarching goals of equality and democracy, they have little if any chance of being realized in projects, programs, and policies that shape the built environment and therefore the public's health."
19191176,0,a,"PURPOSE: International and national programs to control vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) among children in developing countries are reducing the magnitude but VADD still occurs in deprived populations. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for xerophthalmia in children aged 6-71 months living in slums in Pune, India in 2003. METHODS: Children were enrolled into a cross sectional study from randomly selected Anganwadis (kindergartens) in selected slums using proportional to size sampling. Parents/caregivers were interviewed by social workers about night blindness, risk factors for VADD at individual and household levels, intake of vitamin A rich foods, and history of vitamin A supplementation. Children were examined for signs of xerophthalmia by an ophthalmologist. Risk factors for xerophthalmia were explored using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: 1,589 children were examined (response rate 80.2%) 22 of whom had xerophthalmia, prevalence 1.32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.88%). There were no gender differences. Independent risk factors for xerophthalmia were having an illiterate mother [Odds ratio [OR]15.4 (95% CI 4.4-64.1)] and lack of a safe water supply [OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.5-5.1)]. Only 11.3 and 13.3% of children in different slums had taken vitamin A supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Xerophthalmia was at a level of public health significance in children living in slums in Pune. This study highlights the importance of female education and indicates that vitamin A supplementation and other approaches to control need to be improved in children living in deprived areas like urban slums."
11923901,0,a,"The purpose of this paper is to present a comparative analysis of the determinants of physical activity among adolescents in Taiwan and in the United States. Pender's Health Promotion Model (HPM) served as the theoretical framework for both studies (Pender, 1996). The major determinants of health behavior in the HPM are perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, activity-related affect, interpersonal influences, situational influences, commitment to a plan of action, and immediate competing demands. In Taiwan, 969 middle school students (55% males; 45% females) from Taipei provided data for the study. In the United States, the sample was collected from 286 late elementary and middle school students (48% males; 52% females). Results showed the gender differences in activity levels were apparent in the youths from both countries. In both Taiwanese and American youths, boys were more active than girls. Cross-cultural differences in the importance of barriers to physical activity emerged. Among Taiwanese adolescents, barriers did not emerge as a significant direct predictor of physical activity as they did among US adolescents. Perceived efficacy directly predicted physical activity among Taiwanese youths while it indirectly predicted physical activity and appeared to be mediated by beliefs regarding exercise benefits and barriers among American youths. In addition, the paths of effect for interpersonal influences were different when Taiwanese and US youths were compared. The findings from this paper have important and culturally-relevant information that can inform future physical activity intervention studies with diverse adolescents."
10886857,1,a,"Cases and controls were selected for this retrospective investigation of the social determinants of growth retardation, from a Height Census carried out in the 1989 school year,involving children attending the first grade of all public and private schools in Osasco (in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo, Brazil). The cases, totalling 125 children entering school aged 7-8 years old, were characterized by a height-for-age index below -2 z score of the NCHS/WHO reference. The controls, totalling 139 children entering school at the same age, were characterized by a height-for-age index above -1 z score. Socioeconomic variables such as family income, head-of-family's level of schooling, mother's schooling, environmental sanitation, and housing conditions were significant factors associated with the stunting process. Risk of linear growth retardation tended to be higher with lower social class (odds ratio = 7.3 for sub-proletariat vs. petit bourgeois; p < 0,001 for overall trend), suggesting the biological impact of Brazil's economic slowdown during the 1980s."
8089452,1,a,"The aim of this study was to identify the predisposing and enabling factors affecting mothers' hygiene behaviour in relation to childhood diarrhoeal diseases. Qualitative data were gathered by naturalistic observation of 12 mothers and focus group discussions involving 32 mothers. Mothers with children less than 2 years of age in both urban and rural areas of Suphanburi, a central province of Thailand, were sampled. Twelve local terms describing five different types of diarrhoea were identified. Childhood diarrhoea was classified into two groups depending upon perceived causes: contagious and preventable, and not contagious and unpreventable. To prevent diarrhoea in children, mothers reported that they avoid ""taboo"" food, avoid breastfeeding with ""hot"" milk and visit local healers for a herbal paste treatment that is applied to the child's throat. Most mothers did not wash their hands before preparing milk or after disposal of children's faeces. However, they did wash their hands after cleaning the child following the child's defecation, and after their own defecation. Our findings suggest that health education programmes should utilize local terminology and work to counter common misunderstandings regarding childhood diarrhoeal disease and its prevention. Knowledge of the predisposing and enabling factors identified in this study will assist in the development of effective implementation programmes."
18336442,0,a,"OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the context of sexual abstinence and identify potential determinants of abstinence in this population. DESIGN: Four focus groups. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Twenty-four, predominantly African American (88%) girls aged 14 to 19 years were recruited from urban health centers and youth development programs in Rochester, New York, between September and December 2006. DATA ANALYSIS: Content analysis was used to analyze the four verbatim transcripts. Using analytic induction, groups were compared and contrasted at the micro (within-group) and macro (between-group) levels to identify themes. RESULTS: Four themes were identified that provided insight into how and why these girls remain abstinent despite being in sexually active social climates. They focused on the following: self-respect (I'm worth it), impact of mothers (Mama says ... think before you let it go), influence of boys and other peers (Boys will be boys), and potential negative consequences of sex (Hold on, there's a catch). CONCLUSIONS: Developing interventions to maintain abstinence, delay onset of sexual activity, and promote protected first and subsequent sexual contact in abstinent girls are key to decreasing future sexual risk. These findings suggest opportunities to develop HIV prevention strategies tailored to the needs of abstinent girls."
8909112,1,a,"A comprehensive model of family influences on educational resemblance of siblings expands the traditional sibling pair model to a full sibship model in order to investigate how gender, gender composition of sibships, and a measure of ordinal position moderate the effect of social origins on educational attainments of siblings. One common family factor is sufficient to explain the variation of educational attainment among brothers and sisters. Although effects of social origins variables on brothers are larger than on sisters, the relative effects of measured social origins are virtually the same among sisters and brothers. The disparity between educational attainments of brothers and sisters persists across sex composition and family size. Ordinal position does not alter the effects of social origins on educational attainment nor does it directly affect educational attainment. Father's and mother's education are equally important for all siblings regardless of birth order, gender composition, and family size."
10186225,1,a,"It has been predicted that minimally invasive therapy will have dramatic consequences for the specialty of general surgery, as demonstrated by the diffusion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To investigate the determinants of the diffusion in Denmark of five laparoscopic technologies (cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, surgery for colon cancer, surgery for inguinal hernia and fundoplication), questionnaires on seventeen factors' influence on the adoption (stimulating or impeding) were sent to fifty-nine hospitals. Fifty hospitals (85%) responded. Overall, 98% adopted laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Denmark between 1991 and 1995, whereas the remainder of the technologies were adopted by 7-65% of hospitals performing these operations. Large and specialized hospitals were the earliest adopters. The factors, nature of technology (minimally invasive versus conventional), training (appropriate training courses), competition (between specialties and between hospitals) and media attention have stimulated the diffusion, whereas three budget factors (budget for investment, budget for operation and public regulation) usually had an impeding effect. Stimulating factors prevail for all laparoscopic technologies indicating that some guidance of the adoption and use of new health technologies might be necessary. In Denmark, one of the suggested health policies to secure timely guidance is the establishment of an early warning system."

In this study, members of a self-help group for the relatives of schizophrenia sufferers provided information through a mail survey, using standardized measures of psychological distress and burden, and severity of the sufferer's illness. Caregiver psychological distress was high compared with test norms, and the level of behavioral disturbance in the sufferer was found to contribute to caregiver distress after controlling for the caregiver's age, sex, and social supports. An unexpected finding was that those caring for female sufferers reported greater distress than those caring for males."
18384491,0,a,"Two studies were conducted among elite young judokas to examine (a) whether those who persisted in national training centers (n=52) were different from dropouts (n=52) in their perceptions of coach-, parent-, and peer-induced motivational climates, goal orientations, self-perceptions, perceived competence, and intention of dropping out, and (b) whether these variables varied during the persisting athletes' (n=82) first 2 years in these centers. Compared with persisting athletes, dropouts perceived the roles of coaches, parents, and peers as less task-involving, were less task-oriented, and intended more to drop. The association of peer-, coach-, and parent-induced task-involving climates predicted athletes' persistence. During the 2 years, persisting athletes' perceptions of coach-, parent-, and peer-induced task-involving climates decreased, while perceptions of a coach-induced ego-involving climate and the intention of dropping out increased in spite of more positive self-perceptions. Gender differences favoring males were observed for self-perceptions only. These results stress the importance for all the agents of the athletes' social environment to promote task-involving climates, because such climates appear to be naturally prone to degradation in the context of elite competition. The results also shed light on some high-level athletes' characteristics regarding motivational dispositions and self-concept."
10741579,0,a,"To identify the determinants of self-medication and antibiotics abuse by parents treating their children aged between 2 and 18 over the previous year, an investigation was conducted in Hefei City, China in April, 1995. A total of 1596 students from a kindergarten, a primary school and a high school were included in the study, and 1459 completed questionnaires were collected (the response rate: 91.4%). The results showed the rate of parental self-medication for their children in the sample was 59.4%. It increased with children's age; about 51% of children had received parental self-medication on six or more occasions during the 1-year period and 32.8% on four to five occasions; there were associations between parental self-prescribers and sources of medicine and severity of disease. The rate of antibiotics abuse was 35.7%. Logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant associations between self-medication and payment of the mother's medical fees by employers, severity of diseases as well as the mother's educational level."
21544449,1,a,"Lack of effective population screening programmes for digestive tract cancer makes a prompt diagnosis of symptomatic patients the primary option for early detection. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics and determinants of the interval between the first medical symptom and the first medical visit (ISV) in a sample of symptomatic patients of mid-low socioeconomic level admitted to hospital for a digestive tract cancer. During two years, 183 patients were personally interviewed with a structured questionnaire designed to elicit initial symptoms of digestive cancer. Fifty-seven percent consulted a physician during the first month after onset of symptoms, and over two-thirds did so within the first 2 months, but it took more than 3 months for 22.4% of the patients. In univariate analyses, the ISV was longer among patients illiterate, unemployed and in the lower social classes. The interval was also significantly longer when the physician-interviewer judged that the patient did not correctly identify the first symptom (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, the chance of a longer ISV was 2.8 times higher in men; 16 times higher in unemployed patients; 9 times higher in patients with a first symptom of the lower digestive tract; and it increased 8-fold in subjects who attributed no importance to the first manifestation (all p<0.05). In spite of virtually universal health coverage, social factors seemed to act as barriers to seeking medical help in a subgroup of patients. Their procrastination was also related to the nature of the initial symptoms. Achieving an early clinical detection of digestive cancers may be difficult in some segments of the population, and may require substantial improvements in access to and the efficiency of the health system."
19553025,0,a,"Socioeconomic determinants of injury have been associated with risk of burn in the UK and USA, but the relative significance of this impact is largely unknown across Canadian populations. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to risk of burn in the province of British Columbia (BC) and identify the extent to which these findings are generalizable across both urban and rural population groups. Measures of SES were based on province-wide comparisons using data obtained from the Canada Census using the Vancouver Area Neighbourhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX). Results illustrate that the effects of SES and increased injury risk are substantial, though the most pronounced variations were exhibited across each SES stratum for urban areas and with less demonstrable effect when itemized by injury type within rural areas. Although conservative, the results from this study illustrate that burns disproportionately affect populations of greater relative socioeconomic disadvantage and continued efforts to also address social inequities and their link to injury incidence is likely to be more effective than targeting individual behavior alone when trying to reduce and eliminate their occurrence."
16973642,0,a,"BACKGROUND: A systematic approach to examining associations among obesity and socio-demographic determinants, psychological problems, and mental disorders in epidemiological samples is missing. METHODS: Within the representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey and its Mental Health Supplement (GHS-MHS), 4181 subjects (age 18-65 years) took part in a physical examination (including measurement of body weight and height) and a standardized psychological interview (M-CIDI). Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)), somatic diseases, socio-economic variables, health-related quality of life (SF-36), and mental disorders (DSM-IV) were assessed. Data were analysed by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity was 18.5%. There was a strong association between obesity and somatic conditions, as well as to low socio-economic status (SES). No psychosocial disadvantages (e.g. regarding social relationships, impairment due to mental health problems, depressed feelings) for the obese individuals were found. With the exception of a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in obese men (12.5 versus 8.5%, OR = 1.53, CI = 1.06-2.21, disappearing when controlled for number of somatic conditions), obese persons showed no elevated rates of mental disorders. DISCUSSION: Obesity is associated with a low SES and some somatic disadvantages but not with other social or emotional disadvantages that have been often assumed to be very prevalent in that group. From the population-based perspective, obesity per se seems not to be associated with a higher risk for suffering from mental disorders, whereas relations between specific aspects of obesity and specific types of psychopathology still need further study."
17473623,0,a,"This study aimed to establish the determinants of health-related quality of life in a rural and an urban sample of Xhosa-speaking people with disability. The sample was a convenience sample and was identified through a 'snowballing' process initiated by enumerators who were all members of Disabled People South Africa. The Xhosa version of the EQ-5D was utilized and the visual analogue scale which ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) was used as the dependent measure. The sample consisted of 244 rural and 61 urban respondents, demonstrating a preponderance of physical disabilities. The urban sample reported more problems in each of the descriptor domains. The visual analogue scale score showed a bimodal distribution. The results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the presence of pain detracted most from health-related quality of life (-20%), followed by anxiety and depression (-10%), and difficulty with performance of usual activities (-10%). Rural participants, with the same impairment level, reported 8% poorer health-related quality of life. The mean visual analogue scale scores were low (in the 60s), and would indicate that the majority of people living with disability do not necessarily adapt to their functional limitations and continue to experience diminished health-related quality of life. The bimodal distribution, however, did indicate that some respondents enjoyed good health-related quality of life. There is a need to manage symptoms, particularly pain and depression, as these have a severe negative impact on health-related quality of life. The rural setting seemed to contribute to a worse perceived health-related quality of life. This effect needs to be factored in when evaluating programmes."

7996589,1,a,"The term ""gender role"" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ""gender identity"" was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."

19769587,0,a,"Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 has been shown to suppress the growth of a wide range of microbial plant pathogens as well as invertebrate pests such as root nematodes. Hydrogen cyanide, a secondary metabolite produced by the bacterium, has been credited as being one of the determinants of its biocontrol ability. The use of biocontrol agents against social insect pests such as termite Odontotermes obesus has limitations because of behavioural adaptations that include (1) removal of the pathogen when grooming by the termites and (2) isolation of infested members of the colony. In this study, we show that cyanide of bacterial origin may inhibit cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) of the termite respiratory chain and demonstrate that HCN-producing bacteria such as P. fluorescens can actually kill a macroscopic insect pest by cyanide poisoning. This ability of pseudomonad metabolites such as cyanide, which can bring about pest death by blocking respiration through inhibition of CCO rather than infection or predation, can potentially overcome the behavioural adaptations of social insect pests such as termites and represents an attractive option for insect pest management."
11823650,0,a,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to investigate how stroke rehabilitation professionals understand the concept of motivation and the ways that they use this concept in their clinical practice. METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured, in-depth interviews with the professionals working in the stroke unit of an inner-city teaching hospital in the UK. RESULTS: Motivation was a frequently used concept and was described as an important determinant of rehabilitation outcome. Motivation was attributed to patients on the basis of their demeanor (proactivity was equated with motivation, passivity with lack of motivation) and their compliance with rehabilitation (compliance was seen as indicative of motivation, noncompliance as a lack of motivation). These criteria were found to have blurred boundaries. The determinants of motivation were located partly in personality factors but also in social factors. Central among the social factors were aspects of the professionals' own behavior taken to positively and negatively affect motivation. Some professionals reported treating unmotivated patients differently from motivated ones, especially if these unmotivated patients were elderly. Motivation was described as a potentially dangerous label. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals are wary of the concept of motivation yet commonly use it in their clinical practice. The blurred boundaries of the criteria used to identify motivation mean that patients must strike a delicate balance between proactivity and compliance to avoid being categorized as unmotivated. The way the concept of motivation is used in clinical practice might have negative implications for patient care, eg, when reticent yet motivated patients are labeled unmotivated."

To explore these questions, this article reviews some of the relevant literature on culture and class in relation to health promotion, exploring issues foundational to the effectiveness of health-promotion programs and pertinent to delivering health-promotion interventions to ethnic, racial, and cultural minorities and poor populations.

Understanding determinants of such legislation may inform the development and passage of future policies. For this study, key-informant interviews were conducted with 16 legislators and staffers from 11 states in 2005-2006 to examine qualitative factors that enable and impede state-level childhood obesity prevention legislation. Commonly cited factors positively influencing the passage of childhood obesity prevention legislation included national media exposure, introduction of the policy by senior legislators, and gaining the support of key players including parents, physicians, and schools. Noteworthy barriers included powerful lobbyists of companies that produce unhealthy foods and misconceptions about legislating foods at schools. Although the total number of informants was modest, their valuable insights provide policymakers and practitioners with a set of enablers and barriers to be considered when pursuing state-level policy."

From recent research on adolescent fertility, findings that have particular relevance to school health or reflect new understandings of adolescent sexuality are summarized. In selected cases, prevention programs that build directly on an understanding of these risk factors are cited."
2030286,1,a,"A typology of the social climates of group residential facilities for older people was developed by a cluster analysis of seven social climate attributes obtained on a national sample of 235 nursing homes, residential care facilities, and congregate apartments. The analysis yielded six distinct types of social climate: Supportive, Self-Directed; Supportive, Well-Organized; Open Conflict; Suppressed Conflict; Emergent-Positive; and Unresponsive. Facility and resident characteristics were related to social climate type. In addition, the type of social climate was related to resident adaptation. Supportive, Self-Directed and Supportive, Well-Organized facilities had residents who rated higher in well-being and levels of self-initiated activities and who used fewer health services. A configural approach to describing social climates and their determinants and effects may help to develop more humanistic residential facilities and to better match individual residents to appropriate housing placements."
9414976,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the comparability of outpatients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and patients with IBS in primary care with regard to severity of complaints, perceived limitations, other aspects of the complaints, and sex differences. AIMS: To compare outpatients with IBS with primary care patients with IBS. PATIENTS: One hundred and nine patients with IBS were recruited from general practices in Amsterdam and 86 patients with IBS were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Hospital in Nijmegen. METHODS: Each patient completed a questionnaire on demographic variables, abdominal complaints, related complaints, and attributed causes of their abdominal complaints. The scores of the two groups were compared by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The outpatient group contained significantly more men, reported more severe abdominal pain, more frequent complaints, more interference with daily activities, and a higher degree of avoidance of activities (p < 0.01) than the primary care group. When each sex was analysed separately, these differences remained for female (p < 0.01) but not for male patients. Outpatients were more likely to attribute their complaints to somatic causes (p < 0.01), whereas primary care patients were more likely to attribute their complaints to stress (p < 0.01) or their agitated way of life (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that a high severity score, a large number of additional complaints, and a low score on the stress attribution were important determinants for being in the outpatient group. CONCLUSIONS: Female outpatients consider their complaints to be more serious and interfering than do patients with IBS in primary care. Male outpatients were comparable to primary care patients with IBS. More research needs to be done into sex specific differences in IBS and into the factors that influence the decision to refer a patient with IBS."
15246170,0,a,"There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that negative health lifestyles are the principal social determinants of the mortality crisis in the former socialist states. Little is known, however, about health lifestyles in Central Asia, where the downturn in life expectancy was also experienced. This paper examines health lifestyles in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in order to fill an important gap in the literature. The data show, consistent with the improved longevity of the Kyrgyz population, that such lifestyles are more positive in Kyrgyzstan despite the somewhat better economic situation in Kazakhstan, where the mortality crisis continues."
8372490,1,a,"This study examined the influence of educational achievement and occupational position on changes in risk behavior. Study population were 3753 men and women aged 25-64 years who were sampled by the first MONICA Augsburg Survey (Monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). The subjects were sampled in 1984-85, were followed up for three years, and were reexamined in 1987-88. The baseline findings showed for both men and women a statistically significant inverse association between current cigarette smoking and educational level. During the follow-up period the differences between highest and lowest educational levels increased significantly among men. In 1987-88 only 21% of the best educated men were smokers compared to 38% of those with the lowest educational level. Men with low educational levels also drank more alcohol than better educated men, whereas among women those with lowest educational level drank less alcohol than the better educated. Statistically independent of education and age it was found that male civil servants and farmers had the lowest proportion of smokers in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses. Among women, smoking was and remained most prevalent in simple white-collar occupations. In general, the findings indicate that the type of occupation and the actual working conditions have effects on life-style related risk factors which are in part independent of a social gradient. The results also suggest that the tendency to change unhealthy behavior is less pronounced in ""high risk"" groups."
15006238,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: There is concern about whether public services in Northern Ireland are equitably targeted across the religious divide. This study investigates whether use of acute hospital inpatient services differs by religious denomination, after adjusting for supply and for identified demographic, morbidity and socio-economic determinants of need for such services. METHODS: Hospital utilisation at small area level was modelled against a wide range of potential health and socioeconomic factors. Spatial interactive modelling was used to estimate the effect of supply of hospital beds and other facilities on hospital utilisation. Two-stage weighted least-squares regression was used to model utilisation against need and supply. RESULTS: There was a clear positive relationship between the proportion of Roman Catholics in a ward and both need for and utilisation of inpatient services. The higher levels of relative utilisation in wards with a greater proportion of Catholics persisted after controlling for needs but not when supply variables were also entered in the regression equation. The surviving needs drivers were: uptake levels of 'income maintenance' benefits, all-ages standardised mortality ratio, low birth weight and elderly people living alone. Most of these indicators of need are positively correlated with proportion of Catholics. CONCLUSIONS: When both need and supply factors are taken into account, there appears to be no significant effect of religion on inpatient hospital use in Northern Ireland. Efforts to ensure socio-economic equity between the two communities should focus on ensuring that hospital rationalisation does not lead to disadvantage and on reducing socio-economic differentials between the Catholic and Protestant communities."
16821508,0,a,"Many Americans do not have access to adequate medical care. Previous research on this problem focuses primarily on individual-level determinants of access such as income and insurance coverage. The role of community-level factors in helping or hindering individuals in obtaining needed medical care, however, has not received much attention. We address this gap in the literature by investigating the association between neighborhood residential instability and access to health care. Using individual-level data from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and block-group level data from the 2000 decennial census, we find that individuals who live in neighborhoods with high residential turnover have worse health care access than residents of other neighborhoods. This association persists even when the prevalence of poverty, the supply of health care, and a variety of individual characteristics are held constant. We offer explanations for these findings and suggest directions for future research."
1795152,1,a,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the patterns of black-white differences in stroke mortality across communities with varying levels of occupational structure in the southern region of the United States DESIGN: Annual age adjusted race-sex specific rates for stroke mortality were calculated for the years 1979-1981 and related to socioeconomic conditions. SETTING: The study involved 211 state economic areas comprising the southern region of the USA. STUDY POPULATION: Data on stroke mortality for black and white men and women between the ages of 35 and 74 years living in the study area were acquired from the National Center for Health Statistics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Occupational structure was measured as the proportion of white collar workers in each state economic area, and is an indicator of the employment opportunities and related social and economic resources of a community. Stratified analyses and linear regression modelling indicate that communities of lower occupational structure have (a) higher levels of stroke mortality for all four race-sex groups (p less than 0.05) and (b) larger racial inequalities in stroke mortality (p less than 0.01). For men and women, the excess stroke mortality among blacks compared to whites is larger in communities of lower occupational structure. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of occupational structure and related patterns of economic development is crucial for understanding the distribution of stroke mortality within and between racial groups, as well as for planning effective public health interventions. The larger racial inequalities in communities of lower occupational structure in the south suggest that aspects of the black experience which are conducive to high rates of stroke mortality are exacerbated in those communities. Public health interventions to reduce the racial and social inequalities in stroke mortality should recognise the social context within which nutritional, occupational, medical care, and environmental determinants of stroke are distributed."
1859918,1,a,"This essay comments on the main approaches to studying individual differences in ability to quit smoking, and suggests complementing them with a concept of 'difficulty of quitting'. Several areas of research into determinants of ability to quit smoking are discussed, including measures of dependence, reactivity to nicotine, severity of withdrawal symptoms, endurance of discomfort, and psychological well being. A number of correlates of inability to quit may have a common denominator in stress and neuroticism. If these are the primary obstacles to quitting, changes in the composition of the smoking population and in the image of smoking can be expected which could lead to smoking losing some of its appeal for potential new recruits."
12046994,0,a,"Whereas satisfaction is one of the most important outcomes in palliative care settings, there have been no systematic studies investigating the effects of family- and organization-related variables on family satisfaction with care. To clarify factors contributing to family satisfaction with inpatient palliative care services, a cross-sectional mailed survey was performed. A 60-item questionnaire was mailed to 1026 bereaved subjects who had lost family members at one of 37 palliative care units in Japan to evaluate their sociodemographic characteristics and satisfaction levels with care. An institution survey was performed to collect organization-related variables. Caregiver satisfaction was rated on the Satisfaction scale for Family members receiving Inpatient Palliative Care (Sat-Fam-IPC). A total of 640 responses were analysed (response rate = 62%). The responses to overall satisfaction were 'satisfied' in 41 % and 'very satisfied' in 47%. The mean total score of the Sat-Fam-IPC was 82.4 +/- 13.2 on the 0-100 scale. The mean subscale scores were: 85.8 +/- 14.5 (Nursing Care), 81.5 +/- 18.4 (Symptom Palliation), 85.0 +/- 13.8 (Facility), 83.3 +/- 16.6 (Information), 83.1 +/- 17.3 (Availability), 78.3 +/- 18.9 (Family Care), and 79.8 +/- 17.3 (Cost). Significant determinants of family satisfaction identified were: nursing system, the number of nurses at night and presence of attending medical social workers (Nursing Care), patient age and the number of physicians (Symptom Palliation), floor space per bed (Facility), duration of admission and presence of attending medical social workers (Availability), patient age, family age, gender and occupational status (Family Care), patient age and the extra charge for a private room (Cost). In conclusion, informal caregivers are generally satisfied with inpatient palliative care services provided by members of the Japanese Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Units. The levels of satisfaction are influenced by various family- and organization-related variables."
9769664,1,a,"INTRODUCTION: For a long period of time analyses of health status have been based on mortality data, while in this century indicators of morbidity have been introduced as well. However, these two indicators also have limitations because health of the total population was estimated on the basis of data referring to the diseased or deceased during a certain period of time. The definition of health by the World Health Organization was a progress, because the medical model of health was extended to the sociological model with emphasis on well-being, achievement of goals, functioning in the society and social rules. Subjective interpretation of health also has a significant place in assessment of health status of an individual or population groups. CONCEPTION OF HEALTH: Health has a subjective and an objective dimension. It can be analyzed as a global quality, but also as a sum of specific qualities--physical, social and psychological. Health analyses include the following parameters: mental well-being (affective status, mental functioning), physical health (ability to proceed with activities, body integrity, general physical capacity), general well-being and functioning (perceiving general health and expectations in regard to health in the future). Health is a prerequisite of social and economic status, and that is why emphasis is on social adaptation, but social support as well. HEALTH MEASUREMENT: Health measurement can be functional with diagnostic, prognostic or evaluation purpose. Health indicators can also be descriptive, focused on a certain organ, diagnostic methods, but complex as well measuring syndromes, global health and quality of life. Development of health promotion and programs of disease prevention, follow-up of their application, progress and results require various categories of measurement. Some of them identify or quantify the problem, others describe the determinants. There exists a need to measure the contents and processes of intervention and evaluation. Numerous scales of health measurement, that is different aspects of health and quality of life, have been developed, but many of them have limitations, particularly concerning validity and reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Most of existing indicators reflect the model of disease, while contemporary approach to health deals primarily with health itself. This model is oriented towards everyday life and relationships between individuals or groups of people and their physical and social environment as well as towards the way they influence health and well-being. The model also emphasizes well-being, achievement of goals, functioning in the society and social roles. Subjective assessment of health is significant in evaluation of health status, that is quality of life in regard to health, which is being done by different scales. The development of such scales is slow due to different opinions concerning the definition of health and health measurement. Efforts to develop scales which would satisfy the basic characteristics of measurement have largely focused on validity, reliability, accuracy, sensibility, specificity and feasibility."
10532625,1,a,"Autism is a developmental disorder with variable severity, occurring at all levels of cognitive ability and having a number of slightly different clinical presentations. It is associated with neuropsychological deficits that occur in other conditions also, but its pattern may be specific to autism. Genetic and environmental early insults to brain development are etiological determinants of the disorder. Brain circuitries important for social, communicative, and integrational purposes have been suggested to be dysfunctional in autism. There could be at least two different pathways to autism, one connected with primary temporofrontal dysfunction (and late prenatal-early postnatal origins) and another linked to primary brain-stem dysfunction (and early prenatal origins). Further study of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological processes in autism will help elucidate not only the pathological mechanisms involved in the specific syndromes but also the underpinnings of normal brain development."

However, the evaluation team suggested that the council adopt a more active strategy toward the promotion and diffusion of its reports. Some critical determinants of success of the Quebec experience in technology assessment are discussed."
11818587,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mental health among severe hearing-impaired adults in the Netherlands, separately by prelingual and postlingual age of onset. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-three face-to-face interviews were carried out by persons with practical skills in communication with hearing-impaired people. RESULTS: Of prelingually and postlingually deaf men, 27.1% and 27.7%, respectively, reported mental distress (scores on the General Health Questionnaire > or = 2), and among women these figures were 32.4% and 43.2%. These rates are higher than in the general population (men: 22.0%; women: 26.6%). Among the prelingual category, none of the demographic or hearing loss-related characteristics was associated with mental health status as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Of these variables, only additional impairment or serious illness was associated with the brief Symptom Checklist (SCL-8D). Among the postlingual category, female gender and equilibrium disturbance was associated with both the GHQ and SCL-8D, and additional impairment or serious illness with the SCL-8D. For both categories, the risk of mental distress also was higher in those with more communication problems, lower levels of self-esteem, and poorer acceptance of the hearing loss. Opportunities for identification in youth and social support were not associated with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health status differs between the hearing-impaired and the general population, but not as much as is sometimes suggested. Mental distress is greater in those in certain categories of the hearing-impaired."
11938363,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of admitted patients and the patterns of their service utilization over a decade from March 1988 to March 1998. METHODS: Prospective data compilation using a structured questionnaire, hospital records and follow-up observations at King Fahd Hospital of the University in Al-Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 1366 patients (683 of each sex) had 2217 admissions in 10 years. By the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition criteria, 19.5% had schizophrenia, 15.2% bipolar disorder, 9.9% depressive episodes, 8.6% acute and transient psychotic disorders, 7.7% adjustment disorders and 7.6% dissociative disorders. Males were more frequently admitted for schizophrenia and females for mood and anxiety disorders. Most non-Arab expatriates were diagnosed as acute and transient psychotic, stress-related or dissociative disorders. Re-hospitalizations constituted 28% of all admissions. The mean length of stay was 25 days per admission and 41 days per patient. The overall bed occupancy rate was 84.9%. A subgroup of 16.9% of patients, mostly with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, consumed 62.3% of the bed occupancy. CONCLUSION: Gender and immigration were the main determinants of variance in patient characteristics, nosological distribution and pattern of service use. More beds are needed. Psycho-educational programs should be intensified to reduce the social stigma and societal intolerance to mental patients. Active family involvement improves compliance and might reduce re-hospitalization rates. Heavy service consumers should be transferred to long-stay facilities."
2236224,1,a,"The purpose of this article is to examine movement science research on personal and social-environmental motivational influences in physical activity contexts. Motivation is defined as a process in which internal and external factors direct and energize thoughts, feelings, and actions. Motivation is described as a consequence of meaning, which is derived from a combination of personal and social factors, including personal goals or incentives, expectations of personal efficacy, movement-related perceptual and affective experiences, and social and physical features of the environment. Recent literature from sport and exercise psychology is presented on these variables, their determinants, and their consequences for choice, effort, persistence, and performance behavior in exercise and sport contexts."
8469943,1,a,"This study explores determinants of I) general practitioner (GP) visits and II) referrals (outpatient and hospitalization). The analyses were performed with regression models on a set of data from a comprehensive population study of 3533 men and 3578 women aged 40-42 in a county in Northern Norway. Among the various health status dimensions included, self-rated health was found to be the most important determinant, regardless of type of service. Factors, other than health status aspects affecting GP visits, were preoccupation with health and help seeking attitude. Volume of resources (GP per population), socio-demographic characteristics and social networks did not appear as important. Several inequitable effects were revealed on referrals: First, higher rate of referral of patients with higher educational achievement indicates a bias towards higher social status groups. Second, high GP/population ratio and residence in municipalities with referral care facilities were both found to be associated with higher probability of referral."
18950800,0,a,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with parental reports and children's self-reports, and to investigate the potential contribution of demographic factors, disease-specific factors, and problems in school performance or behavior. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective observational study, parents of 58 children with NF1 (32 boys, 26 girls, age 12.2 +/- 2.5 years) visiting a university clinic, and their 43 children 10 years or older were assessed with the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). Potential determinants of domain scores were assessed in 3 explorative regression models. RESULTS: Parents reported a significant impact of NF1 on 9/13 CHQ scales, with moderate effect sizes on 8 (general health perceptions, physical functioning, general behavior, mental health, self esteem, family activities, role functioning emotional/behavioral, and parent emotional impact). Children report an impact on bodily pain, and an above average general behavior. Multiple CHQ scales were sensitive to demographic factors and behavioral problems, and 1 to NF1 severity. NF1 visibility and school problems did not influence HR-QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Parents, but not the children with NF1, report a profound impact of NF1 on physical, social, behavioral, and emotional aspects of HR-QOL. Multiple HR-QOL domains were most sensitive to behavioral problems, which points to an exciting potential opportunity to improve HR-QOL in children with NF1 by addressing these behavioral problems."
10073947,1,a,"Hemostatic factors are reported to be associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). Socioeconomic status (SES) is 1 of the determinants of the hemostatic profile, but the factors underlying this association are not well known. Our aim was to examine determinants of the socioeconomic differences in hemostatic profile. Between 1991 and 1994, we studied 300 healthy women, aged 30 to 65 years, who were representative of women living in the greater Stockholm area. Fibrinogen, factor VII mass concentration (FVII:Ag), activated factor VII (FVIIa), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured. Educational attainment was used as a measure of SES. Low educational level and an unfavorable hemostatic profile were both associated with older age, unhealthful life style, psychosocial stress, atherogenic biochemical factors, and hypertension. Levels of hemostatic factors increased with lower educational attainment. Independently of age, the differences between the lowest (mandatory) and highest (college/university) education in FVII:Ag levels were 41 microg/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 15 to 66 microg/L, P=0.001), 0.26 g/L (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.42 g/L, P=0.001) in fibrinogen levels, and 0.11 U/mL (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.12 U/mL, P=0.03) in levels of vWF. The corresponding differences in FVIIa and PAI-1 were not statistically significant. With further adjustment for menopausal status, family history of CHD, marital status, psychosocial stress, lifestyle patterns, biochemical factors, and hypertension, statistically significant differences between mandatory and college/university education were observed in FVII:Ag (difference=34 microg/L; 95% CI, 2 to 65 microg/L, P=0.05) but not in fibrinogen (difference=0.03 g/L; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.19 g/L, P=0.92) or in vWF (difference=0.06 U/mL; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.22 U/mL, P=0.45). An educational gradient was most consistent and statistically significant for FVII:Ag, fibrinogen, and vWF. Age, psychosocial stress, unhealthful life style, atherogenic biochemical factors, and hypertension mediated the association of low educational level with elevated levels of fibrinogen and vWF. Psychosocial stress and unhealthful life style were the most important contributing factors. There was an independent association between education and FVII:Ag, which could not be explained by any of these factors."
16900044,0,a,"This study investigates the determinants within socio-demography, health behaviour, employer characteristics, and psychosocial and physical work environment for return to work. In 2000, a total of 5357 employees were interviewed regarding age, gender, family status, education, health behaviour, employer characteristics and work environment. They were followed in a national register for 18 months in order to identify subjects with 2 weeks or more of sickness absence. They were followed for an additional 12 months in order to establish associations between baseline measurements and time to first return to work. A total of 930 (17.4%) employees experienced sickness absence in the 18 months after baseline. During the 12-month follow-up, 856 (92.0%) returned to work, the mean absence period being 6.6 weeks. Prolonged time to first return to work was associated with female gender, increased age, no post-school education, being employed by a public employer, working at a workplace with 20 or more employees, high emotional demands in work, high job insecurity and sedentary work. There were no associations between health behaviour variables and return to work. The study indicates a potential for promoting return to work through interventions targeting emotional job demands, job insecurity and decreasing the risks associated with sedentary work."

8194917,1,a,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on serum lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), a presumably strong risk factor for coronary artery disease in White populations, has mostly been derived, in Black populations, from small samples. This study compares the distribution and the determinants of serum Lp(a) in Blacks and in Whites using large representative samples and the same methods in both populations. METHODS: The distribution and the correlates of serum Lp(a) were investigated in population-based samples of 701 Blacks in the Seychelles and 634 Whites in Switzerland, aged 25-64 years. Serum Lp(a) was quantified using a commercial immunoradiometric assay. RESULTS: The distribution of serum Lp(a) was similarly skewed in both ethnic groups, but median Lp(a) concentration was about twofold higher in Blacks (210 mg/l) compared to Whites (100 mg/l). The proportions of individuals with elevated serum Lp(a) (> 300 mg/l) was about 50% higher in Blacks (37.5%) than in Whites (25.2%). In both ethnic groups, serum Lp(a) was found to correlate with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apoprotein B but not with HDL-cholesterol, alcohol intake, smoking, and body mass index. The variance in serum Lp(a) concentration explained by any combination of these factors was smaller than 5.3% in the two populations. CONCLUSIONS: The measured factors did not explain the higher levels of serum Lp(a) found in Blacks compared to Whites. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors account for much of the variation of serum Lp(a) in both populations."
16463243,0,a,"Unexplained differences in the density of in-patient management in one federal state in Germany led to a regional survey of physicians in independent and hospital practice, which aimed to describe more precisely the determinants of referral and admission behaviour. Brief typical case descriptions (vignettes) were designed, as an instrument of data collection, dealing with two examples of management problems: upper and lower abdominal pain. The urgency of inpatient treatment was ranked using clinical scores and guidelines. Social characteristics for the patient (age, gender, social situation, preference for/against hospitalisation, day of the week on which the patient presented) were randomly assigned to the case vignettes. Each physician was asked by mail to decide on the management of 10 upper and 10 lower abdominal vignettes each. The physicians were also asked to provide additional information on the characteristics of their practice or hospital. The data were analysed using multivariate hierarchical models. A 28 % response rate meant that vignettes were available from 455 general practitioners and internal medicine specialists in independent practice, as well as 261 hospital surgeons and internal medicine specialists, together with responses from 31 physicians from the medical service of the German statutory health insurance (MDK). 7376 upper abdominal and 7335 lower abdominal vignettes were analysed. Admission rates reflected the graded severity of the symptoms built into the vignettes. Hospital physicians wanted to admit the vignette patients much more frequently than physicians in independent practice wished to refer them. Older patients, independent of symptoms, were more frequently referred or admitted than younger patients. In the case of acute symptoms it is the day of the week when the patient consulted the physician and in the case of elective surgery the patient's preference that are important for hospitalisation. The results show that medical decisions on case management are made using reasonable problem-specific preferences. The probability of actually instigating admission was, other things being equal, much higher in hospital physicians than in office-based physicians. As an instrument of comparative research into medical care, case vignettes have practical advantages in relation to medical audits and standardised patients. They can also be used for teaching, examining, documenting and quality assurance purposes."
10532676,1,a,Obesity is an environmental issue. Societies that are transitioning to westernized lifestyles are experiencing substantial increases in its prevalence. The primary environmental determinants of obesity are high calorie intake and low levels of activity. Socioeconomic status and place of residence are important contributors. These factors together comprise an obesogenic or 'toxic' environment where the development of obesity is the expected course for humans leading lifestyles incompatible with their evolutionary development. Only by addressing and modifying the toxic environment will we be able to stem the obesity epidemic.
9923956,1,a,"BACKGROUND: The aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the Paisley-Renfrew MIDSPAN cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions. METHOD: A cohort analysis was carried out in Paisley and Renfrew, two post-industrial towns in West Central Scotland. This used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. The subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. The main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors). RESULTS: The following patterns of hospital utilization were found. Only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). In contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. The age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). For non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. Analysis of risk factors (using Cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (FEV1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. The absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. Strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. Those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low FEV1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. Thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates."

The specific purpose of the study was to test the viability of a model for understanding how the treatment of hypertension affects QOL. Indicators of QOL and determinants of QOL were measured in a group of patients aged 60 years or older with hypertension. Correlation coefficients confirmed the hypothesized model. The confirmed model thus can be used to study other chronic diseases and to assess the QOL effects of treatment of chronic diseases."
8666516,1,a,"Establishing causal relationships has been and is today a matter of debate in epidemiology. The observational nature of epidemiological research rends difficult the proving of these relationships. Related to this, different models and causal criteria have been proposed in order to explain health and disease determinants, from pure determinism in Koch postulates, accepting unicausal explanation for diseases, to more realistic multicausal models. In occupational health it is necessary to formulate causal models and criteria to assess causality, and frequently causal assessment in this field has important social, economic and juridical relevance. This paper deal with evaluation of causal relationships in epidemiology and this evaluation is illustrated with a recent example of an occupational health problem in our milieu: the Ardystil case."
18356195,0,a,"BACKGROUND: Social class in childhood and in adulthood have been shown to be important determinants of risk factors in later life. Often the childhood information is retrospective and liable to bias. We use data from a family study of two generations of adults to investigate the effects of social class in childhood, adulthood and social mobility on risk factors. METHODS: In 1996, 2338 adult offspring of participants of the 1970s Renfrew/Paisley study took part in a screening examination. They provided information on sociological, behavioural and clinical risk factors, as their parents had done 20 years previously. Social class and father's social class were available, enabling their influence on risk factors to be investigated. RESULTS: Generally risk factors improved for offspring compared with parents, except for Body mass index and obesity, which worsened. Risk factors were less favourable in manual compared with non-manual offspring, and were more closely related to own than father's social class. There was a large amount of upward social mobility involving 35% of sons and 50% of daughters. Risk factors for the upwardly mobile tended to be more favourable than the class they left behind but less favourable than the class they joined. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitants of social mobility may reflect behavioural choices, such as smoking, and adverse factors, which are more difficult to leave behind. The relatively fast changes in social class profile may not be reflected in as quick changes in population health, as the upwardly mobile bring their earlier life adversities with them."
