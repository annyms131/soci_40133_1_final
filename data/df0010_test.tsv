21870166	In a prospective study conducted from January to December 2010 in the Teaching Hospital of Brazzaville (Congo), we compared the discharge of hospitalized children against medical advice at the parents' request (group 1 - cases) with those admitted during same period with routine discharge (group 2 - controls). Two hundred and seven (7.7%) hospitalized children, 117 boys and 90 girls, were discharged at the parents request. The mean age was 18.0 +/- 13.5 months (range: 1 month-5 years). Among these patients, 150 (72.5%) children were from biparental families, and 30.9% of children were the first and/or only child of the household. Among the parents of Congolese nationality, 147 (71%) had a secondary school level education, including 66.7% of mothers and 58% of the fathers 59.9% of children were admitted between 15 and 7 hours, and 75.4% were hospitalized during working days. The duration of hospitalization did not exceed 3 days in 147 cases (71%). The main reasons for hospitalization were digestive disorders (27%), fever (16.4%), convulsions (11.1%) and anaemia (11.1%). Among patients discharged against medical advice, 34.8% left on the first day of hospitalization (72 cases), 36.7% before the start of treatment (76 cases of which 36 during check-up) and 63.3% during treatment (131 cases). The main reasons for discharge request were improvement in the clinical condition improvement (30.9% of cases), lack of money (28% of cases), supposed insufficient medical care (7.7% of cases), unsatisfactory hospitalization conditions (6.3% of cases), care of other children at home (6.3% of cases), traditional and/or religious beliefs (5.8% of cases) and disagreements with nurses (5.3%). Patients discharge against medical advice was correlated strongly with the educational level of parents, age of the child, delay of consultation, time of admission, rank of the child in family and nationality of parents. Discharge against medical advice is associated to the distrust between the patients and nurses. Improvement of hospitalization conditions in our hospitals, improvement of the socioeconomic status of Congolese and establishment of national social security seem to be the main determinants of reduction of discharge against medical advice.
29898353	OBJECTIVES: This work sought to assess the predictor role of work engagement and social support from the supervisor and coworkers on affective commitment with the organization in nursing staff from southern Portugal. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with participation from 215 nursing professionals from three public hospitals in southern Portugal. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 77.21% were women. Statistically significant and positive correlations were observed between affective organizational commitment and the three dimensions of engagement: vigor (r=0.48), dedication (r=0.49), and absorption (r=0.48). Likewise, support from the supervisor and support from coworkers were positively related with affective commitment (r=0.45 and r=0.24, p<0.01). The linear and hierarchical regression model showed the following significant predictors: support from the supervisor (beta=0.28), vigor (beta=0.26), and absorption (beta=0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Social support from the supervisor and work engagement (vigor and absorption) are important determinants of the affective bond of nursing professionals with their health organizations. Training and formation of the supervisors in leadership and coaching styles, and labor resources at work would permit increasing the levels of affective commitment in the health units.
15797980	OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36.
21645393	BACKGROUND: In the past years, cumulative evidence has convincingly demonstrated that the work environment is a critical determinant of workers' mental health. Nevertheless, much less attention has been dedicated towards understanding the pathways through which other pivotal life environments might also concomitantly intervene, along with the work environment, to bring about mental health outcomes in the workforce. The aim of this study consisted in conducting a systematic review examining the relative contribution of non-work determinants to the prediction of workers' mental health in order to bridge that gap in knowledge. METHODS: We searched electronic databases and bibliographies up to 2008 for observational longitudinal studies jointly investigating work and non-work determinants of workers' mental health. A narrative synthesis (MOOSE) was performed to synthesize data and provide an assessment of study conceptual and methodological quality. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected for evaluation. Seven of these were of relatively high methodological quality. Assessment of study conceptual quality yielded modest analytical breadth and depth in the ways studies conceptualized the non-work domain as defined by family, network and community/society-level indicators. We found evidence of moderate strength supporting a causal association between social support from the networks and workers' mental health, but insufficient evidence of specific indicator involvement for other analytical levels considered (i.e., family, community/society). CONCLUSIONS: Largely underinvestigated, non-work determinants are important to the prediction of workers' mental health. More longitudinal studies concomitantly investigating work and non-work determinants of workers' mental health are warranted to better inform healthy workplace research, intervention, and policy.
18931911	There are limited validated quantitative assessment methods to measure features of the built and social environment that might form the basis for environmental preventive interventions. This study describes a model approach for epidemiologic assessment of suspected environmental determinants of violence, alcohol and other drug (VAOD) exposure and fills this gap in current research. The investigation sought to test the feasibility of a systematic and longitudinal assessment of residential block characteristics related to physical and social disorder and indicators of VAOD exposure. Planometric data were used to establish a stratified random sample of street segments within defined neighborhoods of an urban metropolitan area. Field rater assessments of these neighborhood street segments were conducted using the Neighborhood Inventory for Environmental Typology (NIfETy). This report provides a detailed description of the NIfETy Method, including metric properties of the NIfETy Instrument and outcomes of training procedures and quality control measures. Also presented are block-level characteristics and estimates of observable signs of VAOD activity. This work is a first step toward developing future community-level environmental preventive interventions geared to reduce community VAOD exposure among youthful urban populations and may prove to be useful to other public health research groups as well.
11777189	The object of this study was to investigate how the information status with regard to diagnosis, in addition to social and clinical factors, influenced emotional functioning and quality of life in a group of cancer patients in Turkey. A consecutive sample of 100 cancer patients being treated for different diagnoses in a tertiary care centre were prospectively evaluated. Data on patient disease and social characteristics, clinical factors, and scores on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) were analysed by logistic regression models. A significant proportion (44%) of the patients did not know of their diagnosis of cancer. The scores on functional and symptom scales and global health status/quality of life according to QLQ-C30 did not differ according to the information given or not given on diagnosis. However, the independently significant determinants of good emotional functioning were male gender (P=0.002), low serum alanine transferase levels (P=0.025), good social functioning (P=0.002), and the absence of constipation (P=0.005). In Turkey, it is still common for cancer patients not to be informed of their diagnosis, and there is a great need to improve this situation. Honest disclosure of the truth does not worsen any dimension of quality of life in general or emotional functioning in particular. On the contrary, those with hepatic dysfunction, female gender, poor social functioning and constipation are the ones at increased risk of poor emotional functioning, and these patients may benefit from psychological screening.
18336442	OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the context of sexual abstinence and identify potential determinants of abstinence in this population. DESIGN: Four focus groups. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Twenty-four, predominantly African American (88%) girls aged 14 to 19 years were recruited from urban health centers and youth development programs in Rochester, New York, between September and December 2006. DATA ANALYSIS: Content analysis was used to analyze the four verbatim transcripts. Using analytic induction, groups were compared and contrasted at the micro (within-group) and macro (between-group) levels to identify themes. RESULTS: Four themes were identified that provided insight into how and why these girls remain abstinent despite being in sexually active social climates. They focused on the following: self-respect (I'm worth it), impact of mothers (Mama says ... think before you let it go), influence of boys and other peers (Boys will be boys), and potential negative consequences of sex (Hold on, there's a catch). CONCLUSIONS: Developing interventions to maintain abstinence, delay onset of sexual activity, and promote protected first and subsequent sexual contact in abstinent girls are key to decreasing future sexual risk. These findings suggest opportunities to develop HIV prevention strategies tailored to the needs of abstinent girls.
15639629	In the past decade, significant debate has surrounded the relative contributions of genetic determinants versus environmental conditions to certain types of human behavior. While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria. Bacteria exhibit many social activities and they represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level. Therefore, we introduce the term 'sociomicrobiology'.
12608097	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research study carried-out in 1999 was to assess the impact of various forms of activity (physical, pro-social and intellectual-mental) on health status of the group of people aged 65 and more. METHODS: A tool used to conduct the research was anonymous questionnaire. After a preliminary assessment of 2072 questionnaires for a further analysis, 1910 questionnaires (92.6%) have been selected. Health status has been assessed on the basis of the following epidemiological parameters: information on illness and health problems, hospitalisation, disability, mobility, and body weight, depression, limited life enthusiasm, assessment of satisfaction resulting from contacts with other persons, identification of problems connected with ageing. Activity has been assessed on the basis of responses to the open and closed questions. The statistic tests: Chi 2, logistic regression, Pearson's correlation were used. RESULTS: Active persons assessed their health condition more positively, they suffered from fewer CVD's and their health condition was more stable, many had a better psycho-social status, and they less often used medical services (hospitalisation). Legal and biological disability, except 1st disability category and persons who were immobile did not constitute any barrier to become active. Similarly, diseases didn't exclude activity, except very severe pathologies. In the group of active persons overweight subjects constituted a minority, while no active person was obese. Majority of respondents has admitted that their health condition has deteriorated drastically at the age of 63-64. CONCLUSION: Activity of persons over 65 year old is one of many independent determinants and indicators of positive ageing.
22132614	Health services are more expensive year by year and chronic diseases are more frequent. It is obvious that coping with health problems predominantly in hospitals is not effective. That is why there are attempts to involve all people in health care. Article explains possibilities of health services rationing, importance of health literacy and social determinants of health. People and their health are key elements of any health care system and are important for successful social and economic development.
17450311	Individual and family factors have been hypothesized to influence adolescent sexual behavior, but the extent to which this is true for adolescents in Jamaica as a whole and for those in rural areas in particular, has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to identify individual and family factors associated with initiation of sexual activity before the age of 16 among rural adolescents in Jamaica. We analyzed data for 469 sexually experienced adolescents attending public high schools in the rural parish of Hanover. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict independent influences of these factors. The mean age at sexual debut was 11 years for boys and 15 years for girls. Early adolescent sexual activity was associated with liberal attitudes about negative sexual outcomes (OR = 1.96, 95%CI = 1.34-2.87) and first sexual partner not being a steady boyfriend or girlfriend (OR = 4.19, 95%CI = 1.62-10.84). Female gender (OR = 0.16, 95%CI = 0.07-0.36) and older age at time of survey were protective (OR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.32-0.52). Girls who were early starters were more likely to have been initiated by partners who were not steady boyfriends. They also reported liberal attitude towards negative sexual outcomes. Boys were mainly influenced by liberal attitude towards negative sexual outcomes. Being older was protective for both genders. Considering the high rates of HIV and adolescent pregnancy in this population, reproductive health programs that attempt to delay age at first sex should begin early in primary school before adolescents become sexually active.
31673340	Background: Exposure to adverse conditions earlier in life-course can predispose to type 2 diabetes in adulthood, irrespective of body mass index (BMI). However, the burden of type 2 diabetes in lean Africans is not well understood despite higher exposure to adverse early life conditions. Mirroring ongoing epidemiological transition, we assessed the burden and determinants of type 2 diabetes in a homogenous group of lean Ghanaians residing in rural and urban Ghana, and as migrants in Europe. Methods: Baseline data from 2179 RODAM study participants with BMI<25kg/m(2) (25-70 years) were analyzed. Prevalence and determinants of type 2 diabetes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Adjustments were made for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, use of anti-diabetic medication and optimal blood glucose control. Results: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes in rural, urban and migrant lean participants were 3.5%, 8.9% and 7.5% respectively, representing 55.4%, 35.6%, 13.2% of all participants with type 2 diabetes. Compared with lean rural participants, the odds of type 2 diabetes were higher in lean urban participants (adjusted OR = 8.81, 95% CI = 6.56-11.06), followed by migrants (5.27, 95% CI = 3.51-6.91). Irrespective of site, determinants of type 2 diabetes in lean participants include; presence of hypertension, physical inactivity, hypercholesterolemia and age (>45 years). Conclusions: Our study shows a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes among lean African populations in different geographical settings. Future studies are needed in-order to examine how contextual differences are related to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in lean individuals.
14531507	OBJECTIVE: To know more about the characteristics of long-term users of hypnotic and tranquillising drugs in a primary health care area in The Netherlands. DESIGN: A questionnaire was applied to users of benzodiazepines and the computerised medical records were analysed. SETTING: Nine general practices affiliated to the Registration Network Family Practices (RNH) of the University of Maastricht (UM). SUBJECTS: A sample of 506 users, aged > or = 30 years, was divided into four categories: short-term (< 3 months) users (once-only and episodic) and long-term users (episodic and continuous). RESULTS: In 1992/93, 81% were long-term users and 42% of these took their drug continuously. All groups investigated had a preponderance of women. Health problems more so than social problems led to use of the drug. Long-term use was associated with older age, depressive behaviour in handling problems, a higher score on the medicine addiction index, problems with children or housing, and satisfaction with the effects of the drug. CONCLUSION: Most people taking benzodiazepines are long-term users. Age, depressive behaviour, addiction, satisfaction and problems with children or housing are risk factors for long-term use. Gender is not risk factor.
22399003	This article presents the key findings from an extensive research project aiming to identify the determinants of poor sleep in care homes. A mixed methods study was conducted in 10 care homes in South East England. This included 2-week daily diaries completed by 145 older residents and interviews with 50 care-home staff. This research demonstrated that the regular surveillance by qualified nurses and care assistants at night seriously impedes the quality of sleep experienced by older people living in care homes. However, nurses and social care workers have a duty of care, which would not be fulfilled if regular checks were not undertaken at night. There is a need for care-home staff to strike a balance between enabling older people living in care homes to have a good night's sleep and adhering to their own professional duty of care.
19357732	OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for placenta praevia presenting with severe vaginal bleeding in Mulago hospital, Kampala, Uganda. DESIGN: A case control study. SETTING: Mulago hospital labour suite PARTICIPANTS: Between 15th November 2001 and 30th November 2002 we identified and recruited thirty six parturients with placenta previa who developed severe bleeding and 180 women with normal delivery. The risk factors were studied. VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Socio demographic characteristics, social and family history, gynaecological operations, blood transfusion, medical conditions, past and present obstetric performance and HIV status. RESULTS: Significant predictors for severe bleeding in parturients with placenta praevia were: previous history of evacuation of the uterus or dilation and curettage (O.R. 3.6, CI: 1.1-12.5), delivery by caesarean section in previous pregnancy (O.R. 19.9, CI: 6.4-61.7), residing more than ten kilometres from Mulago hospital (O.R. 2.4, CI: 1.0-5.7) and recurrent vaginal bleeding during the current pregnancy (O.R. 7.3, CI 2.4-63.7). CONCLUSION: Severe bleeding in placenta praevia is associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality. The determinants of severe bleeding in placenta praevia can be used in the antenatal period to identify mothers at risk. These, with prompt interventions to deliver the women can be used to reduce the maternal morbidity associated with this condition.
17888013	The aim of this study was to evaluate determinants of consultation for migraine in a representative sample of the French general adult population. We interviewed 10,032 subjects, of whom 1534 fulfilled the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine. These were categorized into migraine, probable migraine and chronic migraine. Information was collected on consultation experience; 436 subjects (28.4%) had never consulted for headache, 473 (30.8%) were in active consultation and 625 (40.7%) had previously consulted but lapsed. Subjects with chronic migraine showed the highest active consultation rates (51.8%). All subjects completed rating instruments for headache [Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6], psychiatric (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scale) and psychological [Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), Brief COPE Inventory and Coping Strategy Questionnaire] variables. The strongest determinants of active consultation were BIPQ scores, HIT-6 scores and migraine type. Consultation was associated with maladaptive coping strategies (social support, emotional expression and acceptance). Determinants of remaining in consultation were catastrophizing coping scores and previous consultation experience.
18390066	Breast cancer, the commonest malignancy in women, is now the most common cancer in Nigeria, but little is known about the quality of life (QOL) of Nigerian women breast cancer survivors and the predictive factors that may influence their QOL. Health-related QOL (HRQOL) was evaluated in 35 Nigerian women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer at the University College Hospital, Ibadan by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ - C30 version 3). Linear regression procedures were used to evaluate the association of HRQOL outcomes with medical and socio-demographic factors. Physical functioning (PF), Emotional functioning (EF) and Cognitive functioning (CF) scores were above average (76.9 +/- 20.6, 61.9 +/- 30.3 and 60.0 +/- 32.1 respectively) while Role functioning (RF) and Social functioning (SF) scores were below average (46.2 +/- 36.6 and 40.9 +/- 42.8 respectively). High symptom scale scores were recorded for fatigue, pain and financial difficulties (52.7 +/- 32.8, 59.1 +/- 34.4 and 71.4 +/- 38.8 respectively). Age had no significant influence on any of the functional and symptom scale scores as well as the overall QOL. The overall QOL was significantly related to PF, CF and SF. It was also significantly and inversely related to the scores of fatigue, nausea and vomitng, pain, insomnia and financial difficulty. The findings of this study provide important information on QOL and their correlates among Nigerian women undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer and are helpful in developing treatment strategies accordingly.
26790411	BACKGROUND: It is hard to convince people to participate in chlamydia screening programs outside the clinical setting. In two earlier studies (BMC Public Health. 2013;13:1091; J Med Internet Res. 2014;16(1):e24), we identified explicit and implicit determinants of chlamydia screening behavior and attempted, unsuccessfully, to improve participation rates by optimizing the recruitment letter. In the present study, we examined the links between a number of social-cognitive determinants (e.g., stereotypical beliefs about a person with chlamydia, intentions, changes in partner status), and self-reported chlamydia testing behavior six months after the initial study. METHODS: The present study is a follow-up to our first study (T0). We assessed self-reported testing behavior 6 months after the first measure by means of an online questionnaire (T1; N = 269). Furthermore, at T1, we measured the social-cognitive determinants in more detail, and explored the influence of stereotypical beliefs and any changes in partner status during this six month period. RESULTS: In total, 25 (9.1 %) of the participants tested for chlamydia at some point during the six months between baseline (T0) and follow up (T1). Testing behavior was influenced by testing intentions in combination with changes in risk behavior. The higher the participants' own numbers of partners ever, the higher they estimated the number of partners of the stereotypical person with chlamydia. Testing intentions were most strongly predicted by perceived norms and susceptibility, and having had multiple partners in the last 6 months (R(2) = .41). CONCLUSION: The most relevant determinants for testing intentions and behavior were susceptibility, subjective norms and changes in partner status. We found a systematic tendency for individuals to underestimate their own risk, especially the risk of inconsistent condom use. Future research should focus on more promising alternatives to population-based interventions, such as online interventions, screening in primary care, the rescreening of positives, and clinic-based interventions. This future research should also focus on making testing easier and reducing barriers to testing, as well as using social and sexual networks in order to reach more people.
28680437	The study of the molecular basis of tree diseases is lately receiving a renewed attention, especially with the emerging perception that pathogens require specific pathogenicity and virulence factors to successfully colonize woody hosts. Pathosystems involving woody plants are notoriously difficult to study, although the use of model bacterial strains together with genetically homogeneous micropropagated plant material is providing a significant impetus to our understanding of the molecular determinants leading to disease. The gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas savastanoi belongs to the intensively studied Pseudomonas syringae complex, and includes three pathogenic lineages causing tumorous overgrowths (knots) in diverse economically relevant trees and shrubs. As it occurs with many other bacteria, pathogenicity of P. savastanoi is dependent on a type III secretion system, which is accompanied by a core set of at least 20 effector genes shared among strains isolated from olive, oleander, and ash. The induction of knots of wild-type size requires that the pathogen maintains adequate levels of diverse metabolites, including the phytohormones indole-3-acetic acid and cytokinins, as well as cyclic-di-GMP, some of which can also regulate the expression of other pathogenicity and virulence genes and participate in bacterial competitiveness. In a remarkable example of social networking, quorum sensing molecules allow for the communication among P. savastanoi and other members of the knot microbiome, while at the same time are essential for tumor formation. Additionally, a distinguishing feature of bacteria from the P. syringae complex isolated from woody organs is the possession of a 15 kb genomic island (WHOP) carrying four operons and three other genes involved in degradation of phenolic compounds. Two of these operons mediate the catabolism of anthranilate and catechol and, together with another operon, are required for the induction of full-size tumors in woody hosts, but not in non-woody micropropagated plants. The use of transposon mutagenesis also uncovered a treasure trove of additional P. savastanoi genes affecting virulence and participating in diverse bacterial processes. Although there is still much to be learned on what makes a bacterium a successful pathogen of trees, we are already untying the knots.
23034508	In the United States, race and ethnicity are considered key social determinants of health because of their enduring association with social and economic opportunities and resources. An important policy and research concern is whether the U.S. is making progress toward reducing racial/ethnic inequalities in health. While race/ethnic disparities in infant and adult outcomes are well documented, less is known about patterns and trends by race/ethnicity among children. Our objective was to determine the patterns of and progress toward reducing racial/ethnic disparities in child health. Using nationally representative data from 1998 to 2009, we assessed 17 indicators of child health, including overall health status, disability, measures of specific illnesses, and indicators of the social and economic consequences of illnesses. We examined disparities across five race/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic other). We found important racial/ethnic disparities across nearly all of the indicators of health we examined, adjusting for socioeconomic status, nativity, and access to health care. Importantly, we found little evidence that racial/ethnic disparities in child health have changed over time. In fact, for certain illnesses such as asthma, black-white disparities grew significantly larger over time. In general, black children had the highest reported prevalence across the health indicators and Asian children had the lowest reported prevalence. Hispanic children tended to be more similar to whites compared to the other race/ethnic groups, but there was considerable variability in their relative standing.
19412483	A series of 44 consecutive elderly, admitted to a busy general hospital following deliberate self-poisoning, is reviewed for associated medical and psychosocial factors. In all but 3 cases the act involved an overdose of drugs prescribed for the treatment of a chronic medical and/or psychiatric disorder. Women outnumbered men by 2.7 to 1. There was high proportion of chronic psychiatric (80%, mostly depressive) and medical (60%) conditions. Chronic stress from the physical illness, social isolation, or tacit family conflict were common and seemed instrumental in the self-poisoning act. Most attempts were carried out around the weekend and during winter. One man succumbed to complications of the overdose but the rest of the patients recovered. Psychosocial (especially depressive) and medical vulnerability, plus availability of prescribed drugs, were the most important determinants of suicidal behavior among these elderly attempters.
31586374	BACKGROUND: To achieve preventive and controlling activities of Brucellosis, we aimed this study as the first prospective cohort survey on brucellosis in Iran. This cohort in different phases from 2016 until 2020 going to investigate about brucella infection in selected population of Famenin, a city located in Hamadan province, west of Iran. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. METHODS: At the first phase of study, Famenin inhabitants including urban and rural people were studied during September to December in 2016. All identified household's people referred to specified health centers and clinically visited. Blood sampling was done, then these subjects were joined and the follow-up was initiated. At the next step, taken blood samples were examined using Wright kits and 2ME test for diagnosis the seroprevalence of brucellosis. Participants will be followed up for next years to examine clinical profiles of brucellosis and complete investigation about the main risk factors to reach strategies to control and reduce human and animal brucellosis. RESULTS: In the first phase, according to statistical analysis, 3363 persons including 47clusters were enrolled and considered for future studies. All participants were interviewed and demographic questioners were successfully completed. Finally, 2367 blood samples were entered in serology analysis. The seroprevalence of brucellosis based on serologic titers of Wright and 2ME test was 6.59% (95% CI: 5.62%: 7.66%) and 3.46 %( 95% CI: 2.72%: 4.20%) respectively. CONCLUSION: In the first phase, an extensive range of data and information were collected as the basic data for following phases of the cohort.
31813691	Fetuses and young children are sensitive to even low levels of exposure to Hg, which can damage their brain and adversely affect their central nervous system and cognitive development. This study was conducted to determine the maternal and fetal mercury burden levels in mothers presenting to Shahidan Mobini Hospital for delivery. Eighty-nine mothers were included in this study and 360 samples were taken from their placental tissue and blood (maternal blood) as well as their umbilical cord tissue blood (infant blood). Findings revealed a significant strong correlation (r=0.890, p<0.001) in blood mercury between mothers and their infants. According to multiple linear regression analysis, there was a significant positive association between living in rural areas and the level of mercury in the placental tissue (beta=11.09, p<0.001). This positive association was also found in other samples. In addition, there was a significant association between maternal age and mercury level in the placental tissue (beta=5.56, p=0.049), placental blood (beta=11.67, p=0.003), umbilical cord tissue (beta=8.33, p=0.004) and umbilical cord blood (beta=9.51, p<0.001).
18784048	International interest in the social determinants of health and their public policy antecedents is increasing. Despite evidence that as compared to other wealthy nations Canada presents a mediocre population health profile and public policy environments increasingly less supportive of health, the Canadian public health gaze is firmly - and narrowly - focused on lifestyle issues of diet, physical activity and tobacco use. Much of this has to do with Canada being identified as being driven by a liberal political economy, a situation shared with a cluster of other developed nations. Reasons for Canada's neglect of structural and public policy issues are explored and ways by which public health workers in Canada and elsewhere can help to shift policymakers and the general public's understandings of the determinants of health are outlined.
16115285	Birthweight is used as an indicator of individual and population health and is known to be strongly correlated with adult cardiovascular disease. This paper uses routinely collected maternity discharge data from Scotland between 1980 and 2000 to look at birthweight trends and the changes in the distribution of maternal risk factors for birthweight. We also examine the contributions of each of the risk factors to birthweight trends and investigate whether there has been a reduction in inequality in birthweight over time. Data from 1,282,172 singleton live births were used in the analysis. Both mean birthweight and low birthweight (LBW:<2500 g) were used as outcomes. The risk factors studied were maternal age, parity, maternal height, marital status and occupational social class of the father. The slope and relative indices of inequality were used to measure the change in inequalities over time. Mean birthweight increased from 3320 g in 1980 to 3410 g in 2000, while the percentage LBW decreased slightly from 5.7% in 1980 to 5.4% in 2000. The prevalence of many risk factors changed; there has been an increase in the proportion of older mothers, single mothers, taller mothers and mothers with undetermined social class. Although most risk factors had a significant change in effect over time, the inequalities in birthweight between groups did not appear to diminish over time. Both the slope and relative index of inequality had a quadratic relationship over time, with the inequalities in birthweight being greatest in the early 1980s and late 1990s.
30058744	BACKGROUND: According to Florence Nightingale's hypothesis, the environment can play a central role in the healing of the patient's body and mind. The nurse should, therefore, strive to provide a healing and stress-reducing environment for patients about to undergo invasive procedures. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the effects of environmental factors on anxiety as experienced by patients in waiting rooms prior to coronary angiography. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 200 patients undergoing coronary angiography in an urban area of Iran were assigned randomly to the following intervention groups: (1) nature sounds; (2) nature sounds and daylight; (3) nature sounds, daylight, and colour enhancements; and (4) control. Portable monitors were used to measure the patients' physiological indices upon admission and 30 and 60 minutes thereafter. RESULTS: Patients who experienced environmental affecting interventions had significantly lower physiological indices of anxiety than the control group (P < 0.001). Some significance was demonstrated between the three interventions groups, with patients in the intervention group that experienced maximum environmental interventions demonstrating the most overall reduction in anxiety indices. CONCLUSION: Environmental factors were shown to have a positive effect on the indices of anxiety experienced by patients waiting for the procedure of coronary angiography; this is therefore an area of study and practice worthy of further development.
15552859	"The international congress called ""Birth Quality-Life Quality"" has been a key scientific event in Poland resulting in great changes in perinatal care. Improvements in the quality of care at maternity wards were not limited to purely medical issues. Attention became increasingly focused on psycho-social problems of women after parturition. Emphasis is now directed to support by the doctors and nurses and efforts to acquaint young mothers with the benefits of natural feeding, as well as to prepare them for taking good care of their child. Social support is seen as an important tool in the improvement of care over the mother and child. The present study has classified social support according to J. House as informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing. Informational support consists of methods to cope with specific problems that require delivery of information and teaching of new skills. Emotional support focuses on demonstrating care, winning trust and showing empathy. Instrumental support is reflected by delivery of goods or services to persons in need. Finally, worthing support aims at promoting self-esteem. The aim of this study was (1) to analyze the determinants of informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing support and to compare the needs for different types of support among primiparas and multiparas at an obstetrics ward with the rooming-in system; (2) to study correlations between availability and demand for social support; (3) to determine the expectations of patients as to sources of informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing support and as to methods and means used during delivery of informational support. The study was done in a group of 200 women giving birth at the Department of Obstetrics and Perinatology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin. A special questionnaire was developed to determine the needs for support. A modified Social Support Score was also used. It was found that the demand for all determinants of informational support was greater among primiparas than multiparas. In the lactation part, significant differences were noted for 25 determinants (Tab. 1). Similarly, significant differences were noted for 13 determinants of neonatal care and nursing (Tab. 2) and for 9 determinants of postpartum self-care (Tab. 3). A large demand for most determinants of emotional support was noted in the study and reference groups. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were revealed as to 3 determinants representing feeling of safety by the woman during hospitalization (Tab. 4). It was found that the demand for all determinants of instrumental support was greater among primiparas than multiparas (Tab. 5). There were no significant differences in worthing support needs (Tab. 6). Primiparas significantly more often expected informational and instrumental (p < 0.001), as well as emotional support (p < 0.05) (Tab. 7) in comparison to multiparas. The need for social support at a maternity ward was found to be independent of the available support (Tab. 8). The most frequently expected source of informational support is the nurse/midwife at the maternity ward, as well as the doctor at the ward and the outpatient unit. Worthing and instrumental support is usually expected of the husband and the family. The usual methods of delivering support include discussions, training, and demonstration. Brochures remain the preferred vehicle for delivering support (Tab. 9)."
22273395	BACKGROUND: : Tuberculosis (TB) constitutes one-quarter of all avoidable deaths in developing countries. In the Eastern Cape, South Africa, TB is a public health problem of epidemic proportion. Poor compliance and frequent interruption to treatment are associated with increased transmission rates, morbidity, and costs to TB control programs. This study explored determinants of (non-)compliance from the patients' perspective. METHODS: : Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients (33 treatment compliers and 34 treatment non-compliers) and 14 community health workers from local community clinics and the hospital in the township of Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Q-methodology was used. Patients rank ordered 32 opinion statements describing determinants of treatment compliance from the TB adherence model. By-person factor analysis was used to explore patterns in the rankings of statements by compliers and non-compliers. These patterns were interpreted and described as patient views on determinants of compliance with treatment. Patients and community health workers selected the top five determinants of compliance and non-compliance. RESULTS: : Compliers believed that completing treatment would cure them of TB. Economic prospects were crucial for compliance. Compliers felt that the support of the government disability grant helped with compliance. Non-compliers believed that stigmatization had the greatest impact on non-compliance, together with the burden of disease, the arrangements involved with receiving treatment, restrictions accompanying treatment, and the association of TB with HIV/AIDS infection. CONCLUSIONS: : Stigmatization makes TB a 'social disease'. Individual motivation and self-efficacy appear to have a considerable effect on compliance, but, for non-compliers, the general lack of job prospects and being able to provide for themselves or their family also makes TB very much an 'economic disease'.
31155271	Evidence that gender inequalities and restrictive norms adversely affect health is extensive; however, far less research has focused on testing solutions. We first comprehensively reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey literature for rigorously evaluated programmes that aimed to reduce gender inequality and restrictive gender norms and improve health. We identified four mutually reinforcing factors underpinning change: (1) multisectoral action, (2) multilevel, multistakeholder involvement, (3) diversified programming, and (4) social participation and empowerment. Following this review, because little research has investigated the effects of national-level law and policy reforms, we conducted original quasi-experimental studies on laws and policies related to education, work, and income, all social determinants of health in which deep gender inequalities exist. We examined whether the laws and policies significantly affected health outcomes and gender norms, and whether law-induced and policy-induced changes in gender norms mediated the health effects, in areas for which longitudinal data existed. Laws and policies that made primary education tuition-free (13 intervention countries with the law and/or policy and ten control countries without) and that provided paid maternity and parental leave (seven intervention and 15 control countries) significantly improved women's and their children's health (odds ratios [OR] of 1.16-2.10, depending on health outcome) and gender equality in household decision making (OR 1.46 for tuition-free and 1.45 for paid maternity and parental leave) as a proxy indicator of gender norms. Increased equality partially mediated the positive effects on health outcomes. We conclude by discussing examples of how improved governance can support gender-equitable laws, policies, and programmes, immediate next steps, and future research needs.
17261528	OBJECTIVES: To determine the preferences of French elderly inpatients concerning medical information and surrogate designation in life-threatening situations. METHODS: Intention-to-act questionnaire was completed by two geriatricians during a patient interview in the week following admission in three geriatric units in France. The participants were elderly patients (> or =70 years) with adequate cognitive performance for decision making as assessed by the Mini Mental State Examination. The impact of socio-demographic factors, level of confidence in medical care, cognitive or physical disability on surrogate designation and amount of medical information expected were measured. MEASUREMENTS: Impact of socio-demographic factors, level of confidence in medical care, cognitive or physical disability on surrogate designation and amount of medical information expected. RESULTS: 426 consecutive elderly patients were recruited. 32.6% wanted to receive complete information about their care and 77% declared they would want to be informed if they were in a life-threatening situation. 4.5% reported they would not want any medical information. A family member was designated as surrogate by 73% of the patients. In 28%, a second surrogate was also designated, usually the family physician (22%) or a member of the hospital medical staff (10%). Polytomous logistic regression analysis was used to assess determinants of the amount of information expected and social and medical parameters. MMSE score, the presence of physical disability, a low level of confidence in medicine and the presence of children were identified as independent determinants of a high level of information expectation. CONCLUSION: Elderly hospitalised patients expressed a strong desire to receive extensive information and were willing to designate a surrogate in a life-threatening situation. The surrogate was usually a family member alone or with another person, usually a practitioner.
15714217	OBJECTIVE: To outline the rationale, objectives and strategies used in a systematically designed research programmme to study specific weight gain-inducing behaviours, their social-psychological as well as environmental determinants, and the effects of interventions aimed at the prevention of weight gain. DESIGN: The evidence for potential behavioural determinants and strategies to prevent weight gain was reviewed, and the methods applied within the Netherlands Research programme weight gain prevention (NHF-NRG) project were described. The project is designed according to the Intervention Mapping protocol. SETTING: The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: The main target groups are (a) adolescents (12-16 y) in secondary school, (b) young adults (20-40 y) at the workplace and (c) recently retired people (55-65 y) at home. INTERVENTIONS: Each intervention includes an individual component, in which computer-tailored information is provided. Additionally, interventions are aimed at changing environmental components. RESULTS: The short-term results of this project can be expected by the beginning of 2005. Guidelines for nationwide weight gain prevention, based on this research programme, will become available in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the few interventions that were evaluated to date, no robust conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of obesity prevention. The systematic and multidisciplinary design of the NHF-NRG programme enables the identification of potentially effective methods and strategies for the prevention of weight gain.
20357354	There have been significant public health achievements in recent years; not only do people live longer and healthier lives, but there has also been a decline in communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and water-borne diseases, especially in developing countries like India. Although lifestylerelated problems are emerging globally, developing countries carry heavier burdens of poor health conditions, which is an issue of serious concern, in particular among marginalized populations. Reaching out to these groups is a global challenge, and particularly in India, where one-third of the population (between 250 and 300 million people) live in remote, difficult and vulnerable areas lacking basic amenities. In order to address the 'health for all' challenge, this Commentary advocates for the public, private and non-profit sectors to work together to implement innovative community-based approaches that address the various social determinants of health. The case of the Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI), a national NGO, is presented as an example of successful coordinated community and policy actions to improve health determinants in remote rural areas of India.
16351702	PURPOSE: To review the current literature about potential determinants of fruit and vegetable intakes and effective intervention strategies to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables among 6-12-year-old children. METHODS: A structured review of literature located in PubMed and Psychinfo electronic literature databases. RESULTS: Of all determinants, the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables and taste preferences were most consistently and most positively related to consumption. There was some evidence that parental fruit and vegetable intakes, knowledge of intake recommendations and skills had a positive association with children's intakes, whereas television viewing, exposure to television advertisement, and having a snack bar at school were associated with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables. Multi-component school-based interventions that combined classroom curriculum, parent and food service components showed the greatest promise for fruit and vegetable promotion among children. School fruit and vegetable subscription programmes, scout-based interventions, and fruit and vegetables education via computer multi-media channels also appear promising. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should improve the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables to children, and should aim to improve their taste preferences for them. Such interventions should be of a multi-component nature, school-based or use other social channels and may include multi-media channels.
19272301	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study is to identify predictors of current cigarette smoking in adolescents within the school, home, and broader social environment. METHOD: A two stage cluster sample design was used to select a representative sample of students from all middle and high schools in Cyprus in 2005-2006. Standardized Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) methodology was employed in administering the questionnaires and processing the results. Analyses were conducted using logistic regression with the outcome variable being current smoking. RESULTS: After adjusting for the effect of other predictors in the model, the strongest predictor of adolescent smoking was smoking peers. Having parents and grandparents that smoke, concerns about weight, access to pocket money, ease of buying cigarettes, owning an item with a cigarette logo on it, the belief that smokers are less attractive, and the false consensus effect all remain statistically significant predictors. CONCLUSION: In designing smoking prevention programs, factors pertaining to the school, social and familial circle of adolescents as well as misconceptions on the link between smoking and physical appearance need to be considered. Such programs can act as empowering tools to complement legal measures which need to be firmly enforced and constantly revised to be effective.
18397458	CONTEXT: The influences of gender and geography are increasingly being acknowledged as central to a comprehensive understanding of health. Since little research on rural women's health has been conducted, an in-depth qualitative approach is necessary to gain a better initial understanding of this population. PURPOSE: To explore the determinants of health and their influence on rural women's health. METHODS: From November 2004 to September 2005, 9 focus groups and 3 individual interviews were conducted in 7 rural southwestern Ontario communities. Sixty-five rural residents aged 26 years and older participated in the study. Semi-structured interview questions were used to elicit participants' perceptions regarding determinants of rural women's health. FINDINGS: Four Health Canada determinants (employment, gender, health services, and social environments) and 3 new determinants (rural change, rural culture, and rural pride) emerged as key to rural women's health. CONCLUSIONS: Although health determinants affect both urban and rural people, this qualitative study revealed that rural women experience health determinants in unique ways and that rural residents may indeed have determinants of their health that are particular to them. More research is needed to explore the nature and effects of determinants of health for rural residents in general, and rural women in particular.
31777338	BACKGROUND: Green spaces have been proposed to be a health determinant, improving health and wellbeing through different mechanisms. We aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence from longitudinal studies that have investigated green spaces and their association with all-cause mortality. We aimed to evaluate this evidence with a meta-analysis, to determine exposure-response functions for future quantitative health impact assessments. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies on green spaces and all-cause mortality. We searched for studies published and indexed in MEDLINE before Aug 20, 2019, which we complemented with an additional search of cited literature. We included studies if their design was longitudinal; the exposure of interest was measured green space; the endpoint of interest was all-cause mortality; they provided a risk estimate (ie, a hazard ratio [HR]) and the corresponding 95% CI for the association between green space exposure and all-cause mortality; and they used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as their green space exposure definition. Two investigators (DR-R and DP-L) independently screened the full-text articles for inclusion. We used a random-effects model to obtain pooled HRs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018090315. FINDINGS: We identified 9298 studies in MEDLINE and 13 studies that were reported in the literature but not indexed in MEDLINE, of which 9234 (99%) studies were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts and 68 (88%) of 77 remaining studies were excluded after assessment of the full texts. We included nine (12%) studies in our quantitative evaluation, which comprised 8 324 652 individuals from seven countries. Seven (78%) of the nine studies found a significant inverse relationship between an increase in surrounding greenness per 0.1 NDVI in a buffer zone of 500 m or less and the risk of all-cause mortality, but two studies found no association. The pooled HR for all-cause mortality per increment of 0.1 NDVI within a buffer of 500 m or less of a participant's residence was 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97; I(2), 95%). INTERPRETATION: We found evidence of an inverse association between surrounding greenness and all-cause mortality. Interventions to increase and manage green spaces should therefore be considered as a strategic public health intervention. FUNDING: World Health Organization.
14658092	AIM: The paper is aimed at investigating what the actual topics of social-psychiatric research in German speaking countries are. METHOD: German and international journals covering psychiatry and adjacent disciplines were screened for articles dealing with social-psychiatric topics. All in all, 426 relevant articles were identified and subjected to a content analysis. RESULT: Almost one third of all articles was dealing with research on mental health services. Another research area that was strongly represented was epidemiology. By contrast, articles devoted to the study of psycho-social causes of mental disorders and psycho-social determinants of its course were rather rare. DISCUSSION: Possible reasons for the observed trends in social-psychiatric research are discussed. Potential risks for social psychiatry resulting from a too one-sided emphasis on health service research are pointed out.
24044469	OBJECTIVES: To examine the socio-economic, behavioural and Metis-specific factors that predict obesity among Metis children aged 6 to 14 years. Socio-economic factors included household structure and income, parental education and food insecurity. Cultural factors included knowledge of an Aboriginal language, participation in cultural activities, time spent with Elders and parental residential school attendance. METHODS: The 2006 Aboriginal Peoples Survey, Children and Youth component collected data about Metis children, including child height and weight, reported by the person most knowledgeable about the child (PMK). Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to predict obesity, defined using IOTF BMI cut-offs. After testing for interactions, models were stratified by age (6-10, 11-14) and gender. RESULTS: An estimated 18.5% of Metis boys and 14.4% of girls were obese. The effects of socio-economic factors and region varied across age and gender groups, although living in a lone-parent family and rural residence had consistent effects. Many effects of cultural variables were unexpected. Although PMK residential schooling was positively associated with obesity generally, the effects were negative among older girls. As expected, children participating in frequent physical activity generally had lower risk, independent of other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although socio-economic factors are related to risk of obesity among Metis children, the effects may not be the same across age groups and for boys and girls. There is some evidence of independent effects of Metis-specific cultural factors, including parental residential schooling, on the risk of child obesity, but further investigation and better data are needed to understand these relationships.
25921954	BACKGROUND: currently, care providers and policy-makers internationally are working to promote normal birth. In Australia, such initiatives are being implemented without any evidence of the prevalence or determinants of normal birth as a multidimensional construct. This study aimed to better understand the determinants of normal birth (defined as without induction of labour, epidural/spinal/general anaesthesia, forceps/vacuum, caesarean birth, or episiotomy) using secondary analyses of data from a population survey of women in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: women who birthed in Queensland during a two-week period in 2009 were mailed a survey approximately three months after birth. Women (n=772) provided retrospective data on their pregnancy, labour and birth preferences and experiences, socio-demographic characteristics, and reproductive history. A series of logistic regressions were conducted to determine factors associated with having labour, having a vaginal birth, and having a normal birth. FINDINGS: overall, 81.9% of women had labour, 66.4% had a vaginal birth, and 29.6% had a normal birth. After adjusting for other significant factors, women had significantly higher odds of having labour if they birthed in a public hospital and had a pre-existing preference for a vaginal birth. Of women who had labour, 80.8% had a vaginal birth. Women who had labour had significantly higher odds of having a vaginal birth if they attended antenatal classes, did not have continuous fetal monitoring, felt able to 'take their time' in labour, and had a pre-existing preference for a vaginal birth. Of women who had a vaginal birth, 44.7% had a normal birth. Women who had a vaginal birth had significantly higher odds of having a normal birth if they birthed in a public hospital, birthed outside regular business hours, had mobility in labour, did not have continuous fetal monitoring, and were non-supine during birth. CONCLUSIONS: these findings provide a strong foundation on which to base resources aimed at increasing informed decision-making for maternity care consumers, providers, and policy-makers alike. Research to evaluate the impact of modifying key clinical practices (e.g., supporting womens mobility during labour, facilitating non-supine positioning during birth) on the likelihood of a normal birth is an important next step.
28065479	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several genome-wide-association-studies have identified genetic variants in a region on chromosome 9p21 that are associated with an increased risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Here we have explored the interaction of a genetic variant of the CDKN2A/B-rs10811661 gene locus with cardiovascular risk factors and environmental-exposures (e.g., diet and physical activity) in 1165 individuals recruited from the Mashhad-Stroke and Heart-Atherosclerotic-Disorders cohort. METHODS: Genotyping was carried out using TaqMan-real-time-PCR based method. The association of CDKN2A/B-rs10811661 locus and its interaction with dietary intake in association with the main determinants of dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular-risk-factors were assessed in 2 cohorts. RESULTS: Our data showed that obese subjects with a TT genotype had a higher level of TG, TG/HDL ratio and Hs-CRP, compared to the subjects with the wild type genotype, or individuals with a normal BMI. Moreover, the presence of a TT genotype was associated with increased risk of hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance and CVD. These effects were more pronounced in the sub-group with low physical activity and a high dietary energy intake (e.g., the interaction between TT genotype and total energy intake on serum cholesterol was positive (RERI: 0.2, 95%CI (-0.96-1.3), AP: 0.1, 95%CI (-0.5-0.7) and SI: 1.2, 95%CI (0.3-5.1))). CONCLUSIONS: We have found a significant association between the CDKN2A-rs10811661 polymorphism with cardiovascular risk factors and dyslipidemia in a non-diabetic population. It is possible that a low energy diet and high physical activity could ameliorate the unfavorable effects of T allele of CDKN2A/B locus. Functional analysis is warranted to investigate the value of this genetic biomarker of CVD risk in obese people.
27090246	BACKGROUND: According to existing research, unemployment is related to health problems. The causal relationship is not yet fully understood. This secondary data analysis aims to study the interdependencies between unemployment and health. METHODS: This study is based on data from the German Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) panel study comprising a sample of beneficiaries of the Federal Employment Agency and their household members as well as a representative household sample. A total of 12,570 persons (aged 15 to 64 years) from 8,392 households were interviewed in wave 7 (2013) of PASS. RESULTS: The employed and unemployed differ substantially in terms of socio-demographic and health-related characteristics. Unemployed persons more often report worse or bad self-rated health (unemployed men: 31.0 % vs. employed men: 14.0 %; unemployed women: 37.7 % vs. employed women: 21.7 %) and feel being rather or much impaired by mental problems (unemployed men: 21.9 % vs. employed men: 7.2 %; unemployed women: 20.4 % vs. employed women: 15.8 %). For the unemployed, the proportion with an officially certified severe disability as well as another severe health impairment is much higher. They also more often report at least one hospital stay in the previous 12 months (unemployed men: 16.3 % vs. employed men: 9.9 %; unemployed women: 19.6 % vs. employed women: 12.2 %) and more contacts with physicians. In spite of that, unemployed persons do less exercise. Multivariate, longitudinal, logistic regression models demonstrate strong health-related selection effects on labour market transitions. Lower self-rated health is associated with a higher unemployment risk for employed persons as well as a lower probability of reintegration for unemployed persons. The most influential determinants of bad self-rated health are self-rated health status in the year before, while job loss and re-employment tend to influence the occurrence of bad self-rated health. DISCUSSION: The analyses show substantial health disparities to the detriment of the unemployed. They also refer to a need for prevention regarding healthcare and employment.
25955675	BACKGROUND: Youth comprise a significant portion of the total immigrant population in Canada. Immigrant and refugee youth often have different migration trajectories and experiences, which can result in different mental health outcomes. Research is emerging in this area, but study findings have not yet been consolidated. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is known from the existing literature about mental health issues and concerns among immigrant and refugee youth in Canada? METHOD: We searched Embase, Health Star, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Social Science Abstracts databases for the period 1990-2013 for Canadian studies related to the mental health of youth born outside Canada. Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Determinants of mental illness included pre-migration experiences, number of years since immigration to Canada, post-migration family and school environment, in- and out-group problems, discrimination, and lack of equitable access to health care. Only a few common categories of mental illness were identified, and the burden of mental illness was shared differently across gender and immigration status, with female youth experiencing more mental health problems than male youth. Some studies identified fewer emotional and behavioural problems among refugee youth; others reported higher rates of psychopathology among refugee youth compared with their Canadian-born provincial counterparts. Pre-migration experiences and the kinds of trauma experienced were important for refugee youth's mental health. Findings also indicated the importance of family involvement, school settings as points of care and services, and in terms of timing, focusing on the first year of arrival in Canada. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Professionals must work across health, social, and settlement sectors to address the various pre- and post-migration determinants of mental health and illness, and provide more timely and effective services based on how and when these determinants affect different groups of youth.
18095183	OBJECTIVE: General practitioners and pharmacists do not properly educate their patients about the disadvantages of benzodiazepines. In order to increase and improve education, this study will investigate which psychological factors (i.e., beliefs, outcome expectation, social norm and self-efficacy) predict the intention to educate. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in which 339 general practitioners and 149 pharmacists in the Netherlands completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: The Results show that the above-mentioned factors play an important role in forming intentions to educate. However, differences exist between general practitioners and pharmacists. CONCLUSION: General practitioners and pharmacists intend to educate in cases where they think that benzodiazepines have well-defined disadvantages, when the education they undertake leads to success, when they feel pressure to educate from their surroundings and when they are capable of educating. Implications for practice These findings contribute to a better understanding of patient education and are of great value in developing new interventions to improve education.
17077436	BACKGROUND: Despite considerable research investigating the relationship between a long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and outcomes, there has been much less considering predictors of a long DUP. AIMS: To investigate the clinical and social determinants of DUP in a large sample of patients with a first episode of psychosis. METHOD: All patients with a first episode of psychosis who made contact with psychiatric services over a 2-year period and were living in defined catchment areas in London and Nottingham, UK were included in the AESOP study. Data relating to clinical and social variables and to DUP were collected from patients, relatives and case notes. RESULTS: An insidious mode of onset was associated with a substantially longer DUP compared with an acute onset, independent of other factors. Unemployment had a similar, if less strong, effect. Conversely, family involvement in help-seeking was independently associated with a shorter duration. There was weak evidence that durations were longer in London than in Nottingham. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that DUP is influenced both by aspects of the early clinical course and by the social context.
16700397	This study investigated the attitudes of Omani adolescents towards gender roles and women's empowerment in taking household decisions, and the determinants of their positive attitudes. A national representative secondary school-based sample of 1670 boys and 1675 girls completed a self-administrated questionnaire with 2 indices: Adolescents' Attitudes Towards Gender Roles and Adolescents' Attitudes Towards Women's Empowerment. Other questions included demographic data, risk behaviour lifestyle, proxies to mental health and social environments expected to predict attitudes towards gender role. Eight variables predicted higher scores in both indices: sex, age, socioeconomic class, sleep problems, self-esteem, current smoking, history of indulging in violent behaviour and parental relations.
18079335	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Previous studies of neighbourhood effects on ischaemic heart disease (IHD) have used census or administrative data to characterise the residential context, most commonly its socioeconomic level. Using the ecometric approach to define neighbourhood social interaction variables that may be relevant to IHD, neighbourhood social cohesion and safety were examined to see how they related to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality, after adjustment for individual and neighbourhood confounders. DESIGN: To construct social interaction variables, multilevel models were used to aggregate individual perceptions of safety and cohesion at the neighbourhood level. Linking data from the Health Survey in Scania, Sweden, and the Population, Hospital, and Mortality Registers, multilevel survival models were used to investigate determinants of AMI mortality over a three year and nine month period. PARTICIPANTS: 7791 Individuals aged 45 years and over. MAIN RESULTS: The rate of AMI mortality increased with decreasing neighbourhood safety and cohesion. After adjustment for individual health and socioeconomic variables, low neighbourhood cohesion, and to a lesser extent low safety, were associated with higher AMI mortality. Neighbourhood cohesion effects persisted after adjustment for various neighbourhood confounding factors (income, population density, percentage of residents from low-income countries, residential stability) and distance to the hospital. There was some evidence that neighbourhood cohesion effects on AMI mortality were caused by effects on one-day case-fatality, rather than on incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond commonly evoked effects of the physical environment, neighbourhood social interaction patterns may have a decisive influence on IHD, with a particularly strong effect on survival after AMI.
16821508	Many Americans do not have access to adequate medical care. Previous research on this problem focuses primarily on individual-level determinants of access such as income and insurance coverage. The role of community-level factors in helping or hindering individuals in obtaining needed medical care, however, has not received much attention. We address this gap in the literature by investigating the association between neighborhood residential instability and access to health care. Using individual-level data from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and block-group level data from the 2000 decennial census, we find that individuals who live in neighborhoods with high residential turnover have worse health care access than residents of other neighborhoods. This association persists even when the prevalence of poverty, the supply of health care, and a variety of individual characteristics are held constant. We offer explanations for these findings and suggest directions for future research.
19036043	BACKGROUND: The rates of initiation and duration of breastfeeding in France are low when compared with those in other European countries. The objective of this study was to determine attributions of breastfeeding determinants in a French population. METHODS: A self-report survey listing 68 reasons for or against breastfeeding was developed. Nine hundred nine participants from the general population rated their level of agreement with each reason by means of a Likert-type scale. The survey explored gender, age, parenthood, decision to breastfeed, having friends who had breastfed, having family members who had breastfed, and having been breastfed themselves when younger. Exploratory factorial analyses extracted six factors for breastfeeding and five factors against breastfeeding. All the factors were entered in regression analyses to predict demographic variables that determined attributions for and against breastfeeding. Individuals were measured at two points in time to account for test-retest reliability (28.1 days +/- 6.95 day lapse). RESULTS: Determinants varied significantly with respect to gender, age, parenthood, and breastfeeding history. High endorsement for breastfeeding involved breastfeeding to fulfill gender roles, to prevent health risks, and because of external encouragement; little endorsement was given for the physiological advantages for babies, pleasant sensations, and preference factors. In terms of not breastfeeding, high endorsement was observed in lack of support, negative attitudes, and infant formula reasoning factors; medical and physiological reasons for not breastfeeding showed low endorsement. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed a strong impact of society and cultural norms on feeding choice. If breastfeeding initiation and duration rates are to be increased, we suggest approaching the rest of the population in addition to pregnant women and mothers since society as a whole influences the decision to breastfeed.
18347970	This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine the extent to which school-level social and institutional factors moderate genetic tendencies to smoke cigarettes. Our analysis relies on a sub-sample of 1,198 sibling and twin pairs nested within 84 schools. We develop a multilevel modeling extension of regression-based quantitative genetic techniques to calculate school-specific heritability estimates. We show that smoking onset (h2 = .51) and daily smoking (h2 = .58) are both genetically influenced. Whereas the genetic influence on smoking onset is consistent across schools, we show that schools moderate the heritability of daily smoking. The heritability of daily smoking is the highest within schools in which the most popular students are also smokers and reduced within schools in which the majority of the students are non-Hispanic and white. These findings make important contributions to the literature on gene-environment interactions.
29888866	Breastfeeding is an important public health issue worldwide. Breastfeeding rates in the United Kingdom, particularly for exclusive breastfeeding, are low compared with other OECD countries, despite its wide-ranging health benefits for both mother and child. There is evidence that deprivation in the structural and social organisation of neighbourhoods is associated with adverse child outcomes. This study aimed to explore whether breastfeeding initiation, exclusive breastfeeding for at least 3 months, and any type of breastfeeding for at least 6 months were associated with neighbourhood context measured by neighbourhood deprivation and maternal neighbourhood perceptions in a nationally representative U.K. SAMPLE: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the Millennium Cohort Study. Logistic regression was carried out on a sample of 17,308 respondents, adjusting for individual- and familial-level socio-demographic characteristics. Neighbourhood deprivation was independently and inversely associated with breastfeeding initiation. Compared with the least deprived areas, the likelihood of initiating breastfeeding was 40% lower in the most deprived neighbourhoods (OR: 0.60, 95% CI [0.50, 0.72]). The relationship between both exclusive and any type of breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months respectively with neighbourhood deprivation after adjustment for potential confounders was not entirely linear. Breastfeeding initiation (OR: 0.78, 95% CI [0.71, 0.85]), exclusivity for 3 months (OR: 0.84, 95% CI [0.75, 0.95]), and any breastfeeding for 6 months (OR: 0.82, 95% CI [0.73, 0.93]) were each reduced by about 20% among mothers who perceived their neighbourhoods lacking safe play areas for children. Policies to improve breastfeeding rates should consider area-based approaches and the broader determinants of social inequalities.
26860192	"BACKGROUND: Tanzania's socio-economic development is challenged by sharp inequities between and within urban and rural areas, and among different socio-economic groups. This paper discusses the importance of strengthening SDH research, knowledge, relevant capacities and responsive systems towards addressing health inequities in Tanzania. METHODS: Based on a conceptual framework for building SDH research capacity, a mapping of existing research systems was undertaken between February and June 2012. It involved a review of national policies, strategies and published SDH-related research outputs from 2005 onwards, and 34 in-depth interviews with a range of stakeholders in Tanzania. RESULTS: The conceptualization of SDH varies considerably among stakeholders and their professional background, but with some consensus that it is linked to ""inequities"" being a consequence of poverty, poor planning, limited attention to basic humanity and citizenship rights, weak governance structures and inefficient use of available resources. Commonly perceived SDH factors include age, income, education, beliefs, cultural norms, gender, occupation, nutritional status, access to health care, access to safe water and sanitation and child bearing practices. SDH research is in its infancy but gaining momentum. In the absence of a specific ""SDH portfolio"", SDH research is scattered and hidden within disease specific, poverty-related research and research on universal health coverage. Research is mainly externally funded, which has implications on the focus of context specific SDH research, national priorities and transfer to policy. This create mismatch with population and research capacity needs. CONCLUSION: Most research analysis in the country fails to consider the context specific structural determinants of health and inequities towards a broader understanding of existing vulnerabilities. The challenge is on promoting a culture of critical inter-disciplinary research and analysis that is central to SDH research. Establishing a system to promote collaboration across sectors and strengthen collective capacities for individuals and institutions researching in SDH will augment existing SDH research initiatives and better inform appropriate intersectoral policies towards addressing prevailing health inequities across the country."
17157105	BACKGROUND: In France, the 1999 introduction of a dedicated emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) available without a prescription has resulted in a 72% increase in its use over the past 5 years, especially among younger women. METHODS: We used a population-based health survey conducted in 1999 and in 2004 to examine the changes in the determinants of lifetime ECP use among women aged between 15 and 24 years. We also explored the determinants and circumstances of recent use of ECPs in 2004 among women aged between 15 and 44 years who are at risk for unplanned pregnancy. RESULTS: In 1999, 14.6% of women aged between 15 and 24 years had ever used ECPs; this proportion rose to 31.7% in 2004. Results show consistent patterns of lifetime ECP use in 1999 and in 2004, with greater use among higher-educated women and women living in large cities. In 2004, 22% of women were using no contraceptive at the time they used ECPs and 84% resumed use of a regular contraceptive after ECP use. However, 5.5% had unprotected intercourse after taking ECPs in the same menstrual cycle and in the next. CONCLUSION: Despite direct pharmacy access, differences in ECP use remain by social and residential status. Emergency contraceptive pills were used as a backup method in case of contraceptive failure and did not impede the use of subsequent regular contraception.
19190572	As the prevalence of obesity rapidly climbs among youth in the United States, public health practitioners and policymakers seek effective means of slowing and reversing these trends. Recently, many state laws and regulations addressing childhood obesity have been introduced and enacted. Understanding determinants of such legislation may inform the development and passage of future policies. For this study, key-informant interviews were conducted with 16 legislators and staffers from 11 states in 2005-2006 to examine qualitative factors that enable and impede state-level childhood obesity prevention legislation. Commonly cited factors positively influencing the passage of childhood obesity prevention legislation included national media exposure, introduction of the policy by senior legislators, and gaining the support of key players including parents, physicians, and schools. Noteworthy barriers included powerful lobbyists of companies that produce unhealthy foods and misconceptions about legislating foods at schools. Although the total number of informants was modest, their valuable insights provide policymakers and practitioners with a set of enablers and barriers to be considered when pursuing state-level policy.
22935626	BACKGROUND: This article describes the rationale and design of a population-based survey of dementia in Valladolid (northwestern Spain). The main aim of the study was to assess the epidemiology of dementia and its subtypes. Prevalence of anosognosia in dementia patients, nutritional status, diet characteristics, and determinants of non-diagnosed dementia in the community were studied. The main sociodemographic, educational, and general health status characteristics of the study population are described. METHODS: Cross-over and cohort, population-based study. A two-phase door-to-door study was performed. Both urban and rural environments were included. In phase 1 (February 2009 - February 2010) 28 trained physicians examined a population of 2,989 subjects (age: >/= 65 years). The seven-minute screen neurocognitive battery was used. In phase 2 (May 2009 - May 2010) 4 neurologists, 1 geriatrician, and 3 neuropsychologists confirmed the diagnosis of dementia and subtype in patients screened positive by a structured neurological evaluation. Specific instruments to assess anosognosia, the nutritional status and diet characteristics were used. Of the initial sample, 2,170 subjects were evaluated (57% female, mean age 76.5 +/- 7.8, 5.2% institutionalized), whose characteristics are described. 227 persons were excluded for various reasons. Among those eligible were 592 non-responders. The attrition bias of non-responders was lower in rural areas. 241 screened positive (11.1%). DISCUSSION: The survey will explore some clinical, social and health related life-style variables of dementia. The population size and the diversification of social and educational backgrounds will contribute to a better knowledge of dementia in our environment.
26787421	BACKGROUND: Mexico is a developing country with one of the highest youth obesity rates worldwide; >34% of children and adolescents between 5 and 19 years of age are overweight or obese. OBJECTIVES: The current review seeks to compile, describe, and analyze dietary conditions, physical activity, socioeconomic status, and cultural factors that create and exacerbate an obesogenic environment among Mexican youth. DESIGN: A narrative review was performed using PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases, as well as grey literature data from the Mexican government, academics, and statistical reports from nongovernmental organizations, included in electronic formats. RESULTS: The recent socioeconomic and nutritional transition has resulted in reduced healthy meal options at public schools, high rates of sedentary lifestyles among adolescents, lack of open spaces and playgrounds, socioeconomic deprivation, false or misunderstood sociocultural traditional beliefs, misconceptions about health, a high percentage of overweight or obese adults, and low rates of maternal breastfeeding. Some of the factors identified are exacerbating the obesity problem in this population. Current evidence also shows that more policies and health programs are needed for prevention of childhood and adolescent obesity. Mexico presents alarming obesity levels, which need to be curtailed and urgently reversed. CONCLUSIONS: The present narrative review presents an overview of dietary, physical activity, societal and cultural preconceptions that are potentially modifiable obesity-promoting factors in Mexican youth. Measures to control these factors need to be implemented in all similar developing countries by governments, policy makers, stakeholders, and health care professionals to tackle obesity in children and young people.
31859950	INTRODUCTION: We aimed to analyze the relationship between visceral leishmaniasis mortality and social determinants of health (SDH). METHODS: This was an ecological study of all leishmaniasis-related deaths in Brazil, from 2001 to 2015. We analyzed 49 indicators of human development and social vulnerability. The association was tested using the classical and spatial regression model. RESULTS: Mortality was associated with indicators that expressed low human development and high social vulnerability: lack of garbage collection, low schooling, unemployment rate, low per capita income, and income inequality (Gini index). CONCLUSIONS: There was an association between high mortality by leishmaniasis and low SDH.
18036211	BACKGROUND: Health and well-being are the result of synergistic interactions among a variety of determinants. Family structure and composition are social determinants that may also affect health behaviours and outcomes. This study was performed to examine the associations between family structure and health and to determine the protective effects of support mechanisms to improve quality of health outcome. METHODS: Six hundred people, selected by multistage sampling to obtain a representative population of men and women aged 20-60 living in communities in Japan, were included in this study. Data regarding subjective views of one's own health, family structure, lifestyle and social support were collected through structured face-to-face interviews on home visits. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, height and weight were measured by trained examiners. The associations between family structure and health after controlling for demographics, lifestyle and social support were examined using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Subjects living alone were significantly more likely to be in ill health, as determined using the General Health Questionnaire, in comparison to those in extended families (OR = 3.14). Subjects living alone or as couples were significantly more likely to suffer from severe hypertension in comparison to those living in extended families (OR = 8.25, OR = 4.90). These associations remained after controlling for the influence of lifestyle. Subjects living only with spouse or in nuclear family had higher probabilities of mental ill health in the absence than in the presence of people showing concern for their well-being. CONCLUSION: The results of this study infers that a support mechanism consisting of companionship and the presence of family or other people concerned for one's well being acts as a buffer against deleterious influence of living in small family that will lead to improved quality of health outcome.
17151800	Engagement is a core component of effective educational programs for children with autism. Analysis of 711 naturalistic goal-directed classroom behaviors of four school-age children with autism and four comparable children with Down syndrome (DS) was conducted. The definition of engagement was expanded to include child compliance and congruence. A main finding was both child and environmental factors influenced type of engagement. Children with DS produced 20% more goal-directed behaviors that were both congruent and compliant compared to children with autism. Large group instruction was associated with less congruent engagement but more compliant engagement for children with autism. These findings suggest specific types of engagement which may lead to advances in developing evidence-based practices for specific developmental disorders.
26857719	Socioeconomic inequality and child maltreatment have not been studied using the concentration index as an indicator of inequality. The study aimed to assess the association of child maltreatment with socioeconomic status among schoolchildren in Qazvin province, Islamic Republic of Iran. In this cross-sectional study a questionnaire based on the ISPCAN Child Maltreatment Screening Tool-Children's Version and the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire was filled by 1028 children aged 9-14 years, selected through multistage stratified random sampling. The concentration indices for economic inequality were -0.086 for any type of child maltreatment and -0.155, -0.098 and -0.139 for the physical, psychological and neglect subtypes of maltreatment respectively. The number of children and the economic status of the family also showed a significant association with child maltreatment in all 3 subtypes. Appropriate planning for effective interventions for at-risk children of lower socioeconomic status should be considered by the relevant decision-makers.
17595548	Morgan, Zamora and Hindmarsh make a compelling case for a national strategy on chronic disease prevention and management. The truths raised in the lead paper are not particularly inconvenient, but they do raise a number of uncomfortable questions: (1) Why are physicians not taking a more responsible and active role to prevent and manage chronic diseases on behalf of their patients? (Physicians must recognize that it is their professional responsibility and their job to provide their patients with the appropriate level of care for chronic conditions.) (2) Why are non-physician healthcare providers not playing a larger role to prevent and manage chronic diseases? (3) Why is there a greater focus on managing chronic diseases than on preventing or delaying them from happening? (4) Have we forgotten the profound impact of the social determinants of health on illness, life expectancy and death?
31125067	OBJECTIVE: To examine trends of spontaneous very preterm birth (vPTB) and its relationship with maternal socioeconomic status and smoking. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study in Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, UK. The cohort was restricted to spontaneous singleton deliveries occurring in Aberdeen from 1985 to 2010. The primary outcome was very preterm birth which was defined as <32 weeks gestation and the comparison group was deliveries >/=37 weeks of gestation. The main exposures were parental Social Class based on Occupation, Carstairs' deprivation index and smoking during pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between vPTB and the exposures. RESULTS: There was an increased likelihood of vPTB in those with unskilled-occupations compared to professional-occupations [aOR:2.77 (95%CI:1.54-4.99)], in those who lived in the most deprived areas compared to those in the most affluent [aOR: 2.16 (95% CI: 1.27-3.67)] and in women who smoked compared to those who did not [aOR: 1.74 (95% CI: 1.36-2.21)]. The association with Carstairs index was no longer statistically significant when restricted to smokers but remained significant when restricted to non-smokers. CONCLUSION: The strongest risk factor for vPTB was maternal smoking while socioeconomic deprivation showed a strong association in non-smokers. Smoking cessation interventions may reduce vPTB. Modifiable risk factors should be explored in deprived areas.
30019306	INTRODUCTION: Hypercortisolism leads to severe clinical consequences persisting after the onset of remission. These physical sequelae of cortisol exposure are known to profoundly impact the patient's quality of life. As psychological factors may be correlated with this quality of life, our objective was to determine the specific weight of psychological determinants of quality of life in patients in remission from hypercortisolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an observational study, 63 patients with hypercortisolism in remission were asked to complete exhaustive self-administered questionnaires including quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF and Cushing QoL), depression, anxiety, self-esteem, body image, and coping scales. Multivariate analyses were performed. Psychological variables relevant to the model were: anxiety, depression, self-esteem, body image, and positive thinking dimension of the Brief-COPE. Cortisol deficiency was defined as a potential confounder. RESULTS: The median time since remission was 3 years. Patients had significantly lower quality of life and body satisfaction score than the French population and patients with chronic diseases. Depression significantly impaired all WHOQoL and Cushing QoL domains. A low body satisfaction score significantly impaired social relationships quality of life score. In total, 42.9% of patients still needed working arrangements, 19% had disability or cessation of work. CONCLUSION: Patients in biological remission of hypercortisolism can rarely be considered as functionally cured: this is evidenced by altered quality of life, working arrangements, and chronic depression. A multidisciplinary management of these patients is thus mandatory on a long-term basis.
21110000	PURPOSE: European studies about ethnic inequalities in depressive symptoms are scarce, show inconclusive results and are complicated by the discussion of what constitute (im)migrant and ethnic minority groups. Moreover, comparisons across countries are hampered by a lack of comparable measures of depressive symptoms. This study aims to assess the prevalence and determinants of depressive symptoms among immigrants, ethnic minorities and natives in 23 European countries. METHODS: Multilevel analyses are performed using data from the third wave of the European Social Survey (ESS-3). This dataset comprises information about 36,970 respondents, aged 21 years or older, of whom 13.3% immigrants and 6.2% ethnic minorities. Depressive symptoms were assessed with an 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale. Main determinants are immigrant status, socio-economic conditions and the experience of ethnic discrimination in the host country. RESULTS: The results show that immigrants and ethnic minorities do experience more depressive symptoms than natives in an essential part of the countries. Moreover, socio-economic conditions and the experience of ethnic discrimination are important risk factors. Immigrant status seems irrelevant, once the other risk factors are accounted for. Finally, immigrant and ethnic minority groups do not consist of the same individuals and therefore have different prevalence rates of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms are higher for immigrant and ethnic minority groups in a substantial part of the European countries. A clear definition is indispensable for developing policies that address the right-targeted population.
21391962	BACKGROUND. Although recent research has provided evidence for the predictive validity of personality traits in academic settings, the path to an improved understanding of the nature of personality influences on academic achievement involves a reconceptualization of both criterion and predictor construct spaces. AIMS. For the criterion space, one needs to consider student behaviours beyond grades and level of educational attainment, and include what the student does among other things outside of the classroom. For the predictor space, it is possible to bring some order to the myriad personality constructs that have been developed over the last century, by focusing on common variance among personality and other non-ability traits. METHODS. We review these conceptual issues and several empirical studies. CONCLUSIONS. We demonstrate the possible increments in understanding non-ability determinants of academic achievement that may be obtained by focusing on areas where there is a theoretical convergence between predictor and criterion spaces.
19655628	Global warming, the depletion of the world'snatural resources, and excessive consumer consumption in developed countries are determinants reshaping the way we live our everyday lives. These factors are rapidly giving rise to new ecological paradigms of environmental stewardship and in healthcare environments that express sustainable theories and practices. This has given rise to a systematic system for promoting and assessing the energy performance and efficiency of healthcare facilities known as Leadership in Energy Efficient Environmental Design (LEED), and a parallel certification program, the Green Guide for Heath Care. These developments are examined in direct relation to the functions of managerial ethics. A series of ten sustainability-based ethical dilemmas are presented. Each is examined in relation to the need to inculcate in future healthcare administrators a critical understanding and appreciation of the need to reposition contemporary healthcare organizations at the center--as leading civic participants and role models in relation to the emerging movement towards carbon neutrality in the healthcare industry.
10750613	BACKGROUND: To investigate social variation in birthweight and length of gestation in Estonia in the period of transition to a democracy and market economy. METHODS: All live births resulting from singleton pregnancies reported to the Estonian Medical Birth Registry in 1992-1997 (n = 84, 629) were studied with respect to social variation in birthweight and preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation). The results were adjusted for maternal age, parity, education, nationality, marital status, smoking in pregnancy, sex of the infant (and gestational age). RESULTS: Between 1992 and 1997, mean birthweight increased from 3,465g to 3,497g (P < 0.001) and the preterm rate fell from 5.8% to 5.1% (P = 0.001). Maternal education, marital status and nationality were all independently related to the mean birthweight and the risk of preterm birth. The mean difference in birthweight between children of mothers with basic and university education was 87 g (95% CI : 74-100). Children born to mothers of non-Estonian compared to Estonian nationality were on average 77 g lighter (95% CI: 70-84). While the effect of nationality and marital status on birthweight was relatively stable during the study period, differences in birth outcome by maternal education became stronger. CONCLUSIONS: The mean birthweight increased and the preterm rate decreased in Estonia as a whole during the transition. However, the improvements were not shared equally by all social groups. An increase in variation in birthweight by maternal education was particularly notable.
21563624	This study examines healthy public policy development in three European countries representing different welfare regimes: England representing the liberal model; Norway, the social democratic model; and the Netherlands, the corporatist model. National policy documents were used for the analysis. In England and Norway, health promotion has a prominent place and there is a political focus on the broader determinants of health. However, while the Norwegian policies have an explicit focus on the social gradient, the English policies have a much clearer focus on disadvantaged groups and geographic areas. In the Netherlands, the main focus is on disease prevention and risk behaviors. In the Netherlands and England there is a strong focus on the free will of the population in changing unhealthy lifestyles. By analyzing the different policies in the light of Esping-Andersen's typology of welfare state regimes, it is possible to better understand the differences among the countries. While all types of regimes seem willing to develop targeted measures, the social democratic regime seems the most willing to also develop structural measures addressing the wider social determinants of health.
31849539	Menopause is one of the most important reproductive health issues of women. Because of rising life expectancy, by the year 2030, the global population of menopausal women is expected to include 1.2 billion people. The purpose of the present study is to provide a comprehensive assessment of existing studies on the relationship between social determinants of health and menopause to attract the attention of researchers and health providers to this critical issue. In present integrative review, articles for menopause published from Jan 1990 to Jan 2019 in databases including MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Google Scholar, IranDoc, IranMedex, MagIran and SID in English and Persian languages were extracted. After the assessment of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 40 articles were selected and reviewed. Some social determinants of health are related to the health of women in menopause. Cultural factors, lifestyles (nutrition, exercise, tobacco use, etc.), family support, educational level, employment, economic status, marital status, and the number of pregnancies and childbirth are among the social determinants of health that present research assessed them. The need for education, improving emotional and social support, planning for lifestyle enhancement, and improving socio-economic status is felt, which results in promoting women's health during menopause.
10910423	The authors examined the determinants and consequences of impaired functioning in older schizophrenic persons by adapting a model of impairment developed by Berkman and Gurland. The sample consisted of 117 persons age 55 or older with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia. In logistic-regression analysis, the overall model attained significance in predicting functional impairment, and three predictor variables-abnormal movements, use of antiparkinsonian agents, and negative symptoms-attained independent significance. Functional impairment had a direct effect on two of the seven resultant variables, community activities and self-health, and an indirect effect on two other resultant variables, depression and life satisfaction. Thus, the Berkman-Gurland Model has potential usefulness for exploring functioning impairment among older schizophrenic persons. Moreover, the variables that have the greatest impact on functional impairment are potentially remediable.
31162863	"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of nurses caring for socially at-risk patients and gain an understanding of the challenges nurses face when providing care. BACKGROUND: Nurses play a pivotal role in caring for hospitalised patients with social risk factors and preparing them for discharge. Few studies have explored whether acute care nurses are adequately supported in their practice environments to address the unique needs of socially at-risk patients as they transition back into community settings. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study of nurses working in a large urban academic medical centre. METHODS: We conducted six semi-structured focus groups of nurses (n = 21). Thematic content analysis was performed to analyse the transcripts from the focus groups. We adhered to COREQ guidelines for reporting this qualitative study. RESULTS: Six key themes emerged: (a) nurses' assessments of social risk factors, (b) experiences providing care, (c) barriers to care, (d) fear of ""labelling"" socially at-risk patients, (e) unmet social care needs and (f) recommendations to improve care. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that nurses are able to identify social risk factors. However, prioritisation of medical needs during acute care hospitalisation and lack of organisational supports may deter nurses from fully addressing social concerns. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Acute care nurses should be involved in the development of future efforts to address the needs of socially at-risk patients and be provided with additional supports in their practice environments. This could include continuing education to build nursing competencies in community-based care and social vulnerability."
23704847	Social determinants of health are the conditions in which individuals are born, grow, live, work, and age. Increasingly, they are being recognized for their relationship to the soaring incidence of Type 2 diabetes in the US, as well as the opportunities they present for us to counter it. Many current Type 2 diabetes interventions focus on biologic and behavioral factors, such as symptoms, diet, and physical activity. However, it is equally important to address the influence of physical and social environments, which may include low income, employment insecurity, low educational attainment, and poor living conditions, on health outcomes. Section 4302 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 offers an opportunity to improve data collection and policy development to more effectively identify populations at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes and to proactively refer them to appropriate social support services that may ultimately support reduction of health disparities. Expanding the scope of this legislation to include data that incorporate social determinants would improve the ability of clinicians and health systems to engage and to treat patients with chronic conditions, such as Type 2 diabetes, while expanding policymakers' ability to conform to the legislation's intent of shaping efforts to reduce chronic conditions nationwide.
28103072	To systematically improve population health in the United States, community health records (CHRs) must be defined, developed, and implemented. Like electronic and personal health records, CHRs have both unique and overlapping information. CHRs contain data about communities, including the social, physical, and lifestyle determinants of health. These records will serve to complement electronic and personal health records to provide a more complete view of population health, allowing stakeholders to target community health and quality-of-life interventions in a data-driven and evidence-based manner, establishing the basis from which organizations can develop a systematic approach to improving community health. This commentary calls on the United States to conduct a set of consensus activities to define and implement CHRs.
29106530	Aim: Multimorbidity is a growing phenomenon in primary care, and knowledge of the influence of social determinants on its evolution is vital. The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between multimorbidity and immigration, taking into account length of residence in the host country and area of origin of the immigrant population. Methods: Cross-sectional retrospective study of all adult patients registered within the public health service of Aragon, Spain (N = 1092279; 144238 were foreign-born), based on data from the EpiChron Cohort. Age-standardized prevalence rates of multimorbidity were calculated. Different models of binary logistic regressions were conducted to study the association between multimorbidity, immigrant status and length of residence in the host country. Results: The risk of multimorbidity in foreign-borns was lower than that of native-borns [odds ratio (OR): 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-0.55]. The probability of experiencing multimorbidity was lowest for Asians (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.31-0.37) and Eastern Europeans (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.40-0.43), and highest for Latin Americans (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.68-0.72). Foreign-born immigrants residing in Aragon for >/=5 years had a higher multimorbidity risk than those residing for <5 years (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 2.2-2.4). Conclusion: Prevalence of multimorbidity is lower among foreign-borns as compared with native-borns, but increases rapidly with length of residence in the host country. However, the progressive development of multimorbidity among immigrants varies widely depending on area of origin. These findings provide important insight into the health care needs of specific population groups and may help minimize the negative impact of multimorbidity among the most vulnerable groups.
18477747	"BACKGROUND: This paper analyses gender inequalities in health status and in social determinants of health among the elderly in western Europe. METHODS: Data came from the first wave of the ""Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe"" (2004). For the purposes of this study a subsample of community-residing people aged 65-85 years with no paid work was selected (4218 men and 5007 women). Multiple logistic regression models separated by sex and adjusted for age and country were fitted. RESULTS: Women were more likely to report poor health status, limitations in mobility and poor mental health. Whereas in both sexes educational attainment was associated with the three health indicators, household income was only related to poor self-rated health among women. The relationship between living arrangements and health differed by gender and was primarily associated with poor mental health. In both sexes, not living with their partner but living with other people and being the household head was related to poor mental health status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.14; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.14 for men and aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.72 for women). In addition, women living with their partner and other(s) and those living alone were more likely to report poor mental health status (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.41 and aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities persist among the elderly. Women have poorer health status than men and in both sexes the risk of poor health status increases among those with low educational attainment. Living arrangements are primarily associated with poor mental health status with patterns that differ by gender."
17686686	"The power of words to affect international and domestic health policy, both proposal and implementation, is analyzed. The complexity of the implication for social programs related to ""allied health,"" ""social security,"" ""pandemics,"" ""induced abortion,"" and numerous others is illustrated with colorful linguistic references. The present use of emotionally charged themes to categorize and polarize issues receives special attention in this second of a two-part series of articles."
26347090	Numerous studies have documented the determinants of sexual behavior among adolescents in less-developed countries, yet relatively little is known about the influence of social contexts such as school and neighborhood. Using two waves of data from a school-based longitudinal survey conducted in Malawi from 2011-13, this study advances our understanding of the relationship between school-level socioeconomic contexts and adolescents' sexual activity. The results from two-level multinomial logistic regression models suggest that high socioeconomic composition of the student body in school decreases the odds of initiation of sexual activity, independent of other important features of schools and individual-level characteristics. This study also finds that the association between school socioeconomic composition and sexual activity is statistically significant among male adolescents but not female adolescents, suggesting that schools' socioeconomic contexts may be more relevant to male adolescents' initiation of sexual activity.
26880296	BACKGROUND: Further increases in life expectancy in high-income countries depend to a large extent on advances in old-age survival. We aimed to characterise the spatial distribution of old-age survival across small areas of Europe, and to identify areas with significantly high or low survivorship. METHODS: This study incorporated 4404 small areas from 18 European countries. We used a 10-year survival rate to express the proportion of population aged 75-84 years who reached 85-94 years of age (beyond average life expectancy). This metric was calculated for each gender using decennial census data (1991, 2001 and 2011) at small geographical areas. To address problems associated with small areas, rates were smoothed using a Bayesian spatial model. Excursion sets were defined to identify areas with significantly high (>95th centile) and low (<5th) survival. RESULTS: In 2011, on average, 47.1% (range: 22.5-71.5) of the female population aged 75-84 years had reached 85-94 years of age, compared to 34.2% (16.4-49.6) of the males. These figures, however, hide important and time-persistent spatial inequalities. Higher survival rates were concentrated in northern Spain, Andorra and northeastern Italy, and in the south and west of France. Lower survival was found in parts of the UK, Scandinavia and the Netherlands, and in some areas of southern Europe. Within these regions, we detected areas with significantly high and low old-age survival. CONCLUSIONS: Clear and persistent spatial inequalities in old-age survival exist, suggesting that European social unity is still to be accomplished. These inequalities could arise from a myriad of population health determinants (eg, poverty, unhealthy lifestyles), which merit further study.
30238061	Introduction: In a randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI) combined with enhanced community services (MI + ECS) was compared with ECS alone for reducing dental caries in American Indian children on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The intervention was developed and delivered with extensive tribal collaboration. Methods: A total 579 mother-newborn dyads were enrolled and randomized to the MI + ECS and ECS groups. They were followed for 36 mo. Four MI sessions were provided, the first shortly after childbirth and then 6, 12, and 18 mo later. Both groups were exposed to ECS, which included public service announcements through billboards and tribal radio, as well as broad distribution of brochures on behavioral risk factors for early childhood caries (ECC), toothbrushes, and toothpaste. MI impact was measured as decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces (dmfs). Secondary outcomes included decayed surfaces, caries prevalence, and maternal oral health knowledge and behaviors. Modified intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Eighty-eight percent of mothers completed at least 3 of 4 MI sessions offered. Results: After 3 y, dmfs was not significantly different for the 2 groups (MI + ECS = 10, ECS = 10.38, P = 0.68). In both groups, prevalence of caries experience was 7% to 9% after 1 y, 35% to 36% at 2 y, and 55% to 56% at 3 y. Mean knowledge scores increased by 5.0, 5.3, and 5.9 percentage points at years 1, 2, and 3 in the MI + ECS group and by 1.9, 3.3, and 5.0 percentage points in the ECS group (P = 0.03), respectively. Mean maternal oral health behavior scores were not statistically significantly different between the treatment arms. Conclusion: In summary, the MI intervention appeared to improve maternal knowledge but had no effect on oral health behaviors or on the progression of ECC (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01116726). Knowledge Transfer Statement: The findings of this study suggest that motivational interviewing focusing on parental behaviors may not be as effective as previously hoped for slowing the development of childhood caries in some high-risk groups. Furthermore, social factors may be even more salient determinants of oral health than what we previously supposed, perhaps interfering with the capacity to benefit from behavioral strategies that have been useful elsewhere. The improvement of children's oral health in high-risk populations characterized by poverty and multiple related life stresses may require more holistic approaches that address these formidable barriers.
18681817	BACKGROUND: Gender-sensitive tobacco control policies are being challenged, and new directions are being sought because public health efforts have reduced cigarette consumption more substantially among men than among women. To better target women, it would help to identify the protective cultural factors that promote resiliency in women and discourage them from smoking. Whereas western cultures have generated a great deal of gender-specific research and programs on the prevention of smoking in women, Asian cultures have not. Taking a personal and sociocultural perspective, this study examines the effect of gender on smoking behaviors in Taiwan. METHODS: In a 2004 cross-sectional random-sampled interview survey, 827 adult men and 90 adult women smokers in Taiwan were queried about the time they began smoking, maintenance of their habits, and their readiness to change. RESULTS: The male/female smoking rate ratio was 9.5 (45.7% vs. 4.8%). Men smoked significantly more cigarettes per day than women (18 vs. 11). We found Taiwanese women started smoking around 20 years old, much later than their western counterparts. We also found that whereas the smoking behavior of the men was very sensitive to social environment and structural factors, that of women revolved around their desire to control their weight and handle their emotions. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the smoking behavior of men and women are a result of a different sociocultural environment and the life trajectories and social circumstances embedded within it. Comprehensive tobacco control policies need to be tailored to not just smoking behavior alone or one population alone but to the determinants of smoking behavior in specific groups, for example, women. Even when targeting women, some effort may be needed on targeting women of different ethnicities, for instance, Asian women in whom the prevalence is increasing at alarming rates.
28583185	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of undernutrition is decreasing in many parts of the developing world, but challenges remain in many countries. The objective of this study was to determine factors influencing childhood nutrition status in Kenya and Zambia. The objective of this study is to determine factors associated with temporal changes in childhood nutritional status in two countries in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Data from national demographic and health surveys from the World Bank for Kenya (1998-2009) and Zambia (1996-2014) were used to select the youngest child of each household with complete data for all variables studied. Multiple linear regression analyses were used for data from 2902 and 11,335 children from Kenya and Zambia, respectively, in each year to determine the relationship between social and economic factors and measures of nutritional status, including wasting, stunting, and overweight. RESULTS: There was a decreased prevalence of stunting (35% in Kenya and 40% in Zambia), while the prevalence of wasting was unchanged (6-8% in both countries). From 1998 to 2009, there was a protective effect against stunting for wealthier families and households with electricity, for both countries. Finally, better educated mothers were less likely to have stunted children and girls were less likely to be stunted than boys. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data analyzed, there was a higher risk of stunting in both Kenya and Zambia, for those with lower literacy, less education, no electricity, living in rural areas, no formal toilet, no car ownership, and those with an overall lower wealth index. Improving the education of mothers was also a significant determinant in improving the nutritional status of children in Kenya and Zambia. More broad-based efforts to reduce the prevalence of undernutrition need to focus on reducing the prevalence of undernutrition without promoting excess weight gain. Future economic advances need to consider integrated approaches to improving economic standings of households without increasing the risk for overnutrition.
10907657	This study of 72 undergraduate men examined the effects of two determinants of cardiovascular response-active coping and vigilance-on blood pressure and heart rate responses to social stressors. Observation of a future debate partner (i.e., vigilance) evoked larger increases in blood pressure than did observation of a less relevant person, apparently through the combination of increases in cardiac output and vascular resistance. Preparation and enactment of efforts to exert social influence (i.e., active coping) evoked heightened blood pressure and heart rate responses through increased cardiac contractility and output. Thus, both vigilance and active coping in social contexts increased cardiovascular reactivity, but apparently through different psychophysiological processes.
17558245	PURPOSE: This study explored the influence of social support on a prognostic indicator among cardiac patients, exercise tolerance. The relationship of sociodemographic factors to social support was examined, as well as the role of social support as a potential mediator between sociodemographic factors and exercise tolerance. METHODS: Archival data were collected from a sample of 254 men referred to cardiac rehabilitation. An exercise tolerance test was completed upon entry into cardiac rehabilitation, after 14 weeks, and after 9 months. RESULTS: Sociodemographic factors and social support reported upon entry into the cardiac rehabilitation program were related to initial and post-cardiac rehabilitation exercise tolerance, after controlling for admitting diagnoses, medical history, smoking, and perceived severity of illness. Overall, 28% of the variance in exercise tolerance was explained at baseline, 19% at 14 weeks, and 20% at 9 months. Specifically, older individuals had poorer exercise tolerance, whereas those with more income had better exercise tolerance. Social support was positively related to exercise tolerance at all 3 times. Older men reported less social support than younger men did, and those with more income reported more social support. However, social support did not mediate the relationship between sociodemographic factors and exercise tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the potential use of broad social factors in examining the determinants of prognostic factors for heart patients.
27462645	BACKGROUND: Medical and health advances have led to relative increases in human longevity and elderly population. Common diseases in elders can be prevented using healthy lifestyle. Identifying current status of the elderly is necessary to design educational intervention programs to improve their health and quality of life. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the lifestyle of the elderly in Islamshar (suburban of Tehran). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive - analytical study conducted among 480 elderly people over 60 years old referred to Islamshahr Health Center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences for a period of 12 months in 2012-2013. Data were collected through at two-part questionnaire including sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and healthy lifestyle instrument. Healthy lifestyle of the elderly was assessed using a 46 items self-report standard instrument with five subscales reflecting domains including exercise, nutrition, prevention, stress management, and social relationship. Finally, the data obtained were analyzed using the SPSS 18 software using an independent t-test, analysis of variance and ordinal logistic regression test at a significant level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: Mean score of total healthy lifestyle was 148.56 +/- 11.5. Men and women scored 151.95 +/- 11.15 and 145 +/- 10.32, respectively (P < 0.001). 76.2% of participants had moderately healthy lifestyle, and 23.8% had desirable healthy lifestyle. Marital status and gender were important factors in elderly healthy lifestyle. DISCUSSION: The status of a healthy lifestyle among the elderly in Islamshar was relatively moderate. However, more studies are needed for further information to confirm study results. Study results were posed the necessity of tailoring specific interventional programs to achieve desirable healthy lifestyle.
16443314	This study examines the physical, behavioral, emotional and social determinants of self-rated health among Chinese older persons, and investigates if the effect of social support varies by gender. A representative sample of 1589 elderly community dwellers in Hong Kong were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Gender difference in the effect of social support was tested by an interaction term, 'gender x social support', in a hierarchical regression analysis. The frequency of falling ill, the number of chronic illnesses, sleep quality, mobility and positive emotions were most important determinants of self-rated health. The effect of social support was completely redundant when these factors were taken into account. The interaction term 'gender x social support' was significant and indicated a stronger effect for women, but the effect size was negligible (adding only 0.3% to the explained variance). This suggests that the effect of social support by and large is gender free. These findings suggest a high degree of similarity in the determinants of self-rated health between Western and Chinese older populations.
16432486	Heterosexual transmission of HIV in the United States appears to be following the epidemiologic pattern of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as syphilis and gonorrhea, disproportionately affecting blacks in the Southeastern region. Nationwide, rates of syphilis and gonorrhea are nearly 30 times higher in blacks than in whites, and this racial disparity underlies most of the regional and county-level differences in rates. The racial disparity cannot be explained by traditional measures of socioeconomic differences, and it cannot be explained by individual-level determinants of sexual behavior, but rather reflects deeper group-level social and environmental factors for which race is a marker. A theoretical model based on previous ecologic studies is proposed to explain the relationship between racial discrimination and elevated rates of STDs in blacks. Key factors in the model include: 1) chronic joblessness, 2) drug and alcohol marketing, 3) social disorganization (or social capital), and 4) male incarceration.
26495261	BACKGROUND: Smoking among the youth is an important public health concern. Although several studies have investigated the correlates of smoking behavior, no theory-based study has particularly assessed this problem among medical students. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict smoking behavior among a sample of Iranian medical students. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study carried out in Ahvaz, Iran, 2014. The data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire, which included items on demographics, smoking behavior, and components of the TPB model (attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, and intention), and an added construct on smoking refusal skill. Data were analyzed using descriptive correlation, and linear regression statistics by SPSS, version 16. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy medical students with a mean age of 21.25 (SD = 2.9) years were enrolled in the study. Of them, 24 (13.5%) students were smokers. All components of the TPB model and smoking refusal skill were statistically significant as to intention to smoke (P < 0.001). The TPB constructs with and without smoking refusal skill accounted for 77% (adjusted R2) and 78% of the variance observed for intention to smoke, respectively. The results also revealed the highest weight for perceived behavior control (beta= -0.40). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicated that all TPB variables are useful tools for prediction of the smoking behaviors among students. Particularly, students' perceived behavioral control and attitudes towards smoking were found to be important determinants of smoking intentions. Thus, the findings could be used for planning effective tobacco control programs targeting University students.
30706792	BACKGROUND: The present study examined the efficacy of the walking program on biochemical parameters among the elderly women. METHODS: A total of one hundred elderly women participated in this randomized clinical trial study. The intervention group attended a 24-week walking exercise meeting five times per week. The control group continued with their routine activities. The subjects were assessed in Fasting blood glucose (FBS) and lipid profile before and after 12 and 24 weeks of the program. RESULTS: The mean age of the elderly participants in the study was 68.33 +/- 4.55 years. The results of repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant difference between the intervention and the control group in FBS, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after completing the program (for all p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The low-cost physical activity intervention could be effective for reducing chronic vascular disease risk factors among community-dwelling elderly women.
17056454	OBJECTIVE: There might be a difference between non-working and working women in their perception of rights and privileges which may influence their contraceptive behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine contraceptive behavior among non-working and working women in Bangladesh determining associated factors. METHOD: Analysis was based on data from the 1999-2000 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey which employs nationally representative sample. RESULTS: The prevalence of current contraceptive use (any method) was 58.2% among non-working women and 65.5% among working women. Both rates are still low for the country. Some factors, such as discussed family planning with husband, husband approves family planning, desire for more children, and husband lives together, were influential determinants of lower contraceptive prevalence among the non-working women. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a necessity for social activities promoting husband-wife communication and women's participation in employment to enhance the use of contraceptives among Bangladeshi women, especially non-working women.
17097354	The purpose of this study was to define the influence of fatigue, depression, and clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. The study was performed on 103 adult patients who visited Erciyes University Epilepsy Outpatient Clinic between 2004 and 2005. Patients were evaluated with the Form of Negotiation, Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-89), Beck Depression Inventory, and Fatigue Severity Scale. Mean age of the patients was 34.3+/-12.6, and mean duration of disease was 12.6+/-9.3 years. Among these patients, 52.4% were men, 49.5% were married, 15.5% had a university education, 53.4% had low incomes, 45.6% had generalized seizures, and 35.0% had experienced one or more seizures per month during the preceding year. The most significant variables in the domain of Overall quality of life were seizure frequency (P<0.001), depression (P<0.001), and fatigue (P<0.001); the variables in the domain of Mental Health were seizure frequency (P<0.001) and fatigue (P<0.001); the variable in the Cognitive domain was fatigue (P<0.001); the variables in the domain of Physical Health were social insurance coverage (P<0.01), fatigue (P<0.01), and age (P<0.01); the variables in the Epilepsy Targeted domain were depression (P<0.001), seizure frequency (P<0.001), and fatigue (P<0.01). Although quality of life has multiple determinants, seizure frequency, fatigue, and depression are the most important factors affecting quality of life in patients with epilepsy. One or more seizures per month, severe fatigue, and depression are associated with lower quality of life in some but not all domains. Partial correlations demonstrated that fatigue was a significant independent predictor of quality of life. The present study confirms that fatigue can be a powerful predictor of quality of life.
19652692	During the past several decades, smoking prevalence among youth has fluctuated in puzzling and unexpected ways. To help understand these changes, this study tests seven explanations: (a) compositional changes, (b) sample selection, (c) adult smoking, (d) social strain, (e) cigarette prices, (f) tobacco advertising, and (g) other drug use. Figures on smoking prevalence come from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Surveys from 1976-2002, whereas figures on aggregate determinants for the same time period come from government publications. Graphs of the time-series trends to determine temporal correspondence and time-series regression models to test for statistical influence reveal two variables that have expected effects. Increases in cigarette prices reduce smoking, particularly in the most recent years, and higher marijuana initiation (or use) is associated with greater smoking during most of the time period. However, much of the change in youth smoking, particularly the most recent rise and fall, remains unexplained.
26432655	Many governments make use of private finance contracts to deliver healthcare infrastructure. Previous work has shown that the rate of return to investors in these markets often exceeds the efficient level. Our focus is on the factors that influence that return. We examine the effect of macroeconomic, project- and firm-level variables using a detailed sample of 84 UK private finance initiative (PFI) contracts signed between 1997 and 2010. Of the above variables, macroeconomic conditions and lead sponsor size are related to the investor return. However, our results show a remarkable degree of stability in the return to investors over the 14-year period. We find evidence of a 'prevailing norm' that is robust to project- and firm-level variation. The sustainability of excess returns over a long period is indicative of a concentrated market structure. We argue that policymakers should consider new mechanisms for increasing competition in the equity market, while ensuring that authorities have the specialist resources required to negotiate efficient contract prices.
29158657	Purpose: A community-academic partnership was developed to assess community needs and restructure a variety of community-based programs that provide services to underserved communities in New Orleans, Louisiana. Methods: The community and academic partners utilized five phases to assess community needs and restructure programs: 1) meetings; 2) narrowing the scope of community programs; 3) data collection and analysis; 4) emphasizing target programs; and 5) improving sustainability through grant submissions and grant development training. Results: Survey data were collected and analyzed pre- and post-community-academic partnership between November 2014-November 2016 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The data supported the need for community-based programs run by a community organization known as the Dillard University Office of Community and Church Relations (OCCR). The survey results showed that community members expressed interest in: screenings for chronic diseases, such as diabetes; attending exercise classes at local churches; attending financial management workshops; and health fairs run by the community organization. In the future, screenings, workshops, health fairs, as well as exercise and diet programs, will take place at all churches participating in the community-based, umbrella program, Churches in Unity program. Conclusion: A formal community-academic partnership, involving the assignment of an academic liaison, restructured programs for a community partner to better serve the needs of a community that is at-risk for a multitude of obesity-related health problems faced by underserved communities.
27932018	OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of sociodemographic, antenatal and delivery care factors with the essential newborn care (ENC) practices of neonates born at home in Bangladesh. STUDY DESIGN: This study analyzed data of a cross-sectional survey-the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2011. METHODS: This analysis considered 3190 most recent live-born infants who were delivered at home within three years of the survey. Logistic regression models were used to identify the factors affecting the implementation of six ENC practices, namely using disinfected instruments to cut the umbilical cord, avoidance of application of any substances to the umbilical cord stump, immediate drying and wrapping of newborns, delayed bathing of newborns, and immediate initiation of breastfeeding. RESULTS: Factors affecting ENC practices in Bangladesh are low parental education, low utilization of antenatal care services, the absence of skilled birth attendants, smaller size at birth, higher birth order and mother's age at birth. Regional factors also seem to considerably affect ENC practices. CONCLUSION: There is ample scope to improve the coverage of ENC practices in Bangladesh. Health promotion programmes that target parents with low education and older mothers may help to build awareness of ENC practices. This investigation provides insight into the key determinants of ENC practices, which require consideration when scaling up ENC practices in low-income and lower middle-income countries.
31747773	Maternal education is widely regarded as a core social determinant of child mortality in low-income countries. In Myanmar, the evidence related to context-specific social determinants of health including maternal education is scarce, limiting grounds to advocate for a comprehensive health policy. Employing multivariate methods, the study analyzed the 2015-2016 Demographic Health Survey data exploring independent effect of maternal education on neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality. The study found that maternal education was not significantly associated with neonatal mortality as its effect was confounded by household wealth and geographic residence; however, it had independent effect on infant and under-5 mortality. Mothers with primary education had 23% reduction in the odds of under-5 mortality (P < .001); those with secondary level had 40% reduction (P < .001); and those at higher level had 62% reduction (P < .001). The study concluded that maternal education is a critical social determinant of childhood mortalities in Myanmar.
11020935	In Bangladesh, the total fertility rate declined from more than six children per woman of reproductive age in 1980 to 3.3 children per woman in 1996. Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decision making to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning.
31436582	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review focuses on recent population-based studies that have examined the burden of lupus, disease outcomes, and gaps in quality of care, with an emphasis in research addressing health disparities. RECENT FINDINGS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Lupus Registries underscored higher susceptibility of both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary cutaneous lupus among people of color, compared with whites. Not only does SLE disproportionately strike people from racial and ethnic minorities, those individuals are also at increased risk of developing severe manifestations following SLE diagnosis. Mortality is higher and death occurs at a younger age among blacks, compared with whites. Furthermore, ongoing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-supported population-based lupus cohorts, along with research by other groups, have provided new insight into the role of social determinants on outcomes and opportunities to improve care in diverse lupus populations. SUMMARY: While descriptive epidemiological efforts have been critical to providing more accurate estimates of the burden and mortality of lupus across diverse demographic groups, emerging research suggests a significant influence of psychosocial and healthcare system factors on disease outcomes. These current efforts represent important steps toward the development of clinical and public health interventions aimed at eliminating health disparities in lupus populations.
22915146	Studies conducted in developing countries have noted associations between concurrent stunting, social-emotional problems and poor cognitive ability in young children. However, the relative contribution of these variables in Latin America is likely changing as undernutrition rates decline and prevalence of childhood obesity rises. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 106 normal-weight and 109 obese preschool children to compare the relative contribution of early nutrition, sociodemographic factors and psychosocial variables on cognitive development in normal-weight and obese preschool children in Chile. The study variables were categorized as: (1) socio-demographic (age, sex, birth order and socioeconomic) (2) early nutrition (maternal height, birth weight, birth length and height at 5 years) (3) psychosocial factors (maternal depression, social-emotional wellbeing and home space sufficiency). In order to assess determinants of cognitive development at 4-5 years we measured intelligence quotient (IQ); variability in normal children was mostly explained by socio-demographic characteristics (r(2) = 0.26), while in obese children early nutritional factors had a significant effect (r(2) = 0.12) beyond socio-demographic factors (r(2) = 0.19). Normal-weight children, who were first born, of slightly better SES and height Z score >1, had an IQ >/= 6 points greater than their counterparts (p < 0.05). Obese children who were first born with birth weight >4,000 g and low risk of socio-emotional problems had on average >/=5 IQ points greater than their peers (p < 0.05). We conclude that in Chile, a post-transitional country, IQ variability of normal children was mostly explained by socio-demographic characteristics; while in obese children, early nutrition also played a significant role.
28673916	Group size is a fundamental component of sociality, and has important consequences for an individual's fitness as well as the collective and cooperative behaviours of the group as a whole. This review focuses on how the costs and benefits of group living vary in female primates as a function of group size, with a particular emphasis on how competition within and between groups affects an individual's energetic balance. Because the repercussions of chronic energetic stress can lower an animal's fitness, identifying the predictors of energetic stress has important implications for understanding variation in survivorship and reproductive success within and between populations. Notably, we extend previous literature on this topic by discussing three physiological measures of energetic balance-glucocorticoids, c-peptides and thyroid hormones. Because these hormones can provide clear signals of metabolic states and processes, they present an important complement to field studies of spatial and temporal changes in food availability. We anticipate that their further application will play a crucial role in elucidating the adaptive significance of group size in different social and ecological contexts.This article is part of the themed issue 'Physiological determinants of social behaviour in animals'.
31314793	BACKGROUND: As population health and well-being are influenced by multiple factors that cut across sectoral boundaries, an intersectoral approach that acknowledges and leverages the multiple determinants, actors and sectors at play is increasingly seen as critical for achieving meaningful and lasting improvements. In this study, we utilize social network analysis (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the organizations working on maternal & child health (MCH) and water & sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a low-and middle-income countries. METHOD: An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24 organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH. RESULTS: Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points. Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout the network. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including challenges, practical considerations, and limitations.
16231746	Health or disease status is the result of biological, behavioural, and social determinants. The components of health promotion focus specifically on these determinants. How the dissemination of fluoridated salt--a biological component of oral health promotion--interacts with both the determinants of health and the non-biological components of oral health promotion is discussed with respect to individual health behaviour, socio-economic health disparities, the physical and social environment, and the health education curriculum.
29966335	BACKGROUND: Community-based studies have documented racial differences in social, psychiatric, and medical determinants of suicidal ideation; however, less is known about racial differences in the profile of suicide attempts in clinical settings. AIM: The current study aimed to compare Blacks and Whites who attempted suicide for demographic factors, socioeconomic status, medical history, psychiatric disorders, and outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective study was a retrospective chart review of DataDirect, which is an electronic data repository of the Michigan Health Care System, 2014 to 2017. This analysis included 6147 suicide attempts (5388 Whites and 759 Blacks). Race, sociodemographic factors, medical history, psychiatric disorders, and outcomes were measured. RESULTS: Blacks and Whites with suicide attempt did not differ in age or gender, but varied by insurance type. Blacks were more commonly under Medicare and Medicaid, while Whites were more commonly under private insurance or self-pay (p < 0.05). Blacks with suicide attempt were more likely to be obese, while Whites with suicide attempt were more likely to be underweight. Frequency of psychiatric disorders, including depression, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and psychosis, were not different between Whites and Blacks with suicide attempt; however, medical conditions showed a different profile across racial groups. When compared to Whites, Blacks had higher prevalence of uncomplicated hypertension, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coagulopathy, and obesity (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). In contrast, Whites had higher prevalence of other neurological disorders than Blacks. There were no differences in in-patient survival rate between Whites and Blacks who attempted suicide. CONCLUSION: There are considerable differences between Blacks and Whites with at least one suicide attempt. Although their psychiatric diagnoses seem to be similar, Blacks who have attempted suicide attempt have more medical comorbidities than their White counterparts. Lack of racial disparities in in-patient mortality rate of suicide attempts in the Michigan Health Care System is promising news given the higher physical health needs of Blacks when compared to Whites.
29914464	"BACKGROUND: Migrants are the unique production of China's urbanization process. They are often excluded from social welfare and security systems of cities, and often exposed to high health risk related closely to their health problems. This research sought to unveil and explore the influencing factors on health services utilization of migrants in Beijing. METHODS: A sample of 2014 inter-provincial migrants and 4578 residents with Beijing ""Hukou"" who were 15 years old and above was chosen by three-stage stratified cluster sampling method. A structured questionnaire survey was conducted via face-to-face interviews. Anderson health service utilization model was used to demonstrate the effects of the explanatory variables on health seeking behavior from predisposing, enabling and need variables. RESULTS: The study reveals that the rate of 'having symptoms' of migrants was lower than that of residents with ""Hukou"" only in the group of 25 to 34 years old in the past month. 503 migrants (25.0%) and 1441 (31.5%) residents with ""Hukou"" reported at least one episode of discomfort in the past month, and the rate of health service seeking behavior among migrants (46.8%) was lower than residents with ""Hukou"" (62.6%) (P < 0.0001). Chi-square independence test shows that age, ethnicity, employment status, having chronic disease and the degree of symptom were the major determinants affecting migrants to receive health services. The binary logistic regression indicates that the degree of symptom as the need variable and ethnicity as the predisposing variable were the strong and consistent determinants of health services seeking behavior. The migrants with moderate degree and severe degree of symptom in the past month were at 1.623-times (OR = 1.623) and 5.035-times (OR = 5.035) higher chances of seeking health services respectively, comparing to mild degree of symptom. Minority migrants were less likely to seek health services than Han migrants (OR = 0.282). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the current health delivery system is not conducive for migrants to seek appropriate health services. Relevant policies and feasible measures, including increasing the coverage of health insurance and improving the health perception of migrants should be vigorously implemented to provide affordable health services and change health service utilization behaviors for migrants."
25187184	"The objective of this study was to develop a multidisciplinary guideline that supports the care and vocational rehabilitation of HIV-infected people with employment-related problems. The guideline was developed according to the ""evidence-based guideline development"" method developed by the Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement. This method consists of the following steps: forming a multidisciplinary core group and an expert panel, formulating key questions, searching and appraising the available literature, formulating considerations and recommendations, peer reviewing the draft guideline, and authorizing the final guideline. All relevant professional associations were represented in the core group that was assembled to develop the guideline, i.e., HIV doctors, HIV nurses, general practitioners, occupational health physicians, psychologists, social workers, occupational health nurses, vocational experts, and insurance physicians. Five key questions for the guideline were formulated with the following themes: determinants of employment, disclosure and stigma, self-management, interventions, and the organization of care. In the literature review on these topics, 45 studies met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included articles was poor. Factors such as patient preferences and medical/ethical issues were considered. The recommendations in the guideline are a weighting of the scientific evidence and the considerations of the core group. The guideline, as well as its summary for daily practice, clarifies the most important barriers and facilitators to people with HIV either staying at work or returning to work, and it constitutes a clinical, easy-to-use guideline for health-care providers and how they can support people with HIV who want to work."
26555443	BACKGROUND: To answer the question of what bio-psychosocial determinants in infancy, early and middle childhood, and adolescence predict school drop-out in young adulthood, we approached the complex process towards school dropout as a multidimensional, life-course phenomenon. The aim is to find signs of heightened risks of school dropout as early as possible which will eventually help public health workers in reducing these risks. METHODS: In a case-control design, we used data from both the Preventive Pediatric Primary Care (PPPC) files (that contain information from birth onwards) and additional questionnaires filled out by 529 youngsters, aged 18-23 years, and living in the South-east of the Netherlands. We first conducted univariate logistic regression analyses with school-dropout as the dependent variable. Backward and forward stepwise analyses with the significant variables were done with variables pertaining to the 0 to 4 year period. Remaining significant variables were forced into the next model and subsequently variables pertaining to respectively the 4 to 8, 8 to 12 and 12 to 16 year period were introduced in a stepwise analysis. All analyses were cross-validated in an exploratory and confirmatory random half of the sample. RESULTS: One parent families and families with a non-Western background less often attended the health examinations of the PPPC and such less attendance was related to school dropout. The birth of a sibling (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.93) in infancy and self-efficacy (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74) in adolescence decreased the odds of school dropout; externalizing behavior (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.53-5.14) in middle childhood and (sickness) absence (OR 5.62, 95% CI 2.18-14.52) in adolescence increased the risks. CONCLUSION: To prevent school dropout, PPPC professionals should not wait until imminent dropout, but should identify and tackle risk factors as early as possible and actively approach youngsters who withdraw from public health care.
20352332	This study examines how aspects of coalition functioning predict a coalition's ability to promote high-quality implementation of evidence-based programs (EBPs). The study involved 62 Communities That Care (CTC) coalitions in Pennsylvania measured annually from 2003 to 2007. Findings indicate that the communities with higher levels of poverty and longer existing coalitions are related to lower support for high-quality EBP implementation. Several aspects of coalition functioning-including higher levels of funding; leadership strength; board efficiency; strong internal and external relationships; and fidelity to the CTC model-significantly predicted support for high-quality EBP implementation. Earlier measurements of coalition functioning (2003-2004 and 2005-2006) predicted EBP implementation (2007) more strongly than concurrent coalition assessments (2007). The discussion focuses on how coalitions and technical assistance providers can improve coalition support for the implementation of EBPs.
10926127	The aim of this study was to evaluate possible changes in predisposing factors in sexual preventive behaviors that could result from the availability of an efficient new antiretroviral therapy. A total of 136 young adults were randomly assigned a vignette to read describing AIDS as a lethal or chronic disease. After reading the vignette, the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial determinants of intention to use a condom with a new sexual partner. The variables were measured according to Ajzen's (1985, 1988, 1991) theory of planned behavior and Triandis's (1977) theory of interpersonal behavior. The experimental manipulation was more successful when the disease was described as lethal (66 of the 68 subjects) rather than chronic (30 of the 68 subjects). For the 96 participants who correctly identified the expected outcome of the disease presented in the vignette, a significant difference in intention was found between the two experimental situations (p < .05). Regression of intention to use condoms on the psychosocial variables yielded an adjusted R2 of .62. Perceived behavioral control, social norms, personal normative belief and anticipated affective reaction were the significant variables explaining this intention. The results suggest that intention to use condoms with a new sexual partner is likely to be modified by the expected outcome of the disease, that is, whether lethal or chronic. Thus, it is suggested that interventions aimed at young adults take into account the impacts the new antiretroviral treatments are likely to have on preventive behaviors.
17135105	Using data from the Community Tracking Study Household Survey (1998-99), we estimate the relationship between Medigap premiums and senior Medicare beneficiaries' supplemental coverage decisions. All seniors are more likely to be enrolled in an HMO in markets with higher Medigap prices. Lower income seniors are particularly sensitive to Medigap premiums and are more likely to have no supplemental coverage when faced with higher Medigap premiums. As Medicare supplemental options evolve in response to the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, it is important to consider that lower income beneficiaries may respond to price changes and other factors differently than their higher income counterparts.
27354968	AIM: To provide a structural model of the relationship between personality traits, perceived stress, coping strategies, social support, and psychological outcomes in the general population. METHODS: This is a cross sectional study in which the study group was selected using multistage cluster and convenience sampling among a population of 4 million. For data collection, a total of 4763 individuals were asked to complete a questionnaire on demographics, personality traits, life events, coping with stress, social support, and psychological outcomes such as anxiety and depression. To evaluate the comprehensive relationship between the variables, a path model was fitted. RESULTS: The standard electronic modules showed that personality traits and perceived stress are important determinants of psychological outcomes. Social support and coping strategies were demonstrated to reduce the increasing cumulative positive effects of neuroticism and perceived stress on the psychological outcomes and enhance the protective effect of extraversion through decreasing the positive effect of perceived stress on the psychological outcomes. CONCLUSION: Personal resources play an important role in reduction and prevention of anxiety and depression. In order to improve the psychological health, it is necessary to train and reinforce the adaptive coping strategies and social support, and thus, to moderate negative personality traits.
15370610	This study aimed to identify factors at diagnosis that are related to cancer patients' utilization of hospital care during the first 2 years after diagnosis, and thereby improve identification of patients with an increased need for close follow-up. Data from a prospective intervention study of psychosocial support and from a computerized patient administration system were used. A total of 393 newly diagnosed patients were included. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to determine whether the addition of information regarding age, comorbidity, functional status, symptoms, and socioeconomic variables improved the prediction of utilization of specialist inpatient care beyond that afforded by cancer-related factors. In addition to cancer diagnosis and treatment, comorbidity, physical function, and pain determined use of inpatient care. Patients living in rural areas and those with a low income utilized hospital care more often. The results suggest that thorough assessment can identify patients at diagnosis with an increased need for follow-up, e.g. intensified home care services.
22528046	High HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women in Thailand suggest a vital need for targeted interventions. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to examine and compare sexual risk behaviors, and demographic and behavioral correlates of risk, among MSM and transgender women recruited from gay entertainment venue staff and community-based organization (CBO) participants. We used venue-based sampling across nine sites in Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Among 260 participants (57.3% gay-identified, 26.9% heterosexual/bisexual-identified, 15.8% transgender; mean age = 26.7 years), nearly one-fifth (18.5%) reported unprotected anal sex (UAS), half (50.4%) sex in exchange for money, and one-fifth (20.0%) STI diagnosis (past year). Nearly one-fourth (23.1%) reported oral erectile dysfunction medication use and nearly one-fifth (19.2%) illicit drug use (past 3 months). Overall, 43.1% indicated that healthcare providers exhibited hostility towards them. Gay entertainment venue staff were significantly more likely to self-identify as heterosexual/bisexual (versus gay or transgender female), and to have less than high school degree education, higher monthly income, to have engaged in sex in exchange for money, sex with women and unprotected vaginal sex, but were significantly less likely to have engaged in UAS than CBO participants. Targeted interventions for younger MSM and transgender women, for non gay-identified men, and strategies to address structural determinants of risk, including low education and discrimination from healthcare providers, may support HIV prevention among MSM and transgender women, and serve broader national HIV prevention efforts in Thailand.
28686603	"OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between elder abuse and poor sleep using a Malay validated version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). DESIGN: This study was divided into two phases. Phase I tested the construct validity and reliability of the Malay version of PSQI. Phase II was a population-based, cross-sectional study with a multi-stage cluster sampling method. Home-based interviews were conducted by trained personnel using a structured questionnaire, to determine exposure and outcome. SETTING: Kuala Pilah, a district in Negeri Sembilan which is one of the fourteen states in Malaysia. PARTICIPANTS: 1648 community-dwelling older Malaysians. RESULTS: The Malay version of PSQI had significant test re-test reliability with intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.62. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that one factor PSQI scale with three components (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep disturbances) was most suitable. Cronbach's Alpha was 0.60 and composite reliability was 0.63. PSQI scores were highest among neglect (4.11), followed by physical (4.10), psychological (3.96) and financial abuse (3.60). There was a dose-response relationship between clustering of abuse and PSQI scores; 3.41, 3.50 and 3.84 for ""no abuse"", ""1 type of abuse"" and ""2 types or more"". Generalized linear models revealed six variables as significant determinants of sleep quality-abuse, co-morbidities, self-rated health, income, social support and gait speed. Among abuse subtypes, only neglect was significantly associated with poor sleep. CONCLUSION: The Malay PSQI was valid and reliable. Abuse was significantly associated with poor sleep. As sleep is essential for health and is a good predictor for mortality among older adults, management of abuse victims should entail sleep assessment. Interventions or treatment modalities which focus on improving sleep quality among abuse victims should be designed."
31801477	"BACKGROUND: Assessing women's childbirth experiences is a crucial indicator in maternity services because negative childbirth experiences are associated with maternal mortalities and morbidities. Due to the high caesarean birth rate in Iran, measuring childbirth experience is a top priority, however, there is no standard tool to measure this key indicator in Iran. The aim of present study is to adapt the ""Childbirth Experience Questionnaire 2.0"" to the Iranian context and determine its psychometric characteristics. METHODS: Childbirth Experience Questionnaire 2.0 was translated into Farsi. A total of 500 primiparous women, at 4 to 16 weeks postpartum, were randomly selected from 54 healthcare centres in Tabriz. Internal consistency and reliability was calculated using the Cronbach's Coefficient alpha and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, respectively. Construct validity was assessed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and discriminant validity using the known-group method and the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: The internal consistency and reliability for the total tool were high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93; Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.97). Explanatory factor analysis demonstrated the adequacy of the sampling (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin = 0.923) and significant factorable sphericity (p < 0.001). Confirmation factor analysis demonstrated acceptable values of fitness (RMSEA = 0.07, SRMSEA = 0.06, TLI = 0.97, CFI > 0.91, x (2)/ df = 4.23). Discriminatory validity of the tool was confirmed where the CEQ score and its subdomains were significantly higher in women who reported having control over their childbirth than women who did not. CONCLUSION: The Farsi version of the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire 2.0 tool is a valid and reliable tool and can be used to measure the childbirth experience in Iranian women."
23974381	BACKGROUND: Clear associations exist between socioeconomic risks and health, and these risks are often amenable to legal interventions. METHODS: This is a case study of an implementation of a medical-legal partnership (MLP) in three pediatric primary care centers that serve a predominantly high-risk population. Referral circumstances and outcomes over the first three years are described. RESULTS: During the three-year study period, 1,808 MLP referrals were made for 1,614 patients by all levels of provider. Those referred were more likely to have asthma (p<.0001) and developmental delay/behavioral disorder (p<.0001) than the general clinic population. Housing (37%) and income/health benefit (33%) problems were the most common reasons for referral. Referrals led to 1,742 (89%) positive legal outcomes affecting nearly 6,000 cohabitating children and adults and translating into nearly $200,000 in recovered back benefits. CONCLUSION: Successful MLP implementation enabled pediatric providers to address social determinants of health potentially improving health and reducing disparities.
26299713	Approximately one quarter of the food supplied for human consumption is wasted across the food supply chain. In the high income countries, the food waste generated at the household level represents about half of the total food waste, making this level one of the biggest contributors to food waste. Yet, there is still little evidence regarding the determinants of consumers' food waste behaviour. The present study examines the effect of psycho-social factors, food-related routines, household perceived capabilities and socio-demographic characteristics on self-reported food waste. Survey data gathered among 1062 Danish respondents measured consumers' intentions not to waste food, planning, shopping and reuse of leftovers routines, perceived capability to deal with household food-related activities, injunctive and moral norms, attitudes towards food waste, and perceived behavioural control. Results show that perceived behavioural control and routines related to shopping and reuse of leftovers are the main drivers of food waste, while planning routines contribute indirectly. In turn, the routines are related to consumers' perceived capabilities to deal with household related activities. With regard to intentional processes, injunctive norms and attitudes towards food waste have an impact while moral norms and perceived behavioural control make no significant contribution. Implications of the study for initiatives aimed at changing consumers' food waste behaviour are discussed.
19323024	Local health determinants, perceived by a local community in Mueang District, Khon Kaen Province, were explored using a qualitative approach during November 2006. Health determinants could be classified into three categories: environmental, individual and family, and institutional factors. Community perspectives on health determinants included flooding, habits of lottery buying, fluctuation of vegetable market prices, and job opportunities. Community participants gave high value to the social determinants of health as opposed to environmental/biomedical factors, considering that such conditions could positively build social cohesion and even lead to better well-being. They prioritized flooding as a major environmental health determinant that affected villagers' physical and mental health, as well as family income. For social health determinants, they also indicated that many villagers were addicted to lottery buying that led to mental and financial problems within families.
28575394	Objectives: To project future smoking prevalence rates in Spain by sex and age groups using Bayesian methods and to estimate the probability of a 30% relative reduction between 2010 and 2025. Methods: We used the data from the Spanish National Health Surveys (2003, 2006, and 2011) to obtain information about current and former smoking. We reconstructed annual smoking rates from 1989 through 2011 by sex and 5-year age groups. The prevalence were projected for the period 2012-2025 using a Bayesian logistic binomial model and estimated the probability to achieve the 30% relative reduction endorsed by the WHO. We calculated the 95% credible interval (CrI) of the posterior distribution, which includes a 95% of the distribution of potential smoking prevalences. Results: In men, the projections show a decline for crude (-2.64% annually, 95% CrI: -3.32; -1.97) and adjusted (-2.50%, 95% CrI:-3.14; -1.87) prevalence. In women, the projections show a decline for crude prevalence (-0.36%, 95% CrI: -1.02; -0.30)) and the age-adjusted prevalence (-1.02%, 95% CrI: -1.61, -0.47). By age groups, the decline is greater among women aged 15-39 years (-3.92%, 95% CrI: -4.92; -2.96)) while for women aged 40-64 years an increase (1.84%, 95% CrI: 1.06; 2.58) is expected. In men, the probability to achieve the WHO target is 0.728 and in women is less than 0.001. The age group 15-39 shows the highest probability to achieve the target. Conclusions: The results suggest smoking prevalence will decrease during 2012-2025 in all age groups for both sexes except for women aged 40-64. We found that the WHO target of a 30% reduction in prevalence is likely to be achieved overall and in the 15-39 years age groups for both sexes, but not achieved for older women and it is uncertain whether it will be achieved for older men. These results highlight the need to strengthen public health interventions that focus on reducing tobacco use in adult women aged 40-64 years old. Implications: We project a decrease in smoking prevalence in during 2012-2025 except for women aged 40-64. The WHO Target of a 30% relative reduction could be achieved in the population aged 15-39; but not in women and the results are inconclusive in men. These results highlight the need to strengthen public health interventions that focus on reducing tobacco use in adult women aged 40-64 years old.
24351387	The non-universal nature of health services in India can also be the result of many reforms and milestones the health services had passed through since independence. The reform era during the post-nineties is replete with many new trends in organizational strategies which could have led to crises in health services. The salient crises need to be dissected from a larger societal crisis and the specific crises in the health services system. It is evident that non-accessibility and non-availability and the sub-optimal functioning of the primary health centers are perennial issues which could not be addressed by indigenous, imposed or cocktail reforms (such as National Rural Health Mission) and by targeting as these only tinker with the health services. Needless to reiterate that there is a need to address the social dimensions which fall outside the technical sphere of health services. This paper based on an analytical review of relevant literature concludes that any efforts to universalize health and health-care can not only focus on technical components but need to address the larger social determinants and especially the societal crisis, which engender ill-health.
16861599	The number of children at risk for overweight and the number of overweight children are increasing and have become a serious public health concern. Interventions that could be applied at the population level have not been proven effective. The development of effective strategies is thought to be hampered by the lack of understanding of which behavioral and environmental factors need to be modified. On June 14 and 15, 2004, the NIH held a meeting of experts to discuss the issue of modifiable determinants of obesity in children and adolescents. Included were presentations on interventions among children that have been proven effective, dietary and physical activity behavioral determinants, physical, social, and family environmental determinants, and the quality of measures of determinants and correlates of overweight.
28258420	PURPOSE: Gender-related differences in life expectancy, prevalence of chronic conditions and level of disability in the process of ageing have been broadly described. Less is known about social determinants, which may have different impacts on quality of life in men and women. The investigation aims to reveal gender-related differences in social determinants on quality of life assessed by a multi-pathway model including health, social, demographic and living place characteristics. METHODS: The study group consisted of 5099 participants aged 50+ representing general populations of three different European regions (Finland, Poland, Spain) who participated in COURAGE in EUROPE Project. Standardized tools were used to measure quality of life (WHOQOL-AGE) and social determinants (COURAGE Social Network Index, OSLO-3 Social Support Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale, participation scale and trust). A multipath model considering exogenous predictors (demographic, economic), mediators (social) and endogenous outcome (QOL) was created to reveal the role of determinants. Gender-related differences were investigated across three age categories: 50-64; 65-79 and 80+. RESULTS: The model (RMSEA = 0.058; CFI = 0.939) showed the effects of all of the investigated determinants. Gender-related differences in the association between social constructs and QOL were observed for social networks in the group of 80+, for social support in the group of 50-64 and 65-79 years, and for social participation in the group of 65-79 years. Males benefited more (in QOL) from social networks and social support, and women from social participation. CONCLUSIONS: The research provides valuable knowledge about the role of social determinants in QOL considering complex relations between different social constructs. Additionally, the results showed gender-related differences in the associations between social networks, social support, social participation and QOL, suggesting that men might benefit more from the interventions in the first two. Although our research did not investigate the effects of interventions, the results show directions for future investigations, how to shape social interventions at the population level to improve quality of life of older adults, and thus help achieve successful ageing.
30451477	The process of population aging is a worldwide reality becoming a global public health challenge. Although population aging is especially noticeable in more developed regions, there has also been a significant advance in the quantity of elderly people in areas with unfavourable socioeconomic indicators, and a rapid growth in countries with a low level of economic development. This article presents an analysis based on spatial autocorrelation of the relationship between life expectancy and social determinants in a north-eastern region of Brazil. An ecological study was conducted using the secondary data of social, demographic, and health indicators of elderly people collected in the Brazilian Demographic Census of the 75 municipalities of the state of Sergipe. Spatial autocorrelation was evaluated using the Moran global index and the local indicators of space association. Multiple linear regression models were used to identify the relationship between life expectancy and social determinants. The South-eastern region of the state presented clusters with all indicators pointing to acceptable lifestyles, whereas the municipalities of the north-western and far-eastern regions were characterized by values demonstrating precarious living conditions. The high dependency ratio, illiteracy rate, and unemployment rate among elderly people had a negative impact on life expectancy. The evidence confirms that there is an autocorrelation between social determinants and life expectancy, indicating that the worse the social, economic, and health indicators are, the lower the life expectancy. This finding indicates the need to redirect public policies and formulate strategies aimed at reducing social and health inequalities.

24327481	BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed growing interest in determinants of suicide in South Korea. While much of the research has paid attention to the role of individual factors in explaining suicide mortality, another potentially important dimension of health inequality is geography. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To describe the geographical distribution of suicide rates in South Korea, and to examine to what extent the distribution is shaped by area deprivation. METHODS: Using 2004-2006 mortality data and 2005 population census data, the study first described the spatial mapping of age-standardised suicide rates and level of area deprivation across 250 districts in South Korea. A spatial lag model was also employed to examine the association between the two, taking into account the spatial dependence and interactions between neighbouring districts, as indicated by Moran's I and Geary' C statistics. In addition to level of area deprivation, population density, welfare spending, and rates of divorce, marriage and fertility at district-level were added to the model. RESULTS: The spatial mapping of suicide rates across 250 districts exhibited a different pattern between males and females. While the highest suicide rates tended to cluster in the north-east region of South Korea for males, no clear pattern was observed for females. On the other hand, the lowest suicide rates for both males and females were found in most districts of the capital city. The results of the spatial lag model revealed a significant association between suicide rates and area deprivation, particularly for male suicide. Compared to the least deprived area, there were about 12-13 more male suicide cases (per 100,000 males) in highly deprived areas. The association with area deprivation was less clear for females. Population density was negatively associated with suicide rates for both males and females. While suicide rates were in general positively associated with divorce rates and negatively associated with fertility rates, the coefficients of both were not significant in the model for females. DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS: The study highlighted substantial geographical variation in suicide rates across South Korea. Such variation can be largely explained by level of area deprivation, especially for males. The level of excess suicides (i.e. 12-13 per 100,000 males) in highly deprived areas was similar to the average suicide rates of OECD countries. Due to the paucity of individual-level data however, the study was unable to test whether or not these associations were independent of population composition. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: Prioritising development in relatively more deprived areas would potentially minimise resource barriers. Since such area-based approaches focus on a body with clear responsibility (i.e. local authority) and a greater relevance for local residents, programmes and services can be more effectively tailored to local needs and also more effectively delivered to local residents. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Alternative sources of data with individual-level data should be explored to strengthen the basis of the present findings, and also to examine the exact mechanism underlying the associations between suicide rates and area deprivation.
17549509	"BACKGROUND: We recently developed the Amblyopia & Strabismus Questionnaire (A&SQ) to assess the quality of life in amblyopia and/or strabismus patients, and evaluated its content and criterion validity. The A&SQ was now validated clinically by correlating its outcome with past and current orthoptic parameters in a historic cohort of amblyopia and/or strabismus patients. METHODS: The cohort was derived from all 471 patients who were treated by occlusion therapy in the Waterland Hospital in Purmerend between 1968 and 1974 and born between 1962 and 1972. All children with insufficient visual acuity from the Waterland area had been referred to a single ophthalmologist and orthoptist. Of these, 203 were traced, and 174 filled out the A&SQ. In 137 of these, binocular vision, visual acuity, and angle of strabismus were reassessed 30-35 years after occlusion therapy. These clinical parameters were correlated with the five A&SQ domains: ""distance estimation"", ""visual disorientation"", ""fear of losing the better eye"", ""diplopia"", and ""social contact and cosmetic problems"". RESULTS: The current acuity at distance of the amblyopic eye and reading acuity of the amblyopic eye correlated significantly with all five A&SQ domains (significance level P = 0.01-P = 0.05). Weaker correlations were found for binocularity. In spite of the expectation that stereopsis should strongly correlate with the domain ""distance estimation"", and angle of strabismus with the domain ""social contact and cosmetic problems"", the acuity of the amblyopic eye was the overall dominant parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The adult acuity of the amblyopic eye seems the most important clinical determinant for quality of life in amblyopia and/or strabismus patients, even in domains of distance estimation, visual disorientation, and social contact and cosmetic problems, although intermediate determinants cannot be excluded."
18274042	Disasters have been and will continue to be relatively common events in the human experience, and they make important contributions to variations in population health. There is a need, therefore, for conceptual models that identify the social and ecological factors influencing post-disaster consequences on population health. This article presents one such conceptual model which links the health consequences of natural, technological, and human-made disasters to a set of nested socioecological factors. Specifically, we attempt to link post-disaster consequences to aspects of the global and local environment and to highlight the roles played by social and ecological factors, including the social infrastructure, cultural beliefs, demography, and underlying historical and geographical circumstances. Examples from existing population-based health and disaster research are used to illustrate and amplify connections drawn from the model. From an applied standpoint, the model suggests that the role of multiple contextual determinants in shaping population health is likely to be complex. Practitioners interested in mitigating the consequences of disasters should pursue strategies that improve the underlying determinants of health, as well as practicable population-based interventions that could be implemented rapidly.
30296634	"BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitationis effective in promoting physical/psychological recovery following acute coronary syndrome. Yet, rates of attendance at outpatient cardiac rehabilitation by eligible patients are low. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the determinants of attendance at outpatient cardiac rehabilitation in acute coronary syndrome patients following discharge until cardiac rehabilitation commencement. DESIGN: A weekly electronic diary measured cardiac-related cognitions and mood and examined their relation to attendance at outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. SETTINGS: Three United Kingdom National Health Service secondary care settings in two Health Board areas in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Acute coronary syndrome patients were recruited from March 2012 to June 2013 prior to hospital discharge. Of 488 eligible patients referred for cardiac rehabilitation, 214 consented. METHODS: Consecutive patients completed a pre-hospital discharge questionnaire targeting age, diagnosis, social class and smoking history. Acute coronary syndrome patients then completed a weekly electronic diary from the first week of discharge until the start of cardiac rehabilitation. Multilevel structural equation models estimated the effects of initial, i.e. baseline and rate of change in cardiac-related cognition and mood on attendance. Intention to attend cardiac rehabilitation was reflected, log transformed, reported thereafter as ""do not intend"". The role of ""do not intend"" was explored as a mediator of the relationship between cardiac-related cognition and mood on attendance. RESULTS: 166 participants provided, on average, 5 weeks of diary entries before cardiac rehabilitation commenced. High intention (i.e. low ""do not intend"") to attend CR and its rate of increase over time predicted attendance. Low negative emotional representation, high perceived necessity, high confidence in maintaining function, low negative affect, and high positive affect following discharge predicted attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. The rate of change in cardiac-related mood and these cognitions was not predictive. Baseline and rate of change in ""do not intend"" entirely mediated relationships between a) perceived necessity, b) negative affect and attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Negative affect in the first weeks following discharge represents the key challenge to a patient maintaining their intention to attend cardiac rehabilitation. Intervention to improve attendance should focus on improving intention to attend following discharge and during recovery by improving patient understanding of cardiac rehabilitation and reducing negative affect."
15464009	The increase of physical stature in the developed countries and their socio-economic correlates has been well documented for nearly two centuries. In this study, the secular changes in height, weight and the BMI of Hungarian university students and conscripts are analyzed for the years 1933-1998. During the first half of this period these body measurements changed little, while in the second half the rates of change accelerated rapidly: height increased by 1.7 cm among males and 1.8 cm among female university students per decade, and 1.8 cm among male conscripts. Differences were found according to the place of birth and residence as well as parental occupation and educational level.
20933194	PURPOSE: Macroeconomic improvements have been posited as an explanation of the decline in the Black preterm birth rate during the 1990s. This study assessed whether decreasing unemployment explained the decline in preterm, low birth weight births (PT-LBW) for Black women. METHODS: United States singleton births to non-Hispanic Black women ages 18 and over, conceived between 1990 and 2001, were pooled to examine PT-LBW trends by level of social advantage (approximated by education and marital status). The impact of the state-level unemployment rate in the first and second trimester of pregnancy was evaluated in multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: During the 1990s, PT-LBW declined 11% among disadvantaged (unmarried, less than high school educated) Black women. Although the unemployment rate and PT-LBW were positively related, decreases in unemployment did not explain the decline in PT-LBW. Instead, improvements in prenatal care utilization and smoking behavior largely accounted for the temporal trend. CONCLUSIONS: Macroeconomic improvements, measured by unemployment, only marginally contributed to the Black PT-LBW trend in the 1990s. To effect further reductions, future studies should investigate other possible determinants of the proximate behavioral changes that did explain the trend (e.g., Earned Income Tax Credit expansions, increased, cigarette taxes/smoking legislation).
19418020	OBJECTIVES: Based on the theoretical and empirical approach of Pierre Bourdieu, a multivariate non-linear method is introduced as an alternative way to analyse the complex relationships between social determinants and health. METHODS: The analysis is based on face-to-face interviews with 695 randomly selected respondents aged 30 to 59. Variables regarding socio-economic status, life circumstances, lifestyles, health-related behaviour and health were chosen for the analysis. In order to determine whether the respondents can be differentiated and described based on these variables, a non-linear canonical correlation analysis (OVERALS) was performed. RESULTS: The results can be described on three dimensions; Eigenvalues add up to the fit of 1.444, which can be interpreted as approximately 50 % of explained variance. The three-dimensional space illustrates correspondences between variables and provides a framework for interpretation based on latent dimensions, which can be described by age, education, income and gender. CONCLUSION: Using non-linear canonical correlation analysis, health characteristics can be analysed in conjunction with socio-economic conditions and lifestyles. Based on Bourdieus theoretical approach, the complex correlations between these variables can be more substantially interpreted and presented.
14758854	The geographic distribution of health status across Italian regions shows a North-South gradient, with better conditions in the North for both males and females. Using data from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey, the authors first analyze the geographic variation in subjective health and presence of chronic conditions, with specific attention to the effects of individual and area-based socioeconomic conditions and their heterogeneity across regions. The results suggest the North-South gradient in health is mainly affected, at least for subjective health, by the different composition of macro-areas with respect to individual education, and is slightly influenced by contextual circumstances. Moreover, being less educated results in poorer health in some regions (mainly South and Isles) than in others (mainly Northeast). The authors next analyze the circumstances affecting the presence of more disadvantaged people in the South, to highlight features of the Southern context that might exacerbate social inequalities in health and features of Northern areas that might allay them. Indicators of inequalities, welfare, labor, and power resources were analyzed. The results confirm the disadvantage of the South in terms of social, economic, and cultural features, mainly revealing the compositional effects found in the first part of the study. However, the contextual predictive value of income inequalities, quality of care, and social cohesion can have a supplementary effect on health outcomes of disadvantaged persons.
29040562	Large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies have transformed our understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited-either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies, from the perspective that this amounts to conditioning on a collider (i.e. a form of collider bias). Whereas it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that third variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to substantially biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into, or attrition from, a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of knowing which population your study sample is representative of. If the factors influencing selection and attrition are known, they can be adjusted for. For example, having DNA available on most participants in a birth cohort study offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.
30968296	A plethora of empirical work explored finance-income-environment nexus, aims to investigate high CO2 emissions determinants, over the last few couples of decades. The prior empirical work assist the idea that finance and income have diverse impacts on the environment. The lack of consensus on finance-income-environment nexus in the Central and Eastern European Countries in the perspective of Belt and Road Initiative need to be examined. Therefore, the present study explores the nexus between financial development, income level, and environmental quality for a panel of eighteen Central and Eastern European Countries, over the period of 1980-2016. The Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Regression, the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel casualty approaches are employed. The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis also investigated for both time series panel and country-wise. The Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Regression long-run panel results reveal that (i) financial development index and income negatively impact on environmental quality; (ii) energy consumption is the key determinant of CO2 emissions and reduces environmental quality; (iii) urbanization and trade both enhance environmental quality via reduction of carbon emissions; and (iv) the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis supported for the selected panel countries. The country-wise results depict that increase in environmental quality occurs due to increase in financial development (in four countries), income level (in five countries), trade (in five countries), and urbanization (in eight countries). However, the environmental quality decreases due to the increase in financial development (in six countries), income level (in eight countries), energy consumption (in twelve countries), trade (in six countries), and urbanization (in five countries). The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis supported for five Central and Eastern European Countries. Additionally, the causality results confirmed the presence of feedback relationships among income and environmental quality, and financial development and energy consumption. Thus, we conclude that income level and financial development are the main drivers behind high carbon dioxide emissions in CEECs. The finding of the study opens up new insight for appropriate policymaking.
20131685	OBJECTIVE: This study examined correlates of tobacco use among Hmong people residing in Wisconsin. METHODS: Surveys of youth (ages 12-17) and adults (ages > or =18), available in English and Hmong, were distributed in 14 communities through Hmong Mutual Assistance Associations and analyzed centrally. Surveys assessed daily and ever use of tobacco, as well as other sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of those contacted, 2856 people completed the survey (1460 youth and 1396 adults). Among youth, 15% reported daily use (18.8% for males, 11.7% for females); 32% reported ever use (36.3% for males, 28.2% for females). Education and birth location were significant predictors of tobacco use. Youth who reported someone in their household smoked were more likely to use tobacco. The odds of ever use of tobacco increased as the percent of life lived in the United States increased (OR = 3.7). Among adults, prevalence of daily use was 20% (25.3% for males, 12.4% for females) and ever use was 35.9% (45% for males, 23.2% for females.) Adults born in the United States were 3.4 to 3.7 times more likely to use tobacco. The less education reported, the more likely they were to be a daily tobacco user. Adults who reported that someone in their household smoked were 2.8 to 3.4 times more likely to use tobacco. CONCLUSION: Overall, Hmong males are at higher risk of smoking than females, although this difference is smaller for youth than adults. Education and household exposure are strong predictors of smoking prevalence.
18537814	This paper investigates the determinants of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture utilization for cancer patients who are simultaneously having conventional Western medical treatments. This study used five leading cancers in Taiwan, namely cervical, breast, lung, liver and colorectal cancers. A total of 2499 cancer patients were interviewed, of which 2034 had full information and were analysed. Logistic regressions were used for both TCM and acupuncture. The results showed that type of cancer and cancer duration determine the utilization for alternative treatments. While socio-economic factors also affect choice of alternative medicine, the magnitude differs by types of alternative treatment and cancer. Compared with men and older patients, women and younger patients tend to prefer alternative medicine, and patients from south have higher preference for alternative medicine, which could be a reflection of local culture. Our results are useful for the government to determine higher users of TCM and acupuncture among cancer patients, and make policies to suit these patients' needs.
15503071	Personal resources represent important determinants of life-long development. Since the use of the resources is a decisive factor, the perception of resources and changes in them is presumably crucial for the developmental success. In the present study, we investigated whether the perception of resources (i. e., cognition, health, social network) differs between young and old individuals, whether the resource perception is related to well-being and whether these relations are identical among young and old adults. Young and old individuals did not differ with respect to subjective resource status and resource importance; however, the young experienced more gains and the old reported more losses. Resource status explained the highest proportion of variance in well-being in both age groups. Resource loss was of relevance to well-being only in the young, but not in the old group. Thus, the significance of resource loss seems to vary across the life span, which puts the notion of a universal role of resource loss into question. For future studies, domain-specific analyses and the investigation of protective mechanism are proposed.
26005689	BACKGROUND: Sleep is an important aspect of healthy lifestyle. One of the prevalent Diabetes mellitus-related non-vascular complications is sleep problems. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a non-pharmacological care plan designed based on the Continuous Care Model (CCM) on sleep quality in patients with type II diabetes with two month follow up. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from May to November 2012 among 68 the patients with type II DM referring to the Diabetes Clinic of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences. The study instrument consisted of a self-report demographic questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The gathered data were analyzed via SPSS (V. 20) using t-test and Chi-square statistics. RESULTS: After the intervention, the study groups did not differ significantly in terms of sleep quality (0.628). However, the study findings revealed that the interventional group's sleep quality improved significantly after the intervention (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacologic intervention according to CCM improved the sleep quality in the experimental group. Sleep care is a matter of great importance in diabetes mellitus, which deserves particular attention. The present study adds to the growing literature of the use of non-pharmaceutics intervention to improve sleep disorders of diabetic patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: IRCT201202269140N1.
29882990	AIM: To explore reasons for the poor uptake of accredited diabetes self-management education (DSME) in adults with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS: The study was set in an urban population in South London, UK. A cross sectional survey gathered demographic, diabetes service-use data, psychological scores and reasons for non-attendance at locally-available DSME. In addition, 56 healthcare professionals were surveyed. RESULTS: Responses to surveys were returned by 496 adults with Type 1 diabetes (33% response rate), of whom 263 had attended DSME (53%). Multivariable analysis adjusted for significant variables identified four key variables influencing attendance. Non-attendance was associated with men (OR 0.55 CI 0.37-0.84, p = 0.005), lower educational attainment (OR 0.45 CI 0.28-0.73, p = 0.001), higher glycated haemoglobin (OR 1.74 CI 1.03-2.94, p = 0.04) and healthcare professional encouragement to attend (OR 1.7 CI 1.28-2.3, p = 0.001). The most frequently reported barriers to attendance were work (37%) and time (14%) commitments. Only 49% of healthcare professionals (HCPs) correctly identified the most likely barriers. Those HCPs who had observed courses believed more in their efficacy, with higher uptake within their clinic population. CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants of health, particularly educational attainment and gender, increase health inequalities by influencing decisions to attend evidence-based education courses. Healthcare professional communication is paramount to encourage attendance, and observation of a course may facilitate this.
30315427	PURPOSE: Cancer patients in Germany often face payments related to their disease or treatment which are not covered by their health insurance. The aim of this study was to analyze the amount of out-of-pocket payments (OOPPs) among cancer patients in Germany, to explore potential socioeconomic determinants of OOPPs, and to identify how cancer patients are burdened by these payments. METHODS: Cancer ptients were consecutively enrolled in 16 clinics in Leipzig, Germany. Data on OOPPs for the past 3 months and on socioeconomic status were obtained at the end of their hospital stay (t0) and 3 (t1) and 15 months (t2) after t0. Financial burden was calculated by dividing the monthly OOPPs by the midpoint of the income category, and the perceived burden was assessed by using the financial difficulties scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30. A two-part regression model was used to estimate the determinants of OOPPs. RESULTS: At baseline (t0), 502 cancer patients participated in the study and provided data on OOPPs and socioeconomic status. The mean 3-month OOPPs were the following: euro205.8 at baseline, euro179.2 at t1, and euro148.1 at t2. Compared to the lowest income group (< euro500 monthly), all other income groups (euro500-999, euro1000-1499, and >/= euro1500) had higher 3-month OOPPs of euro52.3 (p = 0.241), euro90.2 (p = 0.059), or euro62.2 (p = 0.176). Financial burden at t0 was 6.4% (SD 9.2%) on average, 5.4% (SD 9.9%) at t1, and to 3.9% (SD 7.0%) of monthly income at t2. CONCLUSION: German cancer patients face relatively high OOPPs during their cancer journey. These payments may burden cancer patients, especially certain subgroups like low-income groups.
28099479	BACKGROUND: Patterns of person-to-person contacts relevant for infectious diseases transmission are still poorly quantified in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where socio-demographic structures and behavioral attitudes are expected to be different from those of more developed countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a diary-based survey on daily contacts and time-use of individuals of different ages in one rural and one peri-urban site of Manicaland, Zimbabwe. A total of 2,490 diaries were collected and used to derive age-structured contact matrices, to analyze time spent by individuals in different settings, and to identify the key determinants of individuals' mixing patterns. Overall 10.8 contacts per person/day were reported, with a significant difference between the peri-urban and the rural site (11.6 versus 10.2). A strong age-assortativeness characterized contacts of school-aged children, whereas the high proportion of extended families and the young population age-structure led to a significant intergenerational mixing at older ages. Individuals spent on average 67% of daytime at home, 2% at work, and 9% at school. Active participation in school and work resulted the key drivers of the number of contacts and, similarly, household size, class size, and time spent at work influenced the number of home, school, and work contacts, respectively. We found that the heterogeneous nature of home contacts is critical for an epidemic transmission chain. In particular, our results suggest that, during the initial phase of an epidemic, about 50% of infections are expected to occur among individuals younger than 12 years and less than 20% among individuals older than 35 years. CONCLUSIONS: With the current work, we have gathered data and information on the ways through which individuals in SSA interact, and on the factors that mostly facilitate this interaction. Monitoring these processes is critical to realistically predict the effects of interventions on infectious diseases dynamics.
23239079	BACKGROUND: No previous study could be found that examined the longitudinal association between suicidal ideation and the factors associated with it and that considered both individual and contextual characteristics simultaneously. This study examined whether variation in suicidal ideation is attributable to the administrative-area level and examined suicidal ideation and the factors associated with it at multiple levels, especially focusing on social capital. METHODS: Longitudinal data of 5222 individuals and 2741 households in 25 administrative areas from the Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the Seoul Welfare Panel Study were used. RESULTS: In the study, 2.7% of variation in suicidal ideation was attributable to the administrative area. The results also suggested that perceived helpfulness at individual level (odds ratio (OR) = 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.43, 0.83) and organizational participation at administrative-area level were associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.53, 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers should consider laying down policies aimed at preventing suicide at administrative-area level as suicidal ideation of individuals is different between administrative areas. However, it should also be recognized that directing attention solely at administrative-area level is not efficient, as only small variations in suicidal ideation are attributable to this level. Decision makers need to consider policies promoting social capital, as it may play a role in reducing suicide risk.
19022434	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the probability of medical consultation for infertility during the course of a pregnancy attempt and to study its determinants. DESIGN: Pregnancy-based retrospective telephone survey analyzed with a discrete time Cox model. SETTING: Two rural counties in Brittany and Normandy, France. PATIENT(S): A random sample of 901 women from the general population aged 18-60 years reporting 1,460 pregnancy attempts resulting in a live birth between 1985 and 2000 (participation rate, 73%). INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Probability of medical consultation for involuntary infertility cumulated over time. RESULT(S): The cumulative probability of medical consultation for involuntary infertility among nulligravid women was 45% after 12 months of involuntary infertility and 75% after 24 months. The probability of medical consultation at any time was half that for parous women (odds ratio 0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.6). More highly educated women were more likely to have sought medical help for infertility. Only 45% of women who had sought medical advice received infertility treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Our survival approach provides a description of infertility service use during the course of a pregnancy attempt, and confirms that parity and educational level are strong predictors of medical help-seeking behaviors.
23912202	Hispanics bear a disproportionate burden of diabetes in the United States, yet relations of structural, socio-cultural and behavioral factors linked to diabetes are not fully understood across all of their communities. The current study examines disparities and factors associated with diabetes in adult Hispanics of Mexican-descent (N = 648) participating in a population survey of an underserved rural U.S.-Mexico border community. The overall rate of diabetes prevalence rate in the sample, based on self-report and a glucose testing, was 21%; much higher than rates reported for U.S. adults overall, for all Hispanic adults, or for Mexican American adults specifically. Acculturation markers and social determinants of health indicators were only significantly related to diabetes in models not accounting for age. Older age, greater BMI (>30), greater waist-to-hip ratio as well as lower fruit and vegetable consumption were significantly related to increased likelihood of diabetes when all structural, cultural, behavioral, and biological factors were considered. Models with sets of behavioral factors and biological factors each significantly improved explanation of diabetes relative to prior social ecological theory-guided models. The findings show a critical need for diabetes prevention efforts in this community and suggest that health promotion efforts should particularly focus on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption.
31479374	Enabling services address a combination of social determinants of health and barriers to access to primary care and are intended to reduce health disparities. They include care coordination; health education; transportation; and assistance with obtaining food, shelter, and benefits. Empirical evidence of enabling services' potential contribution to health outcomes is limited, which impedes their widespread dissemination. We examined how the receipt of enabling services influenced patient health care outcomes based on a nationally representative survey of patients served in 2014 at health centers funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration. We compared enabling services users and nonusers and found that enabling services were associated with 1.92 more health center visits, an 11.78-percentage-point higher probability of getting a routine checkup, a 16.34-percentage-point higher likelihood of having had a flu shot, and a 7.63-percentage-point higher probability of patient satisfaction. Our results confirm the value of systematic delivery of enabling services in reducing access barriers and improving patient satisfaction.
17144765	In 2 studies, the authors investigated the determinants of anger and approach-related intentions and behavior toward outgroup members in interracial interactions. In Study 1, White and Black participants who were led to believe that their interracial interaction partner was not open to an upcoming interaction reported heightened anger and approach-related intentions concerning the interaction, including viewing their partner as hostile, intending to ask sensitive race-relevant questions during the interaction, and planning to blame the partner if the interaction went poorly. Results of Study 2 showed that White participants who received negative feedback about their Black partner's openness to interracial interactions behaved in a hostile manner toward their interaction partner. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the quality of interracial interactions.
18386045	OBJECTIVE: While health inequalities among employees are well documented, their variation and determinants among employee subpopulations are poorly understood. We examined variations in occupational class inequalities in health within four employment sectors and the contribution of working conditions to these inequalities. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the Helsinki Health Study in 2000-2002 were used. Each year, employees of the City of Helsinki, aged 40-60 years, received a mailed questionnaire (n = 8,960, 80% women, overall response rate for 3 years 67%). The outcome was physical health functioning measured by the overall physical component summary of SF-36. The socioeconomic indicator was occupational social class. Employment sectors studied were health care, education, social welfare and administration (n = 6,557). Physical and mental workload, and job demands and job control were explanatory factors. Inequality indices from logistic regression analysis were calculated. RESULTS: Occupational class inequalities in physical health functioning were slightly larger in education (1.47) than in the other sectors (1.43-1.40). Physical workload explained 95% of inequalities in social welfare and 32-36% in the other sectors. Job control also partly explained health inequalities. However, adjusting for mental workload and job demands resulted in larger health inequalities. CONCLUSION: Inequalities in physical health functioning were found within each employment sector, with minor variation in their magnitude. Physical workload was the main explanation for these inequalities, but its contribution varied between the sectors. In contrast, considering psychosocial working conditions led to wider inequalities. Improving physical working conditions among the lower occupational classes would help reduce health inequalities within different employment sectors.
26650034	The availability of local support and care infrastructures at the place of residence is an important issue for the elderly living in rural areas. Spatial mobility can be seen as a strategy to cope with a lack of local care facilities. This study analyzes the preferences of older people living in long-term relationships concerning support and care arrangements. Furthermore, it is analyzed how far and under which circumstances older couples are willing to relocate their place of residence in response to regional care infrastructures. Using a quasi-experimental survey design, inhabitants of a small rural community aged over 50 years were interviewed and confronted with descriptions of fictitious situations with randomized options for moving residence. A Tobit model estimation method is applied to examine the determinants of older couples' care-related willingness to move their residence.The results show that most people prefer either the support of their own partner or outpatient care. Residential care is especially preferred by people aged 75 years and above, whereas new forms of support, such as senior cooperatives, are evaluated as attractive especially by younger age groups. Thus, information and advisory campaigns should address the target group in question even at an early stage in older peoples' life course. Care-related willingness to move home of couples aged 50 years and more is significantly determined by local provision of support and care infrastructures. The expansion of any care infrastructure at older peoples' place of residence can significantly reduce their willingness to move. In particular an increased availability of outpatient care is associated with a comparatively large reduction in couples' likelihood to move. In this way local commitment to rural areas can be sustained and rural depopulation can be prevented. At an alternative place of residence assisted living and residential care in particular can significantly enhance the willingness to relocate and can thus generate incentives to move for older couples.
28501047	Population-level assessment and planning has traditionally been the role of public health departments but in establishing Primary Health Networks (PHNs), the Australian Government has instituted a new mechanism for identifying community needs and commissioning services to meet those needs. If PHNs are to achieve the vision of nimble organisations capable of identifying and addressing local health needs via integrated health and social services, several things need to occur. First, PHN funding schedules must become more flexible. Second, the Federal health department must maintain an open dialogue with PHNs, permit waivers in funding schedules to suit local conditions and be prepared to back innovations with seed investment. Third, health data exchange and linkage must be accelerated to better inform community needs assessments and commissioning. Finally, PHNs must be encouraged and supported to develop collaborations both within and outside the health sector in order to identify and address a broad set of health issues and determinants. By following these principles, PHNs may become leading change agents in the Australian healthcare system.
18569628	The health burden of environmental exposures, including ambient air pollution and climate-change-related health impacts, is not equally distributed between or within regions and countries. These inequalities are currently receiving increased attention in environmental research as well as enhanced appreciation in environmental policy, where calls for environmental equity are more frequently heard. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 Global Update of the Air Quality Guidelines attempted to address the global-scale inequalities in exposures to air pollution and the burden of diseases due to air pollution. The guidelines stop short, however, of addressing explicitly the inequalities in exposure and adverse health effects within countries and urban areas due to differential distribution of sources of air pollution such as motor vehicles and local industry, and differences in susceptibility to the adverse health effects attributed to air pollution. These inequalities, may, however, be addressed in local air quality and land use management decisions. Locally, community-based participatory research can play an important role in documenting potential inequities and fostering corrective action. Research on environmental inequities will also benefit from current efforts to (1) better understand social determinants of health and (2) apply research evidence to reduce health disparities. Similarly, future research and policy action will benefit from stronger linkages between equity concerns related to health consequences of both air pollution exposure and climate change, since combustion products are important contributors to both of these environmental problems.
11404202	Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) continue to be a significant and prevalent problem among adolescents. One in four sexually active teenagers are infected with one or more STDs. Certain STDs, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and possibly human papillomavirus infections have the highest prevalence in this age group. The determinants of risk for STDs in adolescence encompass a range of behavioral, biological, and social factors. This review focuses on the skin signs of STDs in adolescents. Recognition of these findings is important since they may represent the most prominent, earliest, or only evidence of an STD. The recognition of the non-AIDs STDs has the added importance of identifying a population at high risk for HIV infection. Although recent data suggest encouraging trends in sexual risk behaviors among high school students in the United States, great challenges remain in the efforts to expand primary and secondary prevention strategies for STDs in adolescents. Expertise in the recognition and treatment of STDs in adolescents remains important for clinicians who care for adolescents.
16174346	Some propositions on male and female sexual orientation will be considered. Some of these are established; others are more speculative. The aim is to offer some notes towards a coherent, comprehensive theory of sexual orientation. 1. The distinction between butch and femme lesbians seems real rather than a social construct. 2. High levels of prenatal steroid hormones seem to be causally associated with the sexual orientation of butch lesbians. However it is not established whether the causal process operates prenatally or postnatally (or both). This is so because prenatal hormone levels are thought to correlate positively with postnatal hormone levels. And high postnatal hormone levels may facilitate homosexual behaviour as a consequence of sensation-seeking. 3. Male bisexuals also are interpreted to have been exposed to high prenatal testosterone levels. But (for reasons similar to those outlined above in regard to butch lesbians) it is unclear whether these have a direct prenatal effect on the brain or whether they are precursors of high postnatal testosterone levels, which are associated with male bisexual orientation by promoting sensation-seeking behaviour. 4. Postnatal learning processes seem to be causally involved in the sexual orientation of some femme lesbians and some exclusive male homosexuals. 5. Some homosexual men have genes that predispose to their sexual orientation. 6. The same may apply to some lesbians, but such genes have not, as far as I know, been identified. 7. People (of both sexes) who engage in same-sex sexual behaviour may be classified simultaneously in two ways, viz (1) 'active' vs 'passive' and (2) those who do and those who do not engage (or consider engaging) in sex with members of the opposite sex. Ex hypothesi, some of the 'active' ones initiate some of the 'passive' ones. The active ones are driven more by hormones and the passive ones by psychosocial factors. The active males contain a substantial proportion of self-identified bisexuals; and the active females a substantial proportion of self-identified butches. 8. These two active categories (butch lesbians and male bisexuals) share a number of endocrinological, psychological, morphological and behavioural features vis-a-vis their exclusively homosexual and heterosexual peers. Methods of testing some of these ideas are presented.
23611831	BACKGROUND: The home and family environment is a highly influential psychosocial antecedent of pediatric obesity. Implementation of conventional family- and home-based childhood obesity interventions is challenging for parents, often requiring them to attend multiple educational sessions. Attrition rates for traditional interventions are frequently high due to competing demands for parents' time. Under such constraints, an Internet-based intervention has the potential to modify determinants of childhood obesity while making judicious use of parents' time. Theory-based interventions offer many advantages over atheoretical interventions, including reduced intervention dosage, increased likelihood of behavioral change, and efficient resource allocation. Social cognitive theory (SCT) is a robust theoretical framework for addressing childhood obesity. SCT is a behavior change model rooted in reciprocal determinism, a causal paradigm that states that human functioning is the product of a dynamic interplay of behavioral, personal, and environmental factors. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of the Enabling Mothers to Prevent Childhood Obesity Through Web-Based Education and Reciprocal Determinism (EMPOWER) program, an Internet-based, theory-driven intervention for preventing childhood overweight and obesity. The project goal is supported by two specific aims: (1) modification of four obesogenic protective factors related to childhood obesity (minutes engaged in physical activity, servings of fruits and vegetables consumed, servings of sugar-sweetened and sugar-free beverages consumed, and minutes engaged in screen time), and (2) reification of five maternal-mediated constructs of SCT (environment, expectations, emotional coping, self-control, and self-efficacy). METHODS: We will recruit mothers with children ages 4 to 6 years from childcare centers and randomly assign them to either the theory-based (experimental) or knowledge-based (control) arm of the trial. Data for the intervention will be collected at three intervals: baseline (week 0), posttest (week 4), and follow-up (8 weeks). At each phase of data collection, we will collect from both groups (1) measures of the four obesogenic protective factors, and (2) summated SCT construct scores. Constructs will be measured by a psychometrically valid and reliable SCT-based instrument. Behaviors will be evaluated by a behavior log. We will use a repeated-measures one-between-, one-within-participants design to evaluate intervention results. Constructs will be modified through Web-based learning modules, online interactive worksheets, and mother-child home-based activities. Process evaluation will assess program fidelity.
28606163	BACKGROUND: The island country of Samoa (population 188,000 in 2011) forms part of Polynesia in the South Pacific. Over the past several decades Samoa has experienced exceptional modernization and globalization of many sectors of society, with noncommunicable diseases (NCD) now the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The evolution of risk factor prevalence underpinning the increase in NCDs, however, has not been well described, including tobacco smoking which is related to cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: The present study examines tobacco smoking in relation to different forms and effects of globalization in Samoa using 7 population-based surveys (n = 9223) over 1978-2013. RESULTS: The prevalence of daily tobacco smoking steadily decreased over 1978-2013 from 76% to 36% in men, and from 27% to 15% in women (p < 0.0001 both sexes). During 1991-2013, current tobacco smoking also steadily decreased from 64% to 40% in men (p < 0.0001), and from 21% to 17% in women (p < 0.05). Declines were similar in younger (25-44 years) and older (45-64 years) men and women. Colonial globalization facilitated the introduction and prolific spread of tobacco trade and consumption in the Pacific Islands from the sixteenth century, with many populations inexorably pulled into trade relations and links to the global economy. It has also been a different globalization which may have led to the decline in smoking prevalence in Samoa in recent decades, through global dissemination since the 1950s of information on the harmful effects of tobacco smoking derived from research studies in the USA and Europe. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 35 years tobacco smoking has steadily declined among Samoan adults; the only NCD risk factor to demonstrate marked declines during this period. By 2013 tobacco smoking in women had decreased to levels similar to Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), however in men smoking prevalence remained more than three times higher than ANZ. The impact on smoking prevalence of the variety of tobacco control interventions that have been implemented so far in Samoa need to be evaluated in order to determine the most effective initiatives that should be prioritized and strengthened.
24678214	BACKGROUND: The coverage of maternal care services among the tribal women in Kerala is better as compared to other states in India. AIM: This study was done to identify the factors contributing to better coverage of maternal care services among the tribal women in Kerala and to study the reasons for remaining differences that exists in utilization of services between tribal and non-tribal pregnant women. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a descriptive cum qualitative study conducted in Thariode Gramapanchayat in the Wayanad district of Kerala. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among all women who had registered their pregnancies in the 5 sub-centres under CHC Thariode and had delivered between September 2009 and October 2010, equal numbers of tribal and non-tribal ante-natal women, 35 each were interviewed in-depth using a semi-structured questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS Version 16.0. Content analysis was done for qualitative data. RESULTS: The determinants of utilization in tribal women were general awareness, affordability, accessibility and quality of services along with motivation by health workers. Among tribal antenatal women, 85% utilized maternal health care facilities fully compared to 100% among non-tribal women. Lower levels of education and lack of transport facilities were prime factors contributing to under utilization by tribal women. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable, accessible and good quality of services in the public health system in Kerala and motivation by health workers were important contributing factors for better utilization of maternal care services.
28466658	"Paramedics, health care workers who assess and manage health concerns in the prehospital setting, are increasingly providing psychosocial care in response to a rise in mental health call volume. Observers have construed this fact as ""misuse"" of paramedic services, and proposed as solutions better triaging of patients, better mental health training of paramedics, and a greater number of community mental health services. In this commentary, we argue that despite the ostensibly well-intentioned nature of these solutions, they shift attention and accountability away from relevant public policies, as well as from broader economic, social, and political determinants of mental health, while placing responsibility on those requiring services or, at best, on the health care system. We also argue that the perspective of paramedics, who are exposed to, and interact with, individuals in their everyday environments, has the potential to inform a better, structural and critical, understanding of the factors driving the rise in psychosocial crises in the first place. Finally, we suggest that a greater engagement with the political and social determinants of mental health would lead to preventing, rather than primarily reacting to, these crises after the fact."
14674182	Given the increasing incidence of chronic diseases across the world, the search for more effective strategies to prevent and manage them is essential. The use of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) has assisted healthcare teams to demonstrate effective, relevant solutions to this growing challenge. However, the current CCM is geared to clinically oriented systems, and is difficult to use for prevention and health promotion practitioners. To better integrate aspects of prevention and health promotion into the CCM, an enhanced version called the Expanded Chronic Care Model is introduced. This new model includes elements of the population health promotion field so that broadly based prevention efforts, recognition of the social determinants of health, and enhanced community participation can also be part of the work of health system teams as they work with chronic disease issues.
22028525	Stigma and resultant psychosocial issues are major hurdles that people with epilepsy confront in their daily life. People with epilepsy, particularly women, living in economically weak countries are often ill equipped to handle the stigma that they experience at multiple levels. This paper offers a systematic review of the research on stigma from sociology and social psychology and details how stigma linked to epilepsy or similar conditions can result in stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination. We also briefly discuss the strategies that are most commonly utilized to mitigate stigma. Neurologists and other health care providers, social workers, support groups and policy makers working with epilepsy need to have a deep understanding of the social and cultural perceptions of epilepsy and the related stigma. It is necessary that societies establish unique determinants of stigma and set up appropriate strategies to mitigate stigma and facilitate the complete inclusion of people with epilepsy as well as mitigating any existing discrimination.
31189640	OBJECTIVE: To quantify the degree of non-attendance of medical appointments, as well as to identify the social reasons behind the missed appointments, at an inner-city primary care clinic. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and survey. SETTING: Inner-city clinic in Saskatoon, Sask, serving a primarily low-income and First Nations population. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with appointments in the clinic between January 2016 and June 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of non-attended clinic appointments and the reasons for missed appointments. RESULTS: Of the 1976 booked appointments during the study period, 487 (24.6%) appointments were not attended. Among the patients with walk-in appointments, 123 (15.5%) of them left the clinic before seeing a physician. New patients had a high rate of non-attendance (44.4% did not show up to appointments). Among those who did not attend an appointment, 19.9% of them missed more than 1 appointment; 77.8% of missed appointments were made more than a week in advance of the appointment, and 51.7% of those who missed an appointment saw a physician at the clinic at a later date (18.5 days later on average). The most common reasons for non-attendance were forgetting the appointment or feeling too sick to attend. Social determinants such as transportation were also found to play a role in non-attendance. Most survey participants stated that a telephone call reminder would aid them in keeping their appointments. CONCLUSION: Non-attendance is a multifactorial issue that causes a considerable waste of resources, limits the provision of preventive care, and negatively affects patient health. As forgetting was found to be a frequent cause of missed appointments, introducing a telephone reminder system might be an affordable and effective first measure to address non-attendance. Factors associated with poverty and other social determinants of health also affect attendance and are more challenging to address.
18805655	PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence and correlates of cocaine injection initiation and the impacts of daily cocaine injection among a cohort of injection drug users. METHODS: Among 1603 participants, from May 1996 to December 2005, risk factors for initiation of cocaine injection among baseline heroin users were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression and correlates of daily cocaine injection by generalized estimating equations. FINDINGS: Of the 238 individuals who had never injected cocaine, 200 (84%) had at least one follow-up visit and 121 (61%) consequently initiated into cocaine injection, yielding an incidence density of initiation into cocaine injection of 21.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.9-25.8) per 100 person-years. In a multivariate model, Downtown Eastside (DTES) residence (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=2.46, 95% CI: 1.68-3.60), incarceration (AHR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.01-2.24), requiring help injecting (AHR=1.57, 95% CI: 0.99-2.49), and binge drug use (AHR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.22-2.73) remained associated with initiation into cocaine injection. DTES residence (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.99, 95% CI: 1.62-2.46), unstable housing (AOR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), incarceration (AOR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.60), sex trade involvement (AOR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.15-1.85), requiring help injecting (AOR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.73-2.58)), borrowing syringes (AOR=1.81, 95% CI: 1.35-2.43) and binge drug use (AOR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.81-2.58) were independently associated with daily cocaine injection. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline prevalence and subsequent incidence of initiation into cocaine injection was high. Daily cocaine injection was independently associated with a number of health and social harms, including elevated HIV risk behavior.
16251223	A systematic review was conducted to examine the barriers to, and facilitators of, healthy eating among young people (11-16 years). The review focused on the wider determinants of health, examining community- and society-level interventions. Seven outcome evaluations and eight studies of young people's views were included. The effectiveness of the interventions was mixed, with improvements in knowledge and increases in healthy eating but differences according to gender. Barriers to healthy eating included poor school meal provision and ease of access to, relative cheapness of and personal taste preferences for fast food. Facilitators included support from family, wider availability of healthy foods, desire to look after one's appearance and will-power. Friends and teachers were generally not a common source of information. Some of the barriers and facilitators identified by young people had been addressed by soundly evaluated effective interventions, but significant gaps were identified where no evaluated interventions appear to have been published (e.g. better labelling of food products), or where there were no methodologically sound evaluations. Rigorous evaluation is required particularly to assess the effectiveness of increasing the availability of affordable healthy food in the public and private spaces occupied by young people.
20024758	We developed gender-specific explanatory models for unsafe sexual behavior among unmarried young people living in urban West Africa using a culturally adapted instrument which addresses personal, relational and socio-cognitive factors. Data were collected on condom use and number of sexual partners, and on their potential determinants, using in-person interviews on a heterogeneous sample of in-school and out-of-school young women (n=185) and (n=214) men who reported ever having had sexual intercourse. Recruitment was done at various sites in 21 randomly selected neighborhoods in Bamako. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to identify determinants of lack of condom at last sex and having more than one partner in the last six months and to test for interactions with gender. Similar percentages of men (40%) and women (46%) reported not using a condom at last sex. However, more men (64%) reported multiple partnering in the last six months than women (32%). Our findings suggest that the context of sexual debut, social status, relation to peers and family as well as attitudinal, normative and behavioral control constructs may influence young men and women's sexual behavior, but that pathways leading to unsafe sex are different across genders. Our findings also show that factors associated with condom use and sexual partnering are distinct. Earlier sexual debut seems to be risk-inducing in women while risk-reducing in men. Poor communication with peers and receiving money from sexual partner were associated with lack of condom use in women. High behavioral control was associated with fewer sexual partners in men. Determinants of unsafe sexual behavior were found at the social, interpersonal and individual levels for both men and women, but notable gender differentials existed. These findings underscore the importance of addressing gender as a crucial factor shaping HIV-risk profiles.
29239799	"OBJECTIVES: Demographic, physical and psychological associations of successful aging (SA) have been evaluated, but occupational factors have not. Nor has SA been evaluated in a specific occupational group. The aims of this study were to examine the occupational associations of SA in older physicians, and to explore the concept of occupational SA. METHODS: Physicians aged 55+ years completed self-ratings of occupational and personal SA on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS; 1 being ""least successful"" and 10 ""most successful""). Associations between occupational and personal SA (defined as 8-10 on the VAS), respectively, and demographic and practice characteristics; health; social and financial resources; cognitive, emotional and motivational resources; work centrality; and anxiety about aging were examined. RESULTS: Rates of occupational SA (69.2%; 95% CI: 66.3-72.0) were significantly higher than personal SA (63.1%; 95% CI: 60.1-66.0) in the sample of 1,048 physicians. Occupational and personal SA were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.73, N = 1,041, p < 0.001). Personal SA was predicted by demographic (older age, female, international medical graduate, urban practice), physical (better self-rated health), psychological (less depression, better cognitive, emotional and motivational resources, and greater anxiety about aging), and occupational (higher work centrality, fewer practice adaptations and not intending to retire) factors. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational factors are central to physicians' self-conceptualization of SA. That greater work centrality, fewer work adaptations and less retirement planning were associated with personal SA suggests older physicians' sense of ""success"" is intertwined with continuing practice. There is a need for educating physicians to adapt to aging and retirement."
17315529	BACKGROUND: There are conflicting findings regarding the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and bone mineral density. We aimed to investigate bone status and its possible determinants by comparing students from two schools, located in a high and a low SES district. METHODS: Data were gathered by using anthropometric measurements and a questionnaire for both families and the students from the two schools chosen by the Ministry of Education. Quantitative ultrasound measurements were done with Omnisense 700P. For normally distributed variables t-test and for others Mann-Whitney U test was utilized. We used the chi-squared test for nominal variables. RESULTS: Forty-two girls and 35 boys from a low SES school, and 41 girls and 38 boys from a high SES school were included in the study. Students in the high SES school had significantly higher calcium scores and more physical activity compared to those in the low SES school. Boys in the high SES school had higher z-scores for quantitative ultrasound; however, they had higher Tanner stages when compared to boys from the low SES school. Speed of sound (SOS) and z-scores of the girls were similar between the two schools. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the notion that certain environmental factors, such as calcium intake and physical activity, might reflect socioeconomic trends in adolescents, similar to adults; however, genetic influences may dominate in terms of bone status.
17852976	OBJECTIVE: Rate of non-attendance following invitation for breast cancer screening is related to several socioeconomic conditions. To what extent this reflects differences with regard to individual and environmental circumstances, respectively, has received little attention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of individual socioeconomic and area-level determinants on variations in non-attendance among geographic areas in an urban mammographic service screening programme. METHODS: The study population consisted of 32,119 women invited for mammographic screening in 1990-93, residing in 97 neighbourhoods in the city of Malmo in Sweden. The influence of the individual factors age, marital status, education, housing accommodation, household income, and area-level circumstances, e.g. rate of migration and rate of being gainfully employed, on the rate of non-attendance was assessed by multilevel analysis. RESULTS: Area rates of nonattendance ranged from 18% to 63%. Of the total variability in non-attendance, 4.3% was between neighbourhoods. This effect was significantly reduced when adjusting for the individual factors. The area-level factors, migration, and rate of being gainfully employed reduced and almost erased the neighbourhood variance in non-attendance. CONCLUSION: In addition to individual socioeconomic factors, area-level factors seem to be important determinants of neighbourhood rates of non-attendance in an urban mammographic screening programme. In a public health perspective neighbourhoods may be targeted in order to affect the problem of non-attendance in mammographic screening.
12102133	Experimental analysis procedures have been shown to be effective means for identifying the environmental determinants of problem behaviors. A potential limitation of these procedures is that it is necessary to produce and document patterns in the occurrence of the problem behavior during the assessment. In the case of severe behavior disorders, this may place the participant or therapist at such risk as to preclude the analysis. The current study arranged experimental analysis contingencies for precursor behaviors that had been observed to reliably precede the occurrence of problem behaviors targeted for reduction. For each of the 4 participants, it was possible to infer the maintaining variables for problem behaviors based on the outcomes of precursor analysis. These results suggest that the current procedures represent a promising alternative method for reducing risk during functional analysis of problem behaviors.
30616565	BACKGROUND: The growth and development that occurs in early childhood has long-term implications, therefore understanding the relevant determinants is needed to inform early prevention and intervention. The objectives of the study were to examine: 1) the longitudinal associations of physical activity and sedentary behavior with social skills and 2) how physical activity and sedentary behavior track over three time-points. METHODS: Participants were from the Parents' Role in Establishing healthy Physical activity and Sedentary behavior habits (PREPS) project. A total of 251 eligible toddlers and their parents participated at baseline in 2014/15 (time 1; 1.6 +/- 0.2 years) and a sub-sample participated at 1-year (time 2; n = 79; 2.7 +/- 0.3 years) and 2-year (time 3; n = 77; 3.7 +/- 0.4 years) follow-ups. Sedentary time (</=25 counts/15 s), light-intensity physical activity (LPA; 26-419 counts/15 s), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA; >/=420/15 s) were objectively measured with wGT3X-BT ActiGraph accelerometers, and standardized for wear time. Parents reported their children's screen time (television/video, video/computer games) at all three time-points. Parents also reported on children's social skills using the Adaptive Social Behavior Inventory (ASBI) at time-points 2 and 3, and comply (e.g., cooperates; 10 items), express (e.g., joins play; 13 items), and disrupt (e.g., teases; 7 items) subscales were created by summing items. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were conducted to address objective one. Tracking coefficients (low: beta1 < 0.30; moderate: beta1 = 0.30-0.59; moderate-high: beta1 = 0.60-0.90; high: beta1 > 0.9) were conducted using GEE to address objective two. RESULTS: Across the study, screen time was negatively associated with express (b = - 0.068, 95%CI: -0.114, - 0.023) and comply (b = - 0.056; 95%CI: -0.094, - 0.018) scores and positively associated with disrupt scores (b = 0.004; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.006). Findings were similar for television/videos but less consistent for video/computer games. No associations were observed for physical activity. Screen time significantly tracked at moderate-high levels (beta1 = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.81), while all other behaviors tracked at moderate levels (beta1 = 0.35-0.49; p < 0.01) over the three time-points. CONCLUSIONS: Screen time was unfavorably associated with social skills across early childhood. Furthermore, all behaviors tracked at moderate to moderate-high levels from toddler to preschool ages. Therefore, promoting healthy physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns early in life, especially for screen time, may be important.
23448627	Mental health refers to a diverse field where individuals can cope with daily stress, realize their potential and maintain a state of well-being. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the influence of mental health on general health, and in particular on cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors. Epidemiological research has focused on several psychosocial components including social determinants, comorbid psychiatric disorders, psychological stress, coping styles, social support, burden on the family, well-being, life satisfaction, personality and cognitive factors in connection with cardiovascular diseases. There is epidemiological research in India that integrates mental health with common cardiovascular diseases such as coronary health disease and stroke. Data from mental health research is sufficiently compelling to highlight the role of chronic stress, socioeconomic status and psychiatric disorders such as depression, substance use, social networks and support in relation to vulnerability to cardiovascular diseases. There are psychosocial consequences of cardiovascular diseases including deficits in the domains of life skills, coping skills and neurocognition, in addition to caregiver burden. The implications of bio-psychosocial models of assessments and interventions that target complex individual and contextual variables simultaneously on cardiovascular treatment outcomes have highlighted the importance of studying mental health in Indian settings. Integration of mental health into mainstream research is the need of the hour. A multidimensional approach to accomplish this is required including at the level of research conceptualization, discussions with key stakeholders, at the policy level, at the institutional level, and at the clinical and community level.
23106752	BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disability (ID) experience health inequity compared with the general population, a key contributing factor being disparities in social determinants of health. The enactment of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) provides a platform for the progression and promotion of health and other interconnected rights to address barriers to the highest attainable standard of health for this populace. Rights can be brought to life through advocacy efforts. This paper explores the meaning, perceptions and experiences of advocacy by family members and paid support workers of adults with ID and locates the findings within a health and human rights discourse. METHODS: As part of a larger randomised controlled trial, 113 parents and 84 support workers of adults with ID completed a telephone interview that included open-ended questions about their understanding and experiences of advocacy. Thematic analysis was used to identify relevant themes. RESULTS: Five key themes were identified. The first underscored how advocacy to 'speak up' for the person with ID is integral to both parent and support worker roles. The second and third themes considered the contexts for advocacy efforts. Access to quality health care was a core concern, along with advocacy across other areas and sectors to address the person's wider psychosocial needs. The remaining themes highlighted the many dimensions to advocacy, including differences between parent and support worker views, with parental advocacy being an expression of 'caring' and support workers motivated by a 'duty of care' to protect the individual's 'rights'. CONCLUSION: Parent and support worker advocacy provides one means to address the social determinants of health and fulfilment of health rights of and for people with ID. Policy and practice in the context of governmental obligation under the CRPD should support advocacy and make health rights the reality not rhetoric for this group of men and women.
15918661	Our knowledge of juvenile delinquency has progressed considerably since the early 1980s, thanks to self-reported delinquency surveys. They teach us that the determinants of delinquent behaviors among teenagers are dependent on the facility with which the offense is committed, the internal motivation (frustration in the family and school, observational learning of the use of violence in the media) and the weakness of social reactions.
28602765	BACKGROUND: Human brucellosis and recurrent brucellosis is an ever-increasing public health concern, especially in endemic areas like Iran. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the epidemiology and determinants of recurrent brucellosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate epidemiological patterns and potential determinants of recurrent brucellosis in Hamadan Province during the years 2009-2015. METHODS: Data on reported cases of new and recurrent brucellosis from 2009 to 2015 were obtained from the provincial Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. Incidence rates per 100000 were estimated at the county level. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of background characteristics and recurrent brucellosis. The power of discrimination of the model for recurrent brucellosis was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Among 7318 brucellosis cases, the total frequency (%) of recurrent cases was 472 (6.45%). The rate of recurrent brucellosis was higher in females, people aged 50 years and over, people with a history of consuming unpasteurized dairy products with no history of contact with animals, and in the winter season. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.65), age >/=55 years (AOR 4.15, 95% CI 2.32-7.42), consumption of unpasteurized dairy products (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.40), and winter season (AOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.71) are potential risk factors for recurrent brucellosis. The final model that involved all the determinants showed moderate discrimination (AUC 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Female sex, older age, and winter months were found to be significant determinants of recurrent human brucellosis. Enhanced surveillance systems with an emphasis on these population characteristics will allow effective preventive and protective measures to be implemented and might alleviate the recurrence of brucellosis in the country.
11851959	Despite growing public resistance to the practice of female genital cutting (FGC), documentation of its prevalence, social correlates or trends in practice are extremely limited, and most available data are based on self-reporting. In three antenatal and three family planning clinics in South-west Nigeria we studied the prevalence, social determinants, and validity of self-reporting for FGC among 1709 women. Women were interviewed on social and demographic history, and whether or not they had undergone FGC. Interviews were followed by clinical examination to affirm the occurrence and extent of circumcision. In total, 45.9% had undergone some form of cutting. Based on WHO classifications by type, 32.6% had Type I cuts, 11.5% Type II, and 1.9% Type III or IV. Self-reported FGC status was valid in 79% of women; 14% were unsure of their status, and 7% reported their status incorrectly. Women are more likely to be unsure of their status if they were not cut, or come from social groups with a lower prevalence of cutting. Ethnicity was the most significant social predictor of FGC, followed by age, religious affiliation and education. Prevalence of FGC was highest among the Bini and Urhobo, among those with the least education, and particularly high among adherents to Pentecostal churches; this was independent of related social factors. There is evidence of a steady and steep secular decline in the prevalence of FGC in this region over the past 25 years, with age-specific prevalence rates of 75.4% among women aged 45-49 years, 48.6% among 30-34-year olds, and 14.5% among girls aged 15-19. Despite wide disparities in FGC prevalence across ethnic, religious and educational groups, the secular decline is evident among all social subgroups.
15345887	BACKGROUND: At least 50 percent of the injections administered each year are unsafe, more particularly in developing countries, posing serious health risks. An initial assessment to describe injection practices; their determinants and adverse effects can prevent injection-associated transmission of blood borne pathogens by reducing injection frequency and adoption of safe injection practices. AIMS: To assess the injection practices in a large metropolitan city encompassing varied socio-cultural scenarios. STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: Field based cross sectional survey covering urban non-slum, slum and peri-urban areas of a large metropolitan city. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Injection prescribers, providers and community members selected by random sampling from the study areas. Pre tested questionnaires assessed knowledge and perceptions of study subjects towards injections and their possible complications. Observation of the process of injection and prescription audit also carried out. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: MS Access for database and SPSS ver 11 for analysis. Point estimates, 95% confidence intervals, Chi Square, t test, one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The per capita injection rate was 5.1 per year and ratio of therapeutic to immunization injections was 4.4:1. Only 22.5%of injections were administered with a sterile syringe and needle. The level of knowledge about HIV and HBV transmission by unsafe injections was satisfactory amongst prescribers and community, but inadequate amongst providers. HCV was known to a very few in all the groups. The annual incidence of needle stick injuries among providers was quite high. CONCLUSION: A locally relevant safe injection policy based on multi disciplinary approach is required to reduce number of injections, unsafe injections and their attendant complications.
19276334	Globally, research on social determinants of health has built a considerable knowledge base over the last decade. Still, not much of this research has been carried out in the extremely poor areas of the world, like for instance Africa south of the Sahara. In very poor ruralities, classic indicators of socioeconomic status are not well suited. Few people have any education, monetary income is not a good measure of material standing and people cannot be classified by occupation as they make their livelihood from a variety of activities. For efforts towards health equity to benefit the poorest of the poor, more suitable indicators of social health determinants must be identified. Health research might benefit from knowledge developed in neighbouring fields like development research, anthropology and sociology.
16290129	This paper investigates the determinants of regional variations in outpatient antibiotic consumption using Swiss data. The analysis contributes to the debate on appropriate antibiotic use by improving the understanding of its determinants, and may help to define more effective health care policies to reduce the resistance phenomenon. Findings suggest that Switzerland exhibits relatively low levels of consumption among European countries. There are significant differences between cantons both in the per capita antibiotic sales and defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants (DID). Econometric estimations suggest that DID are significantly related to per capita income, antibiotic price, the density of medical practices, demographic, cultural and educational factors. The incidence of bacterial infections is also relevant. Appropriate policies affecting antibiotic consumption in the community can be designed by looking at crucial determinants in the model and their related impact.
28341220	INTRODUCTION: Social and behavioral factors play important roles in physical and mental health; however, they are not routinely assessed in the healthcare system. A brief panel of measures of social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDs) were recommended in a National Academy of Medicine report for use in electronic health records. Initial testing of the panel established feasibility of use and robustness of the measures. This study evaluates their convergent and divergent validity in relation to self-reported physical and mental health and social desirability bias. METHODS: Adults, aged >/=18 years, were recruited through Qualtrics online panel survey platform in 2015 (data analyzed in 2015-2016). Participants completed the (1) panel of SBD measures; (2) 12-Item Short Form Health Survey to assess associations with global physical and mental health; and (3) Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale short form to assess whether social desirability influenced associations between SBD measures and self-reported health. RESULTS: The sample included 513 participants (mean age, 47.9 [SD=14.2] years; 65.5% female). Several SBD domain measures were associated with physical and mental health. Adjusting for age, poorer physical and mental health were observed among participants reporting higher levels of financial resource strain, stress, depression, physical inactivity, current tobacco use, and a positive score for intimate partner violence. These associations remained significant after adjustment for social desirability bias. CONCLUSIONS: SBD domains were associated with global measures of physical and mental health and were not impacted by social desirability bias. The panel of SBD measures should now be tested in clinical settings.
19553025	Socioeconomic determinants of injury have been associated with risk of burn in the UK and USA, but the relative significance of this impact is largely unknown across Canadian populations. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to risk of burn in the province of British Columbia (BC) and identify the extent to which these findings are generalizable across both urban and rural population groups. Measures of SES were based on province-wide comparisons using data obtained from the Canada Census using the Vancouver Area Neighbourhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX). Results illustrate that the effects of SES and increased injury risk are substantial, though the most pronounced variations were exhibited across each SES stratum for urban areas and with less demonstrable effect when itemized by injury type within rural areas. Although conservative, the results from this study illustrate that burns disproportionately affect populations of greater relative socioeconomic disadvantage and continued efforts to also address social inequities and their link to injury incidence is likely to be more effective than targeting individual behavior alone when trying to reduce and eliminate their occurrence.
30611219	BACKGROUND: HIV testing and counselling (HTC) is an essential component for HIV prevention and a critical entry point into the HIV continuum of care and treatment. Despite the importance of HTC for HIV control, access to HTC services among female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains suboptimal and little is known about factors influencing FSWs' access to HTC. Guided by the client-centred conceptual framework, we conducted a systematic review to understand the facilitators and barriers influencing FSWs in SSA to access HTC services. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, POPLINE and Web of Science databases for literature published between January 2000 and July 2017. References of relevant articles were also searched. We included primary studies of any design, conducted in SSA and published in the English language. Studies conducted in multi-sites inclusive of SSA were included only if data from sites in SSA were separately analysed and reported. Similarly, studies that included other subpopulations were only eligible if a separate analysis was done for FSWs. This review excluded papers published as systematic reviews, editorial comments and mathematical modelling. The protocol for this review is registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42017062203. RESULTS: This review shows that factors related to approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness of the services are crucial in influencing access to HTC services among FSWs in SSA. These factors were mediated by individual attributes such as HIV risk perceptions, awareness of the availability of HTC, and perceptions of the importance and quality of HTC services. The decision to utilise HTC was predominantly hampered by discriminatory social norms such as HIV stigma and criminalisation of sex work. CONCLUSIONS: FSWs' access to HTC is facilitated by multiple factors, including individual awareness of the availability of HTC services, and perceived quality of HTC especially with regard to assured confidentiality. Concerns about HIV stigma and fear about discrimination due to community intolerance of sex work acted as major barriers for FSWs to seek HTC services from the facilities offering health services to the general population.
15896895	"Almost a third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the organism that causes tuberculosis disease. Most of those infected never fall ill, but individuals who do can recover if they have access to effective therapies. This paper discusses certain ethical and ethnographic issues raised by cases in which patients are infected with M. tuberculosis strains resistant to at least the two most powerful drugs on which therapy is usually based. In most poor countries, people with such multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were, until very recently, considered ""untreatable."" In addition to being consigned to a permanent state of ill health, they were also at risk of transmitting their resistant strain to others. In this paper we discuss the logic of ""cost-effectiveness,"" which international health policy-makers utilized to make the case that treatment of MDR-TB is not feasible in resource poor settings. These analyses, which have held sway in public health policy for many years, are flawed, we argue, because they ignore and conceal the social determinants of access to health services and often rely on assumptions rather than evidence. We propose that policies based solely on analyses of cost-effectiveness of specific interventions for individual settings can be short-sighted and, because they do not pay sufficient attention to the social, political, economic, epidemiological and pathophysiological factors influencing the production of health, will ultimately hinder progress toward effective global TB control."
23415984	The '5+ a day' fruit and vegetable servings recommendation was introduced in New Zealand in 1994, but consumption has remained low in young adults ever since. This study aimed to identify psychosocial determinants of fruit and vegetable consumption among New Zealand university students approximately a decade after the guidelines' introduction. Twenty-nine students, aged 18-24 years, took part in focus group interviews. Important determinants included taste and health awareness/knowledge. Flatmates and partners had the greatest social influence. Cost and availability were major barriers to consumption. To improve consumption participants suggested: cooking sessions providing quick/easy recipes; more-varied nutritional information; 'made-to-measure' interventions; increasing awareness of cheap sources of fruit/vegetables; and increasing campus availability of fruit. Determinants including a negative attitude, a lack of self-efficacy and an unawareness of dietary guidelines/health consequences should be considered when developing interventions for this group, whilst a variety of different delivery channels should be used. Participants in the study were not representative of all university students, who generally have a different lifestyle to other young adults and specific determinants for fruit/vegetable consumption. Consequently, additional research is required among other young adults and university students with lower fruit and vegetable intake, so that promotional strategies can be specifically targeted.
16351702	PURPOSE: To review the current literature about potential determinants of fruit and vegetable intakes and effective intervention strategies to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables among 6-12-year-old children. METHODS: A structured review of literature located in PubMed and Psychinfo electronic literature databases. RESULTS: Of all determinants, the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables and taste preferences were most consistently and most positively related to consumption. There was some evidence that parental fruit and vegetable intakes, knowledge of intake recommendations and skills had a positive association with children's intakes, whereas television viewing, exposure to television advertisement, and having a snack bar at school were associated with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables. Multi-component school-based interventions that combined classroom curriculum, parent and food service components showed the greatest promise for fruit and vegetable promotion among children. School fruit and vegetable subscription programmes, scout-based interventions, and fruit and vegetables education via computer multi-media channels also appear promising. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should improve the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables to children, and should aim to improve their taste preferences for them. Such interventions should be of a multi-component nature, school-based or use other social channels and may include multi-media channels.
31324185	BACKGROUND: A huge number of people living with HIV/AIDS lives in developing countries. Thus, strengthening health systems in these countries is a prerequisite for improving disease prevention and care. After three decades of HIV/AIDS policy-making in Iran, conducting a comprehensive analysis on the policy process seems to be essential. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the HIV/AIDS policy-making process in Iran from 1986 to 2016. METHODS: This was a theory-based, multi-method and retrospective study. Interviewing of key informants and review of policy documents were concurrently conducted to identify and include further key informants (39 participants) and documents in the study. Framework analysis was used to analyse data. RESULTS: The mean age of participants working in HIV/AIDS policy-making was of 48 years and participants had a mean of 14 years of working experience. Findings were categorized as contextual factors, content of HIV/AIDS policies, actors involved in the policy process, and evidence use in the policy process. Contextual effective factors on the HIV/AIDS policy-making process were categorized into five major themes, namely situational factors, structural-managerial factors, socioeconomic factors, political and legal factors, and international factors. The HIV/AIDS phenomenon in Iran was identified to be deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of society. The HIV/AIDS policy content has, recently, been crystallized in the national strategic plans and harm reduction policies of the country. The policy process has been conducted with a solely governmental top-down approach and is now suffering from poor evidence and lack of sufficient consideration of contextual factors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a great need for change in the approach of government towards the issue and to increase the participation of non-governmental sectors and civil society in the policy process.
19377537	Alarming trends in childhood obesity even among preschool children have re-focused attention on the importance of physical activity in this age group. With this increased attention comes the need to identify the amount and type of physical activity appropriate for optimal development of preschool children. The purpose of this paper is to provide the scientific evidence to support a link between physical activity and biological and psychosocial development during early childhood (ages 2-5 years). To do so, we summarize pertinent literature informing the nature of the physical activity required to promote healthy physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development during these early years. A particular focus is on the interaction between physical activity and motor skill acquisition. Special emphasis is also placed on the nature of physical activity that promotes healthy weight gain during this period of childhood. The paper also discusses the strongest determinants of physical activity in preschool-age children, including the role of the child's environment (e.g., family, child-care, and socio-economic status). We provide recommendations for physical activity based on the best available evidence, and identify future research needs.
18306732	OBJECTIVES: Substantial inequalities of health in various parts of Slovak Republic (SR) are observed. BACKGROUND: Our aim was to analyse the combination of sociological and medical aspects of these inequalities. METHODS: Sociological and mortality data from all 76 counties of SR were analysed by cluster analysis, ANOVA, multiple regressions, parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: In the sociologically weaker clusters the life expectancy was shorter, male and female premature cardiovascular mortality was higher and the male (not female) cancer mortality was higher than in sociologically better clusters. CONCLUSION: Social and economic conditions--low educational level, poverty, unemployment, social exclusion and poor housing--strongly influence the health of inhabitants in SR (Fig. 3, Ref. 8).

12949333	The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is comprehensive in scope and establishes the capacity, structure, and function for the MCHB to continually improve the health and well-being of pregnant women and children. The MCHB works in partnership with states and has broad authority to improve access to care and ensure the provision of quality preventive and primary care services. Specific provisions of legislation establish the framework for accomplishing this mission. With the increasing recognition of the social, economic, and environmental determinants of child health and the inequities that exist in access and quality of care for children, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) has set the following 3 goals for year 2003: 1) To eliminate disparities in health status outcomes through the removal of economic, social, and cultural barriers to receiving comprehensive, timely, and appropriate health care; 2) To ensure the highest quality of care through the development of practice guidance and data monitoring and evaluation tools; the use of evidence-based research; and the availability of a well-trained, culturally diverse workforce; and 3) To facilitate access to care through the development and improvement of the maternal and child health infrastructure and systems of care to enhance the provision of necessary, coordinated, quality health care. Priority MCHB strategies to accomplish these goals include improving and expanding 1) the cultural competence of providers (in particular to decrease sudden infant death syndrome [SIDS] among minorities), 2) emergency medical services for children, 3) health and safety in child care, 4) quality of primary pediatric care, and 5) the providing of every child with a medical home.
16188748	AIM: This study examines socio-demographic determinants of initiation and duration of breastfeeding in a community-based cohort in northwest Russia. METHODS: All infants born to women who were registered at the antenatal clinics in Severodvinsk in 1999 comprised the cohort (n=1399) and were followed up at 1 y. Data on maternal and infant characteristics as well as the duration of breastfeeding were obtained from medical records. Proportional hazard analysis was applied to quantify the effect of the selected factors on the risk of breastfeeding discontinuation adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Only 1.3% of infants were never breastfed. Breastfeeding rates were 75.0% and 47.2% at 3 and 6 mo, respectively. Maternal age and early initiation of prenatal care were positively associated with breastfeeding initiation rates. Increased risks of breastfeeding discontinuation were found in teenage mothers (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.06-1.99), in mothers with basic education (OR=1.68, 95% CI: 1.06-2.66) and in unmarried mothers (OR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.38). Women with no previous deliveries were more likely to breastfeed longer (OR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.62-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous studies in Russia, almost universal initiation and considerably higher rates of breastfeeding at specific time points were found. Social variations in initiation and duration of breastfeeding should raise concern of inequalities in breastfeeding practices in transitional Russia.
17543712	BACKGROUND: Drug abuse is a significant public health problem because of its association with numerous negative health and social consequences. Examining the social context of drug use represents a burgeoning avenue of research in drug abuse. This study investigates the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and network factors on current heroin and cocaine use among a predominantly African-American adult sample residing in Baltimore City. METHODS: This study employs a cross-sectional, multilevel design using data from two sources: the SHIELD Study, a network-oriented HIV intervention in Baltimore City and the 1990 U.S. Decennial Census. The sample consisted of 1305 adults from 249 neighborhoods (census block groups) across Baltimore City. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to examine personal network and neighborhood effects on current heroin and cocaine use. RESULTS: Neighborhood poverty was significantly associated with current heroin and cocaine use (odds ratio [OR]=1.51, confidence interval [CI]=1.06-2.15). Social support (OR=0.80, CI=0.69-0.92) and having ties to employed people (OR=0.47, CI=0.24-0.92) were protective of current drug use, but did not buffer negative effects of neighborhood poverty in the face of negative drug influences in the network (OR=8.62, CI=5.81-12.79). CONCLUSIONS: The contexts of neighborhoods and networks represent key determinants in understanding the social epidemiology of drug abuse. Network attributes have strong influences on drug use, and neighborhood poverty may increase odds of use. Further research is warranted to determine other aspects of neighborhood environments that may put individuals at risk for drug use and abuse.
26935846	BACKGROUND: Malaria re-introduction is a challenge in elimination settings. To prevent re-introduction, receptivity, vulnerability, and health system capacity of foci should be monitored using appropriate tools. This study aimed to design an applicable model to monitor predicting factors of re-introduction of malaria in highly prone areas. METHODS: This exploratory, descriptive study was conducted in a pre-elimination setting with a high-risk of malaria transmission re-introduction. By using nominal group technique and literature review, a list of predicting indicators for malaria re-introduction and outbreak was defined. Accordingly, a checklist was developed and completed in the field for foci affected by re-introduction and for cleared-up foci as a control group, for a period of 12 weeks before re-introduction and for the same period in the previous year. Using field data and analytic hierarchical process (AHP), each variable and its sub-categories were weighted, and by calculating geometric means for each sub-category, score of corresponding cells of interaction matrices, lower and upper threshold of different risks strata, including low and mild risk of re-introduction and moderate and high risk of malaria outbreaks, were determined. The developed predictive model was calibrated through resampling with different sets of explanatory variables using R software. Sensitivity and specificity of the model were calculated based on new samples. RESULTS: Twenty explanatory predictive variables of malaria re-introduction were identified and a predictive model was developed. Unpermitted immigrants from endemic neighbouring countries were determined as a pivotal factor (AHP score: 0.181). Moreover, quality of population movement (0.114), following malaria transmission season (0.088), average daily minimum temperature in the previous 8 weeks (0.062), an outdoor resting shelter for vectors (0.045), and rainfall (0.042) were determined. Positive and negative predictive values of the model were 81.8 and 100 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduced a new, simple, yet reliable model to forecast malaria re-introduction and outbreaks eight weeks in advance in pre-elimination and elimination settings. The model incorporates comprehensive deterministic factors that can easily be measured in the field, thereby facilitating preventive measures.
29369164	OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and determinants of HIV stigma in 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa. DESIGN: Analysis of baseline data from the HPTN 071 (PopART) cluster-randomized trial. HIV stigma data came from a random sample of 3859 people living with HIV. Community-level exposures reflecting HIV fears and judgements and perceptions of HIV stigma came from a random sample of community members not living with HIV (n = 5088), and from health workers (HW) (n = 851). METHODS: We calculated the prevalence of internalized stigma, and stigma experienced in the community or in a healthcare setting in the past year. We conducted risk-factor analyses using logistic regression, adjusting for clustering. RESULTS: Internalized stigma (868/3859, prevalence 22.5%) was not associated with sociodemographic characteristics but was less common among those with a longer period since diagnosis (P = 0.043). Stigma experienced in the community (853/3859, 22.1%) was more common among women (P = 0.016), older (P = 0.011) and unmarried (P = 0.009) individuals, those who had disclosed to others (P < 0.001), and those with more lifetime sexual partners (P < 0.001). Stigma experienced in a healthcare setting (280/3859, 7.3%) was more common among women (P = 0.019) and those reporting more lifetime sexual partners (P = 0.001) and higher wealth (P = 0.003). Experienced stigma was more common in clusters wherever community members perceived higher levels of stigma, but was not associated with the beliefs of community members or HW. CONCLUSION: HIV stigma remains unacceptably high in South Africa and Zambia and may act as barrier to HIV prevention and treatment. Further research is needed to understand its determinants.
18320099	INTRODUCTION: The social environment is an important determinant of population and individual health. However, its impact is often not considered in national health policies and generally its attributes are considered as constants. For this reason, contemporary health policies place greater emphasis on individual risk factors. OBJECTIVE: Colombias position in the world ranking is described with respect to several social macro-determinants of health, previously characterized as components of class/welfare regime model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The exploratory study included all countries with comparable data including the following: (1) economic development [gross domestic product per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity], (2) income inequality [Gini coefficient], (3) social capital corruption perceptions index and generalized trust, and (4) political regime index of freedom. First, correlations between these macro-determinants were estimated, and second, the relationship between them and life expectancy at birth was explored. Finally, the position of Colombia in global context was determined. RESULTS: Important correlations occurred among the macro-determinants. Colombia tended to have intermediate to low positions in the global context in all macro-determinants, with the exception of gross domestic product per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity. CONCLUSION: The macro-determinant of population health with the highest potential of effecting improvement in health conditions is to modify income inequality.
31639862	OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the need for a health workforce trained in recognising, understanding and acting on the social determinants of health (SDH). However, little is known about how current medical education prepares graduates to meet this challenge. This study analyses the extent to which content on SDH is incorporated in the German medical curriculum. METHOD: This work is based on a qualitative and quantitative content analysis of 3 key document groups, outlining what medical schools are expected to teach and defining what medical students are expected to know on graduation. RESULTS: The assessment reveals important gaps in the representation of SDH in key frameworks for German medical education. Only between 4 and 27% of the analysed document-elements contained reference to any SDH-related issues, with 0-3% of those elements containing explicit references to SDH. While some aspects were widely covered (e. g. topics of occupational health), other topics such as health inequalities or determinants outside of the health care system were not or hardly represented. CONCLUSIONS: A stronger and more explicit representation of SDH during medical education could help to prepare the new health workforce for current and future challenges in our globalised world. The current reform process of the National Competency-Based Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Medicine should strive to fill the gaps, e. g. by putting more emphasis on aspects of poverty and health, health inequalities and issues of access to healthcare.
23069774	OBJECTIVES: Childhood adversities may be important determinants of later illnesses and poor health behaviour. However, large-scale prospective studies on the associations between childhood adversities and the onset of asthma in adulthood are lacking. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with 7-year follow-up. SETTING: Nationally representative study. Data were collected from the Health and Social Support (HeSSup) survey and national registers. PARTICIPANTS: The participants represent the Finnish population from the following age groups: 20-24, 30-34, 40-44, and 50-54 years at baseline in 1998 (24 057 survey participants formed the final cohort of this study). The occurrence of childhood adversities was assessed at baseline with a six-item survey scale. The analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, behavioural health risks and common mental disorders. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The survey data were linked to data from national health registers on incident asthma during a 7-year follow-up to define new-onset asthma cases with verified diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 12 126 (59%) participants reported that they encountered a childhood adversity. Of them 3677 (18% of all) endured three to six adversities. During a follow-up of 7 years, 593 (2.9%) participants were diagnosed with incident asthma. Those who reported three or more childhood adversities had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.31 to 2.01) greater risk of asthma compared to those without childhood adversities. This hazard attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjustment for conventional risk factors (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: Adults who report having encountered adversities in childhood may have an increased risk of developing asthma.
23101733	OBJECTIVE: Korean immigrants have been identified as one of the most disadvantaged ethnic groups in terms of health insurance coverage and health care access in the U.S.A. Korean immigrants enjoyed access to primary and preventive care services in their home country. This study explores how Korean immigrants' health-seeking behaviors are reconstructed by contextualizing their health care experience and adaptation process in Hawaii. DESIGN: Face-to-face individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 recently arrived Korean immigrant adults in Hawaii, who were selected by a purposive sampling method. RESULTS: A diminution of seeking professional health care services after immigration was the prominent change in their health care behaviors. They delayed seeking primary care, underused preventive care, extended self-diagnosis and self-treatment, and practiced more treatment- and emergency-oriented care. New immigrants also adopted ethnic enclave health care and transnational health care as alternative strategies to meet their health care needs given the structural and cultural constraints. Sociocultural contexts of both home and host countries shaped the behavioral changes and adoption of alternative health care strategies, interplaying with an individual's characteristics. Lack of health insurance and unfamiliarity with the health care system were the most important factors in the decision whether to and when to seek professional health care, while the lack of English proficiency and cultural concerns were the major determinants of where to get health care. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that efforts should be concentrated to minimize structural barriers to health insurance and to improve health care access through policy interventions. Ethnic networks and ethnic media could be used as an effective informational reservoir for introducing various health care resources, disseminating information, and navigating new immigrants to the health system and services. Utilizing ethnic health care facilities and professionals would foster the promotion of immigrant health care without language and cultural challenges.
31460576	BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers around the world. One of the factors involved in the development of colorectal cancer is the changes in the normal flora of the intestine. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the mean copy number of Enterococcus faecalis in people with polyps and people with colorectal cancer has been evaluated in comparison with healthy controls. METHODS: In this study, 25 patients with colorectal cancer and 28 patients with intestinal polyps were selected and stool specimens were taken. In addition, 24 healthy individuals were selected as control group. Extraction of bacterial DNA from the stool sample were performed. The molecular methods of PCR for confirmation of standard strain and absolute Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) method were used to evaluate the number of Enterococcus faecalis in the studied groups. RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that the mean copy number of Enterococcus faecalis in patients with colorectal cancer was 11.2x109 per gram of stool, and in patients with polyps was 9.4x108 per gram of stool. In healthy people, this number was 9x108 per gram of stool. There was a significant difference between the implicit copy numbers in the three groups. (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Enterococcus faecalis in faecal flora of people with colorectal cancer was significantly higher than those with polyps and healthy people. This could potentially signify the ability of this bacterium to induce colorectal cancer. More studies are needed to prove this theory.
26715047	Approximately one in two hundred persons in the Marshall Islands have active tuberculosis (TB). We examine the historical antecedents of this situation in order to assign ethical responsibility for the present situation. Examining the antecedents in terms of Galtung's dialectic of personal versus structural violence, we can identify instances in the history of the Marshall Islands when individual subjects made decisions (personal violence) with large-scale ecologic, social, and health consequences. The roles of medical experimenters, military commanders, captains of the weapons industry in particular, and industrial capitalism in general (as the cause of global warming) are examined. In that, together with Lewontin, we also identify industrial capitalism as the cause of tuberculosis, we note that the distinction between personal versus structural violence is difficult to maintain. By identifying the cause of the tuberculosis in the Marshall Islands, we also identify what needs be done to treat and prevent it.
29592532	OBJECTIVE: Analyses of representative, system-level data to examine trends in short- and longer-term readmission rates for psychiatric illnesses are largely absent. The objective of this article is to examine key trends and variables with implications for inpatient care as indicated by 30-day readmission and outpatient care as reflected by readmission within 5 years. METHODS: Using OMHRS data from 2005 to 2015, patients who had their first inpatient admission were followed for 5 years to examine their subsequent 30-day and overall admission rates stratified by discharge time and diagnosis. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 42,280 patients. The 30-day and 5-year readmission rates for the entire cohort were 7.2% and 35.1%, respectively. Using a time course analysis of readmission for discharges in different years, both 30-day readmission and 5-year readmission rates decreased in a linear manner from 2005 to 2010, primarily because of readmission patterns for patients diagnosed with mood disorders and schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders. It was also evident that both demographic considerations such as age and gender and variables reflective of social determinants such as education level and employment were predictive of rehospitalization risk. CONCLUSIONS: The trends of decreasing readmission rates may be reflective of improvements in the quality of hospital and community-based outpatient care. Such system-level indicators warrant tracking and may inform more effective tertiary prevention.
19225218	OBJECTIVES: Studies have shown that interpersonal relations at work are important for several health related outcomes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether low social support, serious conflict, exclusion by superiors or by co-workers at work may be determinants of depression. METHODS: In a representative Swedish cohort study data were obtained in two waves three years apart. 4,040 women and men who did not change their jobs between the waves were chosen for the study. Exposure and confounders were obtained at Time 1 and outcome, depression according to Bech's MDI at Time 2. Previous depression was controlled for by adjusting for depression at Time 1. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Odds-ratios adjusted for possible confounders and depression at base-line showed significant effects for all four exposures on depression (adjusted OR, low social support 1.5 CI 95% 1.1-2.0, serious conflict 1.4 CI 95% 1.1-1.9, exclusion by superiors 1.6 CI 95% 1.2-2.1 and exclusion by co-workers 1.7 CI 95% 1.2-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: The present results support the conclusion that problematic interpersonal relationships at work can be determinants of depression. These prospective findings may be of relevance for prevention and when rehabilitating depressed patients.
26545058	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Learners in medical education are often inadequately prepared to address the underlying social determinants of health and disease. The objective of this article is to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a Health Policy and Advocacy curriculum incorporated into our family medicine clerkship. METHODS: We developed a Health Policy and Advocacy course for medical students within our family medicine clerkship. We evaluated the curriculum using a survey of our own design administered to students before and after their clerkship year. We created a mean score for each subscale that measured (1) physician's role, (2) knowledge, and (3) confidence in ability and calculated differences between the pre-survey and the post-survey scores for four medical school classes. We also conducted a focus group to get student input on the new curriculum. RESULTS: Mean scores on the pre- and post-surveys were highest for the subscale regarding attitudes about a physician's role in health policy and advocacy and did not change over time. Scores for self-reported knowledge and confidence in abilities increased significantly from the beginning to the end of the clerkship year. Students were generally positive about the curriculum but had some concerns about finding time for advocacy in their future practices. CONCLUSIONS: Training in health care policy and advocacy can be successfully implemented into a medical school curriculum with positive outcomes in students' self-reported knowledge and confidence in their abilities. Work remains on providing advocacy role models for students.
30889937	The often reported reduction of Reaction Time (RT) by Vision Training) is successfully replicated by 81 athletes across sports. This enabled us to achieve a mean reduction of RTs for athletes eye-hand coordination of more than 10%, with high statistical significance. We explain how such an observed effect of Sensorimotor systems' plasticity causing reduced RT can last in practice for multiple days and even weeks in subjects, via a proof of principle. Its mathematical neural model can be forced outside a previous stable (but long) RT into a state leading to reduced eye-hand coordination RT, which is, again, in a stable neural state.
28253113	"BACKGROUND: Simulated patients are commonly used to evaluate medical trainees. Unannounced simulated patients provide an accurate measure of physician performance. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of detection of SPs on physician performance, and identify factors leading to detection. METHODS: Fixty-six family medicine residents were each visited by two unannounced simulated patients presenting with alcohol-induced hypertension or insomnia. Residents were then surveyed on their detection of SPs. RESULTS: SPs were detected on 45 out of 104 visits. Inner city clinics had higher detection rates than middle class clinics. Residents' checklist and global rating scores were substantially higher on detected than undetected visits, for both between-subject and within-subject comparisons. The most common reasons for detection concerned SP demographics and behaviour; the SP ""did not act like a drinker"" and was of a different social class than the typical clinic patient. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-clinic studies involving residents experienced with SPs should ensure that the SP role and behavior conform to physician expectations and the demographics of the clinic. SP station testing does not accurately reflect physicians' actual clinical behavior and should not be relied on as the primary method of evaluation. The study also suggests that physicians' poor performance in identifying and managing alcohol problems is not entirely due to lack of skill, as they demonstrated greater clinical skills when they became aware that they were being evaluated. Physicians' clinical priorities, sense of responsibility and other attitudinal determinants of their behavior should be addressed when training physicians on the management of alcohol problems."
20525270	BACKGROUND: An important gap exists between research production and its utilization. Few studies have examined the factors affecting knowledge utilization in the field of child and family social services. METHODS: The objectives of the study are to describe knowledge utilization by child protection administrators and practitioners (N = 477) and to compare factors related to knowledge utilization by these two occupational groups. The study was conducted with an adapted version of the Questionnaire sur l'utilisation des connaissances (Knowledge Utilization Questionnaire). Factor analysis was used to collapse data collected on the questionnaire items. Factor score for each respondent served as independent variables in three separate multivariate regression analyses to explore variables likely to predict research-based knowledge utilization. RESULTS: A minority of respondents (18%) report using on a frequent basis research-based knowledge in their practice. Relational capital between researchers and users and perceived usefulness of research based knowledge were the two factors most strongly related to utilization. There was a specificity in the factors associated with knowledge utilization according to occupational groups in child protection organizations. Use of active knowledge transfer strategies was associated with knowledge utilization by practitioners, while knowledge dissemination efforts played a more significant role for administrators. CONCLUSION: These results encourage both the use of strategies differentiated according to users and the intensification of interactions between users and researchers to foster research knowledge utilization.
15357207	As a consequence of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, 30% of victims may develop chronic Chagas disease, which presents a spectrum of pathology including cardiomyopathy, megacolon and megaesophagus. The outcome of infection in a particular individual is the result of a set of complex interactions among the host genetic background, environmental and social factors, and the genetic composition of the parasite, all of which can be complicated by mixed infections and re-infections. Initially we consider what is known about the genetic structure and biological properties of the protozoan. Currently, six distinct subgroups have been characterized by different combinations of four distinct genotypic classes. The recent demonstration of genetic exchange via non-meiotic cell fusion illustrates a mechanism by which maintained heterogeneous polyploidy may have been generated in these parasites. Subsequently, we consider factors in humans and in experimental mouse-infection and tissue culture models that have contributed to our understanding of the host's susceptibility or resistance to disease. Identification of the direct players in host-pathogen interactions at the establishment and chronic phases of the disease is perhaps the best hope of a clinical handle for treatment. At some point in the future, these disparate areas of study will have to come together. It is to be hoped that this scientific fusion will result in better prognosis and treatment of Chagas disease.
30540843	Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor health outcomes, underlining the significance of early identification and intervention. Currently, there is no validated tool to screen for ACEs exposure in childhood. To fill this gap, we designed and implemented a pediatric ACEs questionnaire in an urban pediatric Primary Care Clinic. Questionnaire items were selected and modified based on literature review of existing childhood adversity tools. Children twelve years and under were screened via caregiver report, using the developed instrument. Cognitive interviews were conducted with caregivers, health providers, and clinic staff to assess item interpretation, clarity, and English/Spanish language equivalency. Using a rapid cycle assessment, information gained from the interviews were used to iteratively change the instrument. Additional questions assessed acceptability of screening within primary care and preferences around administration. Twenty-eight (28) caregivers were administered the questionnaire. Cognitive interviews conducted among caregivers and among 16 health providers and clinic staff resulted in the changes in wording and addition of examples in the items to increase face validity. In the final instrument, no new items were added; however, two items were merged and one item was split into three separate items. While there was a high level of acceptability of the overall questionnaire, some caregivers reported discomfort with the sexual abuse, separation from caregiver, and community violence items. Preference for methods of administration were split between tablet and paper formats. The final Pediatric ACE and other Determinants of Health Questionnaire is a 17-item instrument with high face validity and acceptability for use within primary care settings. Further evaluation on the reliability and construct validity of the instrument is being conducted prior to wide implementation in pediatric practice.
11133341	BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with estabLished coronary artery improves if smoking is stopped. Still, about half of patients who suffer a myocardial infarction continue smoking after that event. In order to predict to whom additional support should be offered, various baseline characteristics were compared with smoking status at short-term and long-term follow-up. METHODS: Demographics, medical history, presence of coronary risk factors, psychological determinants, and the clinical course were recorded in a group of 530 unselected consecutive patients who had been admitted with a myocardial infarction and were smoking. Patients who were smoking at admission, and who were alive at 4-year follow-up, were studied to relate smoking status and baseline characteristics. RESULTS: At 3 months, persistent smokers were younger than quitters, had shorter hospital stays, underwent revascularization procedures less often, smoked more cigarettes per day at baseline, and were more socially isolated. After 4 years, patients who stopped smoking had had a more serious myocardial infarction and had a lower displeasure score than those who continued smoking. Also, quitters received more support from their social environment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of the patients try to stop smoking after a myocardial infarction, about half smokes after 4 years. In the future, special support should be offered to smokers who suffer myocardial infarction, especially to those whose psychosocial profiles are less favorable.
25157406	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic influence of 48 type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants on disease progression measured as risk of early prescription redemption of glucose lowering drugs in screen-detected patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We studied type 2 diabetes progression in 1,480 patients with screen-detected type 2 diabetes from the ADDITION-Denmark study using information of redeemed prescriptions from the Register of Medicinal Products Statistics from 2001-2009 in Denmark. Patients were cluster randomized by general practitioners, who were randomized to treat type 2 diabetes according to either a conventional or a multifactorial intensive treatment algorithm. We investigated the genetic influence on diabetes progression by constructing a genetic risk score (GRS) of all 48 validated type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants, a GRS of 11 variants linked to beta-cell function and a GRS of 3 variants linked to insulin sensitivity and assessed the association between number of risk alleles and time from diagnosis until first redeemed prescription of either any glucose lowering drug or an insulin drug. RESULTS: The GRS linked to insulin sensitivity only nominally increased the risk of an early prescription redemption with an insulin drug by 39% (HR [95% C.I.] = 1.39 [1.09-1.77], p = 0.009] in patients randomized to the intensive treatment group. Furthermore, the strongest univariate predictors of diabetes progression for the intensive treatment group (measured as time to first insulin) were younger age (HR [95% C.I.] = 0.96 [0.93-0.99]), increased BMI (1.05 [1.01-1.09]), increased HbA1c (1.50 [1.36-.66]), increased TG (1.24 [1.11-1.39]) and reduced fasting serum HDL (0.37 [0.17-0.80]) at baseline. Similar results were obtained for the conventional treatment group. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of HbA1c, fasting circulating levels of triglyceride, lower HDL, larger BMI and younger age are significant determinants of early pharmacological intervention in type 2 diabetes. However, known common type 2 diabetes-associated gene variants do not appear to significantly affect disease progression.
20302437	In the general population, social disparities in Internet practices have been less described than disparities in health information access. Aim is to determine whether there are differences in the frequency of Internet use for health information among health seekers. We conducted an Internet-based survey from November 2006 to March 2007. We considered the 3720 residents of France who had searched for health information during the previous 12 months. This study reveals different uses of the Internet for health information seeking (HIS) between men and women and between the general population and people who work in the health sector. Health status, taking care of somebody who is sick, and active Internet use were associated with higher frequencies of online HIS to varying degrees. The effects of age and level of education were not clear or were not significant. Greater health concerns and some issues in the physician-patient relationship were associated with higher frequencies of Internet use for HIS in the general population. Considering that this increasing use of online tools for HIS is consistent with current public health policies that promote the development of the 'informed patient', one should remain cautious about these social disparities in online HIS practices.
29776007	PURPOSE: To develop and validate a Swedish questionnaire to measure propensity for behaviour change regarding food habits, physical activity and weight reduction in patients with hypertension. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. METHODS: A total of 270 consecutive patients with hypertension diagnosed at four primary care centres in Sweden were included. The 6-item Swedish version of the Propensity to Achieve Healthy Lifestyle Scale (PAHLS) was developed to measure propensity for behaviour change regarding food habits, physical activity and weight reduction. The PAHLS (i.e., including three items for preparedness and three items for capacity) was developed by three multiprofessional researchers inspired by the transtheoretical model of behaviour change in collaboration with clinically active nurses. Data were collected by questionnaires on food habits (i.e., the Food Frequency Questionnaire), physical activity (the International Physical Activity Questionnaire), propensity for a healthy lifestyle (the PHLQ), as well as during a clinical examination. Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), as well as Rasch analysis, were used. RESULTS: Of the 270 patients (50% women), 27% scored low levels of physical activity on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and 34% of the patients were obese (body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2) ). The EFA (explaining 54% of the variance) showed unidimensionality for the PAHLS that was supported by both CFA and Rasch analyses. No floor and 1.9% ceiling effects were found. Multiple group CFA (an extension of structural equation modelling) showed that the PAHLS operated equivalently across both male and female patients. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.83) and composite reliability (0.89) were good. CONCLUSION: The initial testing of PAHLS provided good validity and reliability scores to measure propensity for behaviour change in patients with hypertension. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The PAHLS can be used by nurses as a tool to simplify shared decision-making in relation to behavioural changes.
26861932	INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the association between health facility characteristics and other individual/household factors with a woman's likelihood of skilled birth attendance in north-central Afghanistan. METHODS: Data from a 2010 household survey of 6879 households in 9 provinces of Afghanistan were linked to routine facility data. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to assess determinants of skilled birth attendance. RESULTS: Women who reported having at least one antenatal visit with a skilled provider were 5.6 times more likely to give birth with a skilled attendant than those who did not. The odds of skilled birth attendance were 84% higher for literate women than those without literacy skills and 79% higher among women in the upper 2 wealth quintiles than women in the poorest quintile. This study did not show any direct linkages between facility characteristics and skilled birth attendance but provided insights into why studies assuming that women seek care at the nearest primary care facility may lead to misinterpretation of care-seeking patterns. Findings reveal a 36 percentage point gap between women who receive skilled antenatal care and those who received skilled birth care. Nearly 60% of women with a skilled attendant at their most recent birth bypassed the nearest primary care facility to give birth at a more distant primary care facility, hospital, or private clinic. Distance and transport barriers were reported as the most common reasons for home birth. DISCUSSION: Assumptions that women who give birth with a skilled attendant do so at the closest health facility may mask the importance of supply-side determinants of skilled birth attendance. More research based on actual utilization patterns, not assumed catchment areas, is needed to truly understand the factors influencing care-seeking decisions in both emergency and nonemergency situations and to adapt strategies to reduce preventable mortality and morbidity in Afghanistan.
19253847	"OBJECTIVE: To undertake a research into the maternal health care services and its determinants in poor regions in Sichuan province. METHODS: Stratified cluster sampling strategy was employed to select the participants who had pregnancy since 1998 to complete the interview administered ""maternal health care questionnaire"". A total of 462 women participated in the study. RESULTS: Of the 462 women, 387 received prenatal care services, the most common maternal health care services. Only 144 women got post-natal visits at least once. Maternal age and education had significant impacts on the use of maternal health care services including prenatal examinations and birth in hospitals (P<0.05). Low-income (< Yen 1000) women used less maternal health care services than the high-income (> Yen 5000) women (P<0.05). The women who were covered by the cooperative medical insurance scheme and poverty alleviation scheme used more prenatal care and post-natal services and were more likely to deliver babies in hospitals than those who paid the services entirely out of pocket (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Poor social and economical situation has a detrimental impact on the use of maternal health care services, which might be associated with poor education and low financial capacities of the women."
31425959	AIMS: to investigate stages of change for dietary in type 2 diabetics and its associations with diet knowledge and skills, diet decision making and diet barriers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study which was conducted on 1139 diabetics aged>18 years in East Azerbaijan, Iran. Data were collected through a Personal Diabetes Questionnaire (PDQ) and analyzed through SPSS version 22 software using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests. Tukey's HSD post hoc tests were applied to illustrate ANOVA findings. RESULTS: 59.3% of patients do not follow a diet plan to control their blood glucose. 44.7%, 5.5%, 13%, and 36.8% of patients, respectively, were in the stages of pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation and action. Patients who had shorter disease duration and those whose current treatment was lifestyle change were more likely within the action stage. Also, patients who had a higher score in diet knowledge and skills and diet decision making and those who had a lower score in diet barriers were more likely in the action stage of change. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, a considerable proportion of diabetic patients were in the pre-contemplation stage. Diet knowledge and skills, diet decision making and diet barriers were factors contributing to diet readiness to change. Therefore, taking necessary measures to increase diet knowledge, skills and diet decision-making and a reduction in diet barriers can help people with type 2 diabetes to change diet.
15266192	OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of child-, parent- and family-related factors on the use of and need for mental health services by 12 years of age. METHOD: A prospective population-based questionnaire study of 1,287 first-born children was launched in Finland in 1985. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was completed by 1,086 parents when the children were aged 3 years. At the age of 12, the CBCL, the Youth Self-Report, and other potential determinants of service need and use were obtained from 908 parents and 900 children (80% response rate). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 7.2% had used professional services, and 3.3% had needed services without obtaining them. Elevated scores on the age 3 CBCL Total Problems and Externalizing scale predicted independently later service use but not perceived need of services. In cross-sectional data at age 12, parental ratings of the child's problem behavior were associated with both the need for and use of services. Poor social competence and parental distress were independently associated with use of services. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing behavior problems in early childhood and evaluating family stress factors are important in social and health care systems designed for children.
16014658	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the social determinants of smoking among adolescents attending school and/or work. METHODS: A survey was carried out on 6012 adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years in 15 cities, recruited from schools, vocational training centres and work places. A self-completed questionnaire was used for data collection. Single- and multi-level regression analyses were run to estimate models. RESULTS: Ever smoking and current smoking rates were 41.1% and 10.5% among girls, and 57.5% and 25.2% among boys. These rates were 47.0% and 13.3% among those who only attended school, 62.2% and 31.7% among those who attended school and worked simultaneously, and 67.5% and 43.0% among those who worked and did not attend school. In multi-level analysis, the major predictors of current smoking were close friends smoking [odds ratio (OR) 3.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-6.27], no knowledge of harmful effects of short-term smoking (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.74-2.67), vulnerability to peer pressure (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.48-2.46), negative self-perception (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.31-2.18) and male sex (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.30-2.16). Mothers higher education was a predictor for girls' smoking, while mother's lower education was a predictor for boys' smoking. At the school level, smoking prevalence was a predictor of current smoking (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking patterns were similar to Western countries in several aspects, while male prevalence rates were higher and the impact of gender-related predictors was significant. Our findings suggest that youth smoking prevention policies should address personal, familial and educational environmental level requirements, taking into consideration the gender differences in addition to international guidelines.
19925468	BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Self-care for kidney transplantation is recommended to maintain kidney function. Little is known about levels of self-care practices and demographic, psychosocial, and health-related correlates. AIM: To investigate patients' self-reported exercise and fluid intake, demographic and psychosocial factors associated with these self-care practices, and health-related quality of life. METHODS: Eighty-eight of 158 kidney recipients from two academic medical centers completed a semi-structured interview and surveys 2 months post-transplant. RESULTS: Most patients were sedentary (76%) with a quarter exercising either regularly (11%) or not at current recommendations (13%). One-third (35%) reported drinking the recommended 3 L of fluid daily. Multivariate analyses indicated that private insurance, high self-efficacy, and better physical functioning were significantly associated with engaging in physical activity (p < 0.05); while male gender, private insurance, high self-efficacy, and not attributing oneself responsible for transplant success were significant predictors of adherence to fluid intake (p < 0.05). Despite the significance of these predictors, models for physical activity and fluid intake explained 10-15% of the overall variance in these behaviors. Multivariate analyses indicated that younger age, high value of exercise, and higher social functioning significantly (p < 0.05) predicted high self-efficacy for physical activity, while being married significantly (p < 0.05) predicted high self-efficacy for fluid intake. CONCLUSION: Identifying patients at risk of inadequate self-care practice is essential for educating patients about the importance of self-care.
19436534	Diseases of modernism, rather than infectious diseases and chronic medical conditions, increasingly cause childhood morbidity and mortality. Thus, the goal of enhancing life outcomes for all children has become imperative. Paediatricans may begin with a renewed interest in social paediatrics - the care of the disadvantaged child in Canada, requiring a focus on all the complex factors that impact families and the community. New paediatricians need the tools to impact both social determinants of health and political policies to support health for all. Such interest is as old as the field of paediatrics (social medicine began with the great pathologist, Virchow, in the 1800s). The new neuroscience of experience-based brain and biological development has caught up with the social epidemiology literature. It is now known from both domains that a child's poor developmental and health outcomes are a product of early and ongoing socioeconomic and psychological experiences. In the era of epigenetics, it is now understood that both nature and nurture control the genome. Future paediatricians need to understand the science of experience-based brain development, and the interventions demonstrated to improve life trajectories. A challenge is to connect the traditional population health approach with traditional primary care responsibilities. New and enhanced collaborative interdisciplinary networks with, for example, public health, primary care, community resources, education and justice systems are required.
18272938	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential risk factors for developing complications and their magnitude during the antenatal period. METHODOLOGY: The data used in this paper came from a prospective survey in rural areas of Bangladesh conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Research for Promotion of Essential and Reproductive Health and Technologies (BIRPERHT) between November 1992 and December 1993. The differential patterns were analyzed for respondents' selected characteristics, and multivariate analysis was performed employing logistic regression and proportional hazards models for life-threatening and high-risk complications during pregnancy. RESULTS: For life-threatening complications during pregnancy, several factors emerged as potential risk factors, such as number of the pregnancy, age at marriage, duration of pregnancy, economic status and history of anemia prior to the index pregnancy. The last two covariates were associated only in the proportional hazards. Potential risk factors for high-risk complications during pregnancy were level of education, age at marriage, wanted pregnancy, duration of pregnancy and economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Health planners and policy makers in developing countries are trying to facilitate health services at the doorsteps of rural people. Our findings will help them understand the magnitude and underlying determinants of maternal morbidities and help their health planning process to reduce both life-threatening and high-risk complications during the antenatal period. Early age at marriage needs to be prevented through encouragement of girls' education as well as through increased social awareness programs. An effective quick referral mechanism should be developed to provide emergency services to high risk-groups. Finally, the importance of additional food supplements needs to be promoted during antenatal care visits as well as through mass media in order to reach people living in remote areas of rural Bangladesh.
25420973	BACKGROUND: The University of Sydney's Graduate Diploma in Indigenous Health Promotion (GDIHP) and Masters of International Public Health (MIPH) students have expressed a consistent desire to engage more with each other through student tutorials or any small group activity. MIPH students have expressed an interest in learning about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanderpeople and their health issues recognising contextual similarities in health priorities and social-cultural determinants. A and TSI students enrolled in the GDIHP have traditionally had very little contact with other students and are often unaware of the innovative solutions implemented in developing countries. METHODS: Through this inclusive teaching innovation the MIPH and GDIHP programmes utilised diversity in the student population and responded to the University's Strategic Plan to promote and enhance pathways for supporting Indigenous students. This innovation provided an opportunity for both groups to learn more about each other as they develop into globally competitive public health practitioners. RESULTS: The 'Beyond Borders' initiative exposed MIPH and GDIHP students to problem-based learning that incorporated global perspectives as well as focusing on the very specific and unique realities of life in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Both student cohorts reported that the knowledge and skill exchange was highly valuable and contributed to their development as health professionals. DISCUSSION: This simple yet effective initiative created a sustainable cross-cultural, interdisciplinary and community-oriented partnership that benefited all involved and assisted in addressing health inequities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and in developing countries.
19740642	Wastes, which are the by-products of consumption, are a growing problem in the urban and peri-urban areas of the Lake Victoria region largely due to high urban population growth rates, consumption habits, low collection rates and hence waste accumulation. Whereas the biodegradable proportion is high and could be reutilized, a few have tapped the economic potential of this waste. This study was conducted to explore the potential alternatives and determinants of waste separation and utilization among urban and peri-urban households in the Lake Victoria crescent. A random sample of households in five urban and peri-urban areas of the crescent were selected and surveyed. Logit models were used to establish the factors influencing waste separation and utilization in urban and peri-urban areas of the lake crescent. Results indicate that, gender, peer influence, land size, location of household and membership of environmental organization explain household waste utilization and separation behaviour. Campaigns for waste separation and reuse should be focused in the peri-urban areas where high volumes of wastes are generated and accumulate. Social influence or pressure should be used to encourage more waste reuse and separation.
29490695	BACKGROUND: Health disparities are a persistent problem in many high-income countries. Health policymakers recognize the need to develop systematic methods for documenting and tracking these disparities in order to reduce them. The experience of the U.S., which has a well-established health disparities monitoring infrastructure, provides useful insights for other countries. MAIN BODY: This article provides an in-depth review of health disparities monitoring in the U.S. Lessons of potential relevance for other countries include: 1) the integration of health disparities monitoring in population health surveillance, 2) the role of political commitment, 3) use of monitoring as a feedback loop to inform future directions, 4) use of monitoring to identify data gaps, 5) development of extensive cross-departmental cooperation, and 6) exploitation of digital tools for monitoring and reporting. Using Israel as a case in point, we provide a brief overview of the healthcare and health disparities landscape in Israel, and examine how the lessons from the U.S. experience might be applied in the Israeli context. CONCLUSION: The U.S. model of health disparities monitoring provides useful lessons for other countries with respect to documentation of health disparities and tracking of progress made towards their elimination. Given the persistence of health disparities both in the U.S. and Israel, there is a need for monitoring systems to expand beyond individual- and healthcare system-level factors, to incorporate social and environmental determinants of health as health indicators/outcomes.
16687381	Understanding and enhancing adherence to HIV medications has been identified as a major challenge. The purpose of this study was to explore patterns and determinants of non-adherence among individuals receiving HIV care in a medical clinic. Seven focus groups were conducted with 42 HIV+ patients, and verbatim transcripts of focus group sessions were analyzed through a combination of ethnographic and content analysis. Of the participants currently on combination therapy, 68% reported at least one recent instance of non-adherence. The most commonly cited reasons for non-adherent behavior were grouped into four categories: (1) problems with side effects; (2) conflicts with daily life activities; (3) feelings of aversion toward the medications themselves; and (4) deliberate alterations to the prescribed regimen. Findings based on structured analysis of patient responses in each category differ from past research which defines adherence as a treatment problem and emphasizes logistical characteristics of the treatment regimen itself and patients' ability or willingness to follow specific instructions. In contrast, our focus group data suggest an alternative frame for understanding barriers to adherence which focuses on: (1) the meaning that adherence/pill-taking behavior has for individuals experiencing chronic illness; and (2) the impact that this behavior has on their identity. Because adherence behavior is integral to patients' experience of their disease, non-adherence is no longer a treatment problem, but is an illness problem. Framing adherence as an illness problem rather than a treatment problem is a critical shift that can be applied to the creation of assessments and interventions designed to support patient adherence; this article ends with a series of specific recommendations for programs, policy, and research.
19775869	Deficits in everyday living skills and social skills are associated with the pervasive disability seen in schizophrenia. Cognitive impairments are determinants of these skills deficits and it is known that positive and negative symptoms add to the influence of cognitive impairments for prediction of real-world outcomes. This study examined the relative importance of cognitive impairments measured with a neuropsychological battery, performance-based measures of social and everyday living skills, and positive and negative symptoms for the prediction of real-world outcomes in social and residential domains. In contrast to most previous studies, we examined the importance of individual symptoms, as well as total subscale scores, for predicting clinician rated outcomes in 194 older outpatients with schizophrenia. Symptoms were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; everyday living skills were measured by the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment; and social skills were measured with the Social Skills Performance Assessment. For prediction of real-world social outcomes, blunted affect and passive-apathetic social withdrawal accounted for all of the predicted variance, while social competence and cognitive impairments did not enter the final equation. For residential functioning, everyday living skills were the most important predictor, followed by lack of spontaneity. The positive symptoms of hallucinatory behavior and suspiciousness also predicted real-world residential outcomes. These results suggest that real-world disability is the product of a complex array of ability deficits and symptoms, indicating interventions will need to be carefully targeted. For social and everyday living outcomes, variance accounted for by the entire array of predictive variables was less than 40%, suggesting that other factors, such as social and cultural influences, are involved as well.
16322486	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to identify clinical determinants able to predict which individuals are susceptible to deterioration of mobility from 1 to 3 years after stroke. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of stroke patients consecutively admitted for inpatient rehabilitation. A total of 205 relatively young, first-ever stroke patients were assessed at 1 and 3 years after stroke. Mobility status was determined by the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), and decline was defined as a deterioration of > or =2 points on the RMI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for mobility decline. The discriminating ability of the model was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A decline in mobility status was found in 21% of the patients. Inactivity and the presence of cognitive problems, fatigue, and depression at 1 year after stroke were significant predictors of mobility decline. The multivariate model showed a good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P>0.05), and discriminating ability was good (area under the curve 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Mobility decline is an essential concern in chronic stroke patients, especially because it might lead to activities of daily living dependence and affects social reintegration. Early recognition of prognostic factors in patients at risk may guide clinicians to apply interventions aimed to prevent deterioration of mobility status in chronic stroke.
19822533	In this introduction to volume 31 of Epidemiologic Reviews, the author traces the history of health disparities research in epidemiology and situates the 10 review articles comprising this edition within this history. With the aid of a conceptual model describing the key determinants of health disparities, he offers several suggestions for improving future epidemiologic research on health disparities.
24845239	Recent research published in Health and Place (Ngamini Ngui et al., 2013b) found that one third of people with first episode psychosis [FEP] will have made a large-scale migration six years after initial diagnosis. Here, I extend this discussion around three important observations. Namely, at first presentation the most disadvantaged communities already shoulder the burden of psychotic morbidity; people with FEP in more rural communities migrate less often, and; people with FEP exhibit both upwards and downwards social mobility after onset. Understanding the reasons for (non-)migration before and after psychosis onset is now required for effective public mental health and service provision.
26960085	Within the framework for the realization of the human right to water and sanitation, States have the obligation to implement programs and public policies that satisfy the basic needs of their population, especially its most vulnerable demographics. In Colombia, this challenge has been addressed through policies that provide a determined essential amount of free water to people whose access to water and sanitation services are limited due to low income. Through a review of legal and technical documents as well as relevant literature, this article presents an analysis of the particular determinants involved in implementing this program in Bogota and Medellin, as well as some related concerns. Among such factors, we discuss the evolution and changes of the tariff model used in service provision, estimates of basic consumption, the role of social movements and collective action, and user disconnection due to non-payment. The main particularities and differences of each case highlighted the inconveniences related to the method of identifying eligible users and applying assistance to beneficiary user groups, and the need for national guidelines in implementing this policy.
12965967	Improving end-of-life experience is a major challenge to successful aging. Deaths that are reasonably free of discomfort, in accordance with patients' wishes, and within acceptable professional and ethical standards are high-quality deaths. The authors developed a 31-item measure of the quality of dying and death and applied it in a community sample and a sample of hospice enrollees. Scores on the Quality of Dying and Death Instrument and measures of perceived quality of care were collected from patients' loved ones after death. Higher overall after-death ratings of the quality of care received from all providers and from physicians were associated with higher-quality dying and death. How well patients' symptoms were controlled in the community study and how well wishes were followed and treatments were explained in the hospice study were associated with higher-quality dying. Major challenges to end-of-life research include recruiting representative population samples, given widespread reluctance of patients and loved ones to participate in research at the end of life; important variation in evaluations among different reporters after death; reluctance of loved ones to assign negative evaluations to dying experiences after death; and the highly individual and dynamic nature of dying experiences. Overcoming these challenges is of great importance in the search for the social, organizational, and individual determinants of high-quality dying in the U.S. cultural and health care context.
27397825	AIM: The objectives of this study were to describe the medication adherence of Chinese rural patients with hypertension and to investigate the factors associated with medication adherence. BACKGROUND: Medication adherence and associated factors for patients with hypertension have been widely explored in previous studies; however, these studies mainly focused on hypertensive patients in urban areas. More information regarding prevalence and the correlated factors for medication adherence for rural patients with hypertension is needed to better control blood pressure and prevent hypertension-related complications. METHODS: The study was carried out in three township hospitals in Shanxi Province (Northern China). A cross-sectional design was adopted to facilitate the survey of rural patients with hypertension. The sample consisted of 1159 participants from three township hospitals. Demographic and clinical characteristic variables, medication adherence and social support were investigated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test the determinants of adherence. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 21.3% of patients were adherents to medication and that 78.7% of patients were non-adherents. Most of the participants (71.4%) took medication more than three times daily; only 18.2% of patients took one antihypertensive tablet at a time. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the following variables were associated with medication adherence: age, household income, duration of diagnosis, number of antihypertensive tablets taken in each dose, daily frequency of taking medication, and social support. CONCLUSION: The medication adherence of Chinese rural patients with hypertension is suboptimal. Close attention and effective strategies targeting these patients are necessary; healthcare programs should be designed according to the factors affecting medication adherence.
28573845	OBJECTIVE: To explore ethnic disparities in oral health related quality of life (OHQoL) among adults, and the role that socioeconomic factors play in that association. RESEARCH DESIGN: Data from 705 adults from a socially deprived, ethnically diverse metropolitan area of London (England) were analysed for this study. Ethnicity was self-assigned based on the 2001 UK Census categories. OHQoL was measured using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), which provides information on the prevalence, extent and intensity of oral impacts on quality of life in the previous 12 months. Ethnic disparities were assessed in logistic regression models for prevalence of oral impacts and negative binomial regression models for extent and intensity of oral impacts. RESULTS: The prevalence of oral impacts was 12.7% (95% CI: 10.2-15.1) and the mean OHIP-14 extent and severity scores were 0.27 (95% CI: 0.20-0.34) and 4.19 (95% CI: 3.74-4.64), respectively. Black adults showed greater and Asian adults lower prevalence, extent and severity of oral impacts than White adults. However, significant differences were only found for the extent of oral impacts; Black adults reporting more and Asian adults fewer OHIP-14 items affected than their White counterparts. After adjustments for socioeconomic factors, Asian adults had significantly fewer OHIP-14 items affected than White adults (rate ratio: 0.28; 95%CI: 0.08-0.94). CONCLUSION: This study found disparities in OHQoL between the three main ethnic groups in South East London. Asian adults had better and Black adults had similar OHQoL than White adults after accounting for demographic and social factors.
22115499	BACKGROUND: Individuals' experience of interacting with the healthcare system has significant impact on their overall health and well-being. To relate patients' experiences to a common set of standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the concept of health system responsiveness. This study aimed to assess if the WHO responsiveness concept reflected the non-medical expectations of mental healthcare users in Teheran. METHODS: In this qualitative study, four mixed focus group discussions were formed, comprising 53 mental health service users in Tehran, Iran, in 2010. Content analysis was performed for data analysis. Responses were examined in relation to the eight domains of the WHO's responsiveness model. RESULTS: There were many commonalities between the findings of this study and the eight domains of the WHO responsiveness model, although some variations were found. Effective care was a new domain generated from our findings. In addition, the domain of prompt attention was included in two new labelled domains: attention and access to care. Participants could not differentiate autonomy from choice of healthcare provider, believing that free choice is part of autonomy. Therefore these domains were unified under the name of autonomy. The domains of quality of basic amenities, access to social support, dignity and confidentiality were considered to be important for the responsiveness concept. Some differences regarding how these domains should be defined were observed, however. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the concept of responsiveness developed by the WHO is applicable to mental health services in Iran. These findings might help policy-makers' better understanding of what is useful for the improvement of mental health services.
18950922	"Research on societal determinants of health suggests the existence of an ""inverse hazard law,"" which we define as: ""The accumulation of health hazards tends to vary inversely with the power and resources of the populations affected."" Yet, little empirical research has systematically investigated this topic, including in relation to workplace exposures. We accordingly designed the United for Health study (Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts, 2003-2004) to investigate the joint distribution and health implications of workplace occupational hazards (dust, fumes, chemical, noise, ergonomic strain) and social hazards (racial discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace abuse). Focusing on blood pressure as our health outcome, we found that among the 1202 low-income multi-racial/ethnic working class participants in our cohort - of whom 40% lived below the US poverty line - 79% reported exposure to at least one social hazard and 82% to at least one high-exposure occupational hazard. Only sexual harassment, the least common social hazard, was associated with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) among the women workers. By contrast, no statistically significant associations were detectable between the other additional highly prevalent social and occupational hazards and SBP; we did, however, find suggestive evidence of an association between SBP and response to unfair treatment, implying that in a context of high exposure, differential susceptibility to the exposure matters. These results interestingly contrast to our prior findings for this same cohort, in which we found associations between self-reported experiences of racial discrimination and two other health outcomes: psychological distress and cigarette smoking. Likely explanations for these contrasting findings include: (a) the differential etiologic periods and pathways involving somatic health, mental health, and health behaviors, and (b) the high prevalence of adverse exposures, limiting the ability to detect significant associations. As clarified by the ""inverse hazard law,"" to understand health inequities, research is needed that contrasts exposures and health status population-wide, not just among those most inequitably exposed."
16303256	BACKGROUND: The post-partum blues is a transient mood alteration affecting most women a few days after delivery. Its stereotypic pattern of symptoms and time course, peaking on post-partum day 3-5, is suggestive of biological determinants superimposed on psycho-social factors. This study was designed to evaluate the possible role of the serotonin system during this period through assessment of brain tryptophan availability. METHODS: Blood samples from 50 women were collected just before (D0) and 3 days after (D3) delivery. Based on plasma concentration of tryptophan, amino acids competing with tryptophan for transport across the blood-brain barrier and on their respective affinities for this transporter, a brain tryptophan availability index (BTAI) was calculated and its variation correlated with the intensity of post-partum blues evaluated through the Kennerley and Gath score at D3. RESULTS: The BTAI showed a -15% decrease between D0 and D3 (p < 0.01, paired t-test). This decrease was not supported by a drop in plasma tryptophan since its level rather increased (+19%). There was no evidence for change in placental indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity since the variation in plasma l-kynurenine (+12%) paralleled the change in tryptophan level. The decreased BTAI appeared the consequence of a dramatic increase in plasma levels of most amino acids, particularly the competitor aminoacids leucine, isoleucine, valine and tyrosine, during the early post-partum. This decrease in brain tryptophan availability was concomitant to the post-partum blues, whose intensity significantly correlated with the amplitude of BTAI variation (Pearson's coefficient -0.283, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that generalized, large amplitude metabolic and/or nutritional changes occurring in the early post-partum result in a transient decrease in brain tryptophan availability, partly accounting for the mood alteration referred to as the post-partum blues, a model for the triggering of puerperal mood disorder in vulnerable women.
24695243	"INTRODUCTION: To identify sociocultural determinants of self-reported condom use and HIV testing and examine variables related to accessibility, motivation and obstacles among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jordan. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study among MSM who were identified through services of a local non-governmental organization (NGO). METHODS: Respondents were studied with a semi-structured interview based on the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC) framework. The vignette-based EMIC interview considered locally relevant HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, risk perception and perceived causes, as well as awareness of services and sources of support. RESULTS: Of the 97 respondents, 27% reported that they used a condom at last intercourse; 38% had been tested at least once for HIV. Positive determinants of condom use were higher education level, acknowledging MSM as a high-risk group, seeking advice from a medical doctor and the perceived causes ""sex with prostitutes"" and ""sex with animals."" Awareness of available treatment was a positive determinant of HIV testing. Blood transfusion as a perceived cause and asking advice from friends were negative determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian MSM seem to be aware of the risk of HIV infection and effective prevention methods, and they are willing to be tested for HIV. Our findings addressed the importance of the sexual meaning of HIV/AIDS on the control of HIV/AIDS among MSM. More effective engagement of NGOs and MSM in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS is needed, enlisting the support of medical doctors and community health workers. Peer education should be strategically strengthened. Political commitment is needed to mitigate social stigma."
19608320	Research shows that interprofessional collaboration has become an important factor in the implementation of effective healthcare models. To date, the literature has not focused on the collaboration between medical doctors and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) healthcare practitioners, an example of interdisciplinary collaboration called integrative healthcare (IHC). Drawing on in-depth, semi-standardized interviews conducted with 21 practitioners working in Canadian IHC clinics, this paper explored and interpreted how IHC is experienced by those working in Canadian IHC clinics. The interview questions and analysis were guided by the Input, Process, Output conceptual framework drawn from the organizational management theory (McGrath, J. E. (1964). Social psychology: A brief introduction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.) to study collaboration within teams. We found that constructs contributing to collaboration included practitioners' attitudes and educational background, as well as external factors such as the healthcare system and financial pressures. Major processes affecting collaboration included communication, patient referral and power relationships. These determinants of collaboration were found to result in learning opportunities for practitioners, modified burden of work and ultimately, higher affective commitment toward the clinic. These constructs serve as a guide for further investigation of interprofessional collaboration within an IHC clinic. This exploration of interprofessional collaboration in IHC identified a broad array of key factors associated with interprofessional collaboration. These factors are critical to better understand the functioning of IHC clinics, and provide guidance for creation or maintenance of successful clinics.
31699030	BACKGROUND: There is a controversy about the association between vitamin D and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The effect of serum 25-OH-vitD on the risk of CVDs was evaluated. METHODS: Major electronic databases including Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed were searched. All prospective cohort studies on the relationship between vitamin D status and CVDs conducted between April 2000 and September 2017 were included, regardless language. The study participants were evaluated regardless of their age, sex, and ethnicity. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. Two investigators independently selected the studies and extracted the data. The designated effects were risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR). The random effects model was used to combine the results. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 25 studies with 10,099 cases of CVDs was performed. In general, a decrease in the level of vitamin D was associated with a higher relative risk of CVDs (incidence-mortality combined) (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.24-1.69). This accounts for 54% of CVDs mortality rate (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.29-1.84(. However, no significant relationship was observed between the vitamin D status and incidence of CVDs (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1-1.39). In general, low serum vitamin D level increased the risk of CVD by 44% (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.24-1.69). It also increased the risk of CVD mortality (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.29-1.84) and incidence rates (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that vitamin D deficiency increases the CVDs mortality rate. Due to the limited number of studies on patients of the both genders, further research is suggested to separately evaluate the effect of vitamin D status on CVD in men and women.
18442310	Understanding the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on physical development in children is important, especially in developing countries where considerable inequalities persist. This is the first study to examine the association between SES on bone development at the whole body, femoral neck, and lumbar spine in black children living in Soweto and Johannesburg, South Africa. Linear regression models were used to study associations between SES during infancy and current SES, anthropometric, and DXA-derived bone mass in 9/10-yr-old children (n = 309). Findings suggest that current SES measures, rather than SES during infancy, are stronger predictors of current whole body bone area (BA) and whole body BMC after adjusting for body size, pubertal development, physical activity, habitual dietary calcium intake, and body composition. SES had no significant effect on either hip or spine bone mass. Caregiver's marital/cohabiting status (indicator of social support) and whether there was a television in the home (indicator of greater income) at age 9/10 yr were the most important socio-economic determinants of whole body BA and BMC. SES has a significant independent effect on whole body BMC through its impact on BA. This suggests that poverty alleviation policies in South Africa could have a positive effect on bone health.
26679449	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether empirically selected and social cognitive theory-based factors, including baseline characteristics and modifiable behavioral and psychosocial factors, were determinants of physical activity (PA) maintenance in breast cancer survivors (BCSs) six months after a PA intervention.. DESIGN: Single-group longitudinal study.. SETTING: The Breast Health Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.. SAMPLE: 42 survivors with stage 0-III breast cancer who completed chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.. METHODS: The community-based PA intervention included six weekly education and practice sessions on home-based aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility exercises.. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: The dependent variable, PA maintenance, was determined based on PA level measurement at six months postintervention. The independent variables of baseline characteristics (age, stage of cancer, and chronic musculoskeletal symptoms) and modifiable behavioral and psychosocial factors (PA level, fatigue, PA self-efficacy in overcoming barriers and performing tasks) were assessed at baseline and postintervention.. FINDINGS: Multivariate regression analyses revealed that baseline fatigue and chronic musculoskeletal symptoms were the only factors significantly associated with PA maintenance.. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline fatigue level and chronic musculoskeletal symptoms were significant determinants of PA maintenance in breast cancer survivors who had completed a community-based PA intervention. However, other key factors were considered.. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Prior to participation in community-based PA interventions, clinicians should take into account the effects of high baseline fatigue levels and chronic musculoskeletal symptoms on potential PA maintenance, and consider additional assessments and support for BCSs to sustain their PA behavioral change..
15595508	"Research on the social determinants of health has increasingly sought to understand the relative importance of different features of socioeconomic status. Much of the ensuing debate has wavered between education and income, with recent research leaning increasingly toward income. This research has not, however, consistently explored interactions between different features of socioeconomic status and, in trying to understand the independent effects of different components of socioeconomic status, may have missed important features of socioeconomic position. With an eye toward examining how features of socioeconomic status combine and coalesce, this paper examines variation in the income-health association by level of education. Theories derived both from medical sociology and health economics suggest synergistic interactions between income and education, but they are unclear as to the direction and magnitude of these interactions. Results from two large and nationally representative data sets (the 1996-1997 Community Tracking Study and the 1972-2000 General Social Survey) indicate that the positive relationship between income and health varies substantially in both its strength and shape by level of education. Education improves health, and its effects are larger at lower levels of income. Moreover, education reduces the strength and curvature of the income-health relationship. Consequently, those with more education have better health for all levels of income, and fewer income-based disparities exist among the well educated than among the less well educated. The linear ""gradient"" relationship between income and health is, thus, more characteristic of groups with higher levels of education. Additional analyses indicate that these interactions existed in the United States in each of the last three decades. The results are discussed in light of theory regarding the perpetuation of health disparities, as well as current debates regarding the apparent incompatibility of distributive versus aggregative goals in health policy."
19351401	BACKGROUND: Cholera remains a serious public health problem in low-income countries despite efforts in the past to promote oral rehydration therapy as major treatment. In 2007, the majority of worldwide cases (94%) and deaths (99%) were reported from Africa. To improve cholera control efforts in addition to maintaining and improving existing water supply, sanitation and hygiene behaviour measures, the World Health Organization has recently started to consider the use of vaccines as an additional public health tool. To assess this new approach in endemic settings, a project was launched in Zanzibar to vaccinate 50,000 individuals living in communities at high risk of cholera with an oral two-dose vaccine (Dukoral). Immunisation programmes in low-income countries have suffered a reduced coverage or were even brought to a halt because of an ignorance of local realities. To ensure the success of vaccination campaigns, implementers have to consider community-held perceptions and behaviours regarding the infectious disease and the vaccine of interest. The main aim of this study is to provide advice to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Zanzibar regarding routine introduction of an oral cholera vaccine from a socioeconomic and behavioural perspective as part of a long-term development for a sustained cholera prevention strategy. METHODS AND DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative methods of health social science research will be applied on four stakeholder levels before and after the mass vaccination campaign. Rapid assessment individual interviews and focus groups will be used to describe cholera- and vaccine-related views of policy makers, health care professionals and community representatives. The cultural epidemiological approach will be employed on the individual household resident level in a repeated cross-sectional design to estimate determinants of anticipated and actual oral cholera vaccine acceptance. DISCUSSION: The study presented here is designed to inform about people's perceptions regarding cholera and about socioeconomic and behavioural factors determining anticipated and actual oral cholera vaccine acceptance in Zanzibar. Its pre- and post-intervention design using a mixed-methods approach on different stakeholder levels in communities at high risk of cholera outbreaks will ensure the collection of locally valid data relevant for public health action and planning.
30800972	Introduction: Sexual health is influenced by a myriad of social factors including health care access, social and cultural norms, insurance status, educational level and health literacy, economic status, sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation and behavior. It is pivotal to educate future physicians about these social determinants so that they can work to mitigate the resulting disparities and thereby improve the health of patients and their communities. Methods: This 2-hour, large-group session for second-year medical students was first given in the fall of 2017. It included a 1-hour, case-based lecture followed by a patient panel. Panelists discussed their interactions with the medical system and how these related to their sex and gender identity. Ninety students (77.5% response rate) completed both pre- and postsurveys and an overall assessment of the session. Results: Students reported high levels of satisfaction with the session. Eighty-seven percent felt they would benefit from more classes including a patient panel, and 93% reported specifically that the panel helped them to identify their own biases related to sexual orientation and gender. In the postsurvey, there was a significant (p < .05) increase in the number of students reporting increased comfort regarding various aspects of sexual history taking and interacting with patients of different sexual orientations and gender identities. Discussion: This instructional format provided an effective way to teach medical students about the social determinants of sexual and reproductive health. Students both appreciated the session format and reported increased comfort and confidence related to the subject matter.
24307167	Health literacy improves knowledge and builds skills to help individuals make appropriate decisions regarding their health. Over the past 20 years, several studies have described associations between health literacy and health outcomes. With respect to Romania, evidence is scarce on the level of health literacy, as well as on its determinants. Thus, the objectives of this study were to briefly screen functional health literacy levels in a sample of rural inhabitants, to assess the relationship between health literacy and reported health status, as well as to explore health literacy determinants within this population. Data were collected between September-November 2010, in four villages in Cluj County, Romania, using a cross-sectional survey. The mean age of respondents in the sample was 56 years, with roughly half of respondents being retired. The brief screening of health literacy suggested inadequate to marginal levels within the sample. Significant associations were observed between health literacy score and education, and self-perceived health status, whereas the relationship between health literacy and gender, and the presence of a chronic disease was not statistically significant. Limited health literacy has been shown to be common in people who rated their health as poor, those who attended only middle school, and individuals lacking basic information about their body. In order to minimize the adverse effects of low health literacy on health and health outcomes, efforts should be invested in identifying and addressing the health needs of adults with low and marginal health literacy, especially in underserved areas such as rural and remote settings, where access to health-related information is limited.
15613826	PURPOSE: A structural equation model was analysed to explore the determinants of health behaviors of university students in Korea. METHOD: Nine hundred sixty nine university students were selected by random cluster sampling from five universities located in the central area of Korea. DATA COLLECTION: The data was collected by questionnaires about demographic characteristics, stressful life events, perceived social support, perceived health status and health behaviors. RESULTS: 1. Gender showed indirect effect on health behaviors. 2. Living together with(out) family had a direct effect on health behaviors: students living with family showed more positive health behaviors. 3. Stressful life events had an indirect effect on health behaviors via perceived health status; a higher score of stressful life events was the predictor for negative health behaviors. 4. A higher score of perceived health status predicted positive health behaviors. RECOMMENDATION: Each university should be encouraged to develop a health behavior control program and health promotion program for their own university students. It would be more effective to develop health programs separately according to the demographic or social characteristics of the students. It is also necessary for the Ministry of Education to reform the School Health Act and school health policy to strengthen a health promotion program for university students. In conclusion, following studies should identify and promote the validity and reliability of perceived health status and health behaviors measurements.
16973642	BACKGROUND: A systematic approach to examining associations among obesity and socio-demographic determinants, psychological problems, and mental disorders in epidemiological samples is missing. METHODS: Within the representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey and its Mental Health Supplement (GHS-MHS), 4181 subjects (age 18-65 years) took part in a physical examination (including measurement of body weight and height) and a standardized psychological interview (M-CIDI). Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)), somatic diseases, socio-economic variables, health-related quality of life (SF-36), and mental disorders (DSM-IV) were assessed. Data were analysed by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity was 18.5%. There was a strong association between obesity and somatic conditions, as well as to low socio-economic status (SES). No psychosocial disadvantages (e.g. regarding social relationships, impairment due to mental health problems, depressed feelings) for the obese individuals were found. With the exception of a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in obese men (12.5 versus 8.5%, OR = 1.53, CI = 1.06-2.21, disappearing when controlled for number of somatic conditions), obese persons showed no elevated rates of mental disorders. DISCUSSION: Obesity is associated with a low SES and some somatic disadvantages but not with other social or emotional disadvantages that have been often assumed to be very prevalent in that group. From the population-based perspective, obesity per se seems not to be associated with a higher risk for suffering from mental disorders, whereas relations between specific aspects of obesity and specific types of psychopathology still need further study.
15694708	"This paper suggests to rigorously test the hypothesis that there are causal links between visible light and the development of leukaemia and other cancers in children. Light can be considered as a candidate risk factor because it suppresses melatonin biosynthesis which may play a role in a series of anticancer defences. Indeed, melatonin may offer some protection against all ""hallmarks of cancer"" [i.e., self-sufficiency in growth signals; insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signals; evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis); limitless replicative potential; sustained angiogenesis; tissue invasion and metastasis] recently suggested by Hanahan and Weinberg. Already ongoing investigations into the possible nexus of light, endocrine systems and the development of cancers will be further fueled by recent insights into photoreception and -- transduction, including the discovery of ""novel"" photoreceptors in the eye. Among a variety of different photosensory tasks, these receptors constitute crucial gates for light information from the environment which is employed for the temporal organization of our physiology and it has been proposed that chronodisruption, i.e., a significant disturbance of the coordination and thus order of biological rhythms, could contribute to the development of cancers. With regard to public health, the pervasive exposures to light -- at work and in homes -- imply that visible radiation could be a strong risk factor defined epidemiologically as a causal contributor to disease in a large proportion of cases. Importantly, if light were to be corroborated as a contributor to cancers in children, it would be amenable to manipulations with the perspective of reducing inherent risks significantly. In fact, it could be much easier -- and much more effective -- to reevaluate and modify lighting systems than to manipulate other possible determinants of the chronic processes of cancer such as genetic, nutritional or lifestyle factors."
12101586	This study examined the determinants of attitudes toward intergroup support. The data was collected from the participants of a simulated society game (SIMINSOC; Hirose, 1997). The global society in the game includes rich and poor regions, and the poor regions need to obtain support from rich regions for survival. One hundred and thirty-two participants were randomly assigned to either rich or poor regions and were engaged in various activities in the game. The level of ingroup identity was manipulated by facilitating group activities in some groups but no in others. Then they answered questions regarding the identification, attributions of responsibility, and attitude toward support provision. The results indicated that the identification toward the ingroup increased attribution bias. Furthermore, the identification toward the global society increased the intent to provide support among those from the rich regions. The discussion considered the importance of including intergroup variables in the attributional approach to support provision.
25981341	BACKGROUND: Quantifying the clinical impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most important determinants for optimizing individual patient care. Useful clinical measures for MS can be evaluated from different perspectives. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: This cross-sectional study compared physical disability and functional status as assessed by a neurologist and by a patient and explored how they are associated with the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS: We collected data from 223 patients. One neurologist scored functional disability using the Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and patients evaluated their functional status using the Incapacity Status Scale (ISS). HRQoL was assessed using the Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS, MCS) of the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Multiple linear regressions were applied to analyze the data. RESULTS: Total EDSS and ISS scores correlated significantly (r = .67; p </= .001). Regression analyses showed that EDSS was significantly related to PCS, but not to MCS. After adding ISS into the analysis the association between EDSS and PCS became non-significant. ISS contributed significantly to the explained variance in both models. The final model explained 49% of the total variance for PCS and 15% for MCS. CONCLUSIONS: Functional disability as measured by a neurologist (EDSS) is associated with PCS, but not with MCS, whereas functional disability as measured by patients (ISS) is significantly associated with both HRQoL dimensions. Neurologists should target their attention more on patients' evaluations of their functional status in order to detect the most bothersome problems that are affecting a patient's quality of life.
11028281	In a community sample of 394 elderly aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed. Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed. The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person. In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time. 88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year. 55.8% took at least one medicine each day. The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine. Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor. Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life. Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support. There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine.
25601809	We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2012 in 12 selected provinces and prefectures in Morocco to determine consultation delay (patient delay), diagnosis delay and treatment delay (health system delays), and factors relating to these delays. The sample included 250 eligible and consenting newly diagnosed smearpositive pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were interviewed at the time of their registration within Diagnosis of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases Reference Centers (CDTMR) or Integrated Health Centers (CSI) using a pretested and structured questionnaire. The median total delay was 46 days [inter-quartile interval (IQI) = 29-84 days]. Patient delay (median = 20; IQI = 8-47 days) was higher than health system delay (median=15; IIQ = 7-35 days). Being illiterate, thinking symptoms will disappear by themselves; having financial constraints and feeling fear of diagnosis or social isolation were associated with patient delay. Consulting first in the private sector or having 3 or more consultations before diagnosis was associated with health system delay.
28980733	This article provides a critical discussion of the social determinants of health framework and compares it with theoretical perspectives, such as that offered by assemblage theory, offering an alternative view of the complex interplay between human relationships and the structures around us. We offer an ethnographic perspective, discussing the lived experiences of the social determinants in an Indigenous community in a remote part of northern Australia.
12600275	BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal complaints are frequent and have large consequences for public health. Information about the prognosis after presentation in general practice is far from complete. Knowledge about determinants of the clinical course of musculoskeletal complaints is essential for management decisions and to inform patients about their prognosis. The purpose of this study is to provide information about the prognosis of musculoskeletal complaints other than low back pain by studying the course of these complaints in general practice and to identify determinants of this course. METHODS: Patients of 18 years and older, who present in general practice with a new episode of a musculoskeletal complaint of the neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, arm, hip, knee, ankle or foot, are recruited by their general practitioner (GP). Participants will receive complaint-specific questionnaires by mail at baseline and after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. The following putative determinants of the course of the complaints will be investigated: sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics of the complaint, psychosocial job characteristics, physical workload, physical activity during leisure time, pain coping, mood, kinesiophobia, social support, optimism. The primary outcomes are perceived recovery, pain, functional status, sick leave and overall quality of life.
28476461	OBJECTIVES: To determine whether social determinants of health (SDH) risk adjustment changes hospital-level performance on the 30-day Pediatric All-Condition Readmission (PACR) measure and improves fit and accuracy of discharge-level models. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all hospital discharges meeting criteria for the PACR from 47 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information database from January to December 2014. We built four nested regression models by sequentially adding risk adjustment factors as follows: chronic condition indicators (CCIs); PACR patient factors (age and sex); electronic health record-derived SDH (race, ethnicity, payer), and zip code-linked SDH (families below poverty level, vacant housing units, adults without a high school diploma, single-parent households, median household income, unemployment rate). For each model, we measured the change in hospitals' readmission decile-rank and assessed model fit and accuracy. RESULTS: For the 458 686 discharges meeting PACR inclusion criteria, in multivariable models, factors associated with higher discharge-level PACR measure included age <1 year, female sex, 1 of 17 CCIs, higher CCI count, Medicaid insurance, higher median household income, and higher percentage of single-parent households. Adjustment for SDH made small but significant improvements in fit and accuracy of discharge-level PACR models, with larger effect at the hospital level, changing decile-rank for 17 of 47 hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: We found that risk adjustment for SDH changed hospitals' readmissions rate rank order. Hospital-level changes in relative readmissions performance can have considerable financial implications; thus, for pay for performance measures calculated at the hospital level, and for research associated therewith, our findings support the inclusion of SDH variables in risk adjustment.
30789947	BACKGROUND: Recent reports of increasing prevalence of frequent health complaints and mental health problems among adolescents call for directing more attention on determinants of adolescent health. The relationship between health and social capital has gained increased attention since the early 2000's and research at review level confirms the importance of social capital for health outcomes, despite methodological heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to identify distinct profiles of family, school and peer social capital in a nationally representative sample of adolescents and to explore health outcomes in those profiles. METHOD: Cross-sectional data from the Swedish Health Behaviour of School-aged Children 2013/14 was used for this study. The analytical sample consisted of 7,804 adolescents aged 11-, 13- and 15-years. Items representing sense of belonging and emotional support were assessed in three contexts; family, school and among peers. Latent profile analyses (LPA) were run to determine social capital profiles. Health outcomes included frequent health complaints and life satisfaction, while socioeconomic status and genders were included as predictors. RESULTS: The results show that five distinct profiles best represent the data for 11- and 15-year olds, while a four-profile model was optimal for 13-year olds. Some profiles were recurrent between age groups but unique profiles were also found. Health outcomes were significantly different between profiles depending on levels of social capital in the different contexts. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insight into how social capital co-occurs among adolescents within the contexts of family, school and peers and how this translates into differences in health outcomes. The national representativeness of the sample increases the implications of the results and contributes to meaningful insights that help explain the interactions of social capital in multiple contexts, complementing what is previously known about the relationship with adolescent health.
29925329	BACKGROUND: Investigating cases of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and severe maternal outcome (SMO) and the quality of maternal health care using near-miss approach has become popular over recent years. The aim of this study was to determine facility based incidence and the determinants of severe maternal outcome (SMO) using this approach. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study among all mothers who presented to study facility while pregnant, during child birth and/or within 42 days after termination of pregnancy seeking care and found to have SMM and SMO during the study period was carried out. RESULTS: There were total of 2737 live births, 202 SMM and 162 SMO (138 maternal near-misses (MNM) and 24 maternal deaths (MD)) cases. The SMO ratio was 59.2 per 1000 live births and the MNM mortality ratio, mortality index (MI) and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) were: 5.8:1, 14.8% and 876.9 per 100,000 live births respectively. Close to three-fourth of all women with SMO had evidence of organ dysfunction on arrival or within 12 h of hospitalization. The commonest underlying causes for SMO were uterine rupture 27%, followed by hypertensive disorders 24% and obstetric hemorrhage 24%. The highest case fatality rate was found to be associated with eclampsia 28%. Maternal age, residential area, educational status and occupation were associated with SMO (P < 0.0001). On binary multivariable logistic regression the occurrence of any delay, intrapartal detection of complication, the mode of delivery and duration of hospitalization had statically significant association with SMO (p < 0.05). Optimal number of antenatal care (ANC) visits and delivery by emergency cesarean section (C/S) were found to be protective of SMO. CONCLUSION: The occurance SMO in the facility thus in the population served was high. Most of these factors associated with SMO are modifiable; some amenable to social change and the others are within the control of the health system. Thus the finding of this research calls for planning for such changes which can enhance timely and proper detection and management of pregnancy related complications.
30976391	Kidney disease is a global public health problem, affecting over 750 million persons worldwide. The burden of kidney disease varies substantially across the world, as does its detection and treatment. In many settings, rates of kidney disease and the provision of its care are defined by socio-economic, cultural, and political factors leading to significant disparities. World Kidney Day 2019 offers an opportunity to raise awareness of kidney disease and highlight disparities in its burden and current state of global capacity for prevention and management. Here, we highlight that many countries still lack access to basic diagnostics, a trained nephrology workforce, universal access to primary health care, and renal replacement therapies. We point to the need for strengthening basic infrastructure for kidney care services for early detection and management of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease across all countries and advocate for more pragmatic approaches to providing renal replacement therapies. Achieving universal health coverage worldwide by 2030 is one of the World Health Organization's Sustainable Development Goals. While universal health coverage may not include all elements of kidney care in all countries, understanding what is feasible and important for a country or region with a focus on reducing the burden and consequences of kidney disease would be an important step towards achieving kidney health equity.
16078805	In this article, we present an educational approach uniquely linked to humanitarian and peace-building goals in conflicted regions of the world. We examine the Canada International Scientific Exchange Program and its lead program, the Middle East Association for Managing Hearing Loss, as a case study. Under a Canadian umbrella, continuing medical education and continuous professional development are used to gather academics from regions in conflict for mutually beneficial professional activities. Larger scale international prospects for educational programming, extending beyond the health sector, are ways of addressing the primary determinants of health and creating social capital.
30224653	High blood pressure is a highly heritable and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We report the largest genetic association study of blood pressure traits (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure) to date in over 1 million people of European ancestry. We identify 535 novel blood pressure loci that not only offer new biological insights into blood pressure regulation but also highlight shared genetic architecture between blood pressure and lifestyle exposures. Our findings identify new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation with potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future.
27485619	We identify the socioeconomic determinants of three levels of antenatal care (ANC) visits (no, intermediate [1-3], and recommended [>/=4]) in Bangladesh using a behavior model framework for health care utilization. Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that different levels of visits had different determinants; for example, media exposure increased the likelihood of intermediate compared with no visits while desire for pregnancy increased the likelihood of recommended compared with intermediate visits. We therefore highlight that ANC policies or interventions should be target-group specific because determinants differ depending on level of ANC visits.
28917950	"Suicide is an important public health problem that requires a preventive approach. The present study aimed at assessing suicidal behaviors and their relations with other psychosocial factors in Campeche, Mexico, in order to inform the design of potential preventive interventions. A multistage probability sample of 2386 students representative of all middle schools of the state of Campeche, Mexico, took a standardized, paper-and-pencil survey covering selected psychosocial constructs including suicide behavior, depression, drug use, familial relationships, locus of control, impulsivity, and self-esteem, among others. Latent classes were identified and multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze associations between class membership and psychosocial covariates. An estimated 8% of the middle school population in Campeche had three or more psychosocial problems in the past month including drug use, major depression episode symptoms, as well as suicidal problems like attempts and self-inflicted injuries. Four latent classes were identified, one with lowest risk and three with varying characteristics in terms of binge alcohol and other drug use, depression, and suicide behaviors. Associations between psychosocial covariates and latent class were observed, as predicted based on a multi-dimensional theoretical framework. Heterogeneity across ""High-Risk"" groups and their potential determinants highlight the need for differentiated, specialized efforts ranging from universal to indicated interventions. Given the high level of risk factors in this population, universal preventive interventions should aim at building resiliency among youth by helping them develop an array of coping resources, as well as by creating a more nurturing psychosocial environment."
30080474	Good research evidence exists to suggest that social determinants of health, including access to housing, nutrition, and transportation, can influence health outcomes and health care use for vulnerable populations. Yet adequate, sustainable financing for interventions that improve social determinants of health has eluded most if not all US communities. This article argues that underinvestment in social determinants of health stems from the fact that such investments are in effect public goods, and thus benefits cannot be efficiently limited to those who pay for them-which makes it more difficult to capture return on investment. Drawing on lesser-known economic models and available data, we show how a properly governed, collaborative approach to financing could enable self-interested health stakeholders to earn a financial return on and sustain their social determinants investments.
31368213	Cultural determinants of obesity prevalence have been little studied but could explain significant variations in body mass index (BMI) trajectories among countries. This ecological study quantified longitudinal associations between six dimensions of national culture and mean population BMI over 25 years. National mean male and female BMI data 1990 to 2014 provided dependent variables. National dimensions of culture (from the Hofstede database for up to 87 countries) were independent variables: Individualism, Uncertainty avoidance, Indulgence, Long-term orientation, Power distance, and Masculinity. Analyses used mixed models for repeated measures for each dimension of national culture with male and female adult BMI trajectories, controlling for confounders. A higher mean BMI was significantly associated with higher Individualism, Uncertainty avoidance, Indulgence, and Masculine orientation and with lower Power distance (males only) and lower Long-term orientation (males only). Overall, the national cultural dimensions explained 62.4% (males) and 53.5% (females) of the variance in mean BMI among countries. National cultural characteristics, especially Individualism and Uncertainty avoidance, are strongly related to obesity prevalence, explaining over half of the variance among countries. More research and theory development is needed to understand the pathways for these associations so that cultural contexts can be better accounted for in policies, social marketing messages, and community-based actions for obesity prevention.
27799595	Dissemination and communication of research should be considered as an integral part of any research project. Both help in increasing the visibility of research outputs, public engagement in science and innovation, and confidence of society in research. Effective dissemination and communication are vital to ensure that the conducted research has a social, political, or economical impact. They draw attention of governments and stakeholders to research results and conclusions, enhancing their visibility, comprehension, and implementation. In the European project SOPHIE (Evaluating the Impact of Structural Policies on Health Inequalities and Their Social Determinants and Fostering Change), dissemination was an essential component of the project in order to achieve the purpose of fostering policy change based on research findings. Here we provide our experience and make some recommendations based on our learning. A strong use of online communication (website, Twitter, and Slideshare accounts), the production of informative videos, the research partnership with civil society organizations, and the organization of final concluding scientific events, among other instruments, helped to reach a large public within the scientific community, civil society, and the policy making arena and to influence the public view on the impact on health and equity of certain policies.
30963142	Disparities in outcomes for preventive and primary health care services often result when vulnerable patients rely on episodic encounters for emergency services that do not meet their long-term health needs. Understanding health outcomes in socially or economically disadvantaged subgroups is crucial to improving community health, and it requires innovative analytics and dynamic application of clinical and population data. While it is common practice to use proxy indicators, such as quality of life and mortality, when discussing health equity, these have shown limited utility and are rarely applied at a population-level within a health system. Therefore, we designed and implemented an index, calculated as the ratio of observed-to-expected encounters, to identify and quantify health inequalities in health care systems. Providing equitable care, as measured by health outcomes, is analogous to precision medicine applied to social determinants. For health systems, the use of this index will facilitate the development of specially-tailored interventions to address inequity and provides a tool to measure the impact of such programs.
21639878	BACKGROUND: Assessing the correlates of practicing physical activity during leisure time is important with regard to planning and designing public health strategies to increase beneficial behaviors among adult populations. Although the importance of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) is highlighted in many Western countries, there are not many publications on physical activity patterns, and even less on their correlates, in non-Western societies. The goal of this study was thus to explore the determinants influencing adults' leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in a city in southern Taiwan. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted in 2007, using a standardized questionnaire. Energy expenditure was dichotomized into two groups based on the recommended levels of moderate physical activity from LTPA: >/=10 or < 10 MET.hr.wk(-1). Logistic regression analyses were applied to the results. RESULTS: A total of 762 subjects with valid data took part in the study (mean age 53.8 +/- 13.8 years). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found the following results: Age was positively associated with LTPA. Adults with stronger perceived convenience of exercise facilities (OR = 2.04; 95%CI = 1.28-3.24) and past exercise experience in school (OR = 1.86; 95%CI= 1.19-2.91) participated in more LTPA. Subjects with more general social support (OR = 1.66;95%CI = 1.13-2.44), greater knowledge about the health benefits of exercise (OR = 1.85;95%CI = 1.25-2.74), more sports media consumption (OR = 1.94;95%CI = 1.26-2.98), and higher self-efficacy (OR = 3.99;95%CI = 2.67-5.97) were more likely to engage in LTPA. Further analysis comparing different sources of social support showed only social support from friends had a significant positive association (OR = 1.73;95%CI = 1.14-2.63) with increased LTPA. CONCLUSIONS: LTPA in southern city of Taiwan showed some unique associations with age, socioeconomic status and media consumption that are not commonly reported in the Western World and similar associations with regards to psychosocial correlates of LTPA participation. Further studies from developing countries are warranted to highlight culture-specific differences in physical activity participation.
27334297	BACKGROUND: The causes of health inequalities are complex. For the reduction of health inequalities, intersectoral collaboration between the public health sector and both social policy sectors (e.g. youth affairs, education) and physical policy sectors (e.g. housing, spatial planning) is essential, but in local practice difficult to realize. The aim of this study was to examine the collaboration between the sectors in question more closely and to identify opportunities for improvement. METHOD: A qualitative descriptive analysis of five aspects of collaboration within sixteen Dutch municipalities was performed to examine the collaboration between the public health sector and other policy sectors: 1) involvement of the sectors in the public health policy network, 2) harmonisation of objectives, 3) use of policies by the relevant sectors, 4) formalised collaboration, and 5) previous experience. Empirical data on these collaboration aspects were collected based on document analysis, questionnaires and interviews. RESULTS: The study found that the policy workers of social sectors were more involved in the public health network and more frequently supported the objectives in the field of health inequality reduction. Both social policy sectors and physical policy sectors used policies and activities to reduce health inequalities. More is done to influence the determinants of health inequality through policies aimed at lifestyle and social setting than through policies aimed at socioeconomic factors and the physical environment. Where the physical policy sectors are involved in the public health network, the collaboration follows a very similar pattern as with the social policy sectors. All sectors recognise the importance of good relationships, positive experiences, a common interest in working together and coordinated mechanisms. CONCLUSION: This study shows that there is scope for improving collaboration in the field of health inequality reduction between the public health sector and both social policy sectors and physical policy sectors. Ways in which improvement could be realised include involving physical policy sectors in the network, pursuing widely supported policy goals, making balanced efforts to influence determinants of health inequalities, and increasing the emphasis on a programmatic approach.
11814157	"OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to assess: (1) child health nurses' identification of abuse/neglect of children of preschool age in their districts; (2) overall prevalence of abuse/neglect according to the nurses; (3) determinants of nurse identification; (4) determinants of nurse-reported district prevalences; and (5) determinants of reporting to the child protection services (CPS). METHOD: Questionnaires were mailed to about 3,000 child health centers. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent responded. Of these, 22% identified no case and 33% at least one (mostly five or fewer). The overall prevalence was 1.4%. Identification correlated with general participation rate in the county. Other determinants of identification were acquaintance with the district, large district populations, and three variables assumed to reflect a personal interest. Determinants of prevalences were small district populations, regular contacts with the social services, and two personal interest variables. With large district populations, identification increased, whereas prevalences decreased. Only 30.3% had made a report to the CPS. Regular contacts with the social services correlated with reporting. Personal interest was a determinant of the decision to report, and acquaintance with the district a determinant of reporting rate. CONCLUSIONS: Abuse and neglect did not appear as priorities for the Child Health Services. The method probably led to an underestimation of the true prevalence. Personal interest and social services contacts emerged as important determinants. However, the assumed criteria of ""interest"" were not validated. For effective identification, no nurse should be responsible for more than 400 to 500 children. Implications for practice and research are discussed."
18950800	OBJECTIVE: To investigate health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with parental reports and children's self-reports, and to investigate the potential contribution of demographic factors, disease-specific factors, and problems in school performance or behavior. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective observational study, parents of 58 children with NF1 (32 boys, 26 girls, age 12.2 +/- 2.5 years) visiting a university clinic, and their 43 children 10 years or older were assessed with the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). Potential determinants of domain scores were assessed in 3 explorative regression models. RESULTS: Parents reported a significant impact of NF1 on 9/13 CHQ scales, with moderate effect sizes on 8 (general health perceptions, physical functioning, general behavior, mental health, self esteem, family activities, role functioning emotional/behavioral, and parent emotional impact). Children report an impact on bodily pain, and an above average general behavior. Multiple CHQ scales were sensitive to demographic factors and behavioral problems, and 1 to NF1 severity. NF1 visibility and school problems did not influence HR-QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Parents, but not the children with NF1, report a profound impact of NF1 on physical, social, behavioral, and emotional aspects of HR-QOL. Multiple HR-QOL domains were most sensitive to behavioral problems, which points to an exciting potential opportunity to improve HR-QOL in children with NF1 by addressing these behavioral problems.
18592980	"OBJECTS: The aim of this paper was to identify factors affecting the urgency of nursing home placement after introduction of public long-term care insurance. METHODS: The subjects were families including at least one disabled elderly person and one another family member in two cities in Chugoku Prefecture. The measure of the urgency of placement was 0 if the family did not submit any application for placement, 1 if the care managers judged that the elderly person should enter in the future when she/he really needs placement, 2 if the care managers judged that she/he might be able to wait for a short while, and 3 if the care managers judged that she/he should enter as early as possible. Our estimation method was by ordered logit model. The dependent variable was the measure of the urgency and the independent variables were several attributes of the families. In the estimation, we considered the possibility that the coefficients depend on categories of dependent variable. RESULTS: We obtained data for 146 waiting families and 494 others (total 640). There were differences in the urgency of placement among waiting elderly as follows ""she/he should enter as early as possible"" (28.8%); ""she/he can wait for a while"" (32.2%), ""she/he should enter in the future when she/he really needs placement"" (39.0%). The results of multivariate analyses showed that the urgency of placement correlated significantly with the severity of the elderly persons disabilities, the number of primary caregivers' self-symptoms, the family members' negative attitude toward caregiving, residing in city A, not having one's own house and limited use of short-stay facilities due to the circumstances of the providers. CONCLUSION: When judging the urgency of placement, we should consider not only whether the applicant has submitted a request for a nursing home or not, but also differences among the waiting families. The urgency of placement correlates significantly with severity of disability of the elderly person, the number of primary caregivers' self-symptoms, the family members' negative attitude for caregiving, residing in city A, not having one's own house, and limited use of short-stay facilities due to the circumstances of the providers."
26784886	BACKGROUND: Individuals with a history of suicide attempt have a high risk for subsequent labour market marginalization. This study aimed at assessing the effect of individual and parental factors on different measures of marginalization. METHODS: Prospective cohort study based on register linkage of 5 649 individuals who in 1994 were 16-30 years old, lived in Sweden and were treated in inpatient care for suicide attempt during 1992-1994. Hazard ratios (HRs) for labour market marginalization defined as long-term unemployment (>180 days), sickness absence (>90 days), or disability pension in 1995-2010 were calculated with Cox regression. RESULTS: Medical risk factors, particularly any earlier diagnosed specific mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia: HR 5.4 (95% CI: 4.2, 7.0), personality disorders: HR 3.9, 95% CI: 3.1, 4.9), repetitive suicide attempts (HR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4, 1.9) were associated with a higher relative risk of disability pension. Individual medical factors were of smaller importance for long-term sickness absence, and of only marginal relevance to long-term unemployment. Country of birth outside Europe had an opposite effect on disability pension (HR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.8) and long-term unemployment (HR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8). Female sex was positively correlated with long-term sickness absence (HR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4, 1.7), and negatively associated with long-term unemployment (HR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7, 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: As compared to disability pension, long-term sickness absence and unemployment was more strongly related to socio-economic variables. Marginalization pathways seemed to vary with migration status and sex. These findings may contribute to the development of intervention strategies which take the individual risk for marginalization into account.
29379564	Objective: The aim of this study was to determine factors influencing the number of times neonatal intensive care unit admitted preterm infants attend Neonatal Follow up and Early Intervention services (NFEI) during first year of life. Materials &Methods: A parent-report questionnaire was administered via phone after the first birthday of preterm infants admitted to the NICU at Arash Hospital, Tehran, for at least 24 h, and who received standard NICU-based therapeutic services, from Apr 2014 to Feb 2015. Data included mother's age, education, type of pregnancy, history of abortion or premature birth, self-reported post-partum depression, number of children, infant's gender, birth weight, gestational age, length of stay in the NICU, living area, twin or triplet birth, number of siblings, and the child rank. Number of attending times to services was recorded. Another question addressed the causes of not attending the NFEI services. Results: Ultimately, 119 eligible children participated, 51% were girls and whose mean birth weight was 1908+/-626.7 gr, and average length of NICU stay was 20.1+/-16.9 d. After multivariate analysis, shorter length of stay in the NICU, lower maternal education, number of children, self-declared lack of awareness about early intervention services, and self-reported lack of referral by a physician were the only factors that continued to be significantly correlated, and in fact, the truly influential ones associated with number of attending times. Conclusion: This study has defined some predictors of poor follow up and early intervention service utilization in a high-risk group of infants suggested be addressing and tackling by policymakers.
17934578	This exploratory research based on the Social Ecological Theory aimed to study the health promotion of 39 people working in the harvest of the sugarcane in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The objectives were to identify the individual, social and environmental factors predisposing the workers to illnesses. The data were collected through direct observation of the labor activity and a questionnaire. The main individual determinant factors were physical effort and hectic work rhythm, and among the environmental factors, intense solar radiation, dust, soot and the presence of venomous animals were highlighted. The conditions of life and work reflect the poverty of these individuals and are the main social determinants of illness. The interaction of these factors can cause respiratory, cutaneous, musculoskeletal problems, occupational accidents. Thus, eradicating poverty and improving work conditions are fundamental for the health promotion of these workers.
18464286	I study factors associated with prevalence of obesity among immigrants as the length of their stay in the US becomes longer. Using the National Health Interview Surveys for 1990-2004, I create 'synthetic cohorts' of immigrants that allow controlling for two important determinants of obesity: age at arrival and period of arrival in the US. I find that immigrants with a BA degree did not experience any change in obesity as their stay in the US advanced. Obesity among those without a BA degree, however, increased with duration of stay. Similarly, while some ethnic groups experienced increase in obesity with duration, others did not. For those who experienced increase in obesity with duration, the rise was higher during the first five years of residence than later and greater for those who arrived at a relatively young age.
30158577	PURPOSE: The aims of the study were to assess the magnitude and predictors of the unmet need for spectacles utilization and to quantify its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among rural Chinese adolescents. METHODS: This school-based survey of 2346 grade-7 students (mean age: 13.8 years) was conducted in Southwestern China in 2016. Spectacles need was defined as uncorrected visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or worse but correctable to 20/40 or better in the better-seeing eye, together with the presence of myopia of less than -0.5 diopters (D), hyperopia of more than +2.0 D, or astigmatism of more than 0.75 D in both eyes. The HRQOL was measured using self-reported versions of 23-item Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL 4.0). RESULTS: Among 579 (24.7%) adolescents with an uncorrected VA of 20/40 or less, 483 (83.4%) needed vision corrections and 172 (35.6%) used them. Higher parental education levels (odds ratio (OR) = 2.73; 95% CI, 1.29-5.77), negative attitude regarding spectacles (OR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.97), and poorer uncorrected VA (OR = 31.27; 95% CI, 3.76-260.23) were independent determinants for spectacles utilization. Adolescents not using spectacles had a lower HRQOL score compared to those using spectacles in terms of psychosocial health (65.91 vs. 70.59; P = 0.028), emotional health (56.85 vs. 63.24; P = 0.012), and social functioning (72.99 vs. 78.60; P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of spectacles utilization in rural China was low. Adolescents were not accustomed to use spectacles had a worse HRQOL score.
16277821	This paper discusses possible consequences of energy excess throughout the life cycle. Firstly we consider the effects of foods on hunger, satiety and satiation. Also, the changes in food availability and consumption in relation to changes in social and economic determinants of energy excess. The relationship between physical activity and energy intake (EI) is also considered. Secondly we explore the definition of energy excess and the metabolic effects of macronutrients (mainly in relation to fuel partitioning oxidation/storage) on energy balance. The cellular and molecular regulation determined by specific genes involved in lipogenesis, fuel partitioning and/or in energy dissipation are explored. Thirdly, we examine the main consequences induced by energy excess and positive energy balance, starting with the alterations in glucose utilisation (insulin resistance) leading to type 2 diabetes and the linkage of energy excess with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Biological, social and psychological consequences during perinatal, childhood and adolescence periods are specifically analysed. Fourthly, the transition from energy deficit to excess, under the optic of a developing country is analysed with country examples drawn from Latin America. The possible role of supplementary food programmes in determining positive energy balance is discussed especially in relation to pre-school and school feeding programmes. Fifthly, we deal with the economic costs of energy excess and obesity related diseases. Finally, some areas where further research is needed are described; biological and genetic determinants of individual and population energy requirements, foods and food preparations as actually consumed, consumer education and research needs on social determinants of energy imbalances.
21974736	Exercise plays a key role in the prevention and delay of the onset of Type 2 diabetes and in the management of this disorder. To determine if there are differences in key social-cognitive determinants of exercise and self-reported physical activity levels between adults with diabetes and those without the condition, a random selected sample of adults was surveyed. A telephone interview assessed physical activity behaviour and key social-cognitive constructs from major health behaviour change theories/models. The mean energy expenditure was not significantly different between the diabetes (n = 46) and the non-diabetes (n = 1556) groups. The diabetes group reported significantly lower scores for self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control, but higher for fear of, and vulnerability to, general health and cardiovascular disease threat. The data suggest that it may not be necessary to promote health threat messages, as threat is already high for this diabetes population and studies have shown that excess threat does not promote recommended exercise and health behaviours. Instead, the low levels of self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control among those with diabetes emphasize the importance of designing specific strategies (e.g., skills, incremental success) to increase their self-confidence in undertaking physical activity.
30700299	BACKGROUND: Power imbalances are a key driver of avoidable, unfair and unjust differences in health. Devolution shifts the balance of power in health systems. Intersectionality approaches can provide a 'lens' for analysing how power relations contribute to complex and multiple forms of health advantage and disadvantage. These approaches have not to date been widely used to analyse health systems reforms. While the stated objectives of devolution often include improved equity, efficiency and community participation, past evidence demonstrates that that there is a need to create space and capacity for people to transform existing power relations these within specific contexts. METHODS: We carried out a qualitative study between March 2015 and April 2016, involving 269 key informant and in-depth interviews from across the health system in ten counties, 14 focus group discussions with community members in two of these counties and photovoice participatory research with nine young people. We adopted an intersectionality lens to reveal how power relations intersect to produce vulnerabilities for specific groups in specific contexts, and to identify examples of the tacit knowledge about these vulnerabilities held by priority-setting stakeholders, in the wake of the introduction of devolution reforms in Kenya. RESULTS: Our study identified a range of ways in which longstanding social forces and discriminations limit the power and agency individuals can exercise, but are mediated by their unique circumstances at a given point in their life. These are the social determinants of health, influencing an individual's exposure to risk of ill health from their living environment, their work, or their social context, including social norms relating to their gender, age, geographical residence or socio-economic status. While a range of policy measures have been introduced to encourage participation by typically 'unheard voices', devolution processes have yet to adequately challenge the social norms, and intersecting power relations which contribute to discrimination and marginalisation. CONCLUSIONS: If key actors in devolved decision-making structures are to ensure progress towards universal health coverage, there is need for intersectoral policy action to address social determinants, promote equity and identify ways to challenge and shift power imbalances in priority-setting processes.
17661604	BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months postpartum is promoted internationally as the preferred method of feeding infants. Infants of parents with a history of asthma in particular could benefit from a longer period (6 months) of breastfeeding, because this may reduce the chance of developing an allergic disease. The aim of this study was to identify psychosocial behavioral determinants of the intended duration and actual initiation of breastfeeding in families with a predisposition to asthma. METHODS: This prospective study was part of a randomized trial in which breastfeeding for 6 months was promoted. The 89 women participating completed a breastfeeding questionnaire based on the Attitude-Social Influence-Self-Efficacy model in the second trimester of their pregnancy. This served as the baseline measurement. RESULTS: Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses showed that attitudinal beliefs were significantly associated with the intended duration to breastfeed (p = 0.01) and the intention was the strongest predictor for the actual initiation of breastfeeding (OR: 8.2; 95% CI: 1.5 to 44.3). CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding promotion needs to focus on the health advantages and other advantages of breastfeeding for 6 months, especially in high-risk groups, in order to increase the intention to breastfeed, which appeared to be a strong predictor for actual behavior.
26682658	Postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (P-PTSD) is a variant of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that, although relatively prevalent, is under-researched. Up to one-third of women in the United States describe childbirth as traumatic, with 9 percent of women meeting the criteria for PTSD outlined by the American Psychiatric Association. These statistics are sobering in light of common use of analgesia during birth as well as hospital birth environments promoting family-centered maternity care. How can a seemingly natural event, such as childbirth, be associated with PTSD? This review includes a description of key variables associated with P-PTSD. Socioeconomic, environmental and genetic determinants are discussed, as are evidence-based prevention and treatment approaches.
10926127	The aim of this study was to evaluate possible changes in predisposing factors in sexual preventive behaviors that could result from the availability of an efficient new antiretroviral therapy. A total of 136 young adults were randomly assigned a vignette to read describing AIDS as a lethal or chronic disease. After reading the vignette, the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial determinants of intention to use a condom with a new sexual partner. The variables were measured according to Ajzen's (1985, 1988, 1991) theory of planned behavior and Triandis's (1977) theory of interpersonal behavior. The experimental manipulation was more successful when the disease was described as lethal (66 of the 68 subjects) rather than chronic (30 of the 68 subjects). For the 96 participants who correctly identified the expected outcome of the disease presented in the vignette, a significant difference in intention was found between the two experimental situations (p < .05). Regression of intention to use condoms on the psychosocial variables yielded an adjusted R2 of .62. Perceived behavioral control, social norms, personal normative belief and anticipated affective reaction were the significant variables explaining this intention. The results suggest that intention to use condoms with a new sexual partner is likely to be modified by the expected outcome of the disease, that is, whether lethal or chronic. Thus, it is suggested that interventions aimed at young adults take into account the impacts the new antiretroviral treatments are likely to have on preventive behaviors.
24956548	"The social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work, and age and the systems put in place to deal with illness. These circumstances, in turn, are shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics. Reproductive health indicators and conditions that are germane to obstetricians and gynecologists vary across states and regions in the United States as well as within regions and states. The aim of this article is to illustrate this variation with the use of examples of gynecologic malignancies, sexually transmitted infections, teen birth rates, preterm birth rates, and infant mortality rates. Using the example of infant death, the difficulties in ""unpacking"" the construct of place will be discussed, and a special emphasis is placed on the interaction of race, place, and disparities in shaping perinatal outcomes. Finally, readily available and easy-to-use online data resources will be provided so that obstetricians and gynecologists will be able to assess geographic variation in health indicators and outcomes in their own localities."
11682918	Given the longevity achievable with current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for persons with HIV infection, quality of life (QOL) has emerged as a significant medical outcome measure, and its enhancement as an important goal. This review highlights current knowledge about the relevance and complexity of physical, psychological, and social factors as determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected persons. Existing data suggest physical manifestations, antiretroviral therapy, psychological well-being, social support systems, coping strategies, spiritual well-being, and psychiatric comorbidities are important predictors of QOL in this population. Health care professionals are encouraged to become familiar with the full spectrum of predictors of HRQOL, which may eventually contribute to the development of multiple entry points for interventions in promoting QOL in these patients. Identifying variables influencing QOL among diverse groups, particularly women, injection drug users, and adolescents, and designing effective interventions specific to the social and psychological well-being of HIV-infected individuals are areas for research.
19204797	BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) conducted the World Health Survey (WHS) between 2002 and 2004 in 70 countries to provide cross-population comparable data on health, health-related outcomes and risk factors. The aim of this study was to apply Grade of Membership (GoM) modelling as a means to condense extensive health information from the WHS into a set of easily understandable health profiles and to assign the degree to which an individual belongs to each profile. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper described the application of the GoM models to summarize population health status using World Health Survey data. Grade of Membership analysis is a flexible, non-parametric, multivariate method, used to calculate health profiles from WHS self-reported health state and health conditions. The WHS dataset was divided into four country economic categories based on the World Bank economic groupings (high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low income economies) for separate GoM analysis. Three main health profiles were produced for each of the four areas: I. Robust; II. Intermediate; III. Frail; moreover population health, wealth and inequalities are defined for countries in each economic area as a means to put the health results into perspective. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses have provided a robust method to better understand health profiles and the components which can help to identify healthy and non-healthy individuals. The obtained profiles have described concrete levels of health and have clearly delineated characteristics of healthy and non-healthy respondents. The GoM results provided both a useable way of summarising complex individual health information and a selection of intermediate determinants which can be targeted for interventions to improve health. As populations' age, and with limited budgets for additional costs for health care and social services, applying the GoM methods may assist with identifying higher risk profiles for decision-making and resource allocations.
16288659	BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination are significant determinants of HIV transmission in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T), where the adult HIV/AIDS prevalence is 2.5%. T&T is a spiritually-aware society and over 104 religious groups are represented. This religious diversity creates a complex social environment for the transmission of a sexually transmitted infection like HIV/AIDS. Religious leaders are esteemed in T&T's society and may use their position and frequent interactions with the public to promote HIV/AIDS awareness, fight stigma and discrimination, and exercise compassion for people living with HIV/AIDS (PWHA). Some religious groups have initiated HIV/AIDS education programs within their membership, but previous studies suggest that HIV/AIDS remains a stigmatized infection in many religious organizations. The present study investigates how the perception of HIV/AIDS as a sexually transmitted infection impacts religious representatives' incentives to respond to HIV/AIDS in their congregations and communities. In correlation, the study explores how the experiences of PWHA in religious gatherings impact healing and coping with HIV/AIDS. METHODS: Between November 2002 and April 2003, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 religious representatives from 10 Christian, Hindu and Muslim denominations. The majority of respondents were leaders of religious services, while two were active congregation members. Religious groups were selected based upon the methods of Brathwaite. Briefly, 26 religious groups with the largest followings according to 2000 census data were identified in Trinidad and Tobago. From this original list, 10 religious groups in Northwest Trinidad were selected to comprise a representative sample of the island's main denominations. In-depth interviews with PWHA were conducted during the same study period, 2002-2003. Four individuals were selected from a care and support group located in Port of Spain based upon their perceived willingness to discuss religious affiliation and describe how living with a terminal infection has affected their spiritual lives. The interviewer, a United States Fulbright Scholar, explained the nature and purpose of the study to all participants. Relevant ethical procedures associated with the collection of interview data were adopted: interviews were conducted in a non-coercive manner and confidentiality was assured. All participants provided verbal consent, and agreed to be interviewed without financial or other incentive. Ethics approval was granted on behalf of the Caribbean Conference of Churches Ethics Committee. Interview questions followed a guideline, and employed an open-ended format to facilitate discussion. All interviews were recorded and transcribed by the interviewer. RESULTS: Religious representatives' opinions were grouped into the following categories: rationale for the spread of HIV/AIDS, abstinence, condom use, sexuality and homosexuality, compassion, experiences with PWHA, recommendations and current approach to addressing HIV/AIDS in congregations. Religious representatives expressed a measure of acceptance of HIV/AIDS and overwhelmingly upheld compassion for PWHA. Some statements, however, suggested that HIV/AIDS stigma pervades Trinidad's religious organizations. For many representatives, HIV/AIDS was associated with a promiscuous lifestyle and/or homosexuality. Representatives had varying levels of interaction with PWHA, but personal experiences were positively associated with current involvement in HIV/AIDS initiatives. All 4 PWHA interviewed identified themselves as belonging to Christian denominations. Three out of the 4 PWHA described discriminatory experiences with pastors or congregation members during gatherings for religious services. Nonetheless, PWHA expressed an important role for faith and religion in coping with HIV. CONCLUSION: Religious groups in Trinidad are being challenged to promote a clear and consistent response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; a response that may reflect personal experiences and respect religious doctrine in the context of sex and sexuality. The study suggests that (1) religious leaders could improve their role in the fight against HIV/AIDS with education and sensitization-specifically aimed at dismantling the myths about HIV transmission, and the stereotyping of susceptible sub-populations, and (2) a consultative dialogue between PWHAs and religious leaders is pivotal to a successful faith-based HIV intervention in Trinidad.
26318949	Recently, a new research agenda emphasizing interactions between social factors and health has emerged. The term social determinant of health often refers to any nonmedical factor directly influencing health. Health across the life span is strongly and adversely affected by social disadvantage. Research in epigenetics indicates that alterations in DNA methylation may provide a causal link between social adversity and health disparity. Likewise, accelerated loss of telomeres is correlated with chronic stress. Research is still required to develop an understanding of the role of epigenetics and perturbed telomere function in linking social adversity with health outcome.
20693904	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent research that delineates predictors of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. RECENT FINDINGS: Many mothers find it difficult to meet personal goals and follow expert recommendations for continued and exclusive breastfeeding despite increased rates of initiation. Recent studies have revealed varied sociodemographic, biomedical, and psychosocial determinants of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. SUMMARY: In order to help mothers meet personal goals and expert recommendations for breastfeeding, pediatricians should educate themselves regarding predictors of and barriers to successful breastfeeding. Once these predictors and barriers have been identified, targeted anticipatory guidance can be provided to help mothers achieve breastfeeding success.
12604477	"The author traces the development of the concept of health promotion from 1980s policies of the World Health Organization. Two approaches that signify the modernization of public health are outlined in detail: the European Health for All targets and the settings approach. Both aim to reorient health policy priorities from a risk factor approach to strategies that address the determinants of health and empower people to participate in improving the health of their communities. These approaches combine classic public health dictums with ""new"" strategies, some setting explicit goals to integrate public health with general welfare policy. Health for All, health promotion, and population health have contributed to this reorientation in thinking and strategy, but the focus of health policy remains expenditure rather than investment."
27588360	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether the score of self-reported medication adherence using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5) correlates with the serum level of antiepileptic medication, as well as whether the MARS-5 score can predict the quality of life (QoL) in patients with epilepsy. METHODS: A longitudinal study was carried out. The patients with epilepsy who were prescribed a minimum of one antiepileptic drug were recruited (n=807). Each participant completed a background information sheet and the MARS-5 at baseline, followed by the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) questionnaire at 18-month follow-up. In addition, the serum level of antiepileptic medications was measured at the follow-up. RESULTS: The MARS-5 score was negatively associated with the LSSS score (B=-0.089, SE=0.009, p<0.001) and positively correlated with the serum level of antiepileptic medications (B=3.200, SE=0.416, p<0.001), after adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics. The serum level of antiepileptic drugs was significantly correlated with the overall QOLIE-31 score (B=3.118, SE=1.417, p=0.03). The MARS-5 score was significantly correlated with the overall QOLIE-31 scores and all the scores in the subcategories. In addition, the MARS-5 score was in line with the correlation between the LSSS and QOLIE-31 scores (Z=4.20, p<0.001) and between serum antiepileptic medication levels and QOLIE-31 score (Z=3.98, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The MARS-5 score can predict the QoL in patients with epilepsy for up to 18months. Therefore, healthcare providers may predict the QoL and drug adherence using the MARS-5 score, in order to design personalized interventions.
23561030	BACKGROUND: China has made impressive progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for maternal and reproductive health, but ensuring that progress reaches all segments of the population remains a challenge for policy makers. The aim of this review is to map disadvantaged populations in terms of maternal health in China, and to explain the causes of these inequities to promote policy action. METHODS: We searched PUBMED, Popline, Proquest and WanFang and included primary studies conducted in mainland China. Experts were also contacted to identify additional studies. Disadvantaged populations in terms of MDG 5 and the reasons for this disadvantage explored by authors were identified and coded based on the conceptual framework developed by the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. RESULTS: In China, differences in maternal health service utilization and the maternal mortality ratio among different income groups, and among regions with different socio-economic development still exist, although these differences are narrowing. Groups with low levels of education and ethnic minorities utilize maternal health care less frequently and experience higher maternal mortality, although we could not determine whether these differences have changed in the last decade. Rural-to-urban migrants use maternal health care and contraception to a lower extent than permanent residents of cities, and differential maternal mortality shows a widening trend among these groups. Gender inequity also contributes to the disadvantaged position of women. Intermediary factors that explain these inequities include material circumstances such as long distances to health facilities for women living in remote areas, behavioral factors such as traditional beliefs that result in reduced care seeking among ethnic minorities, and health system determinants such as out-of-pocket payments posing financial barriers for the poor. CONCLUSIONS: Inequity in maternal health continues to be an issue worthy of greater programmatic and monitoring efforts in China.
19997790	BACKGROUND: Little is known about psychosocial mechanisms that may underlie differences in lifestyle change between socioeconomic groups. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine how educational level influences middle-aged participants' (N = 385) psychosocial responses to the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial. METHODS: The measurements of self-efficacy and planning for healthy lifestyle were conducted pre-intervention (T1) and post-intervention (T2, 3 months), and measurements of exercise and healthy eating as outcomes at T1 and at 12 months (T3). RESULTS: Psychosocial determinants at T1 and their T1-T2 changes were mostly similar, irrespective of educational levels. Exercise barriers self-efficacy was enhanced slightly less (p = 0.08) among the low-SES. T2 levels as well as pre-post-intervention changes in exercise self-efficacy predicted 12-month changes in exercise, and T2 diet coping planning predicted changes in dietary fat intake. The associations were similar across all SES groups. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing self-efficacy and planning is similarly effective among intervention participants regardless of education level.
18083444	BACKGROUND: Low educational attainment is a marker of socioeconomic status that correlates strongly with higher death rates from many conditions. No previous studies have analyzed national data to measure the number of deaths associated with lower education among working-aged adults (25-64 years) by race or ethnicity. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined comprehensively the relationship of education to cause-specific and all-cause mortality in the three largest racial or ethnic groups in the United States using national data. METHODS: Age-standardized, race/ethnicity-specific death rates from all causes and the 15 leading causes were measured among men and women aged 25-64 years by level of education based on U.S. national mortality data in 2001. The total number of deaths that potentially could be avoided among people aged 25-64 years was estimated by applying the mortality rates among college graduates (within each 5-year category of age, gender, and race/ethnicity) to each of the less-educated subpopulations. All analyses were performed in 2007. RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of all deaths among men aged 25-64 years (white, black, and Hispanic), and 38% of all deaths in women would not have occurred in this age range if all segments of the population experienced the death rates of college graduates. Black men and women had the highest death rates from all causes combined and from many specific causes at nearly all levels of education, and the largest average life years lost before age 65 years. However, the total number of deaths associated with low education status was not confined to any single racial group. About 161,280 deaths in whites, 40,840 deaths in blacks, and 13,162 deaths in Hispanics in this age range were associated with educational disparity. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially avoidable factors associated with lower educational status account for almost half of all deaths among working-aged adults in the U.S.; these deaths are not confined to any single racial or ethnic group. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to social determinants of health.
25838552	This study investigated sun protective behavior during snow sports and its psychosocial determinants. A longitudinal study was conducted among 418 Dutch adults who planned to go on a ski holiday. Participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire before and after their ski trip. In the baseline questionnaire several psychosocial factors were measured (i.e. knowledge, risk perception, worry, attitude, social influence, self-efficacy and intention). At follow-up, sunscreen use and frequency of sunburns were measured. The results showed that, despite their generally high intention, a substantial part of the respondents (40%) did not use sunscreen adequately during their ski holiday. Furthermore, one-fourth of the respondents reported at least one sunburn during their ski holiday. Men and younger respondents used sunscreen less frequently and were sunburnt more often. Sunscreen use was predicted by a positive attitude, high self-efficacy levels, high intention, high knowledge and high perceived risk. The background and psychosocial variables explained 32% of the total variance of sunscreen use. Suggestions for future research and interventions are discussed.
30276636	OBJECTIVE: For patients who belonged to physician rosters at a family medicine practice in the core of Calgary, Canada, we compared primary care utilization for those who were stably housed and those experiencing homelessness. METHODS: This retrospective chart review accessed electronic medical record data for rostered patients who visited their family physician between July 1, 2015 and August 31, 2016. We assessed the association between homelessness status (defined as having been sheltered in overnight shelters and/or emergency/provisional housing during the study period) and the rate of visits to primary care (defined as the count of visits associated with a patient accounting for the length of the patient's relationship with their family physician) using multivariate negative binomial regression. RESULTS: We analyzed 1013 patients belonging to three family physician rosters, of whom 112 experienced homelessness during the study period (11.1%). The mean number of visits for patients who experienced homelessness was 9.6 (SD 10.5), compared to 4.2 (SD 3.6) visits for stably housed patients (p < 0.0001). The rate of accessing primary care for patients experiencing homelessness was 2.02 times greater than the rate for stably housed individuals (rate ratio [RR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.74-2.35; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In the context of an inner-city primary care clinic in Calgary, Canada, homelessness status is associated with an increased rate of visits to primary care. This work has implications for public health and health systems decision-makers involved in developing equitable health policy, as well as for frontline care providers who serve this vulnerable population.
16380367	This paper reports on an exploratory study of nursing home bankruptcy. From state and industry data regarding nearly 1,000 California facilities, it was possible to identify 155 homes in five chains (multi-facility organizations) that were operating in bankruptcy in 2000. When compared with facilities in non-bankrupt chains, while the bankrupt chain facilities had significantly worse financial liquidity, higher administrative costs, and higher payables to related parties, they also had more Medicare residents, fewer Medicaid residents, better solvency, and were located in less competitive county markets and in areas with higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. These findings indicate that, rather than facility characteristics and local market factors, strategic decisions taken at the corporate (chain) level are the major determinants of nursing facility bankruptcy status.
19135287	Although individual factors have been shown to predict weight gain, contextual determinants have also attracted attention, with some authors stressing the role played by deprivation, urban sprawl, social capital and safety. Recent evidence has implicated environmental factors that facilitate the consumption of excess calories and/or make it more difficult to expend them in routine physical activity. The interrelationships found in some places between physical and social environments (key mediators) and body mass index (BMI), as well as the potential that exists for the development of healthier places, mean that more research is required into the contextual determinants of health. In Portugal, particularly in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), the effects of physical and social environments on physical activity and BMI have not previously been explored in any detail. This study aims to highlight the associations between residential (physical and social) environment and the risk of weight gain and obesity, over and above individual attributes, assessing which indicators are the best predictors of excess weight in the LMA. The study involved data from 7669 individuals aged 18 and over from 143 neighbourhoods. Self-reported body height and weight were used to define overweight body mass index (BMI> or =25). BMI and individual (socio-demographic and behavioural) characteristics were linked to contextual data and analysed in a multilevel framework. Our findings show that different environmental factors are significantly associated with excess weight and obesity, either directly or indirectly (e.g. health-related behaviours such as eating patterns and physical activity, which are key mediators), after adjustment for individual characteristics. The results suggest that a deeper understanding of these mechanisms is critical if we want to tackle the obesity epidemic, and that policies aimed at weight control and obesity reduction must address people and places in order to bear fruit.
28554157	Most research into the role of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of obesity has taken environment to mean behaviours such as exercise and diet. While interesting, this is somewhat at odds with research into the social determinants of obesity, in which the focus has shifted away from individuals and behaviours to the types of wider obesogenic environments in which individuals live, which influence and produce these behaviours. This study combines these two strands of research by investigating how the genetic influence on body mass index (BMI), used as a proxy for obesity, changes across different neighbourhood environments measured by levels of deprivation. Genetics are incorporated using a classical twin design with data from Twins UK, a longitudinal study of UK twins running since 1992. A multilevel modelling approach is taken to decompose variation between individuals into genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental components. Neighbourhood deprivation is found to be a statistically significant predictor of BMI after conditioning on individual characteristics, and a heritability of 0.75 is estimated for the entire sample. This heritability estimate is shown, however, to be higher in more deprived neighbourhoods and lower in less deprived ones, and this relationship is statistically significant. While this research cannot say anything directly about the mechanisms behind the relationship, it does highlight how the relative importance of genetic factors can vary across different social environments, and therefore the value of considering both genetic and social determinants of health simultaneously.
19648131	AIM: While many studies report determinants of adolescent cigarette smoking, few identify risk factors for nicotine dependence (ND). This study distinguished between risk factors for three hallmarks of ND including cravings, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance. METHODS: A total of 319 novice smokers were followed every 3 months from first puff on a cigarette until the end of secondary school. Outcomes included time to first report of cravings, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance. RESULTS: Female sex, inhalation, smoking a whole cigarette, weekly smoking, daily smoking and alcohol use each independently increased the incidence of the onset of cravings. Inhalation, weekly smoking, daily smoking and alcohol use predicted the onset of withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms, smoking a whole cigarette, monthly smoking, daily smoking and friends and siblings smoking increased the incidence of the onset of tolerance. None of parental education, impulsivity, novelty seeking, self-esteem, depression, stress, parental smoking, physical activity, or participation in sports teams was associated with the outcomes. CONCLUSION: The hallmarks of early ND are related to intensity and frequency of cigarette use. Avoidance of daily smoking may be particularly important in preventing the onset of ND symptoms and sustained smoking.
15919199	The effect of age on breast cancer survival is still a matter of controversy. Breast cancer in young women is thought to be more aggressive and to have worse prognosis but results from clinical research have been neither consistent nor definitive. In this study, we have assessed the impact of young age at diagnosis on tumor characteristics, treatment and survival of breast cancer. The study included 82 very young (< or = 35 years), 790 young (36-49), and 2125 older (50-69) women recorded between 1990 and 2001 at the Geneva Cancer Registry. Very young and young patients had more often stage II cancers (P = 0.009), poorly differentiated (P < 0.001) and estrogen receptor negative (P < 0.001) tumors. They were also more likely to receive chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and less likely to receive hormonal therapy (P < 0.001). Specific five-year survival was not different in the three groups (91%, 90%, and 89% for very young, young and older, respectively). When adjusting for all prognostic variables, age was not significantly related to mortality from breast cancer with a hazard ratio of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.3-2.0) for very young and 1.1 (95% CI: 0.8-1.4) for young patients compared to older women. Tumor stage, differentiation, estrogen receptor status, surgery, and radiotherapy were all independent determinants of breast cancer prognosis. We conclude that age is not an independent prognostic factor when accounting for breast tumor characteristics and treatment.
30211265	Residence can affect various aspects of ones physical, psychological and social health. Therefore, the present dataset aimed to assess the level of rural housewives' awareness and attitudes towards the importance of residence and its compliance with health standards. To collect the present dataset, four villages were selected from the Gilan-e-Gharb township using the randomized cluster sampling method, then 25 subjects were chosen from each village (totaling 100 altogether). Furthermore, the subjects' awareness and attitudes were measured using a researcher-made questionnaire, and the data were then analyzed using the SPSS Statistical Software Version 21.0. The obtained data demonstrated that rural housewives' awareness and attitudes towards the subject were significantly different in terms of education and age group (P< 0.05), but the opposite was true in terms of the variables of marital status and training by health practitioners (P> 0.05). Based on the obtained data, the awareness and attitudes of rural women towards the importance and necessity of health standards of residence were low and moderate, respectively. In addition, providing rural women with effective training in various ways to raise their awareness and attitudes is of prime significance.
15046963	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the personality dimensions, neuroticism and alexithymia, and the affective state dimensions measuring negative and positive affect significantly contributed to changes over time in the number of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) reported. METHODS: A total of 318 patients, presenting to their primary care physician with MUS, participated in the study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess to what extent neuroticism, alexithymia, negative affect and positive affect independently contributed to (1) increase vs. decrease in the number of symptoms reported, and (2) the presence of a consistently high number of MUS over a 6-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Negative affect was the strongest determinant of changes in the number of symptoms reported. In addition, low positive affect significantly contributed to changes in the number of symptoms over time. Next to negative affect, the dimension of alexithymia measuring difficulty in identifying feelings (DIF) was found to be an independent predictor of a consistently high number of MUS. Neither neuroticism nor general alexithymia independently contributed to changes in the number of symptoms over time or to symptom persistence. CONCLUSIONS: Negative affect is an important determinant of MUS, because it contributes both to symptom evolution and symptom persistence. Positive affect has a beneficial effect on somatic symptom evolution, whereas the alexithymia dimension measuring DIF clearly contributes to the prediction of symptom persistence.
21591847	This study described predictors of caregiver burden among parents of children with developmental disabilities. The sample, obtained from the 2005-2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs, included 12,225 children, aged 5 to 17 years, with a developmental disability. Structural equation modeling assessed the relationships between the factors of Caregiver Burden, Ease of Accessing and Navigating the Health Care System, and Unmet Health Care Needs. Caregiver burden was inversely associated with ease of accessing and navigating the health care system (beta = -0.094, SE (beta) = 0.045) and positively associated with unmet health care needs (beta = 0.428, SE (beta) = 0.036). Parents of poor, minority, and uninsured children experienced significantly greater caregiver burden. Bolstering services, particularly for vulnerable families, may ameliorate caregiver burden.
17855469	This article explores issues relating to the concept of social capital which has been become an important explanation for inequalities in health. It is based on an analysis of in-depth interviews with working class men living in two contrasting socio-economic areas--one relatively disadvantaged and one advantaged. It highlights the role of different community contexts in the nature and extent of local social capital. In particular, it demonstrates how de-industrialization and economic change as well as material deprivation and a perceived dis-investment in local communities impacted on the men's levels of social capital. Analysis also shows the ways in which gender mediates the processes through which social capital is developed and accessed as a personal and social resource, and how the norms and values associated with working class masculinities appeared to preclude the men from building supportive health-enhancing relationships with others in their community. The prominence of social capital has focused attention on the subjective dimensions of community life as potential determinants of health. This article has, therefore, sought to contribute to this field by widening our understanding about the relationship between social capital, gender and health.
29932219	Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Epidemiological studies using high-sensitivity assays for serum C-reactive protein have shown a consistent association between cardiovascular disease risk and serum C-reactive protein concentrations. C-reactive protein is a biomarker for inflammation, and has been established in clinical practice as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease events. There is evidence that serum C-reactive protein is an excellent biomarker of cardiovascular disease and is also an independent and strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events. Further characterization of the impact and influence of lifestyle exposures and genetic variation on the C-reactive protein response to cardiovascular disease events may have implications for the therapeutic approaches to reduce cardiovascular disease events. This review summarizes the studies that have examined the association between serum C-reactive protein and the risk of cardiovascular disease. We also discuss the impact of independent factors and C-reactive protein genetic polymorphisms on baseline plasma C-reactive protein levels.
21639878	BACKGROUND: Assessing the correlates of practicing physical activity during leisure time is important with regard to planning and designing public health strategies to increase beneficial behaviors among adult populations. Although the importance of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) is highlighted in many Western countries, there are not many publications on physical activity patterns, and even less on their correlates, in non-Western societies. The goal of this study was thus to explore the determinants influencing adults' leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in a city in southern Taiwan. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted in 2007, using a standardized questionnaire. Energy expenditure was dichotomized into two groups based on the recommended levels of moderate physical activity from LTPA: >/=10 or < 10 MET.hr.wk(-1). Logistic regression analyses were applied to the results. RESULTS: A total of 762 subjects with valid data took part in the study (mean age 53.8 +/- 13.8 years). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found the following results: Age was positively associated with LTPA. Adults with stronger perceived convenience of exercise facilities (OR = 2.04; 95%CI = 1.28-3.24) and past exercise experience in school (OR = 1.86; 95%CI= 1.19-2.91) participated in more LTPA. Subjects with more general social support (OR = 1.66;95%CI = 1.13-2.44), greater knowledge about the health benefits of exercise (OR = 1.85;95%CI = 1.25-2.74), more sports media consumption (OR = 1.94;95%CI = 1.26-2.98), and higher self-efficacy (OR = 3.99;95%CI = 2.67-5.97) were more likely to engage in LTPA. Further analysis comparing different sources of social support showed only social support from friends had a significant positive association (OR = 1.73;95%CI = 1.14-2.63) with increased LTPA. CONCLUSIONS: LTPA in southern city of Taiwan showed some unique associations with age, socioeconomic status and media consumption that are not commonly reported in the Western World and similar associations with regards to psychosocial correlates of LTPA participation. Further studies from developing countries are warranted to highlight culture-specific differences in physical activity participation.
18201163	ISSUE ADDRESSED: The high rates of mental health issues confronting Indigenous populations make it imperative that action to promote mental health and prevent the development of mental health problems is effective. An accumulating evidence base for mental health promotion now exists; however, it remains significantly underdeveloped for Indigenous groups. METHODS: This paper outlines the key findings of a systematic review of the literature undertaken to identify attributes of effective Indigenous mental health promotion interventions. RESULTS: Conclusive evidence of the efficacy of Indigenous mental health promotion interventions could not be determined because the evidence base is limited. However, this review did highlight several important findings. First, there were few well-conducted intervention evaluations; in many, the design was weak and insufficient information was supplied to assess effectiveness. Second, Indigenous mental health promotion initiatives commonly focused on individual behaviour change, rather than the broader social, ecological or policy determinants. Third, many interventions involved extensive Indigenous participation, thus supporting cultural relevance and community involvement, essential for the future of Indigenous mental health promotion. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence about effective mental health promotion and prevention interventions for Indigenous populations.
20670346	AIMS: This paper reviews a set of theories of behaviour change that are used outside the field of addiction and considers their relevance for this field. METHODS: Ten theories are reviewed in terms of (i) the main tenets of each theory, (ii) the implications of the theory for promoting change in addictive behaviours and (iii) studies in the field of addiction that have used the theory. An augmented feedback loop model based on Control Theory is used to organize the theories and to show how different interventions might achieve behaviour change. RESULTS: Briefly, each theory provided the following recommendations for intervention: Control Theory: prompt behavioural monitoring, Goal-Setting Theory: set specific and challenging goals, Model of Action Phases: form 'implementation intentions', Strength Model of Self-Control: bolster self-control resources, Social Cognition Models (Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Health Belief Model): modify relevant cognitions, Elaboration Likelihood Model: consider targets' motivation and ability to process information, Prototype Willingness Model: change perceptions of the prototypical person who engages in behaviour and Social Cognitive Theory: modify self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: There are a range of theories in the field of behaviour change that can be applied usefully to addiction, each one pointing to a different set of modifiable determinants and/or behaviour change techniques. Studies reporting interventions should describe theoretical basis, behaviour change techniques and mode of delivery accurately so that effective interventions can be understood and replicated.
11042429	The study aimed to determine the factors associated with a delay in seeking health care for symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among a sample of 1482 patients attending STD clinics. Of the sample 78% were male, 58% sought help from the clinic within the first 6 days of noticing symptoms, 24% waited between 7 and 10 days and 17% waited longer than 10 days before seeking health care. Patients who delayed were those who treated themselves prior to seeking health care, who were female, whose friends waited before seeking treatment, who held misconceptions regarding the cause of STDs, who perceived STDs not to be serious and who valued personal autonomy in sexual behaviours less and had less positive outcome expectations of refusing sex. The data suggest that targeted interventions should be directed specifically at women and the youth. Early health care seeking could be facilitated through improved basic knowledge regarding STDs, control over one's own sexual behaviour and social support for early health care seeking.
30552038	OBJECTIVE: The association between socioeconomic status (SES) and outcome after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is largely unknown. This study aimed to determine the influence of SES on postoperative survival after AAA repair. METHODS: Patients undergoing surgical treatment of AAA at a tertiary referral center between January 1993 and July 2013 were retrospectively collected. Thirty-day postoperative mortality and long-term mortality were documented through medical record review and the Michigan Social Security Death Index. SES was quantified using the neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), which is a standardized and reproducible index used in research that summarizes eight domains of socioeconomic deprivation and is based on census tracts derived from patients' individual addresses. The association between SES and survival was studied by univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 767 patients were included. The mean age was 73 years; 80% were male, 77% were white, and 20% were African American. There was no difference in SES of patients who underwent open vs endovascular repair of AAA (P = .489). The average NDI was -0.18 (minimum, -1.47; maximum, 2.35). After adjusting for the variables that were significant on univariable analysis (age, medical comorbidities, length of stay, and year of surgery), the association between NDI and long-term mortality was significant (P = .021; hazard ratio, 1.21 [1.05-1.37]). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term mortality after AAA repair is associated with SES. Further studies are required to assess which risk factors (behavioral, psychosocial) are responsible for this decreased long-term survival in low SES patients after AAA repair.
30903484	Black men are more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with White men. Despite advances in prevention and treatment strategies, disparities in prostate cancer among Black men persist. While research on the causes of higher incidence and mortality is ongoing, there is limited evidence in the existing literature that clearly speaks to the potential psychological or social factors that may contribute to disparities in prostate cancer incidence. Given the lack of attention to this issue, we review scientific evidence of the ways in which social factors, including socioeconomic status and racial segregation, as well as psychological factors, like depression and anxiety, are related to subsequent prostate cancer risk, which could occur through behavioral and biological processes. Our objective is to illuminate psychosocial factors and their context, using a racial disparity lens, which suggests opportunities for future research on the determinants of prostate cancer. Ultimately, we aim to contribute to a robust research agenda for the development of new prostate cancer prevention measures to reduce racial disparities.
17473623	This study aimed to establish the determinants of health-related quality of life in a rural and an urban sample of Xhosa-speaking people with disability. The sample was a convenience sample and was identified through a 'snowballing' process initiated by enumerators who were all members of Disabled People South Africa. The Xhosa version of the EQ-5D was utilized and the visual analogue scale which ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) was used as the dependent measure. The sample consisted of 244 rural and 61 urban respondents, demonstrating a preponderance of physical disabilities. The urban sample reported more problems in each of the descriptor domains. The visual analogue scale score showed a bimodal distribution. The results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the presence of pain detracted most from health-related quality of life (-20%), followed by anxiety and depression (-10%), and difficulty with performance of usual activities (-10%). Rural participants, with the same impairment level, reported 8% poorer health-related quality of life. The mean visual analogue scale scores were low (in the 60s), and would indicate that the majority of people living with disability do not necessarily adapt to their functional limitations and continue to experience diminished health-related quality of life. The bimodal distribution, however, did indicate that some respondents enjoyed good health-related quality of life. There is a need to manage symptoms, particularly pain and depression, as these have a severe negative impact on health-related quality of life. The rural setting seemed to contribute to a worse perceived health-related quality of life. This effect needs to be factored in when evaluating programmes.
18576207	A multivariate model was developed incorporating various socio-demographic, social-environmental, and social-psychological factors in an attempt to predict suicidal ideation among Canadian youth. The main research objective sought to determine what socially based factors elevate or reduce suicidal ideation within this population. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth-Cycle 5 (2003), a cross-sectional sample of 1,032 was used to empirically identify various social determinants of suicidal ideation among youth between the ages of 12 and 15. Results reveal statistically significant correlations between suicide ideation and some lesser examined socially based measures. In particular, ability to communicate feelings, negative attachment to parents/guardians, taunting/bullying or abuse, and presence of deviant peers were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. As expected, depression/anxiety, gender, and age were also correlated with thoughts of suicide. Research findings should help foster a better understanding toward the social elements of suicide and provide insight into how suicide prevention strategies may be improved through an increased emphasis on substance use education, direct targeting of dysfunctional families and deviant peer groups, and exploring more avenues of self-expression for youth.
17278673	"OBJECTIVE: To promote multiculturalism among grade school students through drama education. PARTICIPANTS: Grade 3-6 students (N = 665) from 6 targeted schools including lead-class students (n = 158) representing each school. SETTINGS: Elementary schools in Windsor-Essex County, Ontario, Canada. INTERVENTION: In this non-experimental design study, group discussions conducted with each lead class to explore students' understanding of multiculturalism were developed into an interactive drama performance and performed for all grades 3-6 students in their respective schools. A follow-up drama workshop was offered to each lead class one week after the drama performance. All students completed a 7-item questionnaire before and after the drama performance and after the drama workshop. Pre-test and post-test data collected were analyzed using T-test and ANOVA to determine the effects of drama education on students' attitudes toward multiculturalism. OUTCOMES: Statistical analysis at 0.05 significance level revealed that both the performance and the drama workshop heightened students' awareness of racism, and instilled cultural respect through ""talking with others"", ""accepting others"", and ""believing that they can make a difference"" in multiculturalism promotion. CONCLUSION: Drama education was an effective experiential tool for promoting multiculturalism in a school setting. The key to promoting inter-racial harmony is to respect and accept individual differences and to broaden the social determinants of health by providing culture safety care."
27000198	Poverty is one of the most significant social determinants of health, and as such, it is imperative that nurses have an understanding of the impact that living in poverty has upon one's life and health. A lack of such understanding will impede nurses from providing care that is patient centered, treats all patients fairly, and advocates for social justice. It is essential that nursing educators assure that poverty-related content and effective teaching strategies are used in nursing curricula in order to help students develop this understanding. Several poverty-simulation tools are available and may be able to assist with development of accurate knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Unfortunately, little evidence exists to evaluate most poverty simulation tools. This article will provide an introduction to several poverty-related simulation tools, discuss any related research that evaluates their effectiveness, and make recommendations for integration of such simulation tools into nursing curricula.
27621437	In a globalized world, establishing successful cooperation between people from different nations is becoming increasingly important. We present results from a comprehensive investigation of cross-societal cooperation in one-shot prisoner's dilemmas involving population-representative samples from six countries and identify crucial facilitators of and obstacles to cooperation. In interactions involving mutual knowledge about only the other players' nationalities, we demonstrate that people hold strong and transnationally shared expectations (i.e., stereotypes) concerning the cooperation level of interaction partners from other countries. These expectations are the strongest determinants of participant cooperation. Paradoxically, however, they turn out to be incorrect stereotypes that even correlate negatively with reality. In addition to erroneous expectations, participants' cooperation behavior is driven by (shared) social preferences that vary according to the interaction partner's nationality. In the cross-societal context, these social preferences are influenced by differences in wealth and ingroup favoritism, as well as effects of specific country combinations but not by spatial distance between nations.
18569355	The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the merits of evaluating new public health campaign materials in the developmental phase using an experimental design. This is referred to as experimental pretesting. In practice, most new materials are tested only after they have been distributed using nonexperimental or quasiexperimental designs. In cases where materials are pretested prior to distribution, pretesting is usually done using qualitative research methods such as focus groups. Although these methods are useful, they cannot reliably predict the effectiveness of new campaign materials in a developmental phase. Therefore, we suggest when pretesting new materials, not only qualitative research methods but also experimental research methods must be used. The present study discusses an experimental pretest study of new campaign materials intended for distribution in a national sexually transmitted infection (STI) AIDS prevention campaign in the Netherlands. The campaign material tested was the storyline of a planned television commercial on safe sex. A storyboard that consisted of drawings and text was presented to members of the target population, namely, students between the ages of 14 and 16 enrolled in vocational schools. Results showed positive effects on targeted determinants of safe sexual behavior. The advantages, practical implications, and limitations of experimental pretesting are discussed.
31276017	As individuals age, they witness a decline in physical health and functional capacities. The presence of one or more chronic illnesses challenges their quality of life and general well-being, thus, impacting their abilities to function physically, psychologically, and socially. We investigated reports of general well-being in older Black males with chronic illness(es) in a study of N = 145 participants, aged 35 to 63, and identified as Black/African American male. Participants responded to items assessing general well-being; ethnic identity; self-esteem; active coping; the presence of chronic illness(es); and additional demographic, social and ecological characteristics. Analyses of responses indicated that marital status (beta = -.17, p < .05), ethnic identity (beta = -.34, p = .00), self-esteem (beta = .22, p = .03) are significant determinants of general well-being in Black males with chronic illness(es). Data further showed active coping (beta = -.41 p = .09) to be negatively correlated with well-being. We discuss the implications of results for the understanding of health outcomes among this marginalized population.
20948239	Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a worldwide common type of refractive error. It is a non-life-threatening disorder with huge social and economic consequences due to its increasing prevalence. Axial length (AL) is the primary determinant of non-syndromic myopia. It is a parameter representing the combination of anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and vitreous chamber depth of the eye. AL can also be treated as an endophenotype of myopia and may provide extra advantages in the investigation of its genetic basis. The study of AL will not only identify the determinants of eye elongation, but also provide aetiological evidence for myopia. The purpose of this review is to outline the current state of AL research. Epidemiological evidence, genetic determinants, the relationship with other eye components and relative animal models of AL are summarised.
16162117	BACKGROUND: Quality of life is a popular measure of outcomes and its widespread use has led to recent calls for a better understanding of the construct, emphasizing the need to build a substantial body of knowledge around what determines perceptions of life quality. Three widely reported and used conceptual principles are examined in this study. METHODS: Self-ratings of life quality and three likely determinants at an individual level (stress), an interactional level (social support) and a community level (neighbourhood belonging) were used. The study involved two groups of young adults from an urban community, one identified as having an intellectual disability (ID). RESULTS Young adults with ID rated their satisfaction with health significantly higher and intimacy and community involvement lower than the comparison group. Social support emerged as the strongest predictor of life satisfaction across both groups. CONCLUSION: The conceptual principles of subjective quality of life provide a useful framework to discuss findings and to stimulate further research.
23911764	The protection of catchment areas for drinking water quality has become an increasingly disputed issue in Australia and internationally. This is particularly the case in regard to the growing demand for nature based and rural recreation. Currently the policy for the protection of drinking water in Western Australia is to enforce a 2 km exclusion zone with a much larger surrounding area with limited and prescribed access to recreators. The debate between recreators and water management agencies has been lively, culminating in a recent state government enquiry. This paper describes the second phase of a three phase study to develop a methodology for defensible policy formulation which accounts for the points of view of all stakeholders. We examine general community, active recreators and professionals' views on the current policy of catchment protection and five proposed alternatives using a social judgement theory approach. Key attitudinal determinants of the preferences for policies were identified. Overall the recreators did not support the current policy despite strong support from both the general community and the professional group. Nevertheless, it was evident that there was some support by the community for policies that would enable a slight relaxation of current recreational exclusion. It was also evident that there was a significant proportion of the general community who were dissatisfied with current recreational opportunities and that, in future, it may be less easy to police exclusion zones even if current policy is maintained. The potential for future integration of recreational and water source protection is discussed as well as the benefits of community research in understanding policy preferences in this regard.
19655628	Global warming, the depletion of the world'snatural resources, and excessive consumer consumption in developed countries are determinants reshaping the way we live our everyday lives. These factors are rapidly giving rise to new ecological paradigms of environmental stewardship and in healthcare environments that express sustainable theories and practices. This has given rise to a systematic system for promoting and assessing the energy performance and efficiency of healthcare facilities known as Leadership in Energy Efficient Environmental Design (LEED), and a parallel certification program, the Green Guide for Heath Care. These developments are examined in direct relation to the functions of managerial ethics. A series of ten sustainability-based ethical dilemmas are presented. Each is examined in relation to the need to inculcate in future healthcare administrators a critical understanding and appreciation of the need to reposition contemporary healthcare organizations at the center--as leading civic participants and role models in relation to the emerging movement towards carbon neutrality in the healthcare industry.
17520162	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the social factors associated with self-reported emotional and behavioral problems among Greek adolescents. METHODS: At age 18, a population-based sample of 3373 Greek adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) questionnaire. RESULTS: The results from the multivariate analysis indicated that both lack of intimate friendships and not having parental monitoring were independently associated with problem behavior among both male and female adolescents. Engagement in sexual activities was significantly associated with higher YSR scores among both genders. Absence of academic motivation was associated with higher YSR scores in girls only. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that social factors, including negative family functions, lack of academic motivation and not having close friends, were associated with emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents and imply the need to develop a supportive social network for adolescents.
10982476	Informed probands are key actors for disclosing genetic information to their relatives when a mutation has been identified in the family. The objectives were to study women's attitudes towards the family disclosure of positive breast cancer genetic testing results and to determine the predictive factors of the diffusion patterns observed. A national multi-center cross-sectional survey was carried out at five French cancer genetic clinics during a 1-year period. Self-administered questionnaires were completed after the consultation by 84.5% (398/471) of women attending breast cancer genetic clinics for the first time. Among the 383 respondents who had at least one living first-degree relative to inform, 8.6% would inform none, 33.2% would inform at least one of them, and 58.2% would inform all of them. The sibship would be the most frequently informed blood relatives, sisters in 86.9% and brothers in 79% compared with mother in 71.4%, children in 70.4%, and father in 64.9%. Women of the family would be more frequently informed than men (P < 0.05). After multivariate adjustment, age, the fact to be affected by cancer, the number of daughters, and the emotional disturbance due to cancer in a close relationship were the main determinants (P < 0.05) of the diffusion patterns observed. The first step of the relatives' attendance to genetic counseling and the proband's willingness to disclose breast cancer genetic tests results was high in this study and was clearly dependent on the women's personal and emotional characteristics.
19161545	Child stunting, an outcome of chronic undernutrition, contributes to poor quality of life, morbidity and mortality. In South Asia, the low status of women is thought to be one of the primary determinants of undernutrition across the lifespan. Low female status can result in compromised health outcomes for women, which in turn are related to lower infant birthweight and may affect the quality of infant care and nutrition. Maternal autonomy (defined as a woman's personal power in the household and her ability to influence and change her environment) is likely an important factor influencing child care and ultimately infant and child health outcomes. To examine the relationship between maternal autonomy and child stunting in Andhra Pradesh, India, we analysed data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-2. We used cross-sectional demographic, health and anthropometric information for mothers and their oldest child <36 months (n = 821) from NFHS-2. The main explanatory variables of autonomy are presented by four dimensions - decision making, permission to travel, attitude towards domestic violence and financial autonomy - constructed using seven binary variables. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between indicators of female autonomy and the risk of having a stunted child. Women with higher autonomy {indicated by access to money [odds ratio (OR) = 0.731; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.546, 0.981] and freedom to choose to go to the market [OR = 0.593; 95% CI 0.376, 0.933]} were significantly less likely to have a stunted child, after controlling for household socio-economic status and mother's education. In this south Indian state, two dimensions of female autonomy have an independent effect on child growth, suggesting the need for interventions that increase women's financial and physical autonomy.
18785182	Individuals adapt to changes in their environment, such as food availability and temperature, by adjusting the amount of time spent in different behavioral activities. These adjustments in behavior should vary across age-sex class according to specific physiological and social needs. We studied the activity budgets of three social Japanese macaque groups inhabiting either vegetated or nonvegetated enclosures in order to compare the effects of access with vegetation, as both food and substrate on resting, feeding, grooming and moving activities over a 12-month period. Daily access to natural foods for monkeys in the vegetated enclosure seems to be largely responsible for the differences in daily time budgets of these three groups. Resting time in all three groups was longer than the time devoted to other activities. Resting and moving time in the two nonvegetated enclosures was significantly longer than in the vegetated enclosure. In contrast, feeding and grooming time was significantly longer in the vegetated enclosure. Seasonal variation in time spent feeding, resting and grooming was significantly effected by enclosure type. In all three enclosures, immatures, particularly females, spent more time feeding and moving, whereas adults spent more time resting. Significant monthly variation in time spent by age-sex class was noted only for feeding and resting. Interestingly, in the vegetated enclosure, time spent feeding on natural vegetation was equal to the amount of time spent feeding on provisioned food. This suggests that factors other than energetic and nutritional needs may be important determinants of the activity budget of the species. These results have important implications for the enrichment of captive primates and our understanding of the maintenance of activity patterns by primates in the wild.
17880688	BACKGROUND: Given the increasing importance of obesity in China, prevention interventions encouraging physical activity by middle school students are needed. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how a rapid elicitation method can be used to identify salient consequences, referents, and circumstances about physical activity as perceived by middle school students and to provide suggestions for interventions and quantitative research. METHOD: A theory-based qualitative study using a self-completion elicitation was conducted with 155 students from two middle schools in Beijing, China. Following the Theory of Planned Behavior, six open-ended questions asked students for their perceptions about performing physical activity at least 60 minutes each day: advantages of participating in physical activity; disadvantages of doing so; people who approve of participation; people who disapprove; things that make it easy; and things that make it hard. Content analysis revealed categories of salient consequences, reference groups, and circumstances. RESULTS: While the three most frequently mentioned advantages elicited from the students were physical health consequences (e.g., will strengthen my body (58.7%)), four of the salient advantages were not (e.g., will improve my grades (12.2%)). Parents were the most frequently mentioned social referent (42.6% as approving; 27.7% as disapproving) when students were asked who might approve or disapprove of their participation. Circumstances perceived to hinder daily physical activity included having too many assignments and not having enough time. CONCLUSION: While many of the beliefs about physical activity elicited from this study were similar to those found with students from England and the US, several were unique to these students from Beijing. The results of this qualitative research suggest that interventions to encourage physical activity among middle school students should address: perceived consequences of physical activity on academic achievement and other factors beyond physical health; barriers of not having enough time and having too many assignments perceived to hinder frequent physical activity; and parental approval. More rigorous research on psychosocial determinants with close-ended items developed from these open-ended data and with larger sample sizes of students is necessary. Research with parents and school staff will be needed to understand the perceptions of these stakeholder groups key to creating the students' social environment.
16442195	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of cognitive functioning, psychopathology, and severity of extrapyramidal side effects on community outcome in a group of Greek outpatients with schizophrenia. Participants were 40 outpatients with schizophrenia (25 men). Social adjustment was assessed with the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Severity of symptoms of schizophrenia was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Finally, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered in order to assess the following cognitive domains: executive functioning/set shifting, executive functioning/inhibition, fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, attention, visuospatial ability, and psychomotor speed/visual scanning. Total scores on the QLS were significantly correlated with negative symptoms, parkinsonism, and performance on the fluency tasks. Interpersonal relations subscale was significantly related with negative symptoms and fluency. No significant relationship was found between the Instrumental Role Functioning subscale and the PANSS, ESRS, or any cognitive domain. Scores on the Intrapsychic Foundation subscale were significantly correlated with negative symptoms and fluency. Finally, scores on the Common Objects and Activities subscale were significantly related with severity of negative symptoms, parkinsonism and visual memory. Our findings suggest that severity of negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, especially performance on fluency tasks and visual memory, as well as parkinsonism, are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia.
17348755	Health inequalities are no longer an issue only for developed countries. In recent years there is agreement that all countries present health inequalities regardless of their level of wealth. In low-income countries and especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the majority of the poor people live as well as their children, research on child health inequalities is still scarce. This review of evidence suggests that if Mozambique is to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) by 2015 further research on important determinants of disparities in child mortality is urgently needed.
17582668	Household surveys from the developing world consistently record a generally low level of illness reporting, but the evidence that substantial differences exist in illness reporting between income groups is scanty. In contrast, a huge gap in illness reporting exists between rich and poor countries. Medical anthropologists have highlighted the differential illness perception across income groups but little is known as to what extent economic variables do determine one's illness decision. In this paper, discrete choice theory is used to explain why some parents choose to report their children's illnesses more often than others in Nepal. An empirical model is developed that depicts illness-reporting decisions as a function of inter alia, price and income. Data are drawn from Phase I of the Nepal Living Standards Survey. The results suggest that income as well as the price that parents expect to pay on treatment of their children's non-chronic ailments determine their decision to report an illness, when controlling for other variables (price responsiveness =-1.16; income responsiveness=0.23; p-value=0.00). This behaviour is theoretically consistent as parents weigh the opportunity costs of their decision (here, choosing to report an illness). Its implications are broader and raise other questions, e.g., Can we explain the difference in illness-perception rates between rich and poor countries that have different mechanisms to finance health care?
18274042	Disasters have been and will continue to be relatively common events in the human experience, and they make important contributions to variations in population health. There is a need, therefore, for conceptual models that identify the social and ecological factors influencing post-disaster consequences on population health. This article presents one such conceptual model which links the health consequences of natural, technological, and human-made disasters to a set of nested socioecological factors. Specifically, we attempt to link post-disaster consequences to aspects of the global and local environment and to highlight the roles played by social and ecological factors, including the social infrastructure, cultural beliefs, demography, and underlying historical and geographical circumstances. Examples from existing population-based health and disaster research are used to illustrate and amplify connections drawn from the model. From an applied standpoint, the model suggests that the role of multiple contextual determinants in shaping population health is likely to be complex. Practitioners interested in mitigating the consequences of disasters should pursue strategies that improve the underlying determinants of health, as well as practicable population-based interventions that could be implemented rapidly.
24884891	BACKGROUND: This study ascertained gender-specific determinants of outpatient mental health (MH) service use for depression to highlight any gender disparities in barriers to care and explain how depressed men and women in need of care might differ in their help-seeking behaviour. METHODS: Data used in this study came from the Canadian Community Health Survey on Mental Health and Well Being, cycle 1.2 (CCHS 1.2) conducted by Statistics Canada in 2002 (N = 36,984). The sample was limited to respondents filling criteria for a probable major depression in the 12 months prior to the interview (n = 1743). Gender-specific multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out. RESULTS: The results showed that 54.3% of respondents meeting criteria for major depression had consulted for mental health reasons in the year prior to interview. When looking at type of outpatient mental health service use, males were more likely to consult a general practitioner and a mental health specialist in the past year as opposed to females. However, females were more likely to consult a general practitioner only as opposed to no service use than males. Gender specific differences in determinants associated with outpatient service use included for males, lower adjusted household income, and for females, a younger age, the presence of social support, self-reported availability barriers, the presence of self-reported suicidal thoughts or attempt and a poorer self- perceived mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Continued efforts to promote access to mental health care are needed for men and women affected by depression, and this, to target specific vulnerable populations and increase utilization rates.
18050152	This paper contributes to analysing and understanding the demand for (social) health insurance of informal sector workers in Kenya by assessing their perceptions and knowledge of and concerns regarding health insurance and the Kenyan National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF). It serves to explore how informal sector workers could be integrated into the NHIF. To collect data, focus group discussions were held with organized groups of informal sector workers of different types across the country, backed up by a self-administered questionnaire completed by heads of NHIF area branch offices. It was found that the most critical barrier to NHIF enrollment is the lack of knowledge of informal sector workers about the NHIF, its enrollment option and procedures for informal sector workers. Inability to pay is a critical factor for some, but people were, in principle, interested in health insurance, and thus willing to pay for it. In sum, the mix of demand-side determinants for enrolling in the NHIF is not as complex as expected. This is good news, as these demand-side determinants can be addressed with a well-designed strategy, focusing on awareness raising and information, improvement of insurance design features and setting differentiated and affordable contribution rates.
24188299	Measuring indicators of health status and demographics are essential in the population health approach. In Canada, sexual minority youth face increased risk for poor health outcomes in behavioral and mental health indicators, yet the health policy response has been severely lacking. The current population health approach exacerbates the social exclusion of a vulnerable, at-risk population. The authors examine health status through the social determinants of health to highlight the need for including sexual identity, attraction, and behavior in youth population health surveys. Additional interventions that address the social determinants of health are needed.
11522137	This ecological study investigated the associations between social deprivation, income inequality and social cohesion and dental caries levels in school children of the Distrito Federal, Brazil. Three sources of data were used: (1) area-based data from a 1997 social survey carried out on 13,000 families, (2) 1995 census data collected for the Government of the Distrito Federal (GDF), and (3) dental caries data from a 1997 oral health survey on 7296 6-12-year-old school children. Results of simple linear regression showed that percent with less than eight years of education (P = 0.03) and percent who did not have a maid (P = 0.009), were negatively statistically significantly associated with the percent of children free of caries. None of the deprivation measures were statistically significantly associated with mean DMF-T scores (P > 0.05). GINI coefficient, an indicator of social inequalities, was negatively statistically significantly associated with both measures of dental caries experience, percent of caries free (P = 0.003) and mean DMF-T scores (P = 0.01). Per thousand number of homicides or attempted homicides, an indicator of social cohesion was of marginal statistical significance associated with caries experience. Results of multiple linear regression analyses showed that only the Gini coefficient remained statistically significantly associated with both dental clinical measures used, after adjusting for potential confounding. In conclusion, relative rather than absolute levels of income were stronger determinants of the onset of caries in this study.
29663118	Urban health indicator (UHI) tools provide evidence about the health impacts of the physical urban environment which can be used in built environment policy and decision-making. Where UHI tools provide data at the neighborhood (and lower) scale they can provide valuable information about health inequalities and environmental deprivation. This review performs a census of UHI tools and explores their nature and characteristics (including how they represent, simplify or address complex systems) to increase understanding of their potential use by municipal built environment policy and decision-makers. We searched seven bibliographic databases, four key journals and six practitioner websites and conducted Google searches between January 27, 2016 and February 24, 2016 for UHI tools. We extracted data from primary studies and online indicator systems. We included 198 documents which identified 145 UHI tools comprising 8006 indicators, from which we developed a taxonomy. Our taxonomy classifies the significant diversity of UHI tools with respect to topic, spatial scale, format, scope and purpose. The proportions of UHI tools which measure data at the neighborhood and lower scale, and present data via interactive maps, have both increased over time. This is particularly relevant to built environment policy and decision-makers, reflects growing analytical capability and offers the potential for improved understanding of the complexity of influences on urban health (an aspect noted as a particular challenge by some indicator producers). The relation between urban health indicators and health impacts attributable to modifiable environmental characteristics is often indirect. Furthermore, the use of UHI tools in policy and decision-making appears to be limited, thus raising questions about the continued development of such tools by multiple organisations duplicating scarce resources. Further research is needed to understand the requirements of built environment policy and decision-makers, public health professionals and local communities regarding the form and presentation of indicators which support their varied objectives.
14986809	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of low socioeconomic status indicators, specifically parental educational and occupational characteristics on neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: Analysis of 3372 newborn infants admitted to five National Collaborative Perinatal Neonatal Network centers (1 February 2000 to 31 January 2002). Outcomes included birth weight, gestational age, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and length of hospital stay. The independent effects of mother's education and occupation as well as father's occupation on health outcomes were assessed by means of stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 271 (8.0%) infants were of low birth weight, 306 (9.1%) were preterm, 410 (12.2%) had NICU admissions and 240 (7.1%) were hospitalized for more than a week. After adjusting for maternal gravidity, age, smoking during pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications, parental socioeconomic characteristics had no significant impact on low birth weight or preterm birth. NICU admission and prolonged hospitalization were significantly correlated with skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled paternal occupations. Illiterate mothers had nearly 3-5 times the risk of NICU admission and prolonged hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Both father's occupation and mother's education play an important role as determinants of neonatal morbidity characteristics.
17374601	OBJECTIVES: To determine factors that independently predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 1 and 3 years after stroke. METHODS: Subjects numbering 397, from a population-based register of first-ever strokes were assessed for HRQOL using the Short Form 36 (SF36) 1 year after stroke. Physical (PHSS) and mental health (MHSS) summary scores were derived from the eight domains of HRQOL in the SF36. Multivariate stepwise regression analyses were conducted to determine independent predictors of these scores; beta coefficients with 95% CI were obtained.beta coefficient is the difference between average value of the variable (e.g. male) and average value under consideration (e.g. female). Demographic and stroke risk factors, neurological impairments and cognitive impairment (MMSE <24) were included in the models. Similar analyses were undertaken on 150 subjects 3 years post-stroke. RESULTS: A year after stroke, independent predictors of the worst PHSS were of females (beta coefficient -3.3: 95% CI -5.7 to -0.8), manual workers (-3.2: -5.9 to -0.4), diabetes (-4.2: -7.7 to -0.8), right hemispheric lesions (-4.9: -8.7 to -1.2), urinary incontinence (-7.8: -11.6 to -4.1) and cognitive impairment (-2.7: -5.5 to -0.1); the worst MHSS were associated with being Asian (-11.8: -20.6 to -3.0), ischaemic heart disease (-2.7: -5.4 to -0.03), cognitive impairment (-3.04: -5.8 to -0.3). Subjects aged 65-75 years (5.4: 2.5 to -8.4) had better MHSS than those <65 years. Three years post-stroke, independent predictors of worse PHSS were hypertension (-8.7: -13.5 to -3.9), urinary incontinence (-8.1: -15 to -1.1) and cognitive impairment (-8.3: -13.2 to -3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of HRQOL vary both over time after stroke and whether physical or psychosocial aspects of HRQOL are being considered. This study provides valuable information on factors predicting long-term HRQOL, which can be taken into consideration in audits of clinical practice or in future interventional studies aiming to improve HRQOL after stroke.
26404963	BACKGROUND: A large proportion of colorectal cancers are thought to be associated with unhealthy dietary and lifestyle exposures, particularly energy excess, obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. It has been suggested that these processes stimulate the production of toxic reactive carbonyls from sugars such as glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde contributes to the production of a group of compounds known as glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end-products (glycer-AGEs), which may promote colorectal cancer through their proinflammatory and pro-oxidative properties. The objective of this study nested within a prospective cohort was to explore the association of circulating glycer-AGEs with risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 1,055 colorectal cancer cases (colon n = 659; rectal n = 396) were matchced (1:1) to control subjects. Circulating glycer-AGEs were measured by a competitive ELISA. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusting for potential confounding factors, including smoking, alcohol, physical activity, body mass index, and diabetes status. RESULTS: Elevated glycer-AGEs levels were not associated with colorectal cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quartile, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.82-1.49). Subgroup analyses showed possible divergence by anatomical subsites (OR for colon cancer, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57-1.22; OR for rectal cancer, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.19; Pheterogeneity = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, circulating glycer-AGEs were not associated with risk of colon cancer, but showed a positive association with the risk of rectal cancer. IMPACT: Further research is needed to clarify the role of toxic products of carbohydrate metabolism and energy excess in colorectal cancer development.
11525391	The present article reviews research about the psychological determinants of human eating behavior. A hypothetical model of food choice and intake is introduced, presenting various factors influencing eating behavior. Internal factors include sensory food aspects. Among the external factors are information, the social context and the physical environment. Processes such as mere exposure, Pavlovian conditioning and social learning shape the relationships between these factors, food liking and eating behavior. The relative contribution of the various determinants is discussed. In spite of a scarcity of studies, liking for the sensory aspects of food seems to be at the center of the development, maintenance and change of dietary patterns. Consequently, efforts for promoting healthy eating behavior might benefit from an increased attention towards learning principles and food likes in the development of interventions. Existing intervention strategies are criticized and preliminary suggestions are formulated to enhance their effectiveness.
27236819	PURPOSE: To evaluate factors associated with a poor quality of life (QoL) of caregivers of Mexican cancer patients. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey of 826 primary caregivers of adult cancer patients at the Oncology Hospital of the Mexican Institute of Social Security. Dependent variables were physical composite score (PCS) and mental composite score (MCS) of QoL of caregivers measured by the Short Form (SF-12) of Medical Outcomes Survey questionnaire. Independent variables included general characteristics of the caregivers, their unmet needs, caregiving and characteristics of cancer patients. Multiple linear regression analysis for each QoL composite score was carried out. RESULTS: The average PCS was 48.7 and MCS was 47.1. Lower PCS was associated with older age, symptoms of chronic illness, depression and unmet personal needs, while concerns about the future were associated with higher physical QoL. Lower MCS was associated with anxiety, depression, unmet personal and emotional needs, and surgery in the last month. Caring for patients with a high global health status was associated with a higher MCS. CONCLUSION: Information about caregivers' QoL and its associated factors is important in order to identify and address modifiable factors. Also, studies from different cultures like Mexico are essential in order to identify possible generalities and particularities in QoL and its associated factors. Given the limitations of the cross-sectional design of our study, future longitudinal studies on the changes of Mexican caregivers' quality of life and their determinants will be an important step to further understanding these phenomena.

18590548	BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most relevant human opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Two strains (PAO1 and PA14) have been mainly used as models for studying virulence of P. aeruginosa. The strain PA14 is more virulent than PAO1 in a wide range of hosts including insects, nematodes and plants. Whereas some of the differences might be attributable to concerted action of determinants encoded in pathogenicity islands present in the genome of PA14, a global analysis of the differential host responses to these P. aeruginosa strains has not been addressed. Little is known about the host response to infection with P. aeruginosa and whether or not the global host transcription is being affected as a defense mechanism or altered in the benefit of the pathogen. Since the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a suitable host to study virulence of P. aeruginosa and other pathogens, we used available genomic tools in this model system to study the transcriptional host response to P. aeruginosa infection. RESULTS: We have compared the virulence of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 using D. discoideum and studied the transcriptional response of the amoeba upon infection. Our results showed that PA14 is more virulent in Dictyostelium than PA01using different plating assays. For studying the differential response of the host to infection by these model strains, D. discoideum cells were exposed to either P. aeruginosa PAO1 or P. aeruginosa PA14 (mixed with an excess of the non-pathogenic bacterium Klebsiella aerogenes as food supply) and after 4 hours, cellular RNA extracted. A three-way comparison was made using whole-genome D. discoideum microarrays between RNA samples from cells treated with the two different strains and control cells exposed only to K. aerogenes. The transcriptomic analyses have shown the existence of common and specific responses to infection. The expression of 364 genes changed in a similar way upon infection with one or another strain, whereas 169 genes were differentially regulated depending on whether the infecting strain was either P. aeruginosa PAO1 or PA14. Effects on metabolism, signalling, stress response and cell cycle can be inferred from the genes affected. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pathogenic Pseudomonas strains invoke both a common transcriptional response from Dictyostelium and a strain specific one, indicating that the infective process of bacterial pathogens can be strain-specific and is more complex than previously thought.
16732741	The aim of this study was to test whether the association between disability and depressive symptoms in patients with cervicogenic headache is similar to that found in primary headaches or to the pattern found in low back pain. During a 2-year period, 716 consecutive patients with the clinical diagnosis of cervicogenic headache (n=182), low back pain (n=116), migraine (n=231), tension-type headache (n=176), and cluster headache (n=11) filled in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Disability was scored by the migraine disability score questionnaire reflecting the number of days with lost or decreased work, household and social activities. Non-parametric tests and multiple general regression were used for statistical analysis. In multivariate testing, significant independent determinants of disability were pain frequency, pain intensity and the severity of depressive symptoms in migraine and tension-type headache; pain frequency and the BDI score in cervicogenic headache, and pain frequency alone in low back pain. Disability is related to pain frequency in all pain syndromes evaluated in the present study. The level of disability is associated with the severity of pain only in primary headaches, but not in pain syndromes of vertebral origin (cervicogenic headache and low back pain). Disability is associated with the severity of depressive symptoms in all headache types but not in low back pain. Both the location and the etiology of pain have importance in determining the interrelationship between pain characteristics, depression and disability.
29506400	The increased availability of treatment has not reduced the prevalence of mental disorders, suggesting a need for a greater emphasis on prevention. With chronic physical diseases, successful prevention efforts have focused on reducing the big risk factors. If this approach is applied to mental disorders, the big risk factors are adverse childhood experiences, which have major effects on most classes of mental disorder across the lifespan. While the evidence base is limited, there is support for a number of interventions to reduce adverse childhood experiences, including an important role for mental health professionals. Taking action on adverse childhood experiences may be our best chance of emulating the success of public health action to prevent chronic physical diseases and thereby reduce the large global burden of mental disorders.
15263980	"Data from Brazilian national surveys conducted since the 1970s have indicated an increase in the prevalence of overweight/obesity. The two most frequently cited causes of this trend have been dietary changes and reduction in physical activity, characterizing a ""contemporary Western lifestyle"". The objective of this paper is to identify and assess some indicators associated with changes in eating habits and physical activity patterns in the Brazilian population in the last 30 years. Despite the lack of detailed data, the following factors appear to play an important role in the process: internal migration; dining out; increased consumption of fast food; labor changes; transportation; and the use of home appliances. More information on dietary and physical activity patterns in association with anthropometric data on the Brazilian population are needed for a better understanding of each factor's role in these relationships. Meanwhile, inter-sector programs and projects with well-defined targets and outcomes are needed for the population's adherence to a healthier lifestyle, in order to control the increase in overweight/obesity."
30535198	BACKGROUND: Limited data have been available on the global practice of handwashing with soap (HWWS). To better appreciate global HWWS frequency, which plays a role in disease transmission, our objectives were to: (i) quantify the presence of designated handwashing facilities; (ii) assess the association between handwashing facility presence and observed HWWS; and (iii) derive country, regional and global HWWS estimates after potential faecal contact. METHODS: First, using data from national surveys, we applied multilevel linear modelling to estimate national handwashing facility presence. Second, using multilevel Poisson modelling on datasets including both handwashing facility presence and observed HWWS after potential faecal contact, we estimated HWWS prevalence conditional on handwashing facility presence by region. For high-income countries, we used meta-analysis to pool handwashing prevalence of studies identified through a systematic review. Third, from the modelled handwashing facility presence and estimated HWWS prevalence conditional on the presence of a handwashing facility, we estimated handwashing practice at country, regional and global levels. RESULTS: First, approximately one in four persons did not have a designated handwashing facility in 2015, based on 115 data points for 77 countries. Second the prevalence ratio between HWWS when a designated facility was present compared with when it was absent was 1.99 (1.66, 2.39) P <0.001 for low- and middle-income countries, based on nine datasets. Third, we estimate that in 2015, 26.2% (23.1%, 29.6%) of potential faecal contacts were followed by HWWS. CONCLUSIONS: Many people lack a designated handwashing facility, but even among those with access, HWWS is poorly practised. People with access to designated handwashing facilities are about twice as likely to wash their hands with soap after potential faecal contact as people who lack a facility. Estimates are based on limited data.
24520555	BACKGROUND: Puberty is one of the most critical periods in a female adolescents' life. This intervening study aimed to evaluate the effect of educational program for puberty health on improving intermediate and high school female students' knowledge in Birjand, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, 325 female intermediate and high school students were selected through randomized cluster sampling during several stages. Then, researcher-made questionnaire including 20 questions, each having one point regarding puberty health, was distributed. After completion of the questionnaires were gathered. Following this, under a systemic educational plan all intermediate and high school selected students were given the same instruction by trained instructors. Instruction time for each meeting was estimated 1.5 hours. One month after the educational program and handing out the pamphlets in schools, the previous questionnaires were again distributed among the students to fill out. At the end, 302 students who had filled out the questionnaires before and after intervention were studied. RESULTS: Out of 302 students, 151 were intermediate and 151 high school students. Knowledge level among intermediate students was 5.03 +/- 3.7 before intervention and was 10.8 +/- 4.8 after intervention. Among high school students, the scores were 4.1 +/- 2.3 and 8.7 +/- 3.8, respectively. There was a significant difference between pre and post intervention stages in both groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, mean knowledge grade in all the students increased from 4.6 +/- 3.1 before intervention to 9.7 +/- 4.4 after intervention (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Performing educational programs during puberty has a crucial role in young girls' knowledge increase. Since young girls often do not share their problems with their parents and their peers during the period, instructional classes in schools provide a good opportunity for them to present their problems and finding solutions.
17135105	Using data from the Community Tracking Study Household Survey (1998-99), we estimate the relationship between Medigap premiums and senior Medicare beneficiaries' supplemental coverage decisions. All seniors are more likely to be enrolled in an HMO in markets with higher Medigap prices. Lower income seniors are particularly sensitive to Medigap premiums and are more likely to have no supplemental coverage when faced with higher Medigap premiums. As Medicare supplemental options evolve in response to the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, it is important to consider that lower income beneficiaries may respond to price changes and other factors differently than their higher income counterparts.
16970785	BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to study the whole spectrum of birthweight in a population-based birth cohort in order to document the role played by social factors, which complement physiological and behavioural factors, in the development of birthweight inequalities at the population level. METHODS: The analyses were performed with data from the 'Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development 1998-2002 (QLSCD)'. The study follows a representative sample (n = 2103) of the children born in 1998 in the Canadian province of Quebec. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for gestational age and mother's age indicate that mean birthweight was higher for boys than girls; improved with birth rank, mother's body mass index (BMI), and family socioeconomic status; and was lower for children of smoking mothers. Compared with children born to non-smoking mothers of higher socioeconomic status, the odds of having a low birthweight were between 6 and 12 times higher for children born to smoking mothers of lower or middle socioeconomic status. When maternal smoking status and mother's BMI are combined, socioeconomic status could still be seen to have a positive effect on mean birthweight except for overweight or obese smoking mothers, among whom the relationship between socioeconomic status and mean birthweight was reversed. In families of lower socioeconomic status, maternal smoking was the most important factor in birthweight inequalities, and in families of higher socioeconomic status, mother's BMI was the most important factor in birthweight inequalities. CONCLUSION: This research is not only important for children in developed nations, but also for those in developing countries, where high birthweight and obesity are becoming more prevalent.
19157764	OBJECTIVE: To explore challenges to health promotion strategies against obesity, with special attention to the Scandinavian context. METHODS: Analytic induction, a procedure for verifying theories and propositions, based on purposefully selected literature references, with subsequent critical reflection. RESULTS: Health promotion efforts against obesity face challenges related to the unequal distribution of vulnerability to weight gain within the population, and to the complex neuroregulatory determinants that explain why obesity is not just a simple matter of lifestyle. Cultural understandings of identity and morality may create victim blaming and disempowerment, thus obstructing clinical health promotion strategies for weight control. Finally, the conceptual validity of obesity measurements and their predictive power deserves attention. CONCLUSION: Preventing obesity is difficult. Awareness of individual vulnerability and neurobiological mechanisms that lead to weight gain must be taken into account when strategies for health promotion are developed. These strategies must transcend a simplistic energy balance view. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinical health promotion needs to be highly individualized and tailored. Preventing weight gain requires attention to the person's sociodemographic, cultural and genetic characteristics. Cultural trends such as sedentary lifestyles and the nutrition transition should be counteracted without turning body weight control into a question of morality and inferior identity.
17176233	ISSUE ADDRESSED: If they are to respond effectively to health inequities, organisations involved in health promotion need to refocus on the social determinants of health (SDH) and the distribution of resources for health. METHODS: This paper examines the potential of health promotion foundations (HPFs), a semi-autonomous arm of the state, to act at several policy and program intervention points to address the SDH and reduce health inequities. CONCLUSION: The public purpose, enterprise and innovation potential of health promotion foundations provides them with unique capacity to respond to SDH. In the complex and contested policy environment surrounding action on the determinants of health, the role that foundations can most usefully play is that of a change agent in a broader social movement seeking health equity.
22888617	Although the rate of suicide is low in Muslim countries, there is evidence that it is increasing integrated analysis was made of data on suicide attempts (nonfatal and fatal) from studies carried out in the Islamic Republic of Iran from 1981 to 2007. Of 54 published studies concerning suicide, 48 (covering 26 768 cases of attempted suicide) satisfied the inclusion criteria. The weighted mean rate of suicide attempts was 26.5 per 100 000 and the average rate of death by suicide was 6.7 per100 000. The mean age of suicide attempters was 25 years; on average 41.8% were male, 50.5% single and 70.0% from urban areas. Most suicide attempters were not working: 54.2% on average were housewives, 24.5% students and 21.0% unemployed men. Medical history showed that 16.2% of suicide attempters had a history of disability and 42.0% had a history of psychological disorders. The rates were compared with studies from other nations/religious groups.
20025778	BACKGROUND: Substantial empirical evidence has demonstrated that individuals who are socially isolated or have few positive social connections seem to age at a faster rate and have more chronic diseases. Oxytocin is a neurohypophyseal hormone hypothesized to coordinate both the causes and effects of positive social interactions, and may be involved in positive physiological adaptations such as buffering the deleterious effects of stress and promoting resilience. The proposed research will examine whether and how oxytocin influences responses to stress in humans and will consider effects in relation to those of social support. METHODS/DESIGN: Experimental research will be used to determine whether exogenously administered oxytocin (intranasal) influences psychological and physiological outcomes under conditions of stress across gender and age in adulthood. Hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Oxytocin ameliorates the deleterious neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and subjective effects of stress; 2) Oxytocin and social support have similar and additive stress-buffering effects; 3) Oxytocin effects are stronger in women versus men; and 4) Oxytocin effects are similar across a range of adult ages. Hypotheses will be tested with a placebo-controlled, double-blind study using a sample of healthy men and women recruited from the community. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either oxytocin or placebo. They undergo a social stress manipulation with and without social support (randomly assigned), and outcome measures are obtained at multiple times during the procedure. DISCUSSION: Understanding the determinants of healthy aging is a major public health priority and identifying effective measures to prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases is an important goal. Experimental research on oxytocin, social relationships, and health in adulthood will contribute to the scientific knowledge base for maximizing active life and health expectancy. At conclusion of the study we will have solid evidence concerning the effects of oxytocin on stress response and whether it has similar effects across age and gender groups. A neurobiological understanding of resilience can inform efforts for both prevention and intervention of diseases or problems common in later life.
15602147	PURPOSE: Little is known about the contextual determinants for the maintenance of physical activity after cardiac rehabilitation. This study aimed to examine perceived social, psychological, and health-related barriers to the maintenance of physical activity among phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation graduates. METHODS: Researchers using an open-ended format asked 160 participants (121 men and 39 women) 6 months after rehabilitation to identify perceived barriers to physical activity maintenance. The content of the participant responses was analyzed through categorization and coding of data, with independent review used to assess accuracy and reliability of decision rules. A social ecologic perspective was used for secondary coding and categorization. A chi analysis of categories was conducted to explore differences by gender, ethnicity, education, and employment. RESULTS: Four categories were developed from the coded responses: intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental, and organizational. In their responses, 93% of the participants reported intrapersonal barriers, with 24% reporting interpersonal barriers, 18% reporting environmental barriers, and 11% reporting organizational barriers. Years of education contributed significantly to acceptance of an inactive lifestyle among those less educated (chi = 32.489; P = .028). Employment status showed significant differences for work as a barrier among those employed full-time (chi = 13.570, P = .004). Barriers to physical activity by gender showed significant differences for interpersonal barriers as a whole (chi = 6.804; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: The open-ended format provided rich narrative data regarding barriers to the maintenance of physical activity. The acknowledgment of barriers, particularly from a social ecologic perspective, is needed to guide innovative, multilevel interventions for promoting physical activity maintenance among those with diagnosed coronary heart disease.
29209745	PURPOSE: To investigate trends and socio-economic determinants of suicide in India over the period of 2001-2013. METHOD: Suicide rates between 2001 and 2013 were calculated using suicide statistics provided by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and census data provided by Census of India, stratified by sex, age group, and geographical region, to investigate trends in suicide over the study period. Multilevel negative binomial regression models were specified to investigate associations between state-level indicators of economic development, education, employment and religious factors and sex-specific suicide rates. RESULTS: Male suicide rates remained relatively steady (~ 14 per 100,000) while female suicide rates decreased over the study period (9 to 7 per 100,000). The age group of 45-59 years had the highest suicide rate among males while the age group of 15-29 years had the highest suicide rate among females. On average, higher male and female suicide rates were observed in states with: higher levels of development, higher levels of agricultural employment, higher levels of literacy, and higher proportions of people identifying with Hinduism. Higher male suicide rates were also observed in states with higher levels of unemployment. CONCLUSION: The process of modernization might be contributing towards higher suicide risk in more developed parts of India. Also, increase in farmer suicides since economic liberalization might be contributing towards higher suicide rates among more agricultural regions. Furthermore, ancient sanctions towards religious suicide are possibly still influencing modern Hindu suicides.
12474412	The economic analysis of efficiency of investment in health care and health at large by means of cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness techniques is the subject of implementation work in a number of countries. Poland's integration with the countries of the European Union justifies the need to understand and to use economic analyses. Unfortunately, these activities encounter many methodological and executive barriers. The investments in workers' health are not only investments in health care and the improvement of working conditions, but also in compensations, including financial ones, resulting from adverse effects of factors influencing the health of working population. The financial reporting system that exists in Poland does not ensure the possibility of full presentation of the aggregated data on the financing of activities for workers' health and diminishing of the adverse effects of factors present in the work environment. The information on the outcome of the investments in workers' health come from different sources, which means that it applies to different groups subjected to the analysis. The problem lies not only in the assessment of profitability of health investments but also in the social problem of the division of the resultant costs and benefits among various branches of the national economy. Therefore, the analyses involving mutual relations between individual sectors that invest in workers' health and those that bear consequences is essential in the terms of economic analyses. The authors present the determinants of economic evaluation in regard to health of working population in Poland.
23772124	BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the national Eye Institute refractive error correction quality of life questionnaire (NEI-RQL-42) among Iranian patients with refractive errors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two samples of patients (n1 = 296, n2 = 95) were consecutively selected from the eye clinic of the Boo-Ali Hospital, Qazvin. A forward-backward procedure was conducted to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Iranian version of the NEI-RQL-42. A homogeneity, stability, and reliability test was conducted for the first sample after a two-week interval. Convergent validity was computed using the correlation between the NEI-RQL-42 subscale scores, National Eye Institute-Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25), and the Short Form-36 (SF-36). Furthermore, Known-group analysis was performed, to determine the discriminant validity between the subgroups of patients with hyperopia, emmetropia, and myopia. Responsiveness to clinical change was tested by administering NEI-RQL-42 on the second sample that was scheduled for surgery. RESULTS: Homogeneity was satisfactory with the Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging between 0.70 and 0.92. The 13 subscales of the NEI-RQL-42 showed a considerable stability in intra-class-correlation (ICC) ranging between 0.70 and 0.89. Positive correlation coefficients were found among all subscales of the NEI-RQL-42 and the other quality-of-life instruments (NEI-VFQ-25 and SF-36). The NEI-VFQ-25 displayed excellent discriminant validity to differentiate the subgroups of patients, and was found to be responsive to change after the surgical correction at three months. CONCLUSIONS: The Iranian version of the NEI-RQL-42 is a valid and reliable instrument to assess refractive error correction quality-of-life in Iranian patients. Moreover this questionnaire can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in patients with refractive errors.
29439740	BACKGROUND: Inequality in life expectancy (ILE) is defined as inequality in the distribution of expected span of life-based on data from survival tables estimated using the Atkinson inequality index. ILE can be influenced by socio-ecological indicators including the Gini coefficient, secondary education, output per worker, and old age pension. This study examined the effects on ILE from a social ecology perspective. METHODS: This analysis is based on ILE data from 108 countries obtained from the United Nations Development Programme. Data on socio-ecological indicators were obtained from the United Nations database. The associations between socio-ecological indicators and ILE were assessed using correlation coefficients and multiple regression models. RESULTS: Significant correlations were evident between ILE and the following indicators from a socio-ecological perspective: Gini coefficient (GC: r = 0.335, p = 0.001) as an indicator of income inequality, female population with at least some secondary education (FSE: r = - 0.757, p = 0.001), male population with at least some secondary education (MSE: r = - 0.741, p = 0.001), output per worker as a measure of labor productivity (OPW: r = - 0.714, p = 0.001), and number of old age pension recipients (OPR: r = - 0.641, p = 0.001). In multivariate regression, the ILE predictors were higher GC and lower levels of FSE, MSE, OPW, and OPR (R(2) = 0.648, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Socio-ecological factors have an important effect on ILE. Policies that address ILE should consider targeted socio-ecological factors, such as the Gini coefficient of income inequality, that give a personal perspective of economic deprivation, attainment of at least a secondary education by both females and males that gives a social environment perspective, output per worker that indicates labor productivity, and the number of old age pension recipients that indicates social security from a public policy perspective.
28367933	ObjectiveDuring the two decades following Japan's World War II surrender in 1945, tremendous improvement in the population's health was observed, particularly in infant mortality and life expectancy. How did Japanese rural dwellers achieve such remarkable health improvement during this relatively short time span while its economy remained heavily damaged following the war? While the efforts from government-driven public health strategies and programs are well known, relatively little is known about the contributions of policies in non-health sectors. Therefore, the main aim is to verify, using literature based sources, whether non-health sectors contributed to the betterment of the population's health in addition to the public health sector policies.HypothesesSynergistic efforts of diverse interventions from different policies and programs likely catalyzed the drastic health improvement observed in the Japanese population in the two decades after World War II. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, for example, implemented programs to provide health care services. These are thought to have contributed directly to reducing maternal and child mortality, as well as tuberculosis-related mortality. Additionally, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry carried out a nationwide livelihood improvement program to enhance individual and family lifestyles, improve indoor and outdoor environments, and strengthen social solidarity. The ministry also attempted to generate income stability for farmers through an agricultural improvement program to ensure allocation of household income to family health. The Ministry of Education also had an initiative to disseminate the concepts of democracy and rational thought to the Japanese population through a social education program. Through these efforts, superstition and pre-modern customs were reduced, and subsequently health awareness increased, leading to an improvement in the population's health.ConclusionThe public health policies implemented in Japan as well as the integration of various policies and programs addressing livelihoods, economics, and education greatly improved the population's health in a relatively short time. These non-health initiatives intersected with a wide range of health determinants. Verifying these hypotheses in detail would help develop effective measures for international aid to poverty-stricken regions. It also encourages alternative ways through which Japan could overcome its present-day challenges such as a rapidly aging population with limited access to national schemes for social security.
21646585	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether characteristics of the social environment surrounding lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth contribute to their rates of tobacco use after controlling for established community-level risk factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Population-based study of youth. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 31,852 eleventh-grade students (1413 LGB individuals [4.44%]) in Oregon completed the Oregon Healthy Teens survey in 2006-2008. MAIN EXPOSURES: We created a composite index of the social environment in 34 Oregon counties. This measure included the proportion of same-sex couples, the presence of gay-straight alliances in schools, and school policies (nondiscrimination and antibullying) that specifically protected LGB students. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any tobacco use in the past 30 days. RESULTS: A more supportive social environment for LGB youth was significantly associated with reduced tobacco use (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-0.94). This effect remained robust after controlling for sociodemographic variables and multiple community-level risk factors for tobacco use, including median county-level income, exposure to cigarette advertisements, exposure to teacher and peer smoking in schools, and school smoking rules. CONCLUSION: This study documents an association between an objective measure of the social environment and sexual orientation-related disparities in tobacco use. These results highlight the need for structural-level interventions that reduce smoking behaviors in LGB youth.
25393088	OBJECTIVES: Determinants in the domains health, job characteristics, skills, and social and financial factors may influence early retirement through three central explanatory variables, namely, the ability, motivation, and opportunity to work. Based on the literature, we created the Early Retirement Model. This study aims to investigate whether data support the model and how it could be improved. METHODS: Employees aged 58-62 years (N=1862), who participated in the first three waves of the Dutch Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM) were included. Determinants were assessed at baseline, central explanatory variables after one year, and early retirement after two years. Structural equation modeling was applied. RESULTS: Testing the Early Retirement Model resulted in a model with good fit. Health, job characteristics, skills, and social and financial factors were related to the ability, motivation and/or opportunity to work (significant beta range: 0.05-0.31). Lower work ability (beta=-0.13) and less opportunity to work (attitude colleagues and supervisor about working until age 65: beta=-0.24) predicted early retirement, whereas the motivation to work (work engagement) did not. The model could be improved by adding direct effects of three determinants on early retirement, ie, support of colleagues and supervisor (beta=0.14), positive attitude of the partner with respect to early retirement (beta=0.15), and not having a partner (beta=-0.13). CONCLUSIONS: The Early Retirement Model was largely supported by the data but could be improved. The prolongation of working life might be promoted by work-related interventions focusing on health, work ability, the social work climate, social norms on prolonged careers, and the learning environment.
16088090	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The importance of careful theory-based intervention planning is recognized for fruit and vegetable promotion. This paper describes the application of the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol to develop the Pro Children intervention to promote consumption of fruit and vegetable among 10- to 13-year-old schoolchildren. METHODS: Based on a needs assessment, promotion of intake of fruit and vegetable was split into performance objectives and related personal, social and environmental determinants. Crossing the performance objectives with related important and changeable determinants resulted in a matrix of learning and change objectives for which appropriate educational strategies were identified. Theoretically similar but culturally relevant interventions were designed, implemented and evaluated in Norway, the Netherlands and Spain during 2 school years. RESULTS: Programme activities included provision of fruits and vegetables in the schools, guided classroom activities, computer-tailored feedback and advice for children, and activities to be completed at home with the family. Additionally, optional intervention components for community reinforcement included incorporation of mass media, school health services or grocery stores. School project committees were supported. CONCLUSION: The Pro Children intervention was carefully developed based on the IM protocol that resulted in a comprehensive school-based fruit and vegetable promotion programme, but culturally sensible and locally relevant.
11322845	BACKGROUND: A carbose is the first of a new class of antidiabetic agents, the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. This study characterizes and identifies predictors of persistence of use of acarbose. METHODS: Medical, pharmaceutical, and demographic records were extracted for 2 cohorts of patients (social assistance recipients and seniors) from the databases of Quebec's provincial health plan. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had received their first dispensation of acarbose between August 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997. The observation period included at least 1 year before the first dispensation and a minimum of 4 months after. RESULTS: New users of acarbose included 216 social assistance recipients and 677 seniors who were followed up for 82 914 and 270 041 person-days, respectively. Median persistence with acarbose treatment was 83 days (95% confidence interval, 75-105 days) for social assistance recipients and 105 days (95% confidence interval, 90-119 days) for seniors. In both cohorts, treatment by an endocrinologist vs another physician predicted longer treatment persistence. In the seniors cohort, additional determinants of (earlier) treatment discontinuation included a higher initial daily dose, previous treatment with insulin, and consultation with a gastroenterologist after treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: New users of acarbose showed low persistence in 2 cohorts of beneficiaries of Quebec's provincial health plan. Prescribing specialist was an important predictor of persistence in seniors and the socially assisted. The importance of 4 additional factors in seniors only led to hypotheses concerning population differences in treatment expectations and in the occurrence and tolerance of adverse effects.
10750165	"Aggression and stereotyped behaviors are not uncommon among people with intellectual disabilities and they are often treated separately as operant behaviors. In this single case study, it is argued that the function of a young woman's aggressive behavior appeared to be that of avoiding or escaping the termination of a chain of complex stereotyped behavior (or ""ritual""). She became aggressive only when this chain of stereotyped behavior was terminated and the aggression appeared to extinguish when it no longer led to escape from the termination of the ""ritual"". It is suggested that this is an example of a complex interaction between two behaviors and that it illustrates the need for very careful analysis of the functions of challenging behavior. Furthermore, it is proposed that the lengthening list of variables already documented as determinants of challenging behavior (provision of attention (verbal and physical), mechanical restraint, sensory or tangible events, escape from demands or from social attention, denials, escape from intrusive medical procedures, escape from task difficulty) be lengthened to include the possibility of escape from (or avoidance of) the interruption of a chain of complex stereotyped behavior or ""ritual""."
26147549	OBJECTIVE: The effects of social discrimination, job concerns, and social support on worker mental health and the influence of mental health on occupational health outcomes have been documented intermittently. We propose an integrated, theory-driven model to distinguish the impact of social determinants on work performance and injuries and the mediating effects of mental health problems. METHODS: The US Chinese immigrant food service workers (N = 194) completed a multimeasure interview; we tested the integrated model using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Mental health problems, which were associated with decreased work performance and increased injuries, also mediated relationships between job/employment concerns and both work performance and injuries but did not mediate the influences of discrimination and social support. CONCLUSIONS: This research reveals mechanisms by which social determinants influence immigrant worker health, pointing to complementary strategies for reducing occupational health disparities.
19488490	This evaluative study focused on expansion of the Family Health Strategy in large cities in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The study analyzed the functionality of health care modalities, performance, and supply of comprehensive care itself and its link to services at other levels. The thrust of the analysis was comprehensiveness of care in the daily routine of health services, with a focus on childbearing-age women, and with pregnancy as the tracer condition. The results emerged from an analysis of focus groups with health care users and health professionals, based on: characterization of key actors; their perceptions concerning health, healthcare model, and organization of primary care services and practices. The groups suggested that the actors perceive health as identified with social determinants. Access to services and actions was differentiated in the family health unit by enrollment of the clientele and active search, and the study showed the lack of a structured network. The study indicates that work processes contemplating the social determination of health and its intersectorality can lead to expanded access to comprehensive care for childbearing-age women.
15963873	"To better understand temporal trends in sexual behavior and their determinants, it is important to look at the demographic and technologic context in which we live; both affect sexual behaviors. Mental disorders and CSA emerge as important correlates of high-risk sexual behaviors. The changing role and expectations of women-the result of major economic and social transformation-transform society further through changes to family and community structures. These changes occur alongside increasing inequality and upheavals in the world, all of which are more visible through increased mobility and communication in the ""global village."" Changes in sexual norms, relationships, abuse, and mental health are better understood in the context of this broad political background."
10884643	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this investigation were to study determinants of apical periodontitis among Lithuanians who were 35 to 44 years old and to study possible associations between apical periodontitis, relevant general diseases, and perceived general health. STUDY DESIGN: Information was collected from a randomly selected sample, consisting of 147 individuals from Vilnius, Lithuania. Aspects of oral and general health, health-related habits and attitudes, and social parameters were used as independent variables, with various aspects of apical periodontitis as the dependent variable. Associations were tested by regression analysis. RESULTS: Apical periodontitis was highly prevalent in this Lithuanian population. Oral health-related variables showed the strongest association with apical periodontitis. Decayed and filled teeth scores were found to be strongly associated with periapical disease, and sound teeth were strongly associated with periapical health. In addition, behavioral variables were found to be important disease determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Apical periodontitis appeared to be an oral health problem closely related to dental caries. No association could be detected between general diseases and apical periodontitis, but an association between perceived general health and apical periodontitis was demonstrated.
19912448	BACKGROUND: In addition to their more clinically evident abnormalities of social cognition, people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) manifest perturbations of attention and sensory perception which may offer insights into the underlying neural abnormalities. Similar autistic traits in ASC relatives without a diagnosis suggest a continuity between clinically affected and unaffected family members. METHODS: We applied fMRI in the context of a non-social task of visual attention in order to determine whether this continuity persists at the level of brain physiology. RESULTS: Both boys with ASC and clinically unaffected brothers of people with ASC were impaired at a visual divided-attention task demanding conjunction of attributes from rapidly and simultaneously presented, spatially disjoint stimuli and suppression of spatially intervening distractors. In addition, both groups in comparison to controls manifested atypical fronto-cerebellar activation as a function of distractor congruence, and the degree of this frontal atypicality correlated with psychometric measures of autistic traits in ASC and sibs. Despite these resemblances between the ASC and sib groups, an exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of correlations across brain regions revealed a decrease in overall functional correlation only in the ASC group and not in the sibs. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish a neurophysiological correlate of familial susceptibility to ASC, and suggest that whilst abnormal time courses of frontal activation may reflect processes permissive of autistic brain development, abnormal patterns of functional correlation across a wider array of brain regions may relate more closely to autism's determinants.
28360010	According to the World Health Organization, mental distress and related illnesses are becoming leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Despite the influence of food insecurity on mental health, empirical understanding of this relationship in sub-Saharan Africa, where incidence of food insecurity is relatively high, is almost non-existent. This study contributes to the literature by examining the association between food insecurity and mental health in the Upper West Region of Ghana. We used Ordinary Least Square (OLS) to analyze cross-sectional data collected on household heads (n = 1438) in 2014 using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and the DUKE Health Profile. The results show that heads of severely food insecure (beta = 0.934, p </= 0.001) and moderately food secure households (beta = 0.759, p </= 0.001) were more likely to report elevated mental distress compared to those from food secure households. We also found that female household heads were more likely to report elevated mental distress (beta = 0.164, p </= 0.05) compared to their male counterparts. Our findings suggest the need to improve food security as a strategy targeted at improving overall mental health in the Ghanaian context.
30476092	Background: The economic crisis has induced detrimental socio-economic and health effects in Greece. This study aims to measure overall income-related health inequalities and examine their determinants, and to compare the respective within estimates for major subpopulations defined by citizenship (Greece, Albania, other countries) in Greece. Methods: Data for 1332 cases were collected from a cross-sectional observational survey (MIGHEAL) conducted at a national level in 2016. Income-related inequalities in poor subjective health, limiting long-standing illness, elevated depressive symptoms and non-communicable diseases were measured with the standard and Erreygers concentration indices. Decomposition analysis identified key factors explaining the inequalities. Results: Overall, significant inequalities favouring the better-off were established in all ill-health indicators, particularly in depression. Greek citizens were associated with consistent health inequalities, while, concerning the other groups, significant disparities were found only in depression for Albanians. Decomposition analyses identified socio-economic status, income in particular, as the main contributor to overall income-related health inequalities, followed by barriers to healthcare access, adverse family background and hazardous working conditions. Risk behaviours and discrimination were relatively less important, whereas area of residence was mainly reducing inequality. Citizens from Albania and other countries were found to be poorer, but with fewer health problems, hence, different citizenship decreased inequalities. Conclusion: Socio-economic health inequalities in Greece can be mitigated by means of appropriate multi-sectorial policy interventions, by focussing primarily on the most socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The overall inequality-producing mechanisms and the different health needs of ethnic groups should be taken into account when formulating such policies.
16277821	This paper discusses possible consequences of energy excess throughout the life cycle. Firstly we consider the effects of foods on hunger, satiety and satiation. Also, the changes in food availability and consumption in relation to changes in social and economic determinants of energy excess. The relationship between physical activity and energy intake (EI) is also considered. Secondly we explore the definition of energy excess and the metabolic effects of macronutrients (mainly in relation to fuel partitioning oxidation/storage) on energy balance. The cellular and molecular regulation determined by specific genes involved in lipogenesis, fuel partitioning and/or in energy dissipation are explored. Thirdly, we examine the main consequences induced by energy excess and positive energy balance, starting with the alterations in glucose utilisation (insulin resistance) leading to type 2 diabetes and the linkage of energy excess with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Biological, social and psychological consequences during perinatal, childhood and adolescence periods are specifically analysed. Fourthly, the transition from energy deficit to excess, under the optic of a developing country is analysed with country examples drawn from Latin America. The possible role of supplementary food programmes in determining positive energy balance is discussed especially in relation to pre-school and school feeding programmes. Fifthly, we deal with the economic costs of energy excess and obesity related diseases. Finally, some areas where further research is needed are described; biological and genetic determinants of individual and population energy requirements, foods and food preparations as actually consumed, consumer education and research needs on social determinants of energy imbalances.
31431474	INTRODUCTION: Previous studies suggest that childhood experience of parental adversities increases the risk of subsequent offspring self-harm, but studies on distinct paternal and maternal characteristics are few and it remains unclear how these interact with childhood social position. The study aims to assess whether paternal and maternal adversities have different associations with offspring self-harm in adolescence and young adulthood. Interaction by offspring gender and childhood income are investigated, as well as cumulative effects of multiple adversities. METHODS: The study uses administrative register data on a 20% random sample of Finnish households with children aged 0-14 years in 2000. We follow children born in 1986-1998 (n=155 855) from their 13th birthday until 2011. Parental substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, criminality and hospitalisations due to interpersonal violence or self-harm are used to predict offspring self-harm with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The results show a clear increase in the risk of self-harm among those exposed to maternal or paternal adversities with HRs between 1.5 and 5.4 among boys and 1.7 and 3.9 among girls. The excess risks hold for every measure of maternal and paternal adversities after adjusting for childhood income and parental education. Evidence was found suggesting that low income, accumulation of adversity and female gender may exacerbate the consequences of adversities. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that both parents' adversities increase the risk of self-harm and that multiple experiences of parental adversities in childhood are especially harmful, regardless of parent gender. Higher levels of childhood income can protect from the negative consequences of adverse experiences.
11938363	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of admitted patients and the patterns of their service utilization over a decade from March 1988 to March 1998. METHODS: Prospective data compilation using a structured questionnaire, hospital records and follow-up observations at King Fahd Hospital of the University in Al-Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 1366 patients (683 of each sex) had 2217 admissions in 10 years. By the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition criteria, 19.5% had schizophrenia, 15.2% bipolar disorder, 9.9% depressive episodes, 8.6% acute and transient psychotic disorders, 7.7% adjustment disorders and 7.6% dissociative disorders. Males were more frequently admitted for schizophrenia and females for mood and anxiety disorders. Most non-Arab expatriates were diagnosed as acute and transient psychotic, stress-related or dissociative disorders. Re-hospitalizations constituted 28% of all admissions. The mean length of stay was 25 days per admission and 41 days per patient. The overall bed occupancy rate was 84.9%. A subgroup of 16.9% of patients, mostly with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, consumed 62.3% of the bed occupancy. CONCLUSION: Gender and immigration were the main determinants of variance in patient characteristics, nosological distribution and pattern of service use. More beds are needed. Psycho-educational programs should be intensified to reduce the social stigma and societal intolerance to mental patients. Active family involvement improves compliance and might reduce re-hospitalization rates. Heavy service consumers should be transferred to long-stay facilities.
28575311	Adequate intake of copper and zinc, two essential micronutrients, are important for antioxidant functions. Their imbalance may have implications for development of diseases like colorectal cancer (CRC), where oxidative stress is thought to be etiologically involved. As evidence from prospective epidemiologic studies is lacking, we conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort to investigate the association between circulating levels of copper and zinc, and their calculated ratio, with risk of CRC development. Copper and zinc levels were measured by reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometer in 966 cases and 966 matched controls. Multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression and are presented for the fifth versus first quintile. Higher circulating concentration of copper was associated with a raised CRC risk (OR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.13; P-trend = 0.02) whereas an inverse association with cancer risk was observed for higher zinc levels (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.97; P-trend = 0.07). Consequently, the ratio of copper/zinc was positively associated with CRC (OR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.40; P-trend = 0.0005). In subgroup analyses by follow-up time, the associations remained statistically significant only in those diagnosed within 2 years of blood collection. In conclusion, these data suggest that copper or copper levels in relation to zinc (copper to zinc ratio) become imbalanced in the process of CRC development. Mechanistic studies into the underlying mechanisms of regulation and action are required to further examine a possible role for higher copper and copper/zinc ratio levels in CRC development and progression.
24097122	OBJECTIVE: We examined associations of organizational justice (OJ) and effort-reward imbalance (ERI) with burnout and intentions to leave the teaching profession (ILTP) among primary school teachers in China. METHODS: Six primary schools located in Wuhan, China, were randomly selected from three different socioeconomic areas in 2010. In total, these schools employed 533 teachers, and 436 of these (82 %) participated in a cross-sectional survey. OJ and ERI were assessed by 13-item and 10-item questionnaires, respectively. Burnout was measured using the emotional exhaustion subscale of the Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory. ILTP were operationalized based on the frequency of thoughts about turnover during the past year. Logistic regression-based odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for OJ and ERI. In a second step, these work stress scales were entered into the same regression model. RESULTS: Separate regression models suggested moderate to strong associations of OJ and ERI with burnout and ILTP. After simultaneous adjustment, the overall OJ score remained associated with burnout and ILTP, but ERI appeared to be the stronger and more consistent determinant of both outcomes. For instance, an increase of 1 standard deviation of the ERI score was associated with an OR of 2.60 (95 % CI 1.97-3.43) for burnout and with an OR of 2.26 (95 % CI 1.66-3.08) for ILTP. CONCLUSIONS: Organizational justice and in particular ERI appeared to be determinants of burnout and ILTP among primary school teachers in China.
18356195	BACKGROUND: Social class in childhood and in adulthood have been shown to be important determinants of risk factors in later life. Often the childhood information is retrospective and liable to bias. We use data from a family study of two generations of adults to investigate the effects of social class in childhood, adulthood and social mobility on risk factors. METHODS: In 1996, 2338 adult offspring of participants of the 1970s Renfrew/Paisley study took part in a screening examination. They provided information on sociological, behavioural and clinical risk factors, as their parents had done 20 years previously. Social class and father's social class were available, enabling their influence on risk factors to be investigated. RESULTS: Generally risk factors improved for offspring compared with parents, except for Body mass index and obesity, which worsened. Risk factors were less favourable in manual compared with non-manual offspring, and were more closely related to own than father's social class. There was a large amount of upward social mobility involving 35% of sons and 50% of daughters. Risk factors for the upwardly mobile tended to be more favourable than the class they left behind but less favourable than the class they joined. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitants of social mobility may reflect behavioural choices, such as smoking, and adverse factors, which are more difficult to leave behind. The relatively fast changes in social class profile may not be reflected in as quick changes in population health, as the upwardly mobile bring their earlier life adversities with them.
30627351	Background: Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) affects approximately 18 million children under the age of five and is associated with more than 500 thousand deaths per year. Existing research has indicated that a high number of caregivers of children admitted for inpatient treatment of SAM experience psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and suicidality. However, no published studies in Malawi have been undertaken to qualitatively explore caregivers' perceptions and experiences regarding their children's malnutrition and inpatient treatment. Aim: To explore caregivers' perceptions and experiences surrounding childhood acute malnutrition and the experience of inpatient care in Malawi. Methods: Interviews were conducted utilising a semi-structured topic guide and were coded using thematic analysis. Results: Caregivers (N=30) gave informed consent to participate in interviews. Caregiver understanding and perceptions of their children's illness varied. Some caregivers identified a physical cause, with a minority identifying lack of dietary protein. Other narratives were around characteristics of the infant, other circumstantial events and religious and spiritual influences. One-third of caregivers described their own health difficulties and marital and relationship stressors. Challenges such as poverty, lack of access to food, poor food variability and competing demands for caregiver time were explained. Both positive and negative experiences of family and community support and hospital-based care were reported. Conclusion: The themes identified contribute to a greater contextual understanding of the multifactorial and integrated approaches required to address malnutrition. This study indicates that healthcare providers need to take a multi-faceted view of malnutrition and be aware of the many factors that may influence healthcare experience and response to treatment. Acknowledging pluralistic belief systems may improve engagement with care. This demands a broader appreciation of perceptions and experiences of malnutrition, hospital-based care, sources of support and stressors within the caregiver, family and community environment as well as consideration of social determinants such as poverty and how these influences present within a clinical context.
18091003	BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent and disabling psychologic pathology. Longitudinal research on the predictors of posttraumatic stress symptomatology is limited. METHODS: We recruited 2752 participants to a prospective, population-based cohort study by conducting a telephone survey of adult residents of the New York City metropolitan area in 2002; participants completed 3 follow-up interviews over a 30-month period. Censoring weights were estimated to account for potential bias. We used generalized estimating equation logistic regression models with bootstrapped confidence intervals to assess the predictors of posttraumatic stress over time in multivariable models. RESULTS: Predictors of posttraumatic stress over time included ongoing stressors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91 per 1 unit increase in number of stressors, [95% confidence interval = 1.55-2.36]) and traumatic events (OR = 1.92 per 1 unit increase in number of traumatic events [CI = 1.71-2.22]), social support (compared with high levels, OR = 1.71 for medium [1.09-2.52]; OR = 1.57 for low [1.08-2.35]), low income (OR = 0.87 per $10,000 increase [0.81-0.92]), female sex (1.60 [1.11-2.23]), and Latino ethnicity (compared with white, OR = 1.74 [1.05-2.97]). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ongoing stressors play a central role in explaining the trajectory of posttraumatic stress over time, and that factors beyond the experience of stressors and traumas may account for sex and ethnic differences in posttraumatic stress risk. Interventions that focus on reducing ongoing adversity may help mitigate the consequences of traumatic events.
19957596	OBJECTIVE: To understand emotional, behavioral problems and related determinants among rural stranded children and to provide evidence for further psychological support. METHODS: A total of 3944 caregivers of children in the rural areas and aged 4 to 7 years but without parents around, were randomly selected. Data were collected through Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (the edition for parents, SDQ). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of children with behavioral/emotional problems was 43.6% among those stranded children including 8.3% having experienced emotional symptoms, 9.5% reported to be displaying 'conduct' problems, 8.7% exhibited significant hyperactivity/inattention, 18.9% experienced peer relationship problems and 16.8% having prosocial behaviors. The prevalence of behavioral/emotional problems was significantly higher in boys than those in girls and in lower age groups. Significant differences were also found in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and prosocial behaviors (P<0.01). The result from logistic regression analysis showed that factors as education level and motivation of the caregivers as well as financial support from the parents were related to emotional/ behavioral problems among the stranded children. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems was high among children living the rural areas but without their parents around which should call for psychological intervention.
17999706	AIMS: The health hazards and prevalence of ecstasy use have been documented in two decades of research, but no review reporting on potentially modifiable antecedents of use is available. The aim of this study was to integrate systematically research identifying cognitive correlates of ecstasy use. Such research has the potential to identify targets for evidence-based interventions designed to discourage use. METHODS: The databases PsycINFO and MedLine were searched, inclusion criteria applied to resulting hits, and descendency and ancestry approaches applied to the selected publications. Reported associations between cognitive determinants, including intention to use and ecstasy use measures, were synthesized by calculating a weighted mean effect size, r. RESULTS: The pattern of associations lent support both to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the expectancy approach as descriptions of potentially useful determinants. Attitudes were associated most strongly with intention and use, followed by subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the strength of associations and the potential modifiability of identified cognitions suggests that evidence-based interventions to discourage ecstasy use should target negative expectancies, perceived behavioural control and anticipated regret, and consider tailoring perceived behavioural control elements.
16186737	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the independent association between socioeconomic conditions and the risk of all-cause hospitalization or death during the course of HIV disease in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. METHODS: Patients in the French PRIMO multicenter prospective cohort of 319 individuals were enrolled during primary HIV-1 infection between 1996 and 2002. Associations between social characteristics (ie, employment status, stable partnership) and the risk of hospitalization or death were assessed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 109 hospitalizations among 84 patients (26.3%) and 3 deaths occurred. Even after adjustment for classic determinants of HIV-infected patients' health status, social characteristics were independently associated with the risk of hospitalization or death, with a significantly increased risk for patients with temporary employment compared with those with stable employment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 5.6) and for patients without a stable partnership compared with those with a stable partnership (OR = 1.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 2.7). CONCLUSIONS: In the era of HAART, adverse social conditions constitute independent risk factors of hospitalization or death during the course of HIV disease.
11324784	OBJECTIVE: To determine the features associated with mortality in a multiethnic US cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) within 5 years of study onset. METHODS: Socioeconomic and demographic features (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, occupation, poverty, and health-related behaviors [drinking, smoking, exercising]), clinical and immunologic features (disease duration, disease onset type, disease activity according to the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure [SLAM], disease damage according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics [SLICC] Damage Index [SDI], number of American College of Rheumatology criteria at diagnosis, organ system manifestations, fatigue and pain ratings, and medication usage and autoantibodies), immunogenetic features (HLA class II genotypes), and behavioral and psychosocial features (social support, illness-related behaviors, and helplessness), as obtained at enrollment into the study, were compared between survivors and deceased patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Within 5 years of study onset, 34 of 288 patients have died. Fourteen deaths could be directly attributed to SLE and 11 to infections. In 1 patient the cause of death could not be determined. In the remaining 8 patients the cause of death was neither infectious nor disease-related. There were 10 deaths among Hispanics, 18 among African Americans, and 6 among Caucasians (P < 0.05). Variables associated with mortality in the univariable analyses included poverty, less than full-time employment, difficulty in accessing health care, shorter disease duration, cardiovascular and renal involvement, higher serum creatinine levels and lower hematocrit values, higher SLAM and SDI scores, lower use of antimalarial drugs, and higher use of (some) immunosuppressants. Specific autoantibodies and class II HLA genotypes were not associated with mortality. Poverty and higher baseline SLAM and SDI scores were independently associated with mortality in the multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Disease activity, disease damage, and poverty appear to be the most important determinants of mortality in this multiethnic US cohort of SLE patients. These results have applicability to the management of patients with SLE, a disease that more severely affects disadvantaged minority population groups.
20202274	Consistency in reporting contraceptive use between spouses is little understood, especially in developing settings. This research challenges the accuracy of measuring contraceptive prevalence rate, which is traditionally calculated based on women's responses. Multinomial logistic regression techniques are employed on a couple dataset from the 1999-2000 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to investigate the consistency in reporting condom use between husbands and wives. The level of inconsistency in reporting condom use was about 46%, of which about 32% was explained by husbands reporting condom use while wives did not, and 14% by wives reporting condom use while husbands did not. Regression analysis showed that couple education and age difference between the spouses are significant determinants of inconsistent reporting behaviour. The findings suggest the need for alternative approaches (questions) in the DHS to ensure consistency in the collection of data related to use of family planning methods.
31302503	OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to figure out the difference between physical and social functioning in determining life satisfaction and self-perception of ageing among community-dwelling elderly people in China. METHODS: A representative random sample of 2161 participants aged 60 years or older was surveyed by face-to-face interview. Sociodemographic factors were measured by age, educational level, and marital status. Physical functioning was identified in terms of self-perceived health, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and number of chronic illnesses. Social functioning was characterized in terms of number of people living together, social support network, and sense of loneliness. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were performed to identify significant determinants of life satisfaction and self-perception of ageing. RESULTS: Older age and lower educational level were related to higher degree of life satisfaction; whereas younger age and higher educational level were related to higher level of self-perception of ageing. Social functioning took precedence over physical functioning in contributing to life satisfaction. In contrast, physical functioning outweighed social functioning in promoting a positive self-perception of ageing. CONCLUSION: A sense of companionship and a supportive social network are vital in enhancing life satisfaction, whereas perceived physical health and functional independence are essential in facilitating a positive self-perception of ageing. Understanding the underlying determinants can provide a novel insight into the mechanism involved in achieving successful ageing.
12780990	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct an item analysis of the COMFORT scale within a sample of critically ill children. The COMFORT scale is a tool that measures eight clinical parameters at the bedside to determine a critically ill child's level of distress. However, documentation of the reliability and validity of specific components of this instrument has been limited to date. DESIGN: This was an observational study. SETTING: A tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS: A sample of 18 intubated, mechanically ventilated patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An item analysis of the COMFORT scale was conducted. The scale was used for variable intervals with each child, providing a total of 514 individual completed ratings. These ratings were then submitted to descriptive, correlational, factor, and regression analyses using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The principal finding of this item analysis was that 97% of the total score variance was explained by six of the eight items. In particular, it was remarkable that heart rate and blood pressure demonstrated very limited reliability and validity as determinants of the total COMFORT score. As well, the clinical experience of the investigators with this scale has demonstrated that these two items can be cumbersome to use, given that these parameters are often affected by hemodynamic factors. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings, we propose a modified COMFORT scale based on a six-item scoring system. This modified scale would provide a more reliable and valid measure for research as well as clinical purposes, by eliminating two parameters that can be affected by factors other than the child's level of distress.
10748986	This paper is the first study of which the author is aware that examines elderly Indonesians' residency decisions. The 1993 Indonesian Family Life Survey provides detailed data on the living children of a sample of elderly individuals. This allows a nested logit to be estimated, which pays due respect to the role of children's characteristics in determining the residency outcome. The estimated earnings potentials of the parents and their children are included as explanatory variables but are not found to be important determinants of coresidency.
30856145	BACKGROUND: Construction workers are at greater risk of musculoskeletal disorders due to their exposure to physical ergonomic risk factors. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to quantify the ergonomic hazards for workers in the construction of residential buildings. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, PATH method, a work-sampling observation method, was applied to study the working postures, handled loads, and manual material handling activities in construction workers. A total of 5832 observations were made on 10 workers involved in tasks of three jobs including reinforcing bar, formwork, and pouring concrete. The ergonomic exposure was characterized in terms of percentage of observations made for each task. RESULTS: Non-neutral trunk postures, especially mild and severe flexions, were frequently observed in all job tasks. High-strain leg postures of squatting, kneeling, and leg(s) bent were mostly observed in floor formwork (39%), concrete finishing (5%), and floor rebar construction (52.3%), respectively. The highest proportion of work time with one (5.8%) and two hands (9%) at/above shoulder was observed in column rebar construction. In concrete pouring and rebar cutting, workers were observed in 39.45% and 23.1% of work time doing carry and push/pull activities, respectively. Heavy loads (>15 kg) were mostly observed in concrete pouring and floor formwork tasks. CONCLUSION: In the construction of residential buildings with the concrete structure, workers perform their task with non-neutral postures of trunk and leg and handling heavy loads. The recommended controls could reduce the musculoskeletal stress in rebar tying, concrete pouring, and concrete finishing tasks.
19237481	The BBC comedy show ;Harry and Paul' sparked media controversy in the UK and around the world for inciting stereotyped racial discrimination, vulgarity and violation of human rights when it portrayed a Filipino domestic worker as a sex toy in Episode 4 of the series. This incident raises the issue concerning the media's role in framing social issues and how it affects the wider determinants of health. There is a need for health psychology as an academic discipline to engage more in these issues. The Journal of Health Psychology provides a unique platform for discussion and debate of perspectives on racism, the media and health.
15885866	Time preferences for health has a role in informing discounting practice in economic evaluation of health care interventions. Yet virtually no empirical evidence on time preferences for health are available for sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this paper are therefore to estimate time preferences for health in Tanzania, and to explore the relationship between time preferences for one's own private health and for others health. Determinants of time preference rates are also explored. A sample of the general population participated, and each person was asked to indicate the maximum duration of more distant ill-health they would be willing to accept in return for a specified delay in the onset of the condition. People were randomised to answer either questions in the context of their own health or in the context of others health. Estimations were done using clustered least squares regression with robust standard errors. The implied mean and median discount rates were 0.07 and 0.058, respectively. Time preferences for one's own and others' health--conceptualised as social health--seem to be roughly the same in this sample, but people seem to discount the most severe health condition at a significantly lower rate than the least severe condition.
29218540	Virtually all large employers engage in corporate philanthropy, but little is known about the extent to which it is directed toward improving community health. We conducted in-depth interviews with leaders of corporate philanthropy from 13 of the largest manufacturing companies in the US to understand how giving decisions were made, the extent to which funding was directed towards improving community health, and whether companies coordinate with local public health agencies. We found that corporate giving was sizable and directed towards communities in which the manufacturers have a large presence. Giving was aligned with the social determinants of health (i.e., aimed at improving economic stability, the neighborhood and physical environment, education, food security and nutrition, the community and social context, and the health care system). However, improving public health was not often cited as a goal of corporate giving, and coordination with public health agencies was limited. Our results suggest that there may be opportunities for public health agencies to help guide corporate philanthropy, particularly by sharing community-level data and offering their measurement and evaluation expertise.
30649280	BACKGROUND: A movement is emerging to encourage health providers and health organizations to take action on the social determinants of health. However, few evidence-based interventions exist. Digital tools have not been examined in depth. OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of integrating, within routine primary care, screening for poverty and an online tool that helps identify financial benefits. METHODS: The setting was a Community Health Centre serving a large number of low-income individuals in Toronto, Canada. Physicians were encouraged to use the tool at every possible encounter during a 1-month period. A link to the tool was easily accessible, and reminder emails were circulated regularly. This mixed-methods study used a combination of pre-intervention and post-intervention surveys, focus groups and interviews. RESULTS: Thirteen physicians participated (81.25% of all) and represented a range of genders and years in practice. Physicians reported a strong awareness of the importance of identifying poverty as a health concern, but low confidence in their ability to address poverty. The tool was used with 63 patients over a 1-month period. Although screening and intervening on poverty is logistically challenging in regular workflows, online tools could assist patients and health providers identify financial benefits quickly. Future interventions should include more robust follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes to the evidence based on addressing the social determinants of health in clinical settings. Future approaches could involve routine screening, engaging other members of the team in intervening and following up, and better integration with the electronic health record.
20198904	Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression.
16521569	"The relationship between fecal corticosterone concentrations and characteristics of the environment and population demography were studied in adult male gerbils (Rhombomys opimus Licht.) at the southern border of Kyzylkum desert (Reserve ""Ecocentre Dzeiran"", Bukhara region, Republic Uzbekistan) in spring and fall seasons from 1999 to 2004. We extracted hormones from air-dried fecal samples and analyzed their concentrations by radioimmunoassay (Gerlinskaya et al., 1993). An analysis for year-specific relationships between hormone concentrations and environmental variables of temperature and precipitation using Pearson's r statistic revealed that corticosterone concentrations correlated positively with total precipitation in January and February and negatively with precipitation during March and April. There was also a significant negative relationship between fecal corticosterone and the number of hot days in March (>20 degrees C). Demographic variables that characterized population densities (percent of burrow systems occupied, mean and maximum number of burrow systems/1 ha, number of females in the burrow system) correlated positively with corticosterone concentrations in feces in the beginning of spring, but these relationships were small compared with mean concentrations of corticosterone for the entire spring season that were strongly and positively correlated with number of gerbils, including all pups emerged, in burrow systems owned by one male (within its home range). In contrast, correlation coefficients of corticosterone concentrations with characteristics of feeding resources in the spring were low and negative. In the long-term perspective (interannual comparison), mortality among adult males was highly negatively correlated with mean corticosterone concentrations in the beginning of spring, which is within the period of maximum reproductive effort and potential stress. Body mass was independent of corticosterone concentrations in males in either the beginning of spring, or during the whole spring. In the fall, mean concentrations of fecal corticosterone in males was positively correlated with the number of days from June to October with mean daily temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C, and with percent of burrow systems where at least one adult, > or = 1 year old gerbil had survived. Mortality from fall to spring of the next year and the fall body mass did not correlate with concentrations of corticosterone in feces collected in the fall. When we analyzed corticosterone concentrations in spring seasons of all years combined using a stepwise regression analysis of a sampling of individual males (we analyzed residuals after withdrawal of year effect) on a set of variables representing habitat resources, distances between nearest neighbor males, and variables representing group demography we found low R2 values not exceeding 0.17. Within the six-year period, concentrations of corticosterone in the spring related negatively with abundance of annual herbs and positively with number of females in a male's social group. When only years of high density were analyzed, fecal corticosterone concentrations in males in the spring were again negatively determined by abundance of herbs, as well as by the nearest neighbor distance, and positively determined by the number of females within a male's home range. At the beginning of spring the only determinants were distance to the nearest neighbor male and number of females. In years of low density none of the variables were found to affect corticosterone levels during the whole spring, while in the beginning of spring only partial regression coefficients of abundance of herbs were negative and significant. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed positive dependence (P = 0.05) of disappearance of adult males during summer drought on concentrations of fecal corticosterone in the spring, but only when burrow systems with at least one adult (male or female) surviving after the summer were considered. Our results provide evidence ground for the assumption that in a desert rodent with non-regular population fluctuations such as the great gerbil, density may be more suppressed by external factors and not by density dependent mortality mediated by stress. Density dependent increases of stress caused by intense reproductive effort occurred when feeding and climatic conditions were favorable to compensate for negative effects on survival. However, in individual gerbils mortality mediated by stress can take place because we found higher stress in the beginning of spring in males, which did not occur in the population after the summer drought."
16803777	Social and economic exclusion and inclusion are receiving growing attention and study in North America for their usefulness as a conceptual framework that addresses the many dimensions of poverty and inequality in our society. A discussion of social and economic exclusion/ inclusion flows naturally out of the population health field in which the social determinants of health have become well-established over the last twenty years or more. The determinants of health provide a broad and inclusive outline within which to situate prevention, early detection and effective intervention of the abuse of older persons. A Social Inclusion Lens offers exciting possibilities for addressing the issue of elder abuse and neglect.
29940906	BACKGROUND: Tackling the social determinants of Tuberculosis (TB) through social protection is a key element of the post-2015 End TB Strategy. However, evidence informing policies are still scarce. Mathematical modelling has the potential to contribute to fill this knowledge gap, but existing models are inadequate. The S-PROTECT consortium aimed to develop an innovative mathematical modelling approach to better understand the role of social protection to improve TB care, prevention and control. METHODS: S-PROTECT used a three-steps approach: 1) the development of a conceptual framework; 2) the extraction from this framework of three high-priority mechanistic pathways amenable for modelling; 3) the development of a revised version of a standard TB transmission model able to capture the structure of these pathways. As a test case we used the Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP), the Brazilian conditional cash transfer scheme. RESULTS: Assessing one of these pathways, we estimated that BFP can reduce TB prevalence by 4% by improving households income and thus their nutritional status. When looking at the direct impact via malnutrition (not income mediated) the impact was 33%. This variation was due to limited data availability, uncertainties on data transformation and the pathway approach taken. These results are preliminary and only aim to serve as illustrative example of the methodological challenges encountered in this first modelling attempt, nonetheless they suggest the potential added value of integrating TB standard of care with social protection strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Results are to be confirmed with further analysis. However, by developing a generalizable modelling framework, S-PROTECT proved that the modelling of social protection is complex, but doable and allowed to draw the research road map for the future in this field.
16202178	Data from the 1998-99 National Family Health Survey (NFHS2) of India are used to examine the net effects of social and demographic characteristics of women on the likelihood of abortion while emphasizing important differences between women from northern and southern states. A north-south comparison illustrates that southern women have relatively higher levels of literacy and labour force participation, lower levels of son preference, and smaller family size. Results from logistic regression analyses show that literacy, type of work, belonging to a scheduled caste or tribe, urban residence, standard of living, parity, religion, age, age at union and contraceptive behaviour all have significant effects on the likelihood of abortion. However, most of these effects significantly differ for southern and northern women. Moreover, the effects of agricultural work, son preference and age at union on the likelihood of abortion are significant for northern but not southern women.
25785579	BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains a major health problem and causes high mortality in Northeastern Thailand. Patients with CCA have a poor prognosis, and little is known about their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its determinants. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate factors affecting HRQOL and its changes over time among CCA patients. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients with CCA were recruited during a 6-month period in 2011 in 5 tertiary hospitals in 4 provinces of northeastern Thailand. Health-related quality of life after diagnosis of CCA was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary questionnaire (Thai version 4). The HRQOL score of CCA patients at different times after diagnosis was compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Generalized estimating equation was used to identify factors affecting HRQOL among CCA patients. RESULTS: Of 237 eligible patients registered, 99 confirmed cases completed follow-up at 2 months. Overall HRQOL varied over time, with the score at baseline being significantly lower than 1 and 2 months later. An adjusted analysis showed that patients who were 60 to 69 years old had higher HRQOL scores than did younger patients. Patients using alternative medicine had lower HRQOL scores than did those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related quality-of-life scores among CCA patients changed over time and were related to age at recruitment and use of alternative medicine. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare providers should carefully communicate about the diagnosis and its implications. Patients with CCA, especially younger patients and those who have used traditional medicine, may benefit from counseling and help with mobilizing family and social support.
10719008	The social, medical and economic effects of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on individual patients and the resource implications of this disease for the healthcare sector are considerable. Optimizing the selection of patients who should receive antibiotics according to stringent clinical criteria is the first step in promoting good clinical practice and cost-effectiveness. Antibiotic efficacy is then the major driver of cost, especially when it reduces the need for hospitalization. Resistance to first-line antibiotics can be expected to increase the risk of treatment failure. Other drivers of cost include non-compliance, which predisposes to therapeutic failure, and the selection of resistant strains. Treatment regimens of short duration, once-daily dosing and good tolerability are determinants of good compliance and cost savings. The expenses of first-line antibiotics typically account for only a small proportion of the overall costs of healthcare and the cheapest antibiotics are not necessarily the most cost-effective. The clinical success rate of first-line therapy is the primary determinant of the overall expenditure on healthcare because of the high costs associated with treatment failure, especially if it leads to hospitalization. Factors such as poor patient compliance and high antibiotic resistance rates, which undermine the clinical efficacies of first-line therapy, will increase the overall costs of treatment.
10881208	Epidemiologic studies in the general population and those based on the clinical assessment of schizophrenic populations have revealed a high degree of overlap between schizophrenia and addictive disorders. The abuse of psychoactive substances (including alcohol) throughout life is so frequent (50%) that the possibility of a specific link inevitably arises. Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain the high co-morbidity between schizophrenia and addiction: 1) The social-environmental hypothesis has been developed but studies have provided poor evidence to validate it. 2) The possible shared biological vulnerability between schizophrenia and addictions led researchers to explore common genetic determinants and study the involvement of the dopaminergic and opioid systems in the aetiology of both schizophrenia and the abuse of and dependence on psychoactive drugs. 3) Finally, the theory of self-medication suggests that schizophrenics may be attempting to counter the deficit linked to their disorders by using the substances they take or their dependency-type behaviour to cope with their emotional problems. The clinical profile of schizophrenic addicts does seem to display some distinctive features, such as the high level of depressive co-morbidity, very high nicotine and alcohol dependence, with a very poor prognosis. These patients are difficult to manage; the possibility of pharmacologic interactions between the substances they are taking and neuroleptic medication calls for prudence, and their compliance is also poor. Addictive disorders in schizophrenics are currently a topic of active research intended to lead to identifying specific treatments. The early identification of addictive disorders in schizophrenics should make it possible to limit their development and improve the prognosis.
18294782	Jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) flexibly change their social forms depending on their age, time of the day, and the season. In the daytime, paired adults behave territorially and unpaired subadults form small flocks of ten birds, whereas at night hundreds of birds roost together. In the breeding season, pairings remain in their nest all day. This fission-fusion raises questions about the underlying social structure and the cognitive capability of jungle crows. In this study, dyadic encounters were used to investigate dominance relationships (linear or non-linear) and the underlying mechanisms in captive jungle crows. Fourteen crows were tested in 455 encounters (i.e., 5 encounters per dyad), and a stable linear dominance relationship emerged. Sex and aggressiveness were determinants as individual characteristics for dominance formation. Males dominated females, and more aggressive individuals dominated less aggressive ones. Aggressive interactions in dyads occurred primarily during the first encounter and drastically declined during subsequent encounters without any signs of a confidence effect. These results suggest that, in captive jungle crow, a linear form of dominance is intrinsically determined by sex and aggressiveness and maintained extrinsically by memories of past outcomes associated with specific individuals, implying individual recognition.
14681279	BACKGROUND: Having regained its political autonomy in 1991, Estonia experienced major changes in political, economic, and social realities. We aimed to analyse mortality changes by education from 1989 to 2000 in order to assess the impact of recent changes in Estonia, as well as the delayed effects of pre-transitional developments. METHODS: Two census-based analyses were compared. Individual cause-specific death data for those aged 20+ for 1987-1990 (72 003 deaths) and 1999-2000 (35 477 deaths) came from the national mortality database. Population denominators came from the population censuses of 1989 and 2000. Mortality for all causes combined and for selected causes of death were analysed for high, mid, and low educational groups. The absolute differences in mortality were evaluated through life expectancy at age 25 and age-standardized mortality rates. To assess the relative differences between educational levels, mortality rate ratios with 95% CI were calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Educational differences in mortality increased tremendously from 1989 to 2000: over the 10-year period life expectancy improved considerably for graduates, and worsened for those with the lowest education. In 2000, male graduates aged 25 could expect to live 13.1 years longer than corresponding men with the lowest education; among women the difference was 8.6 years. Large differences were observed in all selected causes of death in 1989 and in 2000 and the trends were invariably much more favourable for the higher educated. Educational differences in total mortality increased in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Social disruption and increasing inequalities in wealth can be considered main recent determinants; however, causal processes, shaped decades before recent reforms, also contribute to this widening gap.
27298066	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide systematic empirical evidence on the health planning through Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNCs) in India. Design/methodology/approach - A micro-level study was carried out using qualitative study design. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 105 respondents selected from 42 VHSNC sites. A thematic analytical framework approach was used to analyse the data. Findings - The research results indicate that VHSNCs are playing a significant role in health planning. However, the committee meetings are not organised by the committee members on the regular basis. Most of the VHSNC members do not make village health plans. There are some challenges associated with the functioning of VHSNCs like insufficient resources, lack of people's interest, insignificant attention and the unfair behaviour of the Panchayati Raj leaders. Practical implications - The implications of the findings suggest that VHSNCs play a significant role in health planning. However, the leadership is ineffective due to their partial capabilities and approach that generate non-conducive environment. Studies of such nature will be helpful for policy makers in understanding the current situation and micro-level picture of VHSNC and also in analysing it in the existing health system. Originality/value - VHSNC functions with a broader concern and cover range of social determinants at the village level. This study provides empirical evidence on the VHSNCs as lowest part of the health system.
19851709	OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence and determinants of cigarette smoking in Morocco. METHODS: A sample of 9,195 individuals aged 15-90 years, were randomly selected, using a stratified cluster sampling technique. A cross-sectional, household, community-based survey was conducted using a tested questionnaire. The interview covered personal, social and educational characteristics of the respondents and their smoking status. The association between current smoking and sociodemographic variables was estimated. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current smoking was 31.5% for males and 3.1% for females. In men, smoking was associated with lower educational level. In women, it was associated with higher educational level and social class. CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking remains an important public health problem in Morocco. A comprehensive strategy for tobacco control is needed.
18186918	BACKGROUND: This study examines associations between female participation in a microcredit program in India, known as self help groups (SHGs), and women's health in the south Indian state of Kerala. Because SHGs do not have a formal health program, this provides a unique opportunity to assess whether SHG participation influences women's health via the social determinants of health. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used special survey data collected in 2003 from one Panchayat (territorial decentralized unit). Information was collected on women's characteristics, health determinants (exclusion to health care, exposure to health risks, decision-making agency), and health achievements (self assessed health, markers of mental health). The study sample included 928 non elderly poor women. RESULTS: The primary finding is that compared to non-participants living in a household without a SHG member, the odds of facing exclusion is significantly lower among early joiners, women who were members for more than 2 years (OR = 0.58, CI = 0.41-0.80), late joiners, members for 2 years and less (OR = 0.60, CI = 0.39-0.94), and non-participants who live in a household with a SHG member (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.32-0.90). We also found that after controlling for key women's characteristics, early joiners of a SHG are less likely to report emotional stress and poor life satisfaction compared to non-members (OR = 0.52, CI = 0.30-0.93; OR = 0.32, CI = 0.14-0.71). No associations were found between SHG participation and self assessed health or exposure to health risks. The relationship between SHG participation and decision-making agency is unclear. CONCLUSION: Microcredit is not a panacea, but could help to improve the health of poor women by addressing certain issues relevant to the context. In Kerala, SHG participation can help protect poor women against exclusion to health care and possibly aid in promoting their mental health.
31325358	To better address the mental health and substance use crises facing youth globally, a comprehensive approach, inclusive of mental health promotion is needed. A key component of mental health promotion is policy intervention to address the social and structural determinants of health. Importantly, youth should be engaged in these efforts to maximize relevancy and impact. Yet, while there is growing interest in the inclusion of youth in the policymaking process, there is a paucity of guidance on how to do this well. This environmental scan reports findings from a comprehensive search of academic and grey literature that was conducted using the electronic databases: CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Google. Search terms included variations of 'youth*', 'educat*', 'engage*', 'policy' and 'policy training'. Thirteen English language training programmes met inclusion criteria. Analysis identified marked differences in programme philosophy and focus by geographic region and highlights the need for enhanced evaluation and impact measurement moving forward. This paper makes a needed contribution to the evidence-base guiding this key mental health promotion strategy, which holds the potential to address critical gaps in approaches to youth mental health and substance use.

This study assessed the influence of early and later life social conditions on tooth loss and oral impacts on daily performances (OIDP) of people aged 65 and 70 years. Whether social inequalities in oral health changed after the usual age of retirement was also examined. In accordance with ""the latent effect life course model"", it was hypothesized that adverse early-life social conditions increase the risk of subsequent tooth loss and impaired OIDP, independent of later-life social conditions. METHODS: Data were obtained from two cohorts studies conducted in Sweden and Norway. The 2007 and 2012 waves of the surveys were used for the present study. Early-life social conditions were measured in terms of gender, education and country of birth, and later-life social conditions were assessed by working status, marital status and size of social network. Logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to analyse the data. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to adjust estimates for missing responses and loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Early-life social conditions contributed to tooth loss and OIDP in each survey year and both countries independent of later-life social conditions. Lower education correlated positively with tooth loss, but did not influence OIDP. Foreign country of birth correlated positively with oral impacts in Sweden only. Later-life social conditions were the strongest predictors of tooth loss and OIDP across survey years and countries. GEE revealed significant interactions between social network and survey year, and between marital status and survey year on tooth loss. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the latent effect life course model in that early and later life social conditions had independent effects on tooth loss and OIDP among the elderly in Norway and Sweden. Between age 65 and 70, inequalities in tooth loss related to marital status declined, and inequalities related to social network increased."
27660875	INTRODUCTION: Caregivers of demented relatives devote their time and attention in order to help the beloved members of the family. Those who are informal caregivers require support in order to avoid being overburdened. Many such caregivers may suffer from chronic health problems, for instance, depression. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the factors of depression in caregivers, and to discover the determinants of depression among informal family caregivers of demented individuals. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Forty-one caregivers in the research group were administered a questionnaire which included the caregivers' demographics. Caregiver's level of depression was measured by the scale of the Centre for Epidemiology Scale for Depression. The relationship between depression and demographic features was analyzed. Data were analyzed using STATISTICA 8.1 (StatSoft). Analysis of the results was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality. Pearson correlation coefficient was also used. RESULTS: Referring to The Centre for Epidemiology Scale for Depression, the average score in the study group was 18 +/- 7.49. There was no statistically significant relationship between the level of depression and such factors as caregiver's age, time of care of demented relative, and type of kinship and pain. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no relationship between the level of depression and demographic features, the problem with quality of life, worries and grief which may appear, seemed to be sufficient reason for organizing the prevention of depression for all informal caregivers of persons with dementia.
