2723595,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."
9759686,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies suggest underuse of beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease, but these studies have been based on selected populations of recently hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe national patterns and determinants of beta-blocker use in the ambulatory setting. METHODS: We analyzed 11745 visits by patients with coronary artery disease to randomly selected, office-based physicians in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1989 through 1996. We used multiple logistic regression to determine the independent effect of sociodemographic and clinical factors on beta-blocker use. OUTCOME MEASURE: Beta-blocker use at patient visits. RESULTS: Beta-blocker use was reported in only 20.9% of office visits by patients with coronary artery disease and no strong contraindications between 1993 and 1996. In multivariate analyses, age younger than 75 years, residence in the Northeast, and visits to cardiologists and internists compared with family and general practitioners predicted greater use of beta-blocker therapy. White race and private insurance also were significant predictors of beta-blocker use between 1980 and 1996. Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant decline in beta-blocker use from 1980 to 1990, followed by a gradual increase in recent years. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-blockers appear to be underused in ambulatory patients with coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that nonclinical factors may influence rates of use, indicating the need for closer scrutiny of variations in physician prescribing practices."
7479620,"BACKGROUND: Whereas self-efficacy expectations have been identified as important determinants of exercise participation patterns, little empirical work that examines efficacy expectations as outcomes of exercise participation or their theoretical relationship to other psychological outcomes associated with exercise has been conducted. In the context of middle-aged males and females, the present study attempted to integrate social cognitive and impression management perspectives with respect to anxiety associated with exercise. METHODS: Formerly sedentary subjects participated in a 5-month exercise program with assessments of physique anxiety, efficacy, outcome expectations, and anthropometric variables prior to and following the program. RESULTS: Both acute bouts and long-term participation in exercise resulted in significant increases in self-efficacy. In turn, these changes in efficacy and initial positive outcome expectations were significant predictors of reductions in physique anxiety, even when controlling for the influence of gender and reductions in body fat, weight, and circumferences. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are discussed in terms of the implications for structure and content of exercise environments and the utility of the proposed theoretical integration. Strategies for enhancing beliefs regarding health and fitness outcomes associated with exercise rather than appearance outcomes may be required to maximize reductions in negative body image."
8556442,"Adolescents who report prior sexual abuse are at increased risk for adolescent pregnancy. This may result from earlier, more frequent, less well-protected sexual activity or from a greater desire to conceive. To determine the relative contribution of these two possible explanations to the reported association between sexual abuse and adolescent pregnancy, we studied the reproductive and sexual histories of 200 sexually active 13-18 year old females in relation to self-reported sexual abuse. Anonymous questionnaires revealed that 40 (20%) of the 200 subjects reported sexual abuse. Analyses revealed no group differences in the median age of first voluntary intercourse, the frequency of sexual intercourse, or the consistency of birth control use. Compared to their nonabused peers, however, teenagers reporting abuse were more likely to be trying to conceive (35% vs. 14% p < .01), to have boyfriends pressuring them to conceive (76% vs. 44% p < .01), and to have fears about infertility (38% vs. 16% p < .01). Our findings suggest that childhood sexual abuse may increase the risk of adolescent pregnancy by fostering the desire to conceive. Further study is needed to determine why a disproportionate number of sexually abused adolescents desire pregnancy. The efficacy of adolescent pregnancy prevention programs may be improved by identifying previously abused adolescents and by designing educational interventions that specifically address their desire to conceive."
6419709,"This double-blind, controlled study of XYY and XXY men found in a birth cohort of 4,591 tall men born in Copenhagen assessed evidence of delinquent and aggressive behavior and explored the role of hormonal determinants in the behavioral and psychological differences noted among groups. Information from social records, a structured psychological interview, and projective tests did not support the notion that men with sex chromosome anomalies are particularly violent or aggressive. Hormonally, XYY men had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than matched control groups. In contrast, XXY men had higher levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin, but low concentrations of testosterone. There was a significantly positive relation among all subjects as well as XY controls alone between plasma testosterone level and evidence of criminal convictions. A proportionate increase in testosterone levels was noted when subjects were divided into nondelinquents, delinquents without violent convictions, and delinquents with violent convictions. The relation between testosterone level and criminal behavior was not reflected in measures of aggression derived from the psychological interview and projective tests. There was no specific evidence that testosterone is a mediating factor in the criminal behavior of XYY men."
6705636,"This essay is based on the assumption that a long-neglected topic of socialization, the determinants of individual differences in parental functioning, is illuminated by research on the etiology of child maltreatment. Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child."
9653610,"OBJECTIVE: To determine on a large scale the multiple medical and nonmedical factors that influence glycemic control in the general population of children with diabetes, we performed a nationwide French cross-sectional study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 2,579 patients aged 1-19 years with type 1 diabetes of > 1 year's duration. The study was center based: 270 centers were identified, 206 agreed to participate, and 147 included at least 90% of their patients. Questionnaires were completed by physicians interviewing patients and family, and HbA1c measurements were centralized. To identify explanatory variables for HbA1c level and frequency of severe hypoglycemia, we performed multiple regression analysis using all the quantitative variables collected and stepwise logistic regression for the qualitative variables. RESULTS: Mean HbA1c value for the whole population was 8.97 +/- 1.98% (normal 4.7 +/- 0.7% [SD]). Only 19 children (0.7%) had ketoacidosis during the 6 months before the study, whereas 593 severe hypoglycemia events occurred in 338 children (13.8%). Control was better in university-affiliated hospitals and centers following > 50 patients, reflecting the importance of access to experienced diabetologists. Children had a mean of 2.3 injections, allegedly performed 2.8 glucose measurements per day, and were seen an average of 4.6 times per year at the center. In the multiple regression analysis, 94% of the variance of HbA1c was explained by our pool of selected variables, with the highest regression coefficient between HbA1c and age (Rc = 0.43, P < 0.0001), then with daily insulin dosage per kilogram (Rc = 0.28, P < 0.0001), mother's age (Rc = 0.26, P < 0.0001), frequency of glucose measurements (Rc = 0.21, P < 0.0001), and diabetes duration (Rc = 0.14, P < 0.0001). Logistic regression identified quality of family support and dietary compliance, two related qualitative and possibly subjective variables, as additional explanatory determinants of HbA1c. The frequency of severe hypoglycemia was 45 per 100 patient-years and correlated with diabetes duration, but not with HbA1c levels or other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall results remain unsatisfactory, 33% of studied French children with type 1 diabetes had HbA1c < 8%, the value obtained in Diabetes Control and Complications Trial adolescents treated intensively. Diabetes management in specialized centers should be encouraged."
10369442,"We examined the influence of demographic, social and economic background of people with HIV/AIDS in London on total community and hospital services costs. This was a retrospective study of community and hospital service use, needs and costs based on structured questionnaires administered by trained interviewers and costing information obtained from the service purchasers and providers, based on two Genito-urinary Medicine clinics in London: the Jefferiss Wing at St. Mary's Hospital and Patric Clements at the Central Middlesex Hospital, London, England. The subjects were 225 HIV infected patients (105 asymptomatic, 59 symptomatic non-AIDS and 61 AIDS). We found that over and above well established determinants of health care costs for HIV infected people such as disease stage and transmission category, social and economic factors such as employment and support of a living-in partner significantly reduced community services costs. Private health insurance had a similar effect, though only a small proportion of HIV people had such cover. The cost of community services for HIV infected non-European Union nationals, mainly of African origin, was one quarter that for the European Union nationals. Community services costs were highest for heterosexually infected women and lowest for heterosexually infected men after adjusting for other factors. Hospital services costs were significantly higher for HIV infected people lacking educational qualifications and employment. We conclude that access to community care for HIV infected non-EU nationals appears to be very poor as the cost of their community services was one quarter that for the EU nationals after adjusting for the effects of transmission category, disease stage, living with a partner, employment and having a private health insurance. Additional incentives for informal care for HIV infected people could be a cost-effective way to improve their community health service provisions."
2065114,"The role of genotype as a determinant of biologically based inter-individual differences in vulnerability to substance abuse has received little systematic investigation except in the case of alcohol. This report describes the use of an animal model, the inbred mouse, to identify and to characterize variants with inherently altered susceptibilities to the rewarding and other behavioral actions of cocaine. Among a battery of nine inbred strains chosen solely for their genetic diversity, genetic polymorphisms commonly occurred which altered the potency and/or efficacy of cocaine to induce conditioned place preference, oral self-administration, motor activity activation, seizures and lethality. These changes in cocaine sensitivity generally were of a behavior-specific and pharmacodynamic nature. One strain, DBA/2J, found to be markedly hyporesponsive to the rewarding action of cocaine, also was hyporesponsive to the rewarding effects of amphetamine, etonitazene, phencyclidine, caffeine and procaine. We speculate that this strain has an inherent generalized appetitive defect. The frequent occurrence and large magnitude of inherent phenotypic changes in cocaine responsiveness which we have identified among inbred mouse strains now permits an analytical genetic study of processes underlying cocaine-mediated reinforcement."
8500954,"The primary health care approach to public health stresses recognition of economic, political, and social determinants of health. In practice, briefly trained community health workers provide people with education and health care, but they require sound supervision. Such tasks of leadership require higher education. This demands more schools of public health of independent status, as well as stronger departments of community medicine within schools of medicine. Independent schools of public health throughout the world are much stronger than preventive medicine departments in medical schools, as measured by full-time faculty, scope of teaching and research, and candidates enrolled. To train properly for leadership, such independent schools in the developing world should be multiplied by 12 times to meet the needs. Leadership requires basic preparation in the full scope of public health knowledge, along with skills of effective management."
7076787,"Mortality from ischemic heart disease has declined sharply since the mid 1960's in the United States and several other industrialized nations. The causes of this decline have thus far not been established. Six major strategies for investigating determinants of ischemic heart disease mortality trends are discussed in this review: (1) analyses of mortality data; (2) morbidity surveillance; (3) surveillance of change in medical care; (4) surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors; (5) social and ecological surveillance; (6) experimental and quasi-experimental community approaches. The rationale, problems and limitations of each are discussed."
8666516,"Establishing causal relationships has been and is today a matter of debate in epidemiology. The observational nature of epidemiological research rends difficult the proving of these relationships. Related to this, different models and causal criteria have been proposed in order to explain health and disease determinants, from pure determinism in Koch postulates, accepting unicausal explanation for diseases, to more realistic multicausal models. In occupational health it is necessary to formulate causal models and criteria to assess causality, and frequently causal assessment in this field has important social, economic and juridical relevance. This paper deal with evaluation of causal relationships in epidemiology and this evaluation is illustrated with a recent example of an occupational health problem in our milieu: the Ardystil case."
6701567,"This study deals with the relationship between social support and mental health. This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports. It is further suggested that sex roles may be important determinants of the availability and use of different support sources."
10186225,"It has been predicted that minimally invasive therapy will have dramatic consequences for the specialty of general surgery, as demonstrated by the diffusion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To investigate the determinants of the diffusion in Denmark of five laparoscopic technologies (cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, surgery for colon cancer, surgery for inguinal hernia and fundoplication), questionnaires on seventeen factors' influence on the adoption (stimulating or impeding) were sent to fifty-nine hospitals. Fifty hospitals (85%) responded. Overall, 98% adopted laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Denmark between 1991 and 1995, whereas the remainder of the technologies were adopted by 7-65% of hospitals performing these operations. Large and specialized hospitals were the earliest adopters. The factors, nature of technology (minimally invasive versus conventional), training (appropriate training courses), competition (between specialties and between hospitals) and media attention have stimulated the diffusion, whereas three budget factors (budget for investment, budget for operation and public regulation) usually had an impeding effect. Stimulating factors prevail for all laparoscopic technologies indicating that some guidance of the adoption and use of new health technologies might be necessary. In Denmark, one of the suggested health policies to secure timely guidance is the establishment of an early warning system."
9358295,"PURPOSE: To examine the relationship of reported condom use to specific sociodemographics, psychosocial variables, and perceptions of and motivations for condom use as conceptualized by the Health Belief Model. METHODS: This study performed a cross-sectional survey of 557 adolescents enrolled in a hospital-based pregnancy prevention program in an urban community hospital (Harlem Hospital). Multiple logistic regression analysis examined the combined relationship of the significant psychosocial variables to consistent condom use. RESULTS: Males were less likely than females to report teen-parent conflict and depression and more likely to report support for birth control, participation in community activities, and favorable attitudes toward delaying parenthood. Consistent with the Health Belief Model adjusting for age, the strongest predictors of consistent condom use were partner preference for condoms, perceived benefit of avoidance of pregnancy, male gender, and support for birth control (usually by a parent). CONCLUSIONS: The data on this urban, predominantly African-American sample of adolescents suggest the importance of the influences on specific motivations to use protection--that is, the wish to avoid pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and sexually transmitted diseases, although the mechanisms are still unclear. In addition, gender and the modifying effects of parental and partner support of the use of protection strongly influence the reported use of condoms by adolescents. These factors (in addition to psychosocial factors such as depression) may be important in planning interventions to increase condom use by sexually active teens."
7792367,"This paper discusses minor psychiatric morbidity in the community and its relation to help-seeking. The research is aimed at identifying the demographic and social characteristics that enhance the likelihood of minor psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire, and to reveal how these determinants relate to health status. In the second stage of the study, the same characteristics are related to their effect on the decision to decision to consult a general practitioner and, specifically, on presenting psycho-social problems to the GP. At the population level, the likelihood of a high GHQ score was greater for women, divorced persons and the unemployed, other variables remaining equal. However, GHQ score was contaminated by poor subjective health perception, especially for unemployed persons. Chronic physical illness did not have an independent effect on the GHQ score. Chronic physical illness did influence help-seeking. In addition, several socio-demographic characteristics showed an independent effect on consulting behaviour for both GHQ-positive and GHQ-negative patients. Women, unemployed persons and publicly insured patients with a minor psychiatric disturbance were more apt to visit their GP, regardless of their physical health status. However, no socio-demographic characteristics increased the likelihood that a GHQ-positive patient would present unambiguous psycho-social complaints as a reason to see their doctor."
12265071,"""This study is an attempt to investigate the economic determinants of international immigration and remigration into and out of the Federal Republic of Germany. Moreover, employment policy measures with respect to foreign workers are described and their impact on the inflow and outflow of guest workers [is] analyzed."" The author notes that the ability of the government to influence migration flows through legislation is limited because of the free movement of labor within the Common Market countries. It is suggested that in-migration of foreign labor slows wage increases for the native worker, may retard rationalization, and increases the social costs of unemployment, particularly during periods of recession."
7264477,"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered."
3434387,"Previous studies reveal that career guidance is usually based on a mixture of meritocratic criteria (academic ability and achievement) and nonmeritocratic considerations (students' SES and their social labeling by counselors). The present study argues that school counselors in affluent neighborhoods emphasize the meritocratic criteria, while those in poorer neighborhoods tend to focus on the more nonmeritocratic. This hypothesis is examined in a random sample of 210 male, primary school graduates from the 10 state schools of an Israeli town, 125 of whom are from schools in affluent neighborhoods, and 85 from schools in poorer neighborhoods. A path analysis of determinants of guidance to specific high school tracks shows that students' ethnicity and labeling as problematic directly affect guidance by counselors only in the poor neighborhoods. The effect of students' ""problems"" is due to their being labeled as problematic with respect to psychological or physical attributes rather than to behavioral problems at school. The findings are subsequently interpreted as reflecting a patronizing attitude toward lower status students by counselors. Additional studies which may further elaborate the determinants of guidance in poor versus affluent neighborhoods are proposed."
8227095,"The associations of social and behavioural factors on preterm birth in Singapore were studied using hospital maternity records of 20,723 consecutive singleton births between January 1986 and November 1991. The overall proportion of preterm births was 3.6%, the rates for the Chinese, Malay and Indian groups being 3.2%, 3.8% and 4.9% respectively. Teenage mothers were at a higher risk of preterm labour compared to women aged 20-29 years. The incidence of preterm labour decreased with increasing educational status. Preterm births were six times more likely in women who had no antenatal care. Women who had three or more previous births were at a higher risk, while those who had one or two previous births were at a lower risk compared to women who had none."
7326949,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points."
8194917,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on serum lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), a presumably strong risk factor for coronary artery disease in White populations, has mostly been derived, in Black populations, from small samples. This study compares the distribution and the determinants of serum Lp(a) in Blacks and in Whites using large representative samples and the same methods in both populations. METHODS: The distribution and the correlates of serum Lp(a) were investigated in population-based samples of 701 Blacks in the Seychelles and 634 Whites in Switzerland, aged 25-64 years. Serum Lp(a) was quantified using a commercial immunoradiometric assay. RESULTS: The distribution of serum Lp(a) was similarly skewed in both ethnic groups, but median Lp(a) concentration was about twofold higher in Blacks (210 mg/l) compared to Whites (100 mg/l). The proportions of individuals with elevated serum Lp(a) (> 300 mg/l) was about 50% higher in Blacks (37.5%) than in Whites (25.2%). In both ethnic groups, serum Lp(a) was found to correlate with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apoprotein B but not with HDL-cholesterol, alcohol intake, smoking, and body mass index. The variance in serum Lp(a) concentration explained by any combination of these factors was smaller than 5.3% in the two populations. CONCLUSIONS: The measured factors did not explain the higher levels of serum Lp(a) found in Blacks compared to Whites. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors account for much of the variation of serum Lp(a) in both populations."
6656327,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension."
12224661,"Physical activity is a key component of energy balance and is promoted in children and adolescents as a lifelong positive health behavior. Understanding the potential behavioral determinants necessitates understanding influences from three fundamental areas: 1) physiologic and developmental factors, 2) environmental factors, and 3) psychological, social, and demographic factors. The literature to date has generally investigated potential predictors of physical activity in children and adolescents in each of these three general areas, although existing data rely largely on cross-sectional studies in which it is difficult to distinguish a determinant from a correlate. In all likelihood, aspects of each of these three areas interact in a multidimensional way to influence physical activity in youth. This article reviews evidence of potential determinants of physical activity in children and adolescents and provides recommendations for future work."
3776295,"The relevant aspects of the psychosocial situation of men in old age were listed using two different methods: Identification of contextual determinants of the male aging process. Reporting on empirically based evidence of the situation of elderly men. ad 1. The following contextual aspects of the male aging process were under consideration: generalized and personalized images of elderly men, subjective reports on ""male aging"", changing images of the male sex role and the aging role, male sex role typing across the life span, middle and late adulthood as relevant lifespan segments preceding old age, and sociodemographic and health statistics concerning the situation in which elderly men live. ad 2. The report on empirically based data on the psychosocial situation of old aged men included the following aspects: Social roles of men in old age, comparisons between elderly men and elderly women and between elderly and younger men, interindividual variability (classifications) among the group of old-aged men and early antecedents as ""predictors"" of life satisfaction in old age. Analyzing these different kinds of material, the importance of a differential approach to the multidimensionally determined situation of men in old age was stressed; on the other hand, it seemed to be possible to identify certain ""typical"" characteristics at least for the present cohorts of old-aged men (e.g. importance of the quality of marital life, significance of being free of stress, tendency of experiential integration etc.)."
10024209,"BACKGROUND: Childhood diarrhoea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Nicaragua. Amongst the risk factors for its transmission are 'poor' hygiene practices. We investigated the effect of a large number of hygiene practices on diarrhoeal disease in children aged <2 years and validated the technique of direct observation of hygiene behaviour. METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was carried out in a rural zone of Nicaragua. From the database of a previously conducted case-control study on water and sanitation 172 families were recruited, half of which had experienced a higher than expected rate of diarrhoea in their children and the other half a lower rate. Hygiene behaviour was observed over two mornings and diarrhoea incidence was recorded with a calendar, filled out by the mother, and collected every week for 5 months. RESULTS: Of 46 'good' practices studied, 39 were associated with a lower risk of diarrhoea, five were unrelated and only for two a higher risk was observed. Washing of hands, domestic cleanliness (kitchen, living room, yard) and the use of a diaper/underclothes by the child had the strongest protective effect. Schooling (>3 years of primary school) and better economic position (possession of a radio) had a positive influence on general hygiene behaviour, education having a slightly stronger effect when a radio was present. Individual hygiene behaviour appeared to be highly variable in contrast with the consistent behaviour of the community as a whole. Feasible and appropriate indicators of hygiene behaviour were found to be domestic cleanliness and the use of a diaper or underclothes by the child. CONCLUSION: A consistent relationship between almost all hygiene practices and diarrhoea was detected, more schooling producing better hygiene behaviour. The high variability of hygiene behaviour at the individual level requires repeated observations (at least two) before and after the hygiene education in the event one wants to measure the impact of the campaign on the individual."
8227099,"Two samples of births were used to examine the effect of son preference and population policy on sex ratios in Hebei and Shaanxi provinces of China. The results from all births to women aged 15-49 in the 1985 In-Depth Fertility Survey indicated a strong son preference but no clear policy impact on sex ratios at different birth orders. In a sample of selected births during 1975-84 to women aged 40 or under, the mixed influences of son preference and population policy were clearly reflected in the high and rising overall ratios at birth, and the increasing sex ratios with parity. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed."

7989069,"Symptom management and prevention of psychotic relapse are major treatment concerns in schizophrenia. Research shows a relationship between psychotic symptom levels and several intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental factors. These determinants are incorporated into an etiologic causal model of psychotic symptoms based on a vulnerability-stress framework. Then a multifaceted intervention model to influence symptom determinants is advanced, and examples of intervention elements are specified. Finally, a research agenda to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention model is described, and related methodologic issues are considered."
8935459,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify the determinants of childhood pedestrian injuries, taking the child's exposure to the road environment into account. DESIGN: This was a case-control study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia between 1991 and 1993. Altogether 100 injured and 400 uninjured child pedestrians aged 1 to 14 years were studied. Aspects of the child's social and physical environments, measures of his or her behaviour, cognitive skills, and ""habitual"" exposure to the road environment, as well as his or her knowledge of road safety, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: The likelihood of injury increased by 12% with each 10,000 vehicles per day increase in the volume of traffic (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05, 1.19) on roads most frequently crossed. In addition, the presence of visual obstacles on the verge of the child's street of residence increased the likelihood of injury by more than 2.6 times (OR 2.68, 95% CI = 1.42, 5.02). In contrast, the absence of footpaths was associated with a 52% reduction in the likelihood of injury compared with the presence of footpaths on the child's street of residence (OR 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.87). CONCLUSION: The amount of exposure to the road environment and the nature of the road environment to which the child pedestrian was exposed partly influenced the likelihood of injury in children from low socioeconomic areas, male children, and children aged 13 to 14 years. Until now, the excess incidence of childhood pedestrian injuries in these subgroups of the population had not been explained because the child's exposure per se had not been examined."
9148317,"A four-factor control model was used to test the contextual determinants in adolescents' sense of control on a coping scale. Outpatients, matched for age and gender, completed the Tiffany Control Scales. Analyses confirmed the hypotheses that 52 who scored as externalizing compared to those 40 scoring as internalizing showed greater coping in response to different contextual determinants defined as situations."
2033940,"The pattern of use of alcoholic beverages and factors influencing it among Barcelona schoolchildren were studied; 2,255 fifth and eighth grade students from 71 schools completed a self-administered questionnaire. Between fifth-eighth grades, important changes take place in attitudes--strongly opposed to alcohol among the younger, much more moderate among the older. Family celebrations such as Christmas or birthdays are the earliest source of exposure to alcohol, at which one-third of fifth grade students and two-thirds of eighth grade students drink. In eighth grade, though daily consumption is relatively rare (4.4% for boys), a considerable proportion have been drunk at least once (16% of girls and 19% of boys) or have had four or more drinks in a row, while a small but significant proportion (2.5%) have been drunk two or more times in the last six months. A discriminant analysis uncovered some features predicting this ""higher risk"" use of alcohol: age and gender (being a boy in eighth grade), lower socioeconomic status, higher weekly allowance available for personal expenses, a pattern of usual consumption by both the father and friends, smoking regularly, and having a moderate or high physical activity level, as well as holding opinions in favor of drinking."
9107004,"Marital separation can be a time of extreme stress and can significantly disrupt support networks and support processes when they are needed most. The purpose of this investigation was to test mechanisms of support erosion in a multimethod study of 138 divorced mothers and their confidants. Previous work was extended by using observational measures of confidant support in a process model including (a) maternal characteristics over time, (b) support person characteristics, and (c) relationship characteristics (intimacy and confidant relationship type). A hypothesized mechanism of erosion was supported in which ongoing maternal distress was positively associated with levels of confidant negativity, which in turn was related to lower levels of observed support. Having a partner was related to more intimacy than was having family and friends. Contrary to expectation, however, having a partner was related to lower levels of support, and intimacy was not related to observed support."
6699384,"Data from an Australian survey of 1,050 elderly men and women were analyzed with regard to sex differences in life satisfaction and its determinants. Men and women had very similar levels of education, health, financial satisfaction, subjective social integration, and morale. Little difference between sexes was found in the causal process determining life satisfaction. There was little or no interaction between sex and the other variables examined."
9257397,"Quality of life (QofL) has emerged as a new outcome paradigm. It is now the endpoint in various taxonomies of patient outcomes, in which relationships are modeled amongst biological abnormalities, symptom status, functional status, disability, health perceptions and quality of life. Although current models and taxonomies point at important determinants of QofL, they do not provide a heuristic that guides the conceptualization of QofL and the systematic development of an explanatory theory of how ill health affects QofL. General mechanisms linking ill health, behavior, and QofL are lacking. In this paper we propose social production function (SPF) theory as providing such a heuristic, relating the effects of ill health, the activities that patients engage in to maintain QofL, and QofL itself. This theory basically asserts that people produce their own well-being by trying to optimize achievement of universal human goals via six instrumental goals within the environmental and functional limitations they are facing. Three important notions of SPF theory are: (1) the linkages between goals, needs, and well-being; (2) the distinction between universal needs and instrumental goals; and (3) substitution among instrumental goals, activities and endowments according to cost-benefit considerations, whereby costs refer to scarce resources such as functional capacity, time, effort and money. We will argue that SPF theory meaningfully relates the ""biomedical model""-with its focus on pathological processes and biological, physiological and clinical outcomes-to the ""quality of life"" model, with its focus on functioning and well-being. We describe SPF theory and how SPF theory can be used to: (1) operationally define and measure QofL; (2) clarify persistent measurement problems; and (3) develop an explanatory framework of the effects of disease on QofL. In the discussion section, we address the limitations of the SPF approach of QofL and its relationship with personality."
6365517,"The article considers the answers given by different schools of thought to the fundamental questions about the degree of autonomy of medicine and the kind of articulation between medicine and society as a whole and in its ""parts."" The answers vary with the thinking in the different social sciences and the philosophic schools associated with them. The author divides his presentation in two broad chapters: The first covers schools of thought in the health field, and attempts to delineate the philosophical foundations underlying the principal current schools of thought in this field, without attempting a history of the philosophical schools or analyzing each of them in detail. Thus, two idealist currents are studied which have exerted great influence in the health field--neopositivism and neo-Kantianism--and marxism as the materialist school, which recognizes the primary of matter, nature, and objective reality, and views consciousness as a property of matter. The second chapter considers the theoretical contest now going on among the schools of thought discussed in the first chapter, which try to explain the relationship between medicine and the social structure; the effectiveness of medical action, and the social determinants of disease. Prior to the seventies, the author says, the dominant view of the autonomy of medicine, its effectiveness, the potential for social change of the medical institutions, and the benefits to health of economic development, was endorsed by the predominance of positivism among these schools of medical thought. The view that medicine was broadly autonomous and at the same level with other subsystems such as the economic, the political and the educational subsystems, assumed the possibility of changing society by an effort begun through any of these ""sectors."" The enormous growth of productive forces that took place in the developed capitalist countries during the fifties, and even more during the sixties, collided at the end of the latter decade with the existing social production relations, which checked the progress of the production forces and generated a series of challenges in civil society to the aims of economic development and the achievements of science in relation to the inequality of the distribution of wealth. In the health sector, this was a time of criticism of the positivist view and of pointing out the negative effects of medicalization, highlighting the ideological and self-perpetuating character of medical institutions, and proposals for the demedicalization of society.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
3168446,"In order to disclose differences between users and non-users of oral contraceptives (OC), 620 women aged 15-54 were invited to participate in an in depth interview about sexual, contraceptive, and reproductive life events. Of the 585 women who participated, 459 were consecutive gynecological in- or outpatients, and 126 were selected from visitors in general practice. Data was analysed by multivariate test statistics. After correction for present age and social class, the duration of use of OC (DOC) among women 15-34 years of age correlated negatively to age at menarche and coital debut and positively to number of sexual partners, oral-genital sexual practice, and number of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Among women over 35, DOC was positively associated only to cigarette smoking. No correlation was found to coital frequency (whether earlier, present or during pregnancy or menstruation), number of births and abortions, or to social classification. In epidemiological research on benefits and risks of oral contraceptives, confounding influence of one or more variables is of crucial importance. The present findings point at sexual and life-style habits as potential confounders in the study of OC and associated diseases."
3237851,"The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3501048,"The authors examined whether there are differences in the determinants of physician use between aged and middle-aged individuals. Data were obtained through interviews and medical records from a probability sample of 460 individuals aged 45-89 years old. Physical health measures were important predictors for both age groups, but there were differences in the relative importance of specific variables. The number of diagnoses was more important in predicting physician use for the middle-aged and bed days was more significant for the aged. Psychologic factors played a slightly greater role in predicting physician use for the aged, and enabling and predisposing variables were somewhat more important for the middle-aged. Utilization during the year before the interview was associated with subsequent physician use for both age groups, but the correlation was weaker among the aged. Age differences in the predictors of physician use are believed to result from the unique illness response elicited by chronic, as opposed to acute, illness."
1473065,"The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the relationship between women's exercise participation and their social roles as well as characteristics of these roles, and 2) to determine the relative importance of social roles compared to non-role-related determinants (including social support, perceived barriers, interest in exercise, and perceived importance of exercise). A cross-sectional survey was done among 1,113 randomly selected urban women aged 20-49. Social roles did not emerge as a major risk factor for exercise participation. Statistical modelling indicated that whether women exercise was only related to role overload in the presence of the non-role-related determinants. For women exercising, parenthood as well as role overload were related to the amount of exercise in the presence of the non-role-related determinants. These findings have important implications for exercise promotion for women."
6514971,"The issue of symptom formation in patients is discussed in terms of evolution relating to cultures and changes in disease patterns. Determinants of symptoms depend upon a host of factors including the individual's developmental history and personality, the setting in which illness develops, the contemporary social status of the individual, the cognitive and affective state, and the resources based on learning that the individual has in coping and adapting to stressful situations threatening the stability of the organism."
8360226,Differentials in child survival in Bangladesh have been examined using a number of socioeconomic and environmental factors on data from the 1989 Bangladesh Fertility Survey. Multivariate analysis reveals that both wife's and husband's education and household electricity show a significant positive association with child survival. The respondent's working status exerts a significant negative influence. Wife's education has a greater influence on child survival in Bangladesh than that of husband's education.
9498898,"Epidemiological evidence on the relation between aromatic amines and cancer risk is reviewed. In particular, cancer risk in humans resulting from exposure to aromatic amines from occupational sources and tobacco smoking is assessed with reference to ecologic, cohort, and case-control studies. Seven arylamines have been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer: benzidine-based dyes and MOCA (4,4'-methylene bis 2-choloroaniline) were considered 'probably' carcinogenic, Group 2A, because of a high level of evidence in experimental animals; two occupational chemicals (2-naphthylamine and benzidine), one drug (Chlornaphazine), and two manufacturing processes (manufacture of auramine and magenta) were included in Group 1 on the basis of 'sufficient' evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. Occupational exposures to aromatic amines explain up to 25 percent of bladder cancers in some areas of Western countries; these estimates might be higher in limited areas of developing countries. Aromatic amines contaminate the ambient air as a component of environmental tobacco smoke. There is increasing evidence that the excess of bladder cancer in smokers is attributable to aromatic amines rather than to other contaminants of tobacco smoke such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). A modulating role in the risk of bladder cancer associated with exposure to aromatic amines is played by metabolic polymorphisms, such as the N-acetyltransferase genotype, raising important social and ethical issues. The consistent observation of a difference between men and women in bladder cancer risk, after allowing for known risk factors, suggests consideration of gender-related biological determinants for future investigation."
7977915,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to identify the determinants of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in a population with full access to medical care. METHODS: Unionized New York City health care workers (n = 1394) with comprehensive medical insurance were screened for hypertension. Union records documenting all physician visits and prescription medications for the year before screening provided the opportunity to relate patterns of treatment to blood pressure outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 409 employees found to have hypertension, 289 (71%) were aware of their condition and 201 (49%) had been treated, but only 51 (12%) had their blood pressure controlled at the recommended level (< 140/90 mm Hg). In a logistic regression model, the only variable of treatment associated with control was days of antihypertensive medication. The total number of physician visits was not associated with control. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in conventional community settings, even in the absence of financial barriers, treatment for hypertension continues to be characterized by poor outcomes. Improving access to primary care, without changes in the nature of that care, may not substantially improve blood pressure control."
12280705,"""In the literature on population migration, increasing attention has been devoted to quality-of-life factors. Measures of temperature (as proxies for climate) have frequently been employed in empirical work regarding the determinants of population migration decisions. A wide range of such specifications have been used, most of which imply restrictions on the preferences of migrants. In this paper, a variety of temperature variable specifications are analyzed and interpreted. Statistical tests for nested and nonnested hypotheses are used to compare and choose among the various specifications."" The model is used to analyze interstate migration in the 48 contiguous states of the United States for the period 1975-1980."
7202850,"Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children."
7031748,"Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes."
3817461,"The authors attempt to understand the nature of denial of illness by an examination of two patients with serious and disfiguring physical disorders who postponed medical treatment for over a decade. Both patients subsequently had dramatic negative reactions to the therapeutic efforts of physicians caring for them. Various social, experiential, and characterologic determinants are discussed. In addition, the authors argue that the illness served important organizing functions: it sheltered these patients from the exigencies of everyday life; it allowed them to defeat the physician's efforts to effect a cure; and, finally, the disfigured physical state appeared to correspond to their internalized defective self-image and self-esteem."
9458585,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of social deprivation upon the diet, dental health behaviours and dental health status of five-year-old children in Northern Ireland. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Fifty-eight primary schools in North and West Belfast. SUBJECTS: A nine per cent (240) random sample of 2,666 five-year-old children resident and attending school in North and West Belfast. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dental health status measured by dmft index; parental assessments of the child's dental health behaviours: parental dental attendance patterns and attitudes towards dental health; parental assessments of the child's diet and snacking behaviours: parental attitudes towards snack foods; and demographic profile of child's family. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three children were examined, a 68 per cent response. The majority of the families were either in low income employment or unemployed. Sixty-eight per cent of children had experience of dental caries. Dental decay was unrelated to parental employment status but more children from unemployed families attended when in pain. The diet of the children was related to both employment status and parental attitude and was reflected in their caries experience. Caries experience was dependent upon parental dental attendance, the consumption of carbonated drinks and sugar containing bedtime drinks. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that unemployment and parental attitudes are important as determinants of dental caries in five-year-old children from North and West Belfast. These factors may influence the child's dental health care as well as type of diet."
3701582,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors."
6886584,"Dietary, social, and constitutional determinants of plasma concentrations of some major risk factors for ischaemic heart disease were investigated in a cross sectional study among 711 men from the general population aged 30-69. For high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) six variables were significantly associated with plasma concentrations, and these variables explained 12.6% of the variance. For low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (T-C), and triglyceride 8.4%, 7.5%, and 18.5% of the variance was explained by significantly associated variables. Fibrinogen concentrations determined chemically were significantly associated with age, smoking habit, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and intake of cereal fibre (24.2% variance). These data provide some encouragement for the possibility of dietary intervention to influence plasma concentrations of major risk factors for ischaemic heart disease in men."

6814269,"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful."
2650741,"Perinatal mortality in Belgium remains high compared with other countries of Western Europe, although a marked decrease was observed during the period from 1956 to 1984. Analysis of the death causes indicates that further progress is feasible. Social inequalities and geographic variation are persisting in spite of the long-established policy of social welfare and free access to health services. Most of the studies on perinatal mortality in Belgium are descriptive and based on data recorded in birth and infant death certificates. In the future, alternative sources of information should be used to analyze more precisely and to understand more clearly the interactions between the different determinants of perinatal mortality and to evaluate the impact of social and health services."
6684973,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts."
8959415,"The determinants of contraceptive implant discontinuation within six months of insertion were examined among 786 low-income women attending family planning clinics in three U.S. cities. The six-month cumulative life-table discontinuation rate was 7.6%. Menstrual side effects were the most common reasons given for early implant removal, although women who discontinued use were no more likely than those who continued with the method to report menstrual irregularities. Women who opted for early removal were more likely than those who continued with the method to experience headaches, hair loss, weight gain and arm infection. Logistic regression analysis indicates that dissatisfaction with prior contraceptive methods, a partner who wants a child within the next two years, perceived pressure from health care providers to choose the implant, exposure to negative media coverage and the number of implant side effects significantly predict early implant discontinuation. Women's social and demographic characteristics, Medicaid status and motivation to avoid an unplanned pregnancy were not significantly related to early removal."
10162860,"Occupational safety and health researchers seek to conduct effective cancer awareness campaigns to increase agricultural workers' skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Georgia undertook such a project using a social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) conceptual model, with its objectives focusing on personal determinants of and environmental influences on farmers' behavior. One underused strategy to increase the success of health campaigns, formative evaluation, was undertaken during year one of the demonstration project, with four goals. These included an assessment of: (1) the availability of societal resources to support farmers' practices, (2) the affordability for farmers to follow through with behaviors being promoted, (3) the social support for behaving in ways that reduce farmers' skin cancer risk, and (4) farmers' current knowledge, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy in this regard. Formative evaluation revealed an absence of information, products, services, and social support for farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. As a result, the Georgia project's plan was refined to include specific activities aimed at increasing the environmental support for health promotion activities relating to farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. These include a seminar for rural primary care physicians and public health nurses to increase knowledge and skills relating to conducting clinical skin exams; programs for agricultural extension agents, cotton scouts, and 4-H groups to provide opportunities to learn more about and practice sun safety; and a feed and seed store campaign."

3182366,"A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers."

Evidence is presented for opioid-mediated influences of milk and its major constituents and for nonopioid-mediated channels for contact comfort. Consideration of these factors might help us better understand some of the determinants of human feeding disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa.

The results indicate that ""the migration-related growth of non-white populations in northern metropolitan areas during the 1960s was...importantly and directly associated both with the level of employment opportunities as measured by the proportion of the non-white population of labor force age officially employed in the mainstream economy of an SMSA and with the SMSA rate of net migration occurring over the preceding 10-year period, which indicates the role of chain migration."""
6701952,"This paper applies the diffusion of innovations model to the study of the birth control discontinuance of first-time users in the Dominican Republic. Two sets of factors are examined: social characteristics of the adopters are used to test Rogers's and Shoemaker's contention that discontinuers have more traditional values than continuers; and the adoption decision process is analyzed to identify the relationship of communication factors to discontinuance. Although number of children and experience of method problems were the major determinants of discontinuance, unfavorable information from friends and other birth control users was a significant factor. Rumor was found to have little effect on a women's decision to continue or discontinue."
3812821,"This paper attempts to define the characteristics of the ""insolvable problem"" in the dynamics of suicidal children. It posits that part of the underlying dynamics of suicidal children is being pressured to solve a problem, in the family milieu, which is beyond the child's--and often anybody else's--ability to resolve. Moreover, the paper outlines the possible relation between the insolvable problem and various determinants involved in suicidal behavior such as depression, helplessness, hopelessness, rigidity, etc. This discussion will be accompanied by case demonstrations."
3629664,"Data from a 1982 sample survey of 3,830 married women below age 50 in a district of Beijing City are applied to the Bongaarts model of the proximate determinants of fertility. A total fertility rate (TFR) of 0.75 births per woman is estimated from the model, compared with a TFR of 1.24 actually observed from the survey. The estimated TFR (0.75) results from the assumed total fecundity (TF) of 15.30 births per woman being inhibited by the indexes of the proximate determinants of fertility, most notably non-marriage (.280), contraception (.315), and induced abortion (.586). The effects of two other proximate determinants, lactational infecundability and spousal separation, were negligible. Comparative data from other countries confirm that the study area has very low levels of fertility and marriage, a very high prevalence of induced abortion, and a small effect of lactational infecundability. The extremely low level of fertility was, thus, achieved through a high level of induced abortion. Future research needs and policy implications associated with the study are discussed."
3223165,"Multi-dimensional investigation in the peculiarities, clinical course and possible mechanisms of neurotic disorders was performed in 115 patients. In order to study the further course of neurotic disorders and their determinants, as well as the issues of social rehabilitation and psychoprophylactic interferences, 56 patients were studied again after 6 to 8 years. For each of the symptom complexes investigated, the course had distinct features determined primarily by adaptation-compensatory capabilities of personality, and the ""system of psychological defense"". Most unfavorable was the course of hysterical disorders. Therapeutic policy in these patients should be grounded upon the psychotherapeutic measures aimed at finding the ways that would be psychologically adequate for changing the patients' attitudes and restoring their adaptation."
3714667,"Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in different socioeconomic and educational groups in Finland. The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes.

""Since nineteenth century emigration took place mostly through primary contacts this article will examine the newly established immigrant settlements as 'communities transplanted'...which directs our research to include local municipal records such as population censuses, population registers (which were supplemented after 1861 with registers of in- and out-migration), tax records, and records of vital events like marriage, birth and death registers. The quality and availability of these records vary from place to place, but generally speaking, in the case of the Netherlands, they are of high quality since population registration at the municipal level was required by law. The source of information for the local records are the population registers (Bevolkings Registers) which were originally constructed on the basis of information obtained from the 1850 population census...."""
6656327,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension."
10453105,"Studies of migrants and comparisons of rural versus urban communities are potentially informative study designs because they allow examination of genetically similar population subgroups exposed to diverse environmental conditions. These designs have been underused in Africa, where recent urbanization has created many situations in which nearby communities of common ethnicity and culture live under different social and economic circumstances. The International Study of Hypertension in Blacks (ICSHIB) conducted several overlapping surveys in Nigeria starting in 1993. These surveys were based primarily in the rural village of Idere and the urban community of Idikan, both inhabited by people defined ethnically as Oyo Yoruba and sharing a common language and culture. Survey teams collected standardized blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, and some study participants provided 24-hr urine samples and questionnaire data on psychosocial stress and social integration. Rural and urban groups differed substantially in blood pressure and related characteristics. Age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure > or = 140/90 mm Hg) for participants aged 25 years and older was 7-8% in Idere and 24-27% in Idikan. The distributions of overweight, sodium/potassium ratio, perceived stress, and social integration scores all contributed to lower hypertension risk in Idere. The effects and interactions of these identified risk factors remain poorly understood, even among people who share a common genetic background, similar diet, and many other lifestyle features. Nonetheless, the rural-urban distinction is sufficiently salient to engender a nearly threefold difference in hypertension prevalence. This disparity in disease prevalence demonstrates the sensitivity of human beings to the environmental determinants of disease and provides a sobering example of the difficulty in identifying subtle genetic effects, which can be easily overwhelmed by small differences in environmental exposures."
7664129,"Following two previous articles which described changes that are occurring in suicide rates and trends in factors known to be associated with suicides, this article examines in greater depth the effect of occupation and geography on suicide mortality. For both men and women the highest risk occupations are mostly in Social Class I or II. The occupations at highest risk, which include several medical-related professions, and the method of suicide they choose, suggest that easy access to means of suicide is an important factor. Suicide rates for men aged 15-44 are generally higher in Inner London, rural areas, resort and retirement areas, and urban manufacturing areas."
9919629,"Northern Nigeria has a maternal mortality ratio greater than 1,000 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Serious maternal morbidity (for example, vesico-vaginal fistula) is also common. Among the most important factors contributing to this tragic situation are: an Islamic culture that undervalues women; a perceived social need for women's reproductive capacities to be under strict male control; the practice of purdah (wife seclusion), which restricts women's access to medical care; almost universal female illiteracy; marriage at an early age and pregnancy often occurring before maternal pelvic growth is complete; a high rate of obstructed labor; directly harmful traditional medical beliefs and practices; inadequate facilities to deal with obstetric emergencies; a deteriorating economy; and a political culture marked by rampant corruption and inefficiency. The convergence of all of these factors has resulted in one of the worst records of female reproductive health existing anywhere in the world."
2065113,"Vulnerability to substance abuse is an important emerging issue. A critical aspect of this phenomenon is the degree to which individuals who abuse one substance are likely to abuse other substances, alone or in combination with each other. The extent to which several distinct drugs will come to serve as positive reinforcers within genetically defined subjects defines their commonality. Questions in this area are directed at determining whether reinforcement from and abuse of alcohol and other drugs define variations within a single behavioral phenomenon, or whether reinforcement and abuse must be individually defined for each substance involved. Findings related to this commonality issue are now emerging from the areas of pharmacogenetics and operant drug self-administration. Previous studies have shown that ethanol can be readily established as a positive reinforcer in LEWIS rats, as well as C57BL/6J mice. In low ethanol preferring F344 rats, ethanol maintains significant but low levels of responding. Ethanol does not maintain lever pressing behavior in BALB/cJ mice, and is avoided in DBA/2J mice. Initial findings reported in this paper show that these genotypic patterns of reinforcement from ethanol appear to correlate highly with patterns of reinforcement from cocaine and opiates. From these findings it is concluded that (1) there exist important genetic determinants of drug reinforced behavior; and (2) drug seeking behaviors maintained by ethanol, cocaine and opiates may have at least some common biological determinants."
7282978,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology."
2926701,"This study used a subsample of 543 married couples from a large group of families in Utah, who were originally studied to assess the genetic and environmental determinants of hypertension. Excluding individuals on medication and controlling for the major risk factors for hypertension, evidence was obtained for cross-spouse blood pressure associations equal in magnitude to self-psychosocial and demographic measures. Observed spouse-spouse similarity for blood pressures remained significant after adjustment for shared psychological factors. It is speculated that different aspects of each spouse's nonmarital environments (e.g. work, social support) have differential impacts on the marital environment and on physiologic indicators of health."

The results demonstrate the substantial impact of differences in child survival and educational attainment on the intercountry variance of fertility rate ranges from 46-84%), while economic indicators (per capita gross national product and % labor force in agriculture) have slight net impact."
8666516,"Establishing causal relationships has been and is today a matter of debate in epidemiology. The observational nature of epidemiological research rends difficult the proving of these relationships. Related to this, different models and causal criteria have been proposed in order to explain health and disease determinants, from pure determinism in Koch postulates, accepting unicausal explanation for diseases, to more realistic multicausal models. In occupational health it is necessary to formulate causal models and criteria to assess causality, and frequently causal assessment in this field has important social, economic and juridical relevance. This paper deal with evaluation of causal relationships in epidemiology and this evaluation is illustrated with a recent example of an occupational health problem in our milieu: the Ardystil case."
1480790,"Today, we know the caries aetiology and prevention rather well. We also know that caries-related levels of dental health are inequitably distributed among social classes: on the average, disadvantaged people experience higher DMFS then privileged people. This difference can be explained by a differential access to health care, which can be shown by the study of components of the DMFS index: proportion of filled surfaces (F/DMFS), proportion of missing surfaces (M/DMFS), and proportion of recurrent caries (secondary caries/filled surfaces). Though we are able to describe the social distribution of levels of dental care, we cannot ""explain"" the differences we observe. The explanation of those differences defines the field of social epidemiology. This consists in determining the social aetiology of diseases, starting from social determinants of attitudes and behaviors influencing health."
3481909,"Problems with current definitions of mental retardation were recognized. Classification systems based on the behavioral capabilities of retarded persons were criticized since there are so many noncognitive determinants of performance. It was proposed that mental retardation be defined solely by IQ scores at least 2 SDs below the population mean. This suggestion was predicated on the view that the behavioral sciences currently have no better way to assess intellectual functioning. Etiology was seen as such a significant predictor of group differences that the organic, familial, and undifferentiated categories would be used in classification. Social adaptation and expected performance were seen as correlates of class membership rather than defining features of retardation, since they have no reliable method of measurement. Problems of labeling were discussed, but the practice was deemed useful if it leads to beneficial services and interventions."
9465373,"This study researched the effects of cognitive variables on recycling behavior, as well as effects of various media of influence on the cognition and behavior. According to Hirose (1994), the decision making process for recycling consists of two steps. The first leads to goal intention of an ecological lifestyle. The second is related to behavior intention of recycling in line with the goal intention. Mass media, such as newspaper and TV, are thought to influence beliefs about environmental problems, including three determinants of goal intention: perception of seriousness, responsibility, and effectiveness. Personal media, such as personal contacts with pro-environmental activists, are thought to influence evaluation of behavior, including three determinants of behavior intention: evaluation of feasibility, cost and benefits, and social norms. Local media, such as municipal announcement and circular, are hypothesized to have a mixed effect of the two. Path analysis indicated that goal intention affected recycling behavior through behavior intention. Effects of the three media of influence on the cognitive variables were also consistent with the hypothesis."
7639921,"This paper explores the frequency of occurrence of highway accidents on the basis of a multivariate analysis of roadway geometrics (e.g. horizontal and vertical alignments), weather, and other seasonal effects. Based on accident data collected in the field, a negative binomial model of overall accident frequencies is estimated along with models of the frequency of specific accident types. Interactions between weather and geometric variables are proposed as part of the model specifications. The results of the analysis uncover important determinants of accident frequency. By studying the relationship between weather and geometric elements, this paper offers insight into potential measures to counter the adverse effects of weather on highway sections with challenging geometrics."
12293088,"""In this paper, the impact of the West German pension system on the retirement decisions of elderly citizens is analyzed within the framework of a discrete-time hazard rate model deduced from a micro-economic decision rule. The model is estimated using a panel dataset of elderly West German citizens. In order to improve the precision of the estimates obtained, the data from the sample are combined with aggregate-level information on the labour force participation behaviour of the elderly. Policy simulations based on the estimates reveal that the probability of early retirement can be reduced significantly by appropriate changes in the pension system."""
12321105,"""Based on the argument that values and expectations underlie behavioral motives, this study explores the determinants of migration-related values and expectations, and whether they are intervening factors in explaining intentions to move among residents of rural northeast Thailand. Data from the 1992 National Migration Survey of Thailand identify four migration-related value-expectancy dimensions: income, affiliation, stimulation, and comfort. Logistic regression analysis shows that landownership and being married are associated with higher expectations, while a diversified village economy, a village economy development program, and a younger and extended household structure are associated with lower expectations of attaining valued goals in the local rural village. The analysis also shows that value-expectancy concepts are only partial intervening explanations for intentions to move or stay."""
8203689,"OBJECTIVES: This study addresses the question of whether inequalities in premature mortality related to educational level differ among countries. METHODS: Data on mortality by educational level were obtained from longitudinal studies from nine industrialized countries. The data referred to men between 35 and 64 years of age. The follow-up periods occurred between 1970 and 1982. The size of mortality differences associated with educational level was measured by means of two inequality indices, both based on Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: Inequalities in mortality are relatively small in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and about two times as large in the United States, France, and Italy. Finland and England and Wales occupy intermediate positions. The large inequalities in mortality in the United States and France can be attributed in part to large inequalities in education in these countries. CONCLUSIONS: The international pattern found in this study was also observed in a comparison that used occupation as the socioeconomic indicator. Differences between countries in levels of inequality in mortality may be partially explained by the countries' different levels of egalitarian social and economic policies."
6541496,"The effects of two methoxyindoles, melatonin (MEL) and 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTL), on partner investigation and other aspects of pair behaviour in the open field, were observed on male and female mice of the albino TO, and the pigmented C57BL/6 strains. Both indole derivatives are major secretory products of rodent (and human) pineal glands. They were administered by i.p. injection (100 micrograms/kg) to both members of the pair 1 h before each 10 min open field exposure. The testing took place on 3 consecutive days. There were no significant differences in behaviour over days, and group means were used in subsequent data analysis (MANOVA and Dunnet's test). Males, more socially active than the females in both strains, responded to MEL by a reduction in contact time; 5-MTL had the same effect on C57 males (TO males showed no change). Females, on the other hand, did not respond to MEL, and increased their social contact seeking after 5-MTL. There was no consistent effect of either indole on locomotion, and erratic (TO strain only) effects on defaecation. The data are discussed in terms of possible actions of pineal indoles on determinants of social behaviour."
4034814,"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration."
9268254,"OBJECTIVES: The authors explore the determinants of having a regular source of care in a community-based probability sample of homeless adults in Los Angeles. Results from this study should be more representative than those from previous studies of the homeless that are clinic- or shelter-based. In addition to those factors found to be barriers to regular sources of care in the general population, we hypothesized that psychosocial characteristics of the homeless and the homeless lifestyle would negatively impact their likelihood of having a regular source of care. METHODS: The authors conducted a multiple logistic regression to predict regular source of care among the homeless, using an adaptation of the Behavioral Model of health services utilization as an analytic framework. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the sample reported that they had a regular source of care. Of those with a source of care, 30% reported a hospital outpatient department; 25% reported a community or homeless clinic; 23% reported a hospital emergency room; 14% reported a government clinic; and 9% reported a private physician's office as their source of care. Some factors found to be barriers to having a regular source of care in the general population (male, Hispanic, young age) also were barriers among homeless adults. Additional barriers in this sample included homelessness-related characteristics such as competing needs, long-term homelessness, and social isolation. Chronic mental illness and chronic substance dependence were not related to having a source of care among the homeless. Characteristics that increased the likelihood of having a regular source of care in the general population (poor health status, Medicaid) were not related to having a regular source of care among the homeless. CONCLUSIONS: In a context of limited resources, the distribution of regular source of care among the homeless appears to be highly inequitable. Although some of the characteristics identifying those with a regular source of care suggest differential patterns of behavior across subgroups, others suggest differential advantage in access to care and a lack of fit between the needs of the homeless and the organization of health services."
3494378,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy."
12320554,"""In the Netherlands, the social meaning of both marriage and cohabitation has changed. Cohabitation started as an alternative way of living, developed into a temporary phase before marriage, and finally became a strategy for moving into a union gradually.... This article addresses the question whether or not individual past and current life-course experiences become increasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into marriage across female birth cohorts, and yet become decreasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into cohabitation across female birth cohorts. This question is examined using a non-proportional hazard model. Empirical evidence supports this hypothesis strongly, in that both past determinants such as family size or religion and current life-course determinants such as work or education change in their impact on cohabitation and marriage across birth cohorts."""
10519460,"This investigation predicted adolescents' delay of intercourse onset from attitudes, social norms, and self-efficacy about refraining from sexual intercourse. Age, gender, ethnicity, and parental education were also examined as predictors and moderators of the relationships among the 3 psychosocial determinants and onset. The participants (N = 827), part of a cohort initially surveyed in the 9th grade, reported at baseline that they had never engaged in intercourse. The multivariable proportional hazards regression model suggested that adolescents with more positive attitudinal and normative beliefs, as well as those with a parent who graduated from college, were less likely to engage in intercourse in the follow-up period (up to approximately 2 years). Interventions that include an objective to delay onset may benefit from addressing psychosocial determinants, especially attitudes and norms about sexual intercourse."

6706795,"A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed.

2487128,"This report assesses current knowledge about the ecological determinants of child maltreatment and presents data from an aggregate study of co-variation between seven community characteristics and maltreatment rates. A review of these findings revealed literature in the early stages of development. Nothing is known about the ecology of sexual abuse, and studies of physical abuse and neglect have done little more than demonstrate co-variation between reported incidence and neighborhood population and housing characteristics. Study findings reveal that (a) five of the seven community characteristics are significant and independent correlates of neglect, and four are correlates of abuse; (b) the strongest predictors of both types of maltreatment are percentage of families with income less than 200% of poverty and percent of vacant housing; and (c) the pattern of co-variation between the two economic stress indicators and three inadequate social support indicators are consistent with the ecological hypothesis. Discussion focuses on interpretation of findings and recommendations for future research."

Preliminary results suggest that certain specific behaviour characteristics can be identified in individuals with elevated blood pressure already in childhood and adolescence. Cluster analysis showed that subjects with higher blood pressure do not constitute a psychologically homogeneous group but can be classed into one of the following three subgroups: individuals with ""High Academic Performance"", ""Dysthymic Behaviour"" or ""Behavioural Disturbances"". The relationship between blood pressure and behavioural factors is not mediated by covariables such as social status, sexual maturity, body mass, smoking habits, etc."
10189981,"The present study examined gender, race, and binge status differences in alcohol consumption among Caucasian and African-American college students as well as situational differences as qualified by the race of binge drinkers. A confidential questionnaire was voluntarily completed by Caucasians (n = 102) and African-Americans (n = 81) at a medium-sized regional university. The data analysis revealed a significant gender effect on alcohol consumption, with men consuming more alcohol than women. There was no significant main effect of race on alcohol consumption. In addition, Caucasian binge drinkers had significantly higher interpersonal problem behavior scores than did binge-drinking African-Americans, and binge-drinking African-Americans had higher intrapersonal problem behavior scores than did binge-drinking Caucasians."
3407490,"The influence of parental factors on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use has been examined previously, and findings have been contradictory. Previous studies, which found little relationship between parental norms and adolescent sexual activity, have been limited by their failure to recognize developmental differences in the relative weight of parent and peer influences between younger and older teens and by use of selected samples, resulting in a restriction of range. The current study differs in that it utilizes a clustered sample household survey of 329 males and females, aged 14 to 17, and 470 of their parents. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that parents' reported behavioral norms account for 5% of the variance in whether adolescents have had intercourse, and for 33% of the variance in use of contraception at last intercourse. The study suggests that while parents' normative beliefs have limited effect in the decision to become sexually active, they have considerable impact on later contraceptive use."
6705636,"This essay is based on the assumption that a long-neglected topic of socialization, the determinants of individual differences in parental functioning, is illuminated by research on the etiology of child maltreatment. Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child."
8857378,"Converging with psycho-social research findings, animal and human laboratory studies indicate that behavioral alternatives are important determinants of drug-taking. To investigate associations between how early adolescents spend their time, i.e. their behavioral repertoire and drug use (use of marijuana, crack/cocaine or inhalants), we analyzed data from an epidemiological sample of 1516 urban middle-school students who had completed private interviews in spring 1993. The interview included a 36-item questionnaire to assess how frequently the youth engaged in different activities; history of drug-taking was assessed separately. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate associations between drug use and each of seven behavioral domains as well as sex, age and racial-ethnic status. Youths spending a great deal of time working for pay and assuming other adult-like roles were more likely to have initiated drug use (estimated odds ratio, OR = 3.49; p = 0.002). Those who spent much time in religious activities were less likely (OR = 0.2, p <0.001). An exploratory search for interactions disclosed other associations that merit attention in future research. These results corroborate evidence on the potential etiological significance of behavioral repertoire in relation to risk of drug use."
17093748,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting."
7959400,"The main determinants of rehospitalization of elderly people were studied with a longitudinal sample of 264 persons older than 60 years at a midwestern, urban, university-affiliated hospital. Path analysis was applied to survey data collected for this study. Seventeen percent of subjects were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, the main determinant of readmission was the discharge placement; those placed back into the community for care in the home were more likely to be rehospitalized than those discharged to institutions. Contrary to predictions in the literature and the authors' expectations, patient involvement in discharge planning had no discernible effect on placement decisions and subsequent hospitalization. The implications of these findings for discharge planning by social workers are discussed."

1941951,"Health care systems, irrespective of how they are financed, present the paradox that to some observers they appear as a major component of social benefits, while to other observers they seem both excessively costly and limited in their effectiveness. These differing perceptions may be explained in part by the diversity of the determinants of health and disease, only some of which are amenable to those preventive or therapeutic measures encompassed in a health care system--the majority of determinants being genetic, societal, or else uninfluenced by those interventions at present available within a health service. The share of national resources which should be devoted to health care, and the method of raising resources, are primarily matters for political decision; but a national system has advantages both of economy and of comprehensiveness. But when it comes to allocation of resources within the established health budget, the knowledge and skills of health professionals are essential to informed decision-making. The possibilities depend critically on the 'state of the art' at a given time, as is illustrated by the radical changes over time in what could be done for patients with renal failure; and health professionals are likely to be most aware of current options, and of how to choose between them. More speculatively, they are also less likely to confuse the attitudes appropriate to providing a service with those required to run a business."
17806340,"Social insects live in societies that include both reproductive and nonreproductive adults. Understanding the factors that determine which individuals become successful reproductives is necessary to explain the evolution of these societies. The phenotypic effects of the gene Pgm-3 (or a closely linked gene) that may cause workers of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta to selectively execute all queens of a specific genotype were investigated. These effects, which involve differences in queen reproductive development, are expressed only in colonies exhibiting a particular type of social organization (multiple-queen colonies), and it is only in such colonies that selective execution on the basis of genotype occurs. This is an unusual example of genotype-environment interaction in gene expression in which the environmental component is the social environment. The queens executed are, surprisingly, those with the greatest reproductive development. Thus, there is a counterintuitive relation between the potential and realized reproductive success of queens in multiple-queen societies of this ant."
2784327,"A survey of all registered deaths which occurred during 1981-1983 in women of reproductive age was carried out in Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause."
7031748,"Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes."

The first section will discuss: (1) the concept of culture, (2) hierarchical levels of human behavior determinants, (3) the cultural variability continuum, and (4) the concept of self. The second section will discuss: (1) epidemiology, (2) culture and clinical phenomenology in severe disorders, and (3) culture as an etiological determinant. The paper closes with a discussion of some conclusions and suggestions for future research."
10067904,"Analysis of vital statistics for the Czech Republic between 1986 and 1993, including 3,254 infant deaths from 350,978 first births to married and single women who conceived at ages 18-29 years, revealed a neonatal survival advantage for low-weight infants born to disadvantaged (single, less educated) women, particularly for deaths from congenital anomalies. This advantage largely disappeared after the neonatal period. The same patterns have been observed for low-weight infants born to black women in the United States. Since the Czech Republic had an ethnically homogenous population, virtually universal prenatal care, and uniform institutional conditions for delivery, Czech results must be attributed to social rather than to biologic or medical circumstances. This strengthens the contention that in the United States, the black neonatal survival paradox may be due as much to race-related social stigmatization and consequent disadvantage as to any hypothesized hereditary influences on birth-weight-specific survival."
7391772,"The family imprints its members with selfhood in all cultures. Absence of family imprints can result in the development of deviant childhood behavior and loss of identity. In two black racial groups in dissimilar world areas and sampling (Kenya, Africa and Newark, N.J.), five familial determinants interfered with the development of culturally accepted family imprints and led to deviant and criminal behavior. It is suggested that if these deterrents, namely poverty, lack of family authority figures, rejection of of the individual child, absence of family cohesiveness, and loss of individual identity within the family, were altered in their development by family therapy techniques, then criminal and deviant behavior would be decreased."

First, it is argued that Korea has passed the turning point since Korea needs to accept foreign labor for unskilled jobs for some sectors of the economy. Second, we analyze factors which led Korea to reach this turning point in international migration in the context of demographic change and industrial upgrading. Third, Korea's overseas employment as well as its policy of guestworkers are also discussed in the context of the country's structural adjustment. Then, policy options concerning foreign labor import are suggested."""

24302171,"Within our present health care system, there is a growing movement that argues that our perceptions of health and illness are in need of change. This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited."

16203507,"The health effects of alcohol are determined not only by level of intake but also by patterns of alcohol use and many other health determinants. This study seeks to identify groups of individuals who share various features in terms of drinking styles and other health indicators. Data used are a subset of the 1990 Ontario Health Survey, corresponding to men and women aged 20-64 with complete data in four substantive areas: alcohol use; demographic characteristics; current health status; and various behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Cluster analysis was used to groups of male and female respondents who were similar in terms of their style of alcohol use, along with other constructs relevant to health risk and health status. For both sexes, clusters were identified which matched expectation in terms of drinking patterns and other relevant variables. For both sexes, clusters were found with generally higher social class indicators, generally positive health behaviours and health status and drinking patterns which did not include drinking to excess. Clusters were also found for which high-volume drinking occasions corresponded with poor health status and high levels of risk factors for chronic disease. Other unanticipated patterns were also identified. This information may assist in identifying confounding effects in epidemiological studies as well as identifying the characteristics of unique sub-populations which are likely to be the focus of primary prevention efforts."
7124811,"Social desirability and intellectual limitations were investigated as possible determinants of two response biases--acquiescence and naysaying--among mentally retarded respondents. Results clearly indicated that naysaying and acquiescence occur more frequently among lower IQ individuals and naysaying occurs more frequently concerning prohibited behavior, whereas respondents acquiesce regarding desirable behavior. These results suggest that intellectual limitations predispose people to biased responding, whereas social desirability factors determine the type of bias."
2236224,"The purpose of this article is to examine movement science research on personal and social-environmental motivational influences in physical activity contexts. Motivation is defined as a process in which internal and external factors direct and energize thoughts, feelings, and actions. Motivation is described as a consequence of meaning, which is derived from a combination of personal and social factors, including personal goals or incentives, expectations of personal efficacy, movement-related perceptual and affective experiences, and social and physical features of the environment. Recent literature from sport and exercise psychology is presented on these variables, their determinants, and their consequences for choice, effort, persistence, and performance behavior in exercise and sport contexts."
6856718,"This essay will attempt to show, citing evidence from diverse sources, that eye contact plays a central role in interpersonal relations. The eyes preface most new relationships, overshadowing other sensory inputs while transmitting a wide assortment of emotional cues. Visual behavior may at times prove decisive in assuring survival, in amorous encounters, and in clarifying interpersonal motives. Ocular performance, a final common pathway for many social, cultural and emotional determinants, is a crucial factor in defining relationships and in allowing reciprocal influences to be exchanged as persons relate. In psychiatric patients, ocular behavior may provide clues to diagnosis. A common finding in such persons is gaze aversion, a social avoidance phenomenon which indicates a desire to attenuate the interpersonal experience and thereby decrease anxiety."

A Whittaker-Henderson filter is applied to various variables presumably linked to the total fertility index in order to retrieve and isolate the trend, which then enables concentration on residuals' co-variations. A regression analysis then enables assessment of the factors' weights and the short term's influence (business cycle). Governmental incentives, notably between 1988 and 1990, appear as having contributed, as well as the overall economic conjuncture, to the observed total fertility index raise in the course of this period."

We derive conditions under which different incentives, weak or strong, hold for different individuals.... Our analysis enables us to explain several perplexing migratory phenomena, identify income inequality as a distinct explanatory variable of migration and establish an incentive to migrate in situations where the utility-social welfare approach does not."""
20841128,"This article presents a multidimensional model of psychosocial determinants of health behavior for health promotion research and policy analysis. Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented."

The models for men and women did not differ significantly. The findings suggest interventions to increase LTPA participation that enhance health self-determinism and social influences on exercise and influence the negative attitudes toward exercise held by those who have poorer perceived health status, smoke, or are overweight."
8150669,"The inhibition of physiological habituation in patients with chronic aural tinnitus extends from the level of cellular processing to psychologic and psychosocial determinants. The following hypotheses were tested in 32 patients with chronic tinnitus and 30 patients of a comparable clinical control group: tinnitus patients differ concerning (1) the perception of social support, (2) a disposition to psychosomatic diseases, (3) coping with stress and (4) certain personality traits. Standard psychological tests were used as well as a detailed examination of at least 30 minutes. Results showed that the tinnitus patients statistically perceived less social support and more social distress compared to the control group. They also showed significantly poorer results in coping with stress. Increased social distress in a number of cases resulted in noticeable decompensation. Additionally, a disposition to psychosomatic disorders increased, so that conflicts arising expressed themselves in various functional diseases. In most cases psychiatric exploration showed a vocational or familial overcharge. In patients experiencing decompensation, close cooperation with a psychotherapist is required."

The variables examined in relation to 'preference for institutional care' were those previously examined in relation to supporters' psychological well-being (Gilhooly, 1984). The results indicate that factors within the relationship between supporter and the dependent dementing relative are important determinants of motivation to continue giving support. Other variables significantly associated with advocacy of institutional care included the age of the supporter, supporter's contacts with friends, satisfaction with help from relatives, another dependent relative, and whether or not the supporter was employed. Help from the services and supporters' well-being were not significantly correlated with ratings of preference for institutional care."
8284702,"Survey data from a sample of 575 women from the city of Oaxaca de Juarez, Mexico, are analyzed to ascertain the effect of the receipt of job-related benefits, including health benefits, on the self-reported health status of women, their rating of the health of the members of their household, and their satisfaction with the health of the members of their household. Health status depends on the woman's age, her socioeconomic status, and the number of children she has borne. Her rating of the health of the members of her household is related to her age, her socioeconomic status, and her rating of her own health. Satisfaction with the physical health of the members of the household is a function her health, her rating of the health of her household, her age, her socioeconomic status and the number of children she has borne. The overall conclusion is that, in this study, it is socioeconomic and demographic factors that are important in determining the woman's health status, rather than the receipt of job-related benefits. That she reports good health is an important factor in her view of her family's health and her satisfaction with her own health and that of her family."
9068572,"In this issue (page 639) Dr. Ellen L. Lipman and colleagues show that single motherhood is associated with an increased risk of affective disorder and poverty and with increased rates of mental health services utilization. These findings have important implications for primary prevention interventions that focus on the social determinants of family health. Studies have shown that higher levels of psychological distress among single mothers are more closely related to their exposure to stressors than to their personal vulnerability to stress. Research has also shown that the stresses that affect single-parent families are greater in degree but not in kind than those that affect other families. Therefore, intervention programs that address the needs of all families are preferable to those that target specific types of families. Community-based primary prevention programs can promote the well-being of all families by improving the social and economic conditions in which they live."
9693925,"The association between laryngeal contact granuloma and demographic/psychological variables was examined by using a psychosomatic approach to health research. A stepwise procedure of logistic regression analyses was utilized to get a final multivariate model of variables associated with the clinical finding of a laryngeal contact granuloma. The subjects consisted of 47 patients with contact granulomas and 110 patients with voice disorders due to other causes. Our analysis of 22 variables uncovered the following statistically significant factors for developing a contact granuloma: male gender (P = 0.0001), low achievement orientation (P = 0.0007), fear of physical lesions (P = 0.0038), impulsiveness (P = 0.0016), age > 60 years (P = 0.0012), low extraversion (P = 0.004), high achievement orientation (P = 0.0079), fear of appearing in public (P = 0.0216) and strain (P = 0.03). These results show that a variety of variables are important for predicting the development of a laryngeal contact granuloma. The usefulness of this set of risk variables for predicting a contact granuloma remains to be proved in a prospective study. It is possible that not only the nature but the number of risk factors are the prime determinants of outcome."

3292101,"Drugs ingested by a lactating mother would be expected to appear in human milk to some extent and be ingested by a breast-feeding infant. Drugs pass from maternal plasma into milk by passive diffusion and are distributed within the aqueous, protein and lipid phases of milk. Distribution into milk will be affected by physiochemical characteristics of the drug: acid-base characteristics, relative protein binding in plasma and milk, and lipid solubility, as well as milk composition. The milk-to-plasma concentration ratio is the most commonly quoted index of drug distribution into human milk. However, calculation of the daily infant dose of drug ingested in milk, and from this the dose in milk relative to the maternal dose on a weight-adjusted basis, is a more relevant indicator of infant exposure to a drug. This is particularly true for drugs with a high volume of distribution, for which only a small proportion of the mother's dose is contained within the plasma and available for distribution into milk. A better indication of infant exposure to a drug is the steady-state plasma drug concentration in a breast-feeding infant, the major determinants of which are the dose rate (via milk) and the oral availability and clearance in the infant. Although in neonates the rate of absorption may be different from adults, there is little evidence that its extent is significantly different. Clearance, however, is impaired in very young infants, particularly if premature. The decreased clearance would result in a proportional increase in steady-state plasma concentrations in the breast-feeding infant. Consideration of the dose ingested in milk and the approximate clearance in infants of different ages allows estimation of likely steady-state plasma concentrations in breast-feeding infants. From these considerations, recommendations regarding the safety of drugs during breast-feeding can be made. Drugs which are very toxic or have dose-independent toxicity should be considered separately. Recommendations regarding 'social' drugs such as nicotine, alcohol, caffeine and theobromine are particularly difficult, as doses are uncontrolled and vary variable."
3609410,"This paper proposes and carries out a two-stage analysis of the determinants of desired family size, using data gathered from a sample of women in the city of Ilorin, Nigeria. The analysis first focuses on differences between women who report numerical family size desires and those who report nonnumerical desires. Findings suggest that there are important differences between these two groups, but there is little variation in the actual number reported by those expressing numerical desires. Implications of these findings for survey design are discussed. In particular, the practice of forcing numerical responses by instructing interviewers to probe when women report nonnumerical desires is questioned."
10724473,"While it is established that socioeconomic status and social integration influence the distribution of health and illness among men and women, little attention has been paid to the different ways in which women and men experience socioeconomic opportunities and social attachments to others. Drawing on evidence from the literature, the position developed in this article is that gender mediates the influence of both socioeconomic status and social integration on health, and for women, these are intricately linked. Women's relationship to the labour market establishes and perpetuates their socioeconomic inequality relative to men, and may produce contradictory influences on women's health. Furthermore, for women, the marital relationship is paradoxical: marriage may at once improve economic and social support opportunities, while diminishing control over paid and unpaid work--potentially increasing as well as compromising the health status of women. The article is intended to contribute to the growing body of literature on gender and the determinants of health."
9059478,"BACKGROUND: As more developing countries adopt a westernised style of living, an increase in the prevalence of asthma can be expected to occur in these areas. A study was undertaken to establish the normal response to exercise in Ghanaian children and to use these normal values to determine the prevalence of exercise induced bronchospasm (EIB) in urban rich (UR), urban poor (UP), and rural (R) school children. Skin test reactivity to common inhalant allergens in UR, UP, and R children with and without EIB was also investigated. METHODS: Two hundred children aged 9-16 years without a previous history of respiratory symptoms were randomly selected and underwent free running exercise testing. A normal response to exercise was defined as the group mean change in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) +/- 2 standard deviations. This value was used to identify the prevalence of EIB in UR, UP, and R schoolchildren. A total of 1095 children from three different schools underwent exercise testing (220 UP, 599 UR, 276 R), after which 916 children underwent skin prick testing to six common inhalant allergens (D farinae, D pteronyssinus, cat, dog, Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans). RESULTS: From the results of exercise testing in asymptomatic children the normal range was defined as a fall in PEFR of < 12.5% after exercise. Thirty four children were classified as having EIB on the basis of the above definition, giving an overall prevalence of 3.1%. The prevalence of EIB was significantly higher in UR children (4.7%) than in both UP (2.2%; p < 0.05) and R children (1.4%; p < 0.01). However, the prevalence rates in the UP and R children were similar. The prevalence of atopy in the whole population was 4.4%. Of the children with EIB, 10% were skin test positive to at least one of the allergens tested. The prevalence of atopy was significantly higher in UR children (6.55%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.5% to 9.2%) than in UP (2.9%, 95% CI 0.9% to 6.7%) and R children (1.5%, 95% CI 0.4% to 3.7%), respectively (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EIB and atopy is higher in urban rich than in urban poor or rural children suggesting that, in addition to genetic predisposition, social and environmental factors such as wealth, life style, and housing are important determinants of these phenotypes."
8634561,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patients' initial perceptions of their myocardial infarction predict subsequent attendance at a cardiac rehabilitation course, return to work, disability, and sexual dysfunction. DESIGN: Patients' perceptions of their illness were measured at admission with their first myocardial infarction and at follow up three and six months later. SETTING: Two large teaching hospitals in Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS: 143 consecutive patients aged under 65 with their first myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attendance at rehabilitation course; time before returning to work; measures of disability with sickness impact profile questionnaire for sleep and rest, social interaction, recreational activity, and home management; and sexual dysfunction. RESULTS: Attendance at the rehabilitation course was significantly related to a stronger belief during admission that the illness could be cured or controlled (t = 2.08, P = 0.04). Return to work within six weeks was significantly predicted by the perception that the illness would last a short time (t = 2.52, P = 0.01) and have less grave consequences for the patient (t = 2.87, P = 0.005). Patients' belief that their heart disease would have serious consequences was significantly related to later disability in work around the house, recreational activities, and social interaction. A strong illness identity was significantly related to greater sexual dysfunction at both three and six months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' initial perceptions of illness are important determinants of different aspects of recovery after myocardial infarction. Specific illness perceptions need to be identified at an early stage as a basis for optimising outcomes from rehabilitation programmes."

Based on a total sample of 11,695 birth registrations, temporal variation is analysed. For siblings, according to family reconstitution, the total family size, the legitimacy of the child, and birth order are considered. A coefficient of birth month dispersion is defined and estimated for each family. Intra-family variation is related to inter-family coefficients in order to determine whether the local seasonal pattern of births may be partly explained by family characteristics."
2262395,"The purpose of this study was to examine those factors associated with the contraceptive behavior of a national representative sample of Hispanic female adolescents. The subjects included all (n = 85) unmarried, sexually active Hispanic women, aged 15 to 19, from the 1982 National Survey of Family Growth. Contraceptive behavior was measured on a normalized scale, ranging from oral contraceptives to no contraception. Mexican/American and Central/South American background females were more likely (p less than 0.031) to use effective birth control than Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Hispanic background subjects. Twenty additional social, behavioral, and demographic variables were found to be significantly associated (p less than 0.05) with contraceptive behavior. Based on multiple regression analysis, seven of these variables were found to explain 62% (p less than 0.0001) of the variation in the contraceptive behavior of this sample. Poorer contraceptive behavior was associated with noncompliance with the initial birth control method used (33.8%), lower coital frequency (8.3%), older postmenarchial age (5.7%), failure to use birth control at first coitus (4.6%), fewer years dating (4.0%), lower frequency of church attendance (3.3%), and never having experienced a pregnancy scare (2.0%). These findings suggest that the contraceptive behavior of Hispanic female adolescents is a dynamic process that can be understood in the context of previous sexual and contraceptive behavior."
3430425,To evaluate the possible first-night effect on the nocturnal motor activity 25 poor sleepers and 12 good sleepers slept on the Static Charge Sensitive Bed (SCSB) during two consecutive nights. The frequency of body movements in poor sleepers was almost two times higher than in good sleepers. The method itself was reproducible across two nights. There were no statistically significant and systemic level differences between the nights in the movements in bed (MIB). The difference t-test did not either reveal group differences in the magnitude or direction of changes from night to night. Results are consistent with the view that the level of motor activity is one of the determinants of sleep quality. No first-night effect exists in terms of psychomotor activity.
7959400,"The main determinants of rehospitalization of elderly people were studied with a longitudinal sample of 264 persons older than 60 years at a midwestern, urban, university-affiliated hospital. Path analysis was applied to survey data collected for this study. Seventeen percent of subjects were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, the main determinant of readmission was the discharge placement; those placed back into the community for care in the home were more likely to be rehospitalized than those discharged to institutions. Contrary to predictions in the literature and the authors' expectations, patient involvement in discharge planning had no discernible effect on placement decisions and subsequent hospitalization. The implications of these findings for discharge planning by social workers are discussed."
9752284,"The tendency today is to make the population more aware of health in order to encourage their use of prevention activities. The aim of our telephone survey which was performed on a representative sample of the population (1,010) in the Bas-Rhin department in France, was to study the relationship between the level of knowledge of cancer and the use of screening techniques to prevent it. Eighty-two percent of the males and 78% of the females surveyed, show a profound understanding of cancer in general, the associated risk factors and its prevention. The level of awareness of males did not influence a specific behaviour (p = 0.68) towards cancer prevention. It was shown that in smokers, the more they smoke, the more they underestimate the chances of cure from all categories of cancer (p = 0.01). They both overestimate the number of cigarettes needed daily before smoking becomes toxic (p < 0.01) and are less active physically than nonsmokers (p < 0.007). Heavy smokers live in larger communities (p < 0.02) and smokers are younger than non-smokers (p < 0.0001). In the female population, the level of awareness did indeed influence their behaviour towards cancer prevention (p < 0.04). The level of knowledge was higher in both those who consciously attend cancer screening clinics (cervical Papanicolaou smears and faecal tests) and those who are opposed to faecal tests. Younger females are significantly less aware than those who are older (p = 0.0001) and more than two-thirds of these would not consider a cervical Papanicolaou smear as a preventative diagnostic tool. Females who conscientiously attend cancer screening clinics and who are very much aware of cancer, are generally older in age (p < 0.05). The occurrence of mammography as a preventative measure is both high and dependent on age. In conclusion, the level of knowledge of cancer cannot explain alone human behaviour towards the prevention of this disease. Other determinants responsible for influencing human behaviour towards cancer prevention will be better understood once the social sciences, epidemiology and anthropology units work together and combine resources to achieve a common goal."
6695831,"The association between duration of breast-feeding and nutritional status was studied in a population-based sample of 802 children aged 12 to 35.9 months in Southern Brazil during 1982. The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis. These results are also consistent with a controlled trial on supplementary feeding in the Sudan."
1943097,"Genetic models were fitted to self-report data on frequency of alcohol consumption and average quantity consumed when drinking, from 3,810 adult Australian twin pairs. Frequency of consumption is determined both by an abstinence dimension, which is strongly influenced by shared environmental effects but not by genetic effects, and by an independent frequency dimension, which is influenced by genetic effects in both sexes and possibly by shared environmental affects in men. Quantity of alcohol consumed is likewise determined by an environmental abstinence dimension and by an independent and partly heritable quantity dimension. The best-fitting model allowed for two routes to abstinence: those who were not abstainers by virtue of their position on the abstinence dimension could nonetheless become abstainers by their position on the second, frequency (or quantity) dimension. Heritability estimates were 66% in women and 42-75% in men, for frequency; and 57% in women and 24-61% in men, for quantity."
2033624,"The British Government is implementing some major alterations to the way health services in Great Britain are organised. As well as the introduction of competition between health care providers, their financial interests are to be linked to their output, in efforts to use market forces to increase efficiency and cut costs. This paper looks at the possible impact of these changes of health care organisation on ethical medical practice. This is investigated with particular reference to the country whose health service has embraced most closely these elements of the market--the United States of America. The question to be answered is whether high standards of ethical care are ensured by factors somehow intrinsic to the medical profession, and are therefore immune to changes in the economics of health care. This assumption is shown to be questionable in light of what is known about the determinants of ethical medical practice."
6644542,"Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition."
1759089,"The role of single night studies and the determinants of effective nasal continuous positive airway (CPAP) pressures were determined in 412 consecutive patients between 1984 and 1989. Patients chosen for analysis had an apnea index (AI) of greater than or equal to 20 hr-1 prior to CPAP. The AI was 67 +/- 30 hr-1, the body mass index (BMI) was 36 +/- 9 kg/m2, the age was 51 +/- 13 yr and the lowest oxygen saturation was 72 +/- 14%. Effective CPAP (9 +/- 3 cm H2O) was documented in 320 patients on single night studies and resulted in a 99% reduction in the frequency of obstructive events and improvement in the lowest O2 saturation to 94 +/- 5%. Only 18% of the variability in effective CPAP could be explained by AI and BMI. Single night studies are sufficient to establish effective CPAP in 78% of patients and offer considerable conservation of resources compared to routine multiple night studies. Effective CPAP pressures are variable and must be determined by incremental CPAP trials."

This article asks how the schooling levels of husband and wife come to be associated with each other through the marriage market. The Kiefer-Neumann model of labor market search is adapted to marital search, the aim being to explain both the positive sorting on educational levels for spouses, and the positive relationship between female schooling and age at 1st marriage. World Fertility Survey data for Indonesia, Korea, and Malaysia are employed in the analyses."
7740827,"Scenarios are a powerful way to bound the uncertainty of the future--to sketch the major pathways that the future might take. This article contains five scenarios depicting the United States health care system in the 21st century. These explore: an extrapolation of the current system; a single-payer driven system; a market-oriented system which forces more choice on the individual: a scenario which traces a transformation in health care; and a fifth scenario focuses on the healing role of health care. These scenarios acknowledge certain changes which relevant in all of them, e.g., by the early 21st century health care providers in the United States will have shifted to predicting likely health conditions, preventing what can be prevented and managing optimally those conditions which do arise (optimal in the sense of cost-effective treatment in light of the best practices of the day applied in ways which recognize and take advantage of the biochemically unique nature of each individual. Developed in 1991, these scenarios have been successful as a tool for identifying a range of likely paths which health care might take. The scenarios did not foresee the assertiveness of the President of the United States towards health care reform, although it did identify the difficulty which the President's and any other reform efforts would face. At their base, however, the scenarios trace the fundamental shift taking place in health care in spite of financing reforms. This fundamental shift is being driven largely by outcome measures; a commitment to accountability; better and more accessible health knowledge; enhanced technology; and a greater willingness on the part of some sectors of the health care system to deal with the broader determinants of health (e.g., community and economic factors)."
9158292,"The idea that early experiences disproportionately influence adult behaviour has long been a fixture of mainstream developmental theory. Although unambiguous empirical support for this view at the human level is surprisingly sparse, compelling evidence from animal studies abounds. Recent studies with rhesus monkeys have demonstrated dramatic short- and long-term effects of differential early social experiences on both behavioural and physiological functioning. Early social relationships with mothers or other caregivers appear to provide especially powerful determinants of behavioural propensities throughout the lifespan."
6838152,"The determinants of the timing of menarche are many, and it is difficult to isolate a single factor which may delay or accelerate this maturational event. Menarche, on average, occurs later in athletes, including ballet dancers, than in the general population. With few exceptions, the data are consistent across several countries. Swimmers are an exception to the tendency towards later menarche in athletes. In all samples of swimmers surveyed but one, menarche tends to approximate the average for the general population. The menarcheal data are consistent with other indices of biological maturity status, i.e., skeletal age and secondary sex character development. The data dealing with the effects of intensive physical training on menarche are reviewed and given the number of factors involved, it is difficult to implicate training as a factor which specifically delays menarche. A two-part hypothesis for the apparent maturity delay in athletes is thus suggested. The hypothesis combines biological selective factors (i.e., physique and skill) and social factors. Family size and composition, however, must receive more consideration. Family size influences the timing of menarche and such a trend is apparent in data for several groups of athletes."
3399999,"Theoretical consideration of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) suggests that the key determinants of transmission dynamics are the duration of infectiousness and the extent to which subgroups in the population interact sexually. We used two empirical correlates to represent these concepts: (1) the force of infectivity, calculated by summing all the days of potential infectivity (the time between last sexual exposure and treatment of the contact) generated by a given case, and then summing the days for all cases within a given subgroup; (2) self-selection, representing the observed probability that members of a given subgroup select sexual partners from within their own group. Using data gathered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, we estimated that a single group i.e., black, male, heterosexual, military personnel residing in the core areas, generated 27% of the force of infectivity. Subgroups that select greater than 50% of their sexual partners from outside their sociodemographic boundaries generated a rate for the force of infectivity that was 4.5 times higher than the rate for self-selectors. These findings confirm the core group theory and suggest strategies for control of STD."
7794544,"OBJECTIVES: To study trends in prevalence and to ascertain risk factors for HIV-1 among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attenders in Trinidad. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial cross-sectional studies were conducted in 1987-1988 and 1990-1991 at a centralized STD clinic in Port of Spain. A case-control study was carried out to examine in greater detail the demographic and behavioral risk factors for HIV-1 among self-declared heterosexuals in this population. RESULTS: HIV-1 prevalence increased from 3.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-3.9] in 1987-1988 to 13.6% (95% CI, 11.8-15.6) in 1990-1991. Age > or = 40 years [odds ratio (OR), 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8], urban residence (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0), and human T-lymphotropic virus-I seropositivity (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6-6.0) were significant risk factors for HIV-1 in 1990-1991. In the case-control analysis, significant independent risk factors for men included current genital ulcer disease (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.2-12.5), current genital warts (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.0), having ever had syphilis (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.6-6.1), and use of crack cocaine in the preceding 6 months (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.7-14.2). Corresponding risk factors for women were commercial sex work (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.3-25.7), initiation of sexual activity before age 14 years (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.5-16.0), and past non-gonococcal cervicitis (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3-13.1). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 in this setting is primarily heterosexually transmitted in a milieu of unprotected sexual activity fuelled by a crack cocaine epidemic. Targeted interventions to prevent, detect and treat STD and crack cocaine addiction, as well as disrupt their adverse synergism, may substantially reduce HIV-1 transmission in this population."
3834353,"Using ethnicity of surname, nativity, residential social class, and inferred age at migration to characterize and subdivide Hispanics in Los Angeles, we compared risk ratios and proportional incidence ratios to examine the patterns of occurrence of selected neoplasms within the Hispanic community. Common neoplasms for which Hispanics have high, low, and intermediary risk were examined in detail. Although the patterns expected on the basis of current concepts of etiology were generally found and served to reinforce presumptions about the biologic significance of the risk factors, a number of observations cannot be explained easily with current knowledge. The risks for stomach and bowel cancers do not conform to the mirror-image patterns to be expected on the basis of inverse patterns of dietary acculturation. Incidence of cancer of the breast, in contrast to that of cervix, does not appear to reflect early cultural practice. Consistent details in the patterns of cancers of the bladder, rectum, ovary, prostate, and possibly pancreas imply unrecognized determinants of disease. Gallbladder cancer in Hispanic women is the disease most closely tied to Hispanic origin or culture, or both, but the ethnic pattern in women differs greatly from that in men."

Focus group interviews were used to identify the determinants of infant-feeding decisions and the most effective strategies for encouraging women to breastfeed. Motivations and perceived barriers related to breastfeeding and social network influences on feeding choice are discussed. The findings were used to design a multifaceted breastfeeding promotion campaign aimed at new mothers, family members, health professionals, and the community at large."

The investigation is done by means of a single equation framework model, which is applied to U.S. Bureau of the Census data. The results indicate that ""the migration-related growth of non-white populations in northern metropolitan areas during the 1960s was...importantly and directly associated both with the level of employment opportunities as measured by the proportion of the non-white population of labor force age officially employed in the mainstream economy of an SMSA and with the SMSA rate of net migration occurring over the preceding 10-year period, which indicates the role of chain migration."""
10120999,"Coronary heart disease deaths have declined in New Zealand, as in other Western countries, during the past two decades. This is probably due to a combination of population lifestyle changes and improved treatment of the disease. However, the social class gradient for coronary disease has reversed and it is now more common in lower socio-economic groups who are increasingly disadvantaged in our community. Socioeconomic factors are powerful, primary determinants not only of coronary disease but also of many of the other health problems outlined in the New Zealand Health Charter. Policy making and health services delivery shape societal conditions essential for true health. These factors are considered in relation to the spectrum of human communication and the current transitional changes in our health system."
12280405,"An overview of the relationship between demographic factors and rural poverty in developing countries is presented. The author examines both the micro- and macro-level perspectives of this relationship and the determinants and consequences of population growth. The author notes the prospects for a rapid increase in the rural labor force and considers its implications for the agricultural production structure and the need for institutional change. Consideration is also given to the continuing demand for high fertility at the family level and the role of infant and child mortality in the poverty cycle. ""The paper concludes by drawing attention to the need for developing the mechanism for reconciliation of social and individual optima with respect to family size and population growth."" The need for rural development projects that take demographic factors into account is stressed as is the need for effective population programs. (summary in FRE, ITA)"
8506166,"To determine whether gender differences existed in the relationships among potential predictors of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), a heuristic model of nine explanatory variables was tested with the responses of 146 men and 158 women randomly selected from middle- and upper-income census tracts of a midwestern city. The models for men and women did not differ significantly. The findings suggest interventions to increase LTPA participation that enhance health self-determinism and social influences on exercise and influence the negative attitudes toward exercise held by those who have poorer perceived health status, smoke, or are overweight."
2766211,"An increasing number of mothers of preschool children in Canada (either by choice or economic necessity) have entered the work force. It is estimated for example that 58-80% of mothers of preschool children are working. In Canada in 1986, 51.6% of women in the work force had children under the age of five (1). It is beyond the scope and intent of this paper to discuss the merits (or possible harm) of day care per se. The aim of this paper is to discuss aspects of the quality of day care, and how this might be improved by child psychiatrists being involved in day care centres and in their organization. Few would doubt that the emotional climate and the development of trusting relationships to significant others, in the first year of life, are essential determinants of the healthy personality. Hence the quality of the day care experience of small children is an essential area of study for the child psychiatrist which is as yet insufficiently recognized. This paper discusses what has been learned from the literature and from experience as a consultation-liaison child psychiatrist to a day care centre. A case example illustrates some of the important issues."
8140447,"Efforts to control disease and improve health in developing countries require increasing collaboration between social and medical scientists. This collaboration should extend from the early stages of technology development to the evaluation and improvement of population-wide interventions. This paper provides an integrating framework for social science research on health producing processes at the household level, drawing on recent work in economics, anthropology, and public health. Further development of theory and methods in this area would benefit from interdisciplinary research in categories as defined by social and behavioral science in addition to those related to specific diseases and intervention programs."
9809712,"Poor countries can ill-afford ineffective health care. An effective disease intervention is one which produces a net improvement in beneficiaries' quality of life and/or increases life expectancy. Unlike developed countries, very little research has been done in developing countries on the measures of the ultimate output of health care. The objectives of this study were to: (i) apply the existing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) methods in eliciting health state valuations from farmers, teachers and health professionals living and working in the schistosomiasis endemic Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kenya; (ii) determine whether there is significant difference between average health states valuations from the three main groups of people at risk of schistosomiasis infection; and (iii) assess the relative effect of different respondent characteristics and health states prognosis on valuations. The instrument consists of seven health state descriptions-each defined along six functional dimensions: self-care, mobility, livelihood activities, energy, social participation and pain. Cardinal health state values were measured using a visual-analogue-scale (VAS). Values were elicited from three random samples of farming general public, medical professionals and teachers. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test showed that there is significant difference in the average health state values (for mild, moderate, severe, very severe and comatose states) obtained from the three samples. Generally, except for the valuation of the immediately following state, the other explanatory variables are not statistically significant determinants of valuations for the mild, moderate, severe and very severe states. The results suggest that VAS valuations are primarily affected by prognosis. There is urgent need for more representative and systematic HRQoL studies to test the relevance of the Western-based generic instruments in African countries contexts, with a view to developing more appropriate tool(s) if necessary."
8403239,"Some 211 male alcoholic in-patients were compared with a simple random sample of 200 men from Greater Stockholm. The group of male alcoholic in-patients and the random sample were subdivided with respect to alcohol consumption and use of hepatotoxic drugs: (IA) men from the random sample with low or moderate alcohol consumption and no use of drugs (n = 169); (IB) men from the random sample with low or moderate alcohol consumption with use of drugs (n = 31); (IIA) alcoholic in-patients with use of alcohol but no drugs (n = 171); (IIB) alcoholic in-patients with use of alcohol and drugs (n = 40). Earlier and more severe alcohol-related and anti-social problems were found among subjects with an alcoholic parent than among subjects without an alcoholic parent. The highest level of problems was noted for subjects with alcoholism in both parents and among the alcoholic in-patients. Groups which resembled each other were the drug users in the alcoholic group and in the general sample. Both inherited and environmental factors are important determinants and many of these individuals have psycho-social problems as children and adults. The children of those adults who used alcohol in combination with drugs (IIB) had most problems and the most severe problems. In the general population sample, those who used alcohol in combination with drugs (IB) had so many problems in the family and psycho-social problems themselves that they resembled the alcoholic in-patients and especially the group with high alcohol consumption in combination with drugs (IIB). A new finding is that the high-risk groups IB and IIB, who used both alcohol and drugs, had experienced a more disturbed school career and were more aggressive, had more nervous problems, and were more emotionally disturbed than the other groups. It is concluded that alcohol and drug use by parents may be predictive of future alcoholism in their children."
3538185,"Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity."
7761906,"Breastfeeding beyond the resumption of mother's menstruation plays a significant role in the proximate determinants of fertility. Breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea data collected from retrospective surveys usually exhibit digit preferences. Here, these heaping errors were smoothed by B-spline and used in multivariate models of risk of conception to investigate the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. The data used come from a 1987 Indian survey. Results show that lactation, after mother's menses resume, reduces the risk of conception. Heaping in breastfeeding data attenuates this relationship. When adjustment is made, breastfeeding reduced the rate of conception by 47 per cent; the reduction, with adjusted data, was 63 per cent."

9446197,"This is the burning issue of the hour. In attempting to resolve it within the context of advanced age, it is important to clarify the meaning of the words involved: Independence and autonomy are far from being synonyms. Independence refers to the ability to perform physical activities of daily living (bathing, eating, preparing meals, shopping, money management), whereas the second word, autonomy, refers more to the ability to make decisions, to reason, to express an appropriate opinion in a given situation. Hazard and inevitability are totally at variance. Hazard implies the likelihood of occurrence of an event harmful to health, or to the length or quality of life. Hazard is more or less predictable, whereas inevitability is the expression of a supernatural power controlling all events. To find out whether ""dependency is a hazard or an inevitability"", it is necessary to conduct a historical review of the extension in human longevity and in particular of the current ""weight"" of aging both on individuals and on society at large. In Geneva, the proportion of the over 65-year-olds grew from 5.1 percent in 1880 to 13.4 percent in 1990. During that time, the gain in life expectancy was 52.4 percent for Geneva males of 80 years of age and 93 percent for Geneva females of the same age. This drastic change in age groups was coupled with a noteworthy change in household sizes. In 1860, the number of persons per household was 4.5. In 1990, it was down to 2.2. Conversely, the number of inmates in Geneva's medico-social institutions went up from 649 to 1168 between 1982 and 1992. In this socio-economic and cultural perspective, the concept of ""globality of the individual"" throughout his lifetime explains: age-related physiological changes; the long-term repercussion of physical, professional or leisure activities; the consequences of the accumulation of such varied risk factors as overweight or its opposite, malnutrition, tobacco or stress. Such frailty caused by aging is an ideal breeding ground for disease. For now, what matters most is the functional consequence of disease. Is the disease acute or chronic? Two out of three deaths result from a chronic disease, which caused loss of function by organs (impairment), loss of function by the subject himself (disability) or loss of function by the individual in society (social handicap or disadvantage). Raising the question ""Dependency: a hazard or an inevitability?"" boils down to asking oneself about the place of disease in our society and its determinants, and about all aspects of medicine and especially of prevention. When detected, a susceptibility brings into play primary prevention, aimed at averting the onset of the disease. After a disease has set in, measures to prevent recurrence, or secondary prevention, are required. Lastly, prevention of dependency and of loss of autonomy is part of tertiary prevention. Except for violent traumatic accidents, the formulation of the above concepts proves that dependency is essentially ""a hazard"". Therefore, let us anticipate!"
10173402,"A population-based case control study was conducted to ascertain whether the process of primary care can be a determinant of infant mortality due to Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Cases were 118 infants who died from ARI, individually matched with 118 infants who suffered an ARI episode and recovered. Information was gathered through interviewing mothers. Study variables were assembled into five subsets: children's characteristics; mothers' characteristics; access to medical services; process of primary care, and; sociodemographic variables. An index per subset was built to analyze the independent influence of each on ARI death risk. The index was constructed upon the weighted sum of the adjusted odds ratios (OR) within each subset. Then, the values of each index were collapsed into high/low values with the 50 percentile as a cut-off value. Next, by means of a conditional logistic regression procedure, an explanatory model of ARI mortality was obtained. The final multivariate model included the indexes that showed an independent effect: I) Process of care (OR 9.68, CI 95% 3.59-26.1): inadequate referral, attention provided by more than one physician and being attended by a private physician; II) children's characteristics (OR 7.22, CI 95% 2.35-22.2): perinatal history, lack of breast-feeding and incomplete immunization scheme; III) access to medical services (OR 5.27, CI 95% 2.02-13.7): geographic and economic barriers, lack of confidence in public health services, and; IV) mothers' characteristics (OR 4.03, CI 95% 1.18-13.8), mainly represented by untimely care seeking. We conclude that the management of the disease is a key determinant in which factors relating to the mother and the health services are strongly related. Our study reveals untimely care seeking, difficult access and inadequate disease treatment as important factors which deserve careful attention in the future. We also confirm the importance of biological determinants previously described. A main strategy to reduce infant mortality due to ARI should be to encourage training of primary care physicians, including private practitioners, focused on providing effective case management and emphasizing the education to mothers."
8909112,"A comprehensive model of family influences on educational resemblance of siblings expands the traditional sibling pair model to a full sibship model in order to investigate how gender, gender composition of sibships, and a measure of ordinal position moderate the effect of social origins on educational attainments of siblings. One common family factor is sufficient to explain the variation of educational attainment among brothers and sisters. Although effects of social origins variables on brothers are larger than on sisters, the relative effects of measured social origins are virtually the same among sisters and brothers. The disparity between educational attainments of brothers and sisters persists across sex composition and family size. Ordinal position does not alter the effects of social origins on educational attainment nor does it directly affect educational attainment. Father's and mother's education are equally important for all siblings regardless of birth order, gender composition, and family size."

The first group consists of 173 patients with A and B remissions, the second one, of 155 patients with D and C remissions and without remissions. The authors have analyzed 487 morbid characteristics of patients and identified 209 of them, which allow the differentiation of the groups under study at a statistically significant level. Forty of the most informative signs were utilized for constructing on the basis of image-recognizing algorithms of determinants for the individual prognosis of the remission type."
6802782,"Health care systems throughout the world are being scrutinized because of their growing cost in relations to national wealth. At the same time, techniques for evaluating health care with respect to appropriateness, quality and resource allocation are being developed. These techniques are multifactorial since they must relate to all aspects of health care including: characteristics of the population being served; available health care resources; measures of the process and utilization of care; measures of health care outcomes; peer review, including quality assessment of health care providers; consumer attitudes, knowledge, and compliance; care provided for ""tracer"" or sample conditions; and economic cost-benefit studies. Evaluation in health care assumes that a health care system and the providers of health care within that system are responsible and accountable for the health status of the population. It must, however, recognize that health services are not the sole determinants of health status; social, economic and cultural factors also play key roles. A comprehensive approach to evaluation in health care is outlined in this review. Many of the components that are available in the Israeli health care system are described; others that remain to be developed are discussed. Evaluation is an integral part of a comprehensive health care system; the components of evaluation must be built into any national system. As long as rationality is expected of health care, evaluation is an essential element of the overall system."
3544552,"This paper examines the widespread notions on the effect of children's departure from home. Several studies describe this situation as one of major role loss for the mother who reacts with feelings of depression and loneliness: the so-called ""empty nest syndrome"". Thirty studies were analyzed. There are no data which allow a generalization of such assumptions: The experience of facing the empty nest is individualistic for each woman due to her own biographical and actual factors of life context. Feelings range from loss and sadness to relief and freedom. Further empty nest research should define the term ""empty nest"" more thoroughly, including numerous variables about mothers' and children's life situations. Developmental counseling for middle-aged women cannot exist in standard programs with same aims for all participants, but has to begin with individual and situational determinants of each woman."
7439106,"The evolution of medicine from an applied science to the extension of specialized medical care delivery, has had a bearing on the student's early decision, influenced by a specialist teacher, to chose specialization in a given field. The author gives current explanations of the specialization process in order to conclude that, in Brazil, one of its leading determinants is a policy of the social welfare system that favors the specialist. Other factors cited are the (not always justified) preference of patients--at least of those who can afford it--for physicians who work with sophisticated equipment, the vested interests of the industry that produces or owns that equipment, and the desire of the young physician to escape the stiff competition he would encounter in general practice, while at the same time separating himself from the somewhat negative image of the general clinician who does not keep abreast of developments in medicine. The author examines the question in light of sociological theories of social and technical division of labor, and asserts that the process has led to the atomization of responsibilities among physicians who have become incapable, because of overspecialization, of viewing the patient as a biological, psychological, social and cultural whole."
10287174,"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3503938,"Data from the Oxford healthy life survey were used to explore social class variations in beliefs about the determinants of health, willingness to contemplate behaviour change and experience of lifestyle advice in primary care.While the association between lifestyle factors and health was well-recognized by all social groups, those in social classes 1 and 2 were more likely than others to stress the importance of smoking, diet and exercise, while those in social classes 4 and 5 were more likely than middle class people to emphasize the effect of socioeconomic influences on health such as unemployment, income, pollution and housing. Members of all social classes attributed considerable importance to psychosocial influences on health. In all social classes a substantial proportion of overweight people expressed a desire to reduce their weight, smokers to modify their smoking habits and sedentary people to increase the amount of exercise they took. However, there was less interest in dietary change or reduction of alcohol consumption. One third of the smokers and of those who were overweight had received advice from health professionals about behaviour modification, but less than 10% of those in the other risk groups reported receiving advice. There was a high demand for advice on health; 44% of all respondents said they would be interested in receiving advice on a healthier lifestyle."

The analysis examined the relationship between the average effectiveness level of the contraceptive methods that a woman used over a three-and-a-half-year period and community characteristics such as employment opportunities, the availability of contraceptive and abortion information and services, and the level of religious adherence in communities. Community characteristics associated with higher levels of contraceptive effectiveness were rapid population growth, high rates of unemployment, elevated levels of religious affiliation, high socioeconomic status, and ready access to family planning information and services. Community liberality was negatively associated with effective contraceptive use. The results support arguments that various community characteristics affect a woman's contraceptive choices by increasing or decreasing the costs of an unintended pregnancy."
3071406,"In this presentation, physical appearance has been considered an inseparable part of daily human existence. Relevant aspects of research in social psychology on interpersonal attraction and personality theory stressing narcissistic vulnerability were reviewed. General systems theory was proposed as a theoretical framework from which to view the multifactorial aspects of the psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness. In support of this proposition, the contemporary use of systems thinking in medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family therapy, and the understanding of emotions was stressed. Emotional reactions to the evaluations of physical appearance by self and others were shown to be inevitable, involving appraisal and feedback processes affecting different systems in the person's life. The person's self-image and self-esteem were stressed as underlying determinants of outcome in health and in illness. Finally, we hope to have communicated our belief that in the present, as a way of integrating and summarizing the knowledge obtained in the specialized fields, systems thinking allows for more creative and successful treatment outcomes."
6473033,"Personality determinants of characteristic trends in inferred hemispheric utilization were investigated using conjugate lateral eye movement as an index of hemispheric involvement. The Adjective Checklist provided a number of personality and cognitive-style variables. Two independent samples were assessed, a group of 54 undergraduate psychology students and a group of 39 mechanical engineering students. Subjects were classified as predominantly right-, left-, or bidirectional movers. Discriminant analyses significantly separated these groups in terms of checklist scales. Accuracy of classification was 51.9% in the psychology sample and 89.7% in the engineering sample. A bidirectional pattern in eye movement was associated with a more adaptive and well-adjusted personality style than unidirectional consistency."
3803557,"Rates of teenage pregnancy, birth and abortion vary greatly among states. Because states that have high birthrates tend to have low abortion rates, pregnancy levels vary much less than do the birth and abortion measures. The role of unintended pregnancy is highlighted by the fact that in states that have very high pregnancy rates, the adolescent abortion rate is higher than the birthrate and the abortion rate combined in states that have the lowest pregnancy rates. A series of multivariate analyses that controlled for the percentage of the state population that was black, poor and metropolitan showed that social factors tend to be more important determinants of state differences in teenage pregnancy, birth and abortion levels than are policy-related variables, particularly for whites. Nevertheless, some policy measures have important associations for both races, especially for blacks. Social factors. High rates of population growth and residential mobility over the previous decade, a high crime rate, a high teenage suicide rate, extensive circulation of sexually explicit magazines, a large percentage not voting in elections and a high level of stress are all associated with high pregnancy-related rates for teenagers. The percentage of children living in female-headed households correlates positively with abortion and pregnancy levels among white teenagers, but has no significant association with the birthrate. The percentage of a state's population that belongs to fundamentalist religious groups is positively associated with adolescent birthrates. Political liberalism correlates with relatively low pregnancy rates and birthrates but with a somewhat higher likelihood of pregnancies being terminated by abortion. In states where women's status is higher, birthrates are lower, but abortion levels are higher. Policy measures. States that have high proportions of teenagers dropping out of school and of young women not graduating from high school tend to have high pregnancy rates and birthrates and a somewhat lower proportion of pregnancies ending in abortion. Increased spending on education is associated with relatively high abortion rates (and, therefore, pregnancy rates). The higher the teacher-student ratio, the lower the adolescent birthrate and the more likely the pregnant teenager is to have an abortion. Welfare payments to teenage mothers are negatively associated with both black and white teenage birthrates, and higher maximum payments are associated with relatively high abortion levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
3566318,"We followed 183 infants for two years, 31 of whom were breast fed less than three and a half months (median 70 days; short breast feeding group) and a further 31 of whom were exclusively breast fed for more than nine months (long breast feeding group). We assessed heredity for atopy, number of infections, and duration of breast feeding as determinants of atopy. During the first year of life 14 infants has signs of atopy. During the second year parents reported signs of atopy in a further 31. Heredity was the only significant predictor of atopy. Atopy was seen in 33% of infants with a positive heredity and in 16% without family history for atopy. The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13). Duration of breast feeding did not associate with incidence of respiratory infections. Diarrhoea was more common in the short breast feeding group than in the long breast feeding group during the first year of life. We conclude that prolonging exclusive breast feeding from the median of 70 days to nine months did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy and respiratory tract infections."
8693173,"In this paper, we analyze the factors related to the allocation of home help services, a main component for maintaining elderly at home. The study is based on a random sample of 889 people aged 65 and over, living at home in the areas of Lunel and Pezenas (Herault, France). The factors taken into account were disabilities, income, social support, and subjective health assessed through the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). A logistic model allowed to bring out the factors related to the delivery of home help services. Positive statistical correlations were found for age (OR = 1.6 per 10-year age groups), disabilities for instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 3.8) and for the notion of mobility assessed through the NHP (OR = 3.3); negative statistical correlations were found for the level of income (OR = 0.3), as well as for disabilities for activities of daily living (physical dependency) (OR = 0.5). These results show that the main criterion for allocating home help services is not severe disability and that subjective aspects play an important part. Accordingly, current practices should be modified to obtain a better targeting of home help services for disabled elderly at home."
1558650,"The purpose of the current research was to identify demographic and psychosocial factors important in the decision to breastfeed among a sample of WIC participants in a rural area. One hundred and ninety-eight women completed both a prenatal interview during their third trimester of pregnancy and a second interview within one to three weeks postpartum. Twenty-seven percent of these WIC participants initiated breastfeeding. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that prenatal behavioral beliefs about the consequences of breastfeeding and formula feeding were the strongest predictors of breastfeeding initiation. The results suggest that education to improve the current low rates of breastfeeding among WIC participants should emphasize that formula feeding is neither more convenient nor easier than breastfeeding, and that breastfeeding need not limit mothers in public or social settings."
12348290,"""This paper...[analyzes] the distance moved by one-year migrants using a multi-level modelling approach. Controlling for a range of socio-economic variables, derived from the 1991 British Census Sample of Anonymised Records (SAR), at both the individual and area level, the distance moved by household heads in public, privately rented and owner-occupied housing within Britain is assessed.... It is confirmed that migrants in public housing are less likely to migrate long distances than owner-occupiers and that the proportion of public housing in a SAR area, and the absolute reduction in public housing in a SAR area between 1981 and 1991, does not have a significant effect on the distance that in-migrants have moved."""
8192118,"Proposed and tested a model of the determinants of adolescents' chronic life stressors, consisting of sociodemographic, personal, and contextual stress and coping factors, using baseline and 1-year follow-up data from 259 adolescents who varied in their psychological and physical health. Concurrent regression analyses at Time 1 and at Time 2, and longitudinal regressions that controlled for the levels of chronic stressors 1 year earlier, showed that sociodemographic, personal, and contextual factors each made a significant contribution to predicting adolescents' ongoing stressors with their mother, father, siblings friends and classmates and teachers at school. Personal factors of an emotional temperament and low perceived self-worth, and contextual factors of more negative life events and fewer social resources, were related to more chronic stressors. Suggestions for further development of the model are discussed."
8501991,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of multiuse of prescription drugs and its major determinants among Finnish adults. The data were based on three nationally representative and intercomparable health surveys in 1976, 1978-80, and 1987. The study populations were 16,413 in 1976, 13,138 in 1987, and 7,217 in 1978-80. The simultaneous use of at least five prescription drugs was the main outcome measure. In 1976, 4.7% of the study population, and 6.3% in 1987 were multiusers. Of all users of prescription drugs, the proportion of multiusers was 14% both in 1976 and 1987. In 1987, the elderly comprised 55% of all multiusers, whereas their share in 1976 was 44%. The strongest predictor of the multiuse was, as expected, chronic morbidity. Of the various diagnostic groups, the main determinants were cardiac insufficiency, hypertension, asthma, mental disorders, and coronary heart disease. Even allowing for chronic morbidity, age was significantly associated with multiuse, but sex was not. The number of visits to a primary care physician correlated also independently with the multiuse. These findings indicate that the elderly may in part get prescriptions indiscriminately."
6486090,"Associations between smoking habit, social class, body mass index, and diet were examined in 493 men aged 45 to 59 yr, selected from the general population and who had completed a 7-day weighed dietary record. Smokers were lighter than nonsmokers and had a lower body mass index. There was no difference in energy intake, but in general, smokers had lower intakes of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Exsmokers had similar intakes to nonsmokers. Manual workers tended to be shorter, had a higher body mass index, higher intakes of energy and carbohydrates, and lower intakes of vitamins and minerals than nonmanual workers. Social class had a greater effect than smoking habit on intakes of energy and carbohydrates, whereas smoking habit had the greater effect on intakes of minerals and vitamins. Body mass index was associated negatively with sucrose intake and positively with protein intake, smoking habit, and social class being less important determinants."
24896982,"An experimental model was constructed using seven postulates derived from the experimental results of Zayan (1974, 1975a,b,c, 1976). The model specifies the relative importance of several asymmetries in predicting aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus helleri . These asymmetries concern difference between duellists with respect to: prior residence in the tested area (vs intrusion); immediate social experiences of dominance or submission; social isolation; individual familiarity and recognition. The predictions of the general model were checked experimentally and confirmed; a multiple orthogonal regression accounted for about 97% of the variance in our experimental results. The basic experimental results serving as postulates were confirmed and could be generalized; a new synthetic and predictive model was formulated concerning the determinants of aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus ."
7481601,"Home-related injuries are a major threat to pre-school children in the western world. In this study the behavioral determinants of 18 parental safety measures were assessed. To select behavioral determinants, the Attitude-Social influence-Self-efficacy/barriers model was used with the inclusion of variables from the Health Belief Model and the Protection Motivation Theory. A written questionnaire was completed by 1129 Dutch mothers of pre-school children. Most safety measures were explained (rather) well by the same set of determinants. Main determinants for adopting or not adopting a safety measure were the mother's belief in the necessity of the safety measure according to the child's age, her belief about her partner's opinion on the necessity and her belief about the success of taking the measure. Subsequent important determinants were the mother's belief about the inconvenience and instrumentality of the safety measure; the perceived susceptibility had a minor or moderate influence on most measures. This study did not indicate that more highly educated mothers were more knowledgeable about safety-related subjects. The theoretical implications of this study are discussed."
8816008,"This study examined the structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of heroin addiction. A questionnaire was derived from interviews with lay people about their beliefs and theories of heroin addiction and academic literature on the subject. One hundred and forty-four subjects completed the questionnaire, in which they rated 105 statements about the causes, correlates and cures of heroin addiction. The three parts of the questionnaire were individually factor analyzed and a clear, interpretable factor structure emerged for each. The factors seemed similar to explicit academic theories, but the exception was beliefs about cure, which did not show overall support for the most clinically used models. When the three factor analyses were combined into a single 'higher-order' factor analysis four factors emerged, labelled moralistic, psychosocial, sociocultural and drug treatment, which reflect more or less coherent views on the nature of heroin addiction. Subjects' political beliefs was the greatest (demographic and attitudinal) determinant of lay beliefs in these factors, with experience of addiction, addicts, drugs and age also highly correlated. Vote was the main determinant and best predictor of the four 'higher-order' structured lay theories: right-wing voters emphasizing moralistic and individualistic theory and left-wing voters supporting the psychological and societal ideas. Implications for policy and interventions to addicts of these lay theories are considered."
7057173,"This descriptive study employed semistructured interviewing and questionnaire administration to delineate the sociocultural determinants of the help-seeking process in 48 psychiatric patients. The help-seeking process is considered in two stages. The first stage starts from the recognition of initial symptoms and ends in the first contact with a mental health professional. The second stage is defined as that time between the first contact and actual participation in a planned treatment program. In both stages, patients typically go through phases of lay consultation, nonpsychiatric professional consultation, and referral. The multiple steps which are usually involved in help seeking often result in significant delay of both mental health contact and treatment. The help-seeking process was found to correlate strongly with ethnicity. Both Asians and Blacks showed more extended family involvement, and the involvement of key family members tended to be persistent and intensive in Asians. Ethnicity was also associated with the length of delay, with Asians showing the longest delay and Caucasians the least. These ethnic differences were also reflected in help-seeking pathway assignment using Lin's criteria. Although modernity and parochialism, as measured by the level of modernization and the cohesiveness of the social network system of the subjects, were also found to be correlated with delay, they appeared to exert an influence independent from that of ethnicity."
3434396,"Past research has indicated significant sex differences in determinants of male and female high school students' status as measured by how subjects would like to have been remembered from their high school years. In order to determine if remembrance preference is sex or gender role related, 671 subjects were administered the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) and a questionnaire asking if they most wanted to be remembered from high school as a brilliant student, leader in activities, athletic star or most popular. Using both the median split and t-ratio procedures in scoring the BSRI, 206 subjects were selected because they were sex-typed (masculine males, feminine females), cross sex-typed (masculine females, feminine males), or androgynous (scoring high on both masculine and feminine traits). To find a model of best fit, the data were subjected to a log-linear analysis. The variables included were sex, gender role, and remembrance preference. Rather than sex being the influential factor, the model of best fit was a gender role by remembrance preference interaction. If subjects were masculine, they were more likely to choose athletic star than were feminine or androgynous subjects. Most popular and leader in activities were both more likely to be chosen by feminine and androgynous subjects. All groups chose brilliant student more often than any other category. It was concluded that some previously designated sex differences may instead be differences in gender role. Further research should address the distinction between the two."
7964331,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify geographical differences in coronary heart disease (CHD) attack rates in a small urban area and to relate these to indicators of socioeconomic class. DESIGN: CHD attack rates were calculated from data of the Ghent MONICA myocardial infarct register for the period 1983-87. The city of Ghent is subdivided into 201 sectors based on morphological, and socioeconomic characteristics. During the national census of 1981, the main determinants of residential differentiation were measured. These sector variables were linked with the CHD attack rates. PATIENTS: All residents of the city aged 25-69 years are prospectively followed with regard to heart attacks. Between 1982 and 1987, 1728 suffered an acute heart attack according to MONICA criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.05) differences in age and sex standarised attack rates were observed between city sectors. These differences were related to an index of socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: Within a small urban area, significant geographical differences occur in CHD attack rates and these are related to socioeconomic status."
1948148,"Little information exists on health discrepancies within rural areas. Our research proposes to analyse the Quebec Health Survey--a population health survey carried out in Quebec in 1987--using a geographic grid which defines three different rural areas: that area bordering urban centers, a more remote area and the very remote hinterland. The analysis brings to light major, statistically significant, discrepancies between these areas in three sectors: health status determinants (physical activity and social support), the actual state of health (perceived health, a global health index and various pathologies) and the consequences that may be attributed to this state of health (disability and medication). It shows the difficult situation of inhabitants of the very remote hinterland."

7945681,"The authors raise questions regarding the wide-spread calls emanating from lay and medical audiences alike to intensify the formal teaching of ethics within the medical school curriculum. In particular, they challenge a prevailing belief within the culture of medicine that while it may be possible to teach information about ethics (e.g., skills in recognizing the presence of common ethical problems, skills in ethical reasoning, or improved understanding of the language and concepts of ethics), course material or even an entire curriculum can in no way decisively influence a student's personality or ensure ethical conduct. To this end, several issues are explored, including whether medical ethics is best framed as a body of knowledge and skills or as part of one's professional identity. The authors argue that most of the critical determinants of physician identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a more subtle, less officially recognized ""hidden curriculum."" The overall process of medical education is presented as a form of moral training of which formal instruction in ethics constitutes only one small piece. Finally, the authors maintain that any attempt to develop a comprehensive ethics curriculum must acknowledge the broader cultural milieu within which that curriculum must function. In conclusion, they offer recommendations on how an ethics curriculum might be more fruitfully structured to become a seamless part of the training process."
1294072,"According to 1982 and 1988 NSFG data, unmarried white women are far less likely than they were in the early 1970s to place their children for adoption. The levels of relinquishment among black women have remained low throughout this period, and relinquishment among Hispanic women may be virtually nonexistent. Multivariate analysis of the determinants of relinquishment among unmarried non-Hispanic white women suggests that having a well-educated mother, being in school at the time of conception, having no labor force experience, and being older are positively associated with placing a child for adoption. Sons were found to be less likely to be relinquished than daughters."

2020883,"The relationship between urbanisation and measles control is examined. In urban settings in developing regions measles is a disease of particular importance, since it tends to affect children at a younger age and with greater severity than in rural settings. A further finding in urban areas, especially peri-urban slums, is the lower measles vaccination coverage rates compared with rural regions. Factors identified as determinants of measles vaccination coverage among children under 2 years of age in urban areas include: home delivery; being born outside the urban setting; and length of stay in the city. These factors are probably related to the low socioeconomic status and lack of social integration experienced by new urban immigrants. A number of additional obstacles, such as distance, economic and cultural barriers, and inconvenient clinic hours all prevent parents from gaining easy access to vaccination services. In order to address the problems of measles control in expanding urban settings, a regional approach--with full integration of curative and preventive services--is called for. A more effective use of existing services will probably go a long way towards improving urban vaccination coverage with resultant measles control."
2558204,"To identify factors associated with the decision to consult with dyspepsia, patients with dyspepsia were identified from a postal survey in the community. A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour."
3359393,"Parents who had been placed in an orphanage as children rated the behaviour of all their children who were between the ages of 6-18 years on a children's behaviour survey instrument. All families were intact and the parents had not requested professional help for marital problems. A significant number of relationships were found between parental background variables and higher reported levels of conflict with siblings and with parents, dependent-unassertive behaviour, and undemandingness in the children. Although sampling difficulties preclude generalization, the results suggest that repercussion of events in the lives of the first and second generation that are usually pathogenic may be seen in the third generation, even when the second generation may not be grossly adversely affected. These events most frequently related to individual differences in the third generation in the area of undercontrol of aggression directed toward parents and siblings."
12159612,"The authors describe the socioeconomic characteristics and fertility patterns of female immigrants from Latin America to the United States, with a focus on reasons for fertility differentials. ""Using the one per cent public use sample from the 1970 and 1980 United States census, we first compare changes in socio economic characteristics from 1970 to 1980, and then examine the determinants of fertility of female immigrants to the United States, aged 16-49, from four Latin American areas or countries of birth.... The findings...suggest that there are direct effects of demographic, assimilation, and socioeconomic variables beyond those mediated by the variables in each of these sets. Further, regardless of the model, the effect of the clusters of demographic characteristics is most apparent. Age categories and marital status are the strongest indexed determinants of immigrant fertility.... The effect of education and employment is strong. Among assimilation variables, duration of residence and language ability are significant determinants of Hispanic immigrant fertility."" (SUMMARY IN FRE AND SPA)"
1879391,"Employed data from two longitudinal surveys of gay men in San Francisco (a) to examine for cohort (Study 1) and attrition (Studies 1 and 2) bias effects on reported changes in condom use by gay men and (b) to investigate predictors of condom use (Study 2). Substantial increases in condom use were observed, and these changes were unrelated to attrition and cohort bias. In terms of predictors of condom use, men who always used condoms had higher levels of social support from informal sources of help, had more positive expectations that condoms would have positive interpersonal and personal consequences, and were more likely to be HIV positive than men who used condoms occasionally or never. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for HIV-prevention research."
3629664,"Data from a 1982 sample survey of 3,830 married women below age 50 in a district of Beijing City are applied to the Bongaarts model of the proximate determinants of fertility. A total fertility rate (TFR) of 0.75 births per woman is estimated from the model, compared with a TFR of 1.24 actually observed from the survey. The estimated TFR (0.75) results from the assumed total fecundity (TF) of 15.30 births per woman being inhibited by the indexes of the proximate determinants of fertility, most notably non-marriage (.280), contraception (.315), and induced abortion (.586). The effects of two other proximate determinants, lactational infecundability and spousal separation, were negligible. Comparative data from other countries confirm that the study area has very low levels of fertility and marriage, a very high prevalence of induced abortion, and a small effect of lactational infecundability. The extremely low level of fertility was, thus, achieved through a high level of induced abortion. Future research needs and policy implications associated with the study are discussed."
9245679,"BACKGROUND: Within the CINDI framework, a European ""Quit and Win"" contest was organized in 1994. In Finland the number of participants was 5,879 (0.6% of smokers). In the CINDI demonstration area, North Karelia (NK), the participants numbered 618 (2.0% of smokers). This study compared abstinence maintenance among the participants in NK with the rates found elsewhere in Finland and analyzed determinants for successful quitting. METHODS: A follow-up study was conducted 12 months after the quit date with a sample of 2,114 participants. Response rates of 67-68% were achieved (n = 1,419). The abstinence was assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. Two estimates are presented: (1) the proportion of abstainers among the respondents and (2) the proportion of abstainers among the sample, considering all nonrespondents smokers. The determinants for maintenance of smoking cessation were analyzed with logistic regression. RESULTS: Using the first estimate, the rates at 1/6/12 months were 75/36/28% in NK and 70/28/21% elsewhere (P < 0.01). Using the second estimate, the corresponding rates were 50/24/19% in NK and 46/19/14% elsewhere. The most significant determinants for successful quitting were sex, age, marital status, level of withdrawal symptoms, previous quitting attempts, and support received. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment of smokers and the maintained cessation were more successful in the demonstration area. The difference between areas was explained by differences in the combined professional and lay support and by the sex and age distributions."
3608944,"This study examined the cognitive structures underlying women's intentions to delay or not delay seeking medical care for a breast cancer symptom. Middle-aged women imagined that they had just discovered a particular change in their breast, and they completed a questionnaire that assessed variables specified by Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action with respect to two alternative courses of action: immediately calling the doctor (i.e., prompt behavior) and monitoring the breast change on one's own (i.e., delay behavior). Also assessed were variables external to the theory that were drawn from previous research on cancer delay. Results showed that intentions to delay were positively associated with having favorable attitudes toward delay and with perceived social pressure to delay; the attitudinal factor, however, was more influential than the social factor in determining intentions. Underlying favorable attitudes toward delay were beliefs that delay would be likely to result in maintaining control over and avoiding the disruption of one's own and others' lives but would be unlikely to result in negative health outcomes. No external variable was found to contribute to intentions to delay above and beyond attitudinal and normative considerations."
6504868,"Preventive and therapeutic advances have brought life expectancy in the United States to well over 70 years and have shifted mortality causes from acute to chronic diseases, the determinants of which are genetics, lifestyle, the environment, and aging itself. Plausible approaches to chronic disease prevention are likely to increase longevity further, with some foreseeable effects on demographic and economic projections. Primarily, longevity advances would swell forecasts of population size, and would thus have to be met by production advances in order to maintain or improve living standards. This study, a restricted example, considers the probable demographic and economic consequences of a limited prevention program in the context of the Ford Motor Company, based on actual experience and certain expectations up to the year 2000. According to the results, prevention would reduce outlays for life insurance, disability, and health care, but would also generate the higher costs of extending pension plans. Undoubtedly, prevention will continue to be highly ranked in society's pursuit of happiness, and society must prepare to meet its effects with appropriate social and economic policies."
2801277,"This study investigated the relationships among family environment, demographic measures, the decisions made by unintentionally pregnant adolescents regarding postdelivery plans and the certainty with which these decisions were made. Subjects were 175 pregnant adolescents, ages 14 through 22, who intended to carry their pregnancies to term. Greater uncertainty was associated with living with both natural parents or with mother only. Higher levels of negative affect were related to lower levels of perceived family cohesion, independence, expressiveness, and intellectual-cultural orientation. Age, trimester of pregnancy, and family constellation also were related to levels of negative affect. Discriminant analysis revealed that subjects choosing adoption were more likely to be older and to be white than were those choosing to keep the child. They also tended to perceive higher levels of expressiveness and independence in their families. The implications of these findings for the delivery of services and for future research efforts in this area are discussed."
2723595,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."
9347588,"This article focuses on the relationship between women's economic status earlier in their lives and their poverty status in old age. Previous research on the determinants of poverty among aged women has documented the socioeconomic and demographic correlates of the poor, and has examined the financial impact of adverse later-life events such as widowhood, deterioration of health, and loss of employment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women (NLSMW), we find that most women who experience these types of adverse events in their later years do not become poor and that a large majority of older NLSMW respondents who were poor in 1991-92 were poor earlier in their adult lives. Whether women are impoverished by adverse later-life events depends on their economic resources just prior to the event. But, the financial resources available in old age, in turn, depend very much on their long-term economic status throughout much of their adult lives. This article underscores the fact that for most older women, these adverse events do not appear to precipitate poverty spells--at least not within the first couple of years--and directs attention at longer term circumstances that make some women more vulnerable to poverty."
8193249,"In the developed world, deferment of marriage and postponement of child-bearing in marriage are resulting in unprecedented numbers of couples who desire pregnancy relatively late in life. These factors combine with a decline in fertility and an increase in pregnancy wastage with advancing age to present new challenges for the clinician treating infertility. Experience with young oocytes donated to older women indicates that the major responsibility for the decline in fertility with age can be attributed to aging oocytes. Oocyte donation offers new hope for infertile older woman, but important moral and social questions remain unanswered."
3354493,"In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking."
10453246,"This study in Bangladesh found that inter-cluster variation in the use of modern reversible methods of contraception was significantly attributable to the educational levels of the female family planning workers working in the clusters. Women belonging to clusters served by educated workers had a higher probability of being contraceptive users than those whose workers had only completed primary education. At the household level, important determinants of use were socioeconomic status and religion. At the individual level, the woman being the wife of the household head and having some education were positively related to her being a user. The model also found that inter-household variation was significantly greater than inter-cluster variation. Finally, the study concludes that after controlling for various covariates at all three levels, the clusters do not have significantly different levels of use of modern reversible methods of contraception. There are, however, some special areas where contraceptive use is dramatically low, and these contribute significantly to the observed inter-cluster variation."
17214174,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Abis area, 15 kilometers south east of Alexandria city, to determine the prevalence of human fascioliasis and to study some of the epidemiological determinants which may affect the infection. A specially designed questionnaire interview was completed, and a total number of 3475 stool samples were examined. The results revealed a prevalence rate of fascioliasis of 11% in the studied area which was only second to S. mansoni. The prevalence of infection was significantly higher among females in general and specifically in the age group 5 to less than 15 years and 25 to less than 35 years. Family aggregation of fasciola infection was noticed among the studied group. The prevalence and also the risk of infection were significantly higher among children whose mothers were infected. They were, however, insignificantly higher among illiterate, single males, and low social class group. In addition, the prevalence and risk of infection were significantly higher among individuals obtaining their raw green leafy vegetables from multiple sources. From the results it was concluded that human fascioliasis is an important public health problem in Abis area with increased risk of spread of infection to Alexandria city through raw green leafy vegetables which represent the main source of infection."
9629734,"The definition of emergent and re-emergent diseases, patterns of occurrence during the last 25 years, and the determinants of this occurrence are presented. The importance of descriptive epidemiology and its use in the investigation of these health problems, especially in view of epidemiologists' tendency to give less attention to it, finally, is emphasized the challenges that the emergent diseases pose for public health practice and for the methodological development of descriptive epidemiology are also set out. These challenges are considered in three fields: biosecurity, surveillance systems and descriptive epidemiology techniques."
7419352,"Most of the 'variance' in human food selection can be attributed to culture and individual experience. It is argued that while rigorous research on biological determinants of food selection is very valuable, we must also invest heavily in more exploratory, social science oriented studies. Only in this way can we approach most of the major determinants of food choice. We must recognize that food selection is multidetermined and context dependent. At this early stage of scientific development in this field, we must be willing to consider tradeoffs between rigor or quantification and promising preliminary and qualitative studies."
3395696,"Specialization--the predisposition to violent behavior persisting over an extended period of time--is considered in relation to congenital factors, to determine whether such factors are contributory to this predisposition. Congenital factors include inherited characteristics and perinatal experiences. Evidence for inherited characteristics in criminal behavior is approached through family studies, the study of twins, and adoption studies. Of those three, adoption studies provide the most fertile ground for study. Predisposition toward criminal behavior is noted to be limited to property crime. The second congenital factor is the perinatal experience. Minor physical anomalies appear to be strongly related to hyperactivity and later criminal involvement, but only if the offender was reared in an unstable, nonintact family. Indices of perinatal problems relate to later violent crime, rather than to property crime, and may have as their basis some form of trauma occurring very early in life."
22085142,"Abstract A sample survey of 2,012 married and single women aged 18-59 in Madrid was in part focused on causes of late marriage, which has for a long time been characteristic of Spain. It was found that age at marriage was not related to a variety of socio-economic measures, to parental restrictions on courtship, nor to birth order or number of siblings. Direct economic motivations appear to have affected length of courtship but scarcely age at marriage. Ages at marriage differ in different areas of Madrid, even when key demographic and social variables are controlled; and evidence from a sub-sample of interviews suggests that it may be a characteristic of different families. Along with clear evidence of normative patterns supporting long courtships and late marriages, such data point to the potential importance of sociological variables, and to the need for similar research on determinants of men's ages at marriage."

8882839,"Theoretically, segregation and discrimination could affect mortality among blacks (African Americans) not only through their impact on social class (including the concentration of blacks in high-poverty areas) but also by influencing health care and psychosocial factors. This paper reviews evidence that variation in mortality rates for black infants and young adults living in large metropolitan areas is associated with the level of black-white segregation. A few metropolitan areas in California with relatively low levels of segregation are shown to have low black death rates and small black-white differences in mortality rates for infants and young adult males (15-44 years old). In-depth studies are needed in these areas. Longitudinal studies of potential ""risk factors"" for disease and death among blacks should include: personal histories of experiences with discrimination, psychological reactions to discrimination, segregation indexes, quality of life in residential areas, and social class indicators."
6725588,"Conducted a survey to determine how aware drinkers are of the situational determinants of alcohol (N = 64). Findings showed that social drinkers were well aware of the effects of different settings on the quantity consumed and the effects experienced. These findings suggest the need for caution in generalizing laboratory findings conducted under ""non-natural"" conditions to practical applications."
2925863,"Social support, family functioning, self-perceptions of appearance, school, behavior, athletics, and social competence, as well as daily hassles/microstressors, were investigated as determinants of general self-esteem in 41 children with congenital/acquired limb deficiencies. Classmate, parent, teacher, and friend social support all were significant predictors of self-esteem. Family conflict and organization were also significantly associated with self-esteem, as were microstressors. The overall model of significant predictor variables accounted for 66% of the variance in general self-esteem. General self-esteem also was significantly predictive of depressive symptomatology. The findings suggest a number of factors which are potentially modifiable and which might enhance general self-esteem in children with visible physical handicaps."
17093748,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting."
12292532,"""Immigrants' attachments to home and their assimilation into the host society have been identified as major factors influencing international return migration. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of attachment and assimilation, with a special focus on the impact of duration of stay. Using survey data on guestworkers in West Germany in 1984 and 1989, the study finds that assimilation increases at a decreasing rate as the duration of stay is extended. The relationship between attachment and length of stay is less strong, but shows a general trend of decreasing attachment levels as guestworkers prolong their stay in Germany. The resulting trends for return migration are characterized by an overall decline in the propensity to return as the duration of stay is extended. However, the rate of decline varies by gender, marital status, and nationality. Overall, the results allude to the importance of distinguishing between short term and long term immigrants."""
1417626,"This study explored family factors associated with Expressed Emotion (EE) in families with a member diagnosed with schizophrenia. Drawing on an attributional model of expressed emotion it was predicted that high EE relatives would have less knowledge of the illness and would attribute negative symptoms to the personality, rather than the illness, of the sufferer. Thirty-one caregivers of schizophrenic patients were interviewed. Results indicated that EE status was related to knowledge, coping and causal attributions of negative symptoms. Low EEs, as compared with High EEs, tended to have more knowledge of the illness and to cope better with the patient, and were less likely to attribute the cause of negative symptoms to the sufferer's personality. Support was therefore obtained for the utility of an attributional model in attempting to understand the determinants of levels of EE."
3437081,"Although it is of both practical and theoretical importance very little work has been done on adolescents' knowledge of, and beliefs about, the economy. Two studies are reported in this paper--the first concerns the determinants of economic values in a population of 16-17 year old British schoolchildren, and the second concerns economic preferences and knowledge in a larger group of slightly older adolescents. By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on economic socialization."
9114467,"This pilot study investigated the importance of social, clinical, and discharge factors in predicting extended length of stay (LOS) in a state geropsychiatric hospital. The authors reviewed medical records of all first time admissions during a 22 month period. A total of 272 patients age 60 and older were admitted for the first time during this period. Nine variables comprised of medical, demographic, social, and discharge information were examined in retrospective analysis to assess their relationship to LOS. The mean and standard deviation of days spent in hospital was 392.3 +/- 752.81. The median number of days of hospitalization was 72.0. Single marital status, type of living arrangement, polypharmacy, and limited functional status were predictive of LOS. Our findings underscore the challenge within geropsychiatry of treating patients with coexisting medical conditions who also have significant behavioral, mood, and/or cognitive disturbances."
6984992,"The hypothesis that social indices and educational level of mother are potential sources of childhood malnutrition was tested in Kampumbu, Zambia. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, protein and albumin levels in children were studied in relation to malnutrition. Six hundred and fifty rural children (306 males and 344 females) aged one and fourteen years exposed to various types of diet and environmental factors were selected randomly. Data on economic status, diet environment and educational attainment as well as other demographic information were collected. The major epidemiological findings were that the difference in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by income) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis was significant (X2 = 4.1, P less than 0.025), and the relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Similarly, there was a very significant difference (X2 = 7.4, P less than 0.005) in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by house grades) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis. The estimated relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Other variables, including age, history of hookworm, were not found to be determinants of risk for malnutrition."
3628634,A theoretical model designed to assess the contribution of systematic factors contributing to vulnerability to life-events exposure is described. This model is applied to six-year longitudinal data on life events exposure for a sample of New Zealand women with school-aged children. The fitted model suggests that in the region of 30% of the variance in life-event reports over the six-year period was attributable to a common vulnerability factor. Modelling of this vulnerability factor suggested that two major determinants of vulnerability to life events were the level of social disadvantage of the woman and her level of neuroticism: women of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and women with high neuroticism scores showed a consistent tendency to report high life-event exposure during the six-year period. The implications of these findings are discussed.
2807934,"A national sample of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged was created by merging the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey and its counterpart, the National Health Interview Survey for the same year. A weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might be useful in calculating home- and community-based long-term care clients' risk of institutionalization. A model containing patient characteristics, nursing home bed supply, and a climate variable correctly classified 98.2 percent of cases residing in nursing homes or the community. Physical dependency, mental disorder and degenerative disease, lack of spouse, being white, poverty, old age, unoccupied nursing home beds, and climate all appear to be determinants of institutional residency among the aged."
2030286,"A typology of the social climates of group residential facilities for older people was developed by a cluster analysis of seven social climate attributes obtained on a national sample of 235 nursing homes, residential care facilities, and congregate apartments. The analysis yielded six distinct types of social climate: Supportive, Self-Directed; Supportive, Well-Organized; Open Conflict; Suppressed Conflict; Emergent-Positive; and Unresponsive. Facility and resident characteristics were related to social climate type. In addition, the type of social climate was related to resident adaptation. Supportive, Self-Directed and Supportive, Well-Organized facilities had residents who rated higher in well-being and levels of self-initiated activities and who used fewer health services. A configural approach to describing social climates and their determinants and effects may help to develop more humanistic residential facilities and to better match individual residents to appropriate housing placements."

This model is used as a guide for the analysis of the individual process of psychosocial adaptation in order to assist the patient. Furthermore, based on findings of empirical studies, the increased risk of psychiatric disorders reflecting maladaptive coping processes is outlined. Finally, some fundamental considerations regarding psychological rehabilitation within paediatric care are presented."
8964453,"Course of Grief Response, influencing Factors, Satisfaction with treatment, Need for Psychotherapeutic Support: The emotional response to a late miscarriage or a stillbirth was examined retrospectively in a systematic study involving 51 patients. The women had lost a child either by stillbirth (beyond the 20th week of gestation) or shortly after delivery. We assessed the long-term course of possible determinants of grief, a complicated grief response, as well as the patients' satisfaction with the treatment and their need for further psychotherapeutic support. The mourning response was complicated by a depressive reaction in 22%. Major risk factors were individual disposition, lack of partner and professional support. The findings reveal that the course of the grief response is positively influenced by: 1. open discussion (thematisation) with the skilled personnel and the patients' families, 2. direct or indirect contact with the deceased child (concretisation) and 3. the patients concerned being extensively informed as to place and circumstances of the funeral (whereabouts of the child)."
2963022,"Research on attitudes toward the disabled generally has focused on adult perceptions of disabled adults, or children's attitudes toward peers. In view of changing social practices, such as mainstreaming in education and community integration of children with special needs, measures of adults' attitudes toward disabled children are needed. This paper reports on the development and validation of a 30-item self-report questionnaire assessing parental attitudes toward children with handicaps, and presents information concerning several determinants of parental attitudes. The measure is easy to use, reliable, and shows good evidence of construct validity. It detects differences among parents by gender, by parental education and occupational status, by cultural background of parents, by parental familiarity with a handicapped person, and by stimulus (physically disabled vs. mentally retarded child referent). Results are discussed in relation to determinants of parental attitudes toward handicaps. Potential applications of this measure for evaluation of teacher attitudes are suggested."
3720261,"These case histories illustrate how medical, psychosocial, cultural and economic factors affect the elderly with chronic arthritis. Physicians need to be aware of their patient's attitudes, concerns, support systems and goals resulting from a lifetime of experience, to provide the most appropriate and effective care. 'Images of future are usually only caricatures of the present' (Starr, 1982), but based on current demography, one can predict trends for the future. It is likely that the elderly of the future will be better off financially, better educated, healthier, more politically connected and strident, but their social support systems will be less effective. The last stems from trends such as declining birth rate, an increasingly mobile society, diminished importance of the nuclear family, and the diminishing attractiveness of professions involved with providing maintenance care. This suggests that the physician and nurse, being the primary gatekeepers for the care of and services for the elderly, must be even more attentive to the non-biological determinants of arthritis disability."
10394499,"Although various trends have placed breastfeeding in and out of vogue, in the twentieth century the greater availability of human milk substitutes mandates that a woman choose her infant's feeding method. It appears that intrapsychic factors or life experiences, as well as certain social conditions, influence that choice. For example, the economic state of society historically has had significant impact on the role of women and the value placed on woman's unique biologic contributions. Likewise, personality and attitudinal factors also may act as potential mediators of observed differences between lactating and nonlactating mothers in their mother-infant interactions. Finally, once the decision to breastfeed or bottle-feed has been made and carried through, additional physiologic mechanisms may mediate conscious behavioral intentions. The phenomenon of human lactation, then, is sensitive to a variety of interrelated factors that can be grouped as follows: (1) individual personality, (2) social forces, and (3) psychophysiologic mechanisms. An in-depth understanding of the specific factors that affect a woman's decision to breastfeed will have far-reaching implications for future educational and interventional programs."

Its discussion of the primary determinants of medical students' ethical development focused on improving: (1) the evaluation of candidates for admission; (2) the medical school learning climate, including recognition of the challenges inherent in the increasing cultural diversity among students and patients; and (3) communication to students of expectations of professional behaviors and standards. An AAMC initiative is outlined that includes preparation of a resource book featuring cases illustrating common ethical dilemmas that medical students face, descriptions of effective honor systems, suggestions for faculty development, and an annotated bibliography."
7875917,"This study tested predictions specifying the influence of caregiver personality traits on negative outcomes of caregiving, health complaints and burden. Two-hundred and thirteen caregivers, who were caring for family members with dementia, were interviewed and their relatives were assessed on cognitive status and aggression. At follow-up conducted twenty-four months later, forty-five caregivers were still continuing to provide home care for their dependents. Caregivers who scored higher on a measure of neuroticism experienced higher levels of burden and health complaints both at initial and follow-up assessment. Caregiver extraversion-introversion did not influence the experience of caregiving. At both initial and final assessment, the ability to enjoy some aspects of caregiving, recreational activities, and satisfaction with social support from family and friends mitigated negative outcomes of caregiving, while appraising the dependent as more troublesome increased negative outcomes. Caring for more cognitively impaired and more aggressive dependents and being female increased negative outcomes initially. Personality traits and most other study variables demonstrated significant continuity across time for caregivers continuing home care."

1469676,"The beginning of the 1980s saw the birth of Zimbabwe as a result of a protracted liberation war. It coincided with global interest in primary health care, the concept of universal primary school education and, unfortunately, moves towards economic stabilization and structural adjustment programmes. Economic structural adjustment was adopted by several sub Saharan African countries with dire consequences for the poor and vulnerable. Zimbabwe's commitment to social justice and to equitable distribution of resources demonstrated a practical move away from the culture of rhetoric so characteristic of many governments and non-governmental organisations and agencies. This commitment has been translated into impressive improvements in health and education. Current evidence shows that education has had a positive impact on health and related areas like contraceptive use, child mortality and the nutrition status of children. Conversely nutrition and health conditions among school children are important determinants of educational outcomes. Hitherto Zimbabwe's economy has been sufficiently strong to avoid excessive dependence on the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other foreign financial institutions. Unfortunately, however, the current economic recession together with economic structural adjustment programmes are beginning to have a negative impact on health and education. Will true synergism between health and education weather these structural problems? It seems that the people and government of Zimbabwe have the capacity and resolve to weather such a storm."
7183557,"Some social gerontologists have argued that the aged status in America results in distrust of and despair with the social order (anomia) independent of other determinants: lack of access to the means of achievement of life goals and social isolation. This argument was tested with a multivariate regression analysis utilizing data on 354 white men aged forty and older from the 1974 General Social Survey. The Srole anomia scale was used as the dependent variable. Multiple indicators of life chances and social participation were used; health and verbal intelligence were employed as controls. The results showed no relationship between age or other indicators of life chances and anomia, net of education and/or verbal intelligence. Prior studies reporting that age and anomia are causally related probably have done so due to lack of adequate control variables and/or due to cohort effects from the lesser education of the older population in the United States. Compared when employing appropriate controls, aged American males are not more anomic than middle-aged males."
9623686,"The study aim was to compare the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in children living in Munster, western Germany, and Greifswald, eastern Germany, and to investigate associations of several characteristics and exposures with atopic disease symptoms. In 1994 and 1995, questionnaire information was gathered on 5-8 yr old children (n=3,741 in Munster and n=2,857 in Greifswald) and 12-15 yr olds (n=4,003 and n= 3,153, respectively) using the phase I protocol of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The 12 month period prevalences of reported atopic disease symptoms in 5-8 yr olds were generally higher in Munster than in Greifswald, whereas only a few prevalence differences were observed in 12-15 yr olds. In both age groups the reported lifetime prevalences of asthma, hay fever and eczema were lower in Greifswald. Indoor exposures such as wood or coal heating and feather bedding were negatively associated with symptoms, whereas exposures such as truck traffic in a residential street or active smoking were positively associated with symptoms. Wood or coal heating could partly explain the prevalence difference of allergic rhinitis symptoms among 5-8 yr olds between Munster and Greifswald. The findings provide additional evidence for a role of several characteristics and exposures as potential determinants of asthma and allergies in children."
7264477,"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered."
1492742,"Socio-cultural, biological, psychological and environmental determinants of health develop within the community. Therefore, any intervention aimed at promoting health must derive from and evolve within the community itself, with the participation of all its members, each of whom charged with a specific and well-defined role to play. Deep changes have occurred in modern society, as a consequence of industrialization and urbanization. This notwithstanding, the biological and social role of women in family management has remained unchanged, even after the spreading of female work. The community-based control of chronic and degenerative diseases calls for the acquirement of a lifestyle more suitable to maintaining health. To this purpose, women can be charged with the responsibility of carrying our activities aimed at improving scientific knowledge to the benefit of the whole community."
4049019,"This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

6684973,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts."
8192221,"The author cites significant changes in the conduct of the psychiatric profession between the fourth and ninth decades of this century. Determinants of the changes included the impact of World War II, the National Mental Health Act of 1946, the evolution of multiple modes of psychotherapy, the move from a system of involuntary incarceration and treatment in public institutions to a voluntaristic and pluralistic system, the provision of public and private insurance support for office, outpatient, and inpatient psychiatric care, the resurgence of psychopharmacology, and the pursuit of research in biological and psychosocial fields. The social goals of the profession are also discussed."
9871112,Group B streptococci (GBS) colonizing the vagina and rectum of pregnant women cause invasive disease of the offspring in a small number of cases. The immune status of the host and differences in virulence among strains appear to be the main determinants for neonatal infection. A high-virulence clone (HVC) was proposed to cause much of the morbidity and mortality when a collection of GBS isolates was examined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. HVC isolates could be further distinguished by their inability to grow at 40 degrees C. This characteristic was used in the present study to examine a collection of 57 GBS isolates from Mexico City for the HVC. Three serotype III invasive strains were classified in the HVC. The other eleven invasive strains and all carrier isolates had growth curves unaffected at 40 degrees C. These results demonstrate the presence of the HVC in Mexico. Such a low prevalence could explain in part the low rate of GBS invasive neonatal disease in Mexico.
3060449,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement."
12294787,"""We investigate the effects of demographics, household expenditure and female employment on the allocation of household expenditure to consumer goods. For this purpose we estimate an Almost Ideal Demand System based on Dutch micro data. We find that interactions between household expenditure and demographics are of significant importance in explaining the allocation to consumer goods. As a consequence, consumer goods such as housing and clothing change with demographic characteristics from luxuries to necessities."""
1927071,Contrary to many widely discussed theories of anorexia nervosa the conclusive human genetic results of research with twins have been almost totally ignored and individual casuistry has often been misinterpreted. The two twin-series studies at hand (Crisp et al./London and the author)--totally independent of each other and compiled during the same time period--speak unmistakably for a great genetic determination and genesis of anorexia nervosa. The AN-twin pairs compiled by the author over a period of 30 years are described here.
7660042,"The quality of official information on underlying causes of infant deaths was studied on the basis of data collected for a population-based study of the surveillance of infant mortality in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil in 1989. The survey included the analysis of a sample of infant deaths carried out by comparing the underlying causes of death as coded on death certificates to those recorded by a group of doctors who abstracted information from hospital records. We verified that 11.7% of neonatal deaths did not have the underlying cause of death confirmed by the investigation (kappa = 0.61), and neither did 44.0% of post-neonatal deaths (kappa = 0.47). It is believed that this major disagreement among post-neonatal deaths is due to the close correlation observed among the major causes of death within this group (pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition). For example, associated malnutrition was observed in 76.9% of those cases in which diarrhoea was coded as the underlying cause of death. It was concluded that the quality of the death certificates is not satisfactory. However, the composition of the main groups of causes presented no significant alteration after investigation and may be used in public health surveillance, especially if we regard pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition as a group with the same determinants. Unfortunately, this group still accounts for a great number of otherwise avoidable deaths in Brazil."
12280179,"""Distinctive types of mobility are identified for the [U.S.] elderly, many of whom also move for traditional reasons. Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves."""
1423121,"In recent formulations of the concept of health promotion, such as Achieving Health for All and the Ottawa Charter, emphasis is clearly placed on comprehensivity and the integration of individual and social determinants of health, broadly defined. This paper is premised on the observation that despite evidence of a paradigm shift in the way we talk about health promotion at a conceptual level, we have yet to properly articulate a 'new' research methodology to accompany the 'new' health promotion. The paper has three main sections. First, some of the limitations and contradictions that separate the rhetoric of health promotion from its current operationalization in research practice are discussed. In asserting the inherent links between theory, methodology and method, the need for a new research paradigm is demonstrated. In the second section, seven key issues derived from the literature on sociological theory are identified and discussed in terms of their implications for choosing a new research methodology for health promotion. In the third section it is suggested that using these issue areas as a 'decision map' leads to the selection of a preferred strategy which brings together both interpretive and critical perspectives to bear on our understanding of social reality as it affects health. Elements of both of these approaches and the nature of their potential complimentarity are considered. Throughout these deliberations the reader is encouraged to consider the potentially conservative or activist orientations that alternate methodologies imply, and to critically evaluate how these mesh with the emerging rhetoric of fostering empowerment that is the cornerstone of the 'new' health promotion."
9819707,"The present study was undertaken to characterize the variables that influence parental perception of metabolic disorders and their genetic origin before and after genetic counselling, the effect of counselling on parental attitudes towards prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination, and the factors affecting parental coping with burden. Parents of children with metabolic diseases from 32 Arab-Muslim families were interviewed, answering a pre-structured questionnaire. These interviews indicate the following. (1) Traditional belief and religious commitment are more important determinants than education in parental perception of inherited metabolic diseases. (2) The number of affected children has a greater impact on parental evaluation of the burden than the number of healthy children. The social component, i.e. the way families are viewed by society, is the most significant factor of the burden. (3) Parents use different techniques to divide responsibility regarding reproduction. Having a healthy child and the availability of prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination were the two most important factors in parental reproductive decision making. In the absence of a healthy child and when the burden was perceived as too heavy, parents tended 'not to decide'. (4) Parental attitude to pregnancy termination was dependent on two factors: religious commitment (leading to objection) and severity of disease (leading to flexibility and approval). (5) In almost all families, genetic counselling altered parental perception of the disease and its hereditary origin. We conclude that genetic counselling and population education may be helpful in the prevention of consanguineous marriages and in family planning, even in a society that values traditional beliefs very highly."
9244971,"Communication between asylum seekers/refugees and general practitioners/physicians of the three main outpatient sectors for the Swiss national Health System (general practice, medical outpatient and accident & emergency departments) are being described and analysed. The data have been collected during three cross-sectional studies investigating the health status of asylum seekers and refugees and the health services provided to them. These studies addressed the problem exclusively from the point of view of the health care providers. Data on language capabilities, sociocultural aspects of communication and the necessity and availability of interpreters have been collected with questionnaires. The main results of the questionnaires have been followed up in group discussions with general practitioners. The majority of general practitioners/physicians felt that most of the communication problems were related to speaking a common language. Only about one out of two adult asylum seekers/refugees knew German, French, Italian or English. Particularly during the group discussions it was brought forward that cultural and social factors additionally complicate communication during patient-doctor interactions. When the data of the outpatient consultations of the main studies were analysed, it became obvious that interpreters were significantly more often present in consultations with patients with psychological/psychosocial diagnoses than those with somatic diagnoses (72% vs. 55%). This can be interpreted in two ways: (1) if a patient suffers from a psychological/psychosocial problem, it is more likely that an interpreter will be asked to assist during the consultation or (2) if an interpreter is present during a consultation, it is more likely that a psychological/psychosocial problem will be detected. With the exception of children, most of the general practitioners/physicians felt that non-professional interpreters (relatives, friends) were adequate for coping with most of the tasks. The following areas for improvements were identified: (1) availability of professional interpreters and quality as well as organisational issues related to interpretation, (2) language training for asylum seekers and refugees and (3) creation of awareness among general practitioners/physicians towards cultural and socioeconomic determinants of patient-doctor interactions and training."
9414976,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the comparability of outpatients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and patients with IBS in primary care with regard to severity of complaints, perceived limitations, other aspects of the complaints, and sex differences. AIMS: To compare outpatients with IBS with primary care patients with IBS. PATIENTS: One hundred and nine patients with IBS were recruited from general practices in Amsterdam and 86 patients with IBS were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine of the University Hospital in Nijmegen. METHODS: Each patient completed a questionnaire on demographic variables, abdominal complaints, related complaints, and attributed causes of their abdominal complaints. The scores of the two groups were compared by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The outpatient group contained significantly more men, reported more severe abdominal pain, more frequent complaints, more interference with daily activities, and a higher degree of avoidance of activities (p < 0.01) than the primary care group. When each sex was analysed separately, these differences remained for female (p < 0.01) but not for male patients. Outpatients were more likely to attribute their complaints to somatic causes (p < 0.01), whereas primary care patients were more likely to attribute their complaints to stress (p < 0.01) or their agitated way of life (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that a high severity score, a large number of additional complaints, and a low score on the stress attribution were important determinants for being in the outpatient group. CONCLUSIONS: Female outpatients consider their complaints to be more serious and interfering than do patients with IBS in primary care. Male outpatients were comparable to primary care patients with IBS. More research needs to be done into sex specific differences in IBS and into the factors that influence the decision to refer a patient with IBS."

The research identifies the determinants of psychosocial recovery for those four demographic groups. A total of 431 families who were victims of a tornado were interviewed for the study. A path model of the determinants of psychosocial recovery is presented, and observations are made regarding intervention strategies for older disaster victims."
31968900,"Reproductive success in many mammals depends on synchrony between copulation and ovulation, which is insured by the phenomenon of heat in the female. Certain anthropoid primates including rhesus monkeys do not show heat but may copulate throughout the menstrual cycle, especially when pairs are isolated from conspecifics. In social groups, however, mating mostly occurs around midcycle. We wished to test the hypothesis that copulations are more closely linked to ovulation when males have simultaneous access to several females in different cycle phases. Artificial menstrual cycles were therefore induced by giving hormones to ovariectomized female rhesus monkeys observed in small social groups that each consisted of four females and one male. The cycles of two hormone-treated femlab in each group were either made to synchronize or be offset by 7-day increments so that the estradiol peak of one female occurred 7 days before, and 7 and 14 days after, the estradiol peak of the other. Radioimmunoassay of plasma samples (N = 224) confirmed the timing of the estradiol peaks. Results from eight unique male-female groups (4 males, 8 females, 16 male-female pairs, 718 tests) fully supported the hypothesis. Compared with synchronized cycles, the amplitudes of rhythmic changes in offset cycles were reduced for ejaculations made by males but greatly enhanced for ejaculations received by females. We propose that this socio-hormonal integration of behavior in the group is highly adaptive and enhances the reproductive success of both males and females."
10468392,"Most national surveys of health care utilisation capture only self-reported measures of morbidity. If self-reported morbidity is measured with error, then the results of applied work may be misleading. In this paper we propose a model of the relationship between morbidity and health service utilisation which allows for reporting errors and simultaneity. Errors in self-reported morbidity are expressed as a function of person-specific reporting thresholds and recent contact with health services, arising because of better self-evaluation of current health status or a desire to justify consumption of a publicly-provided good. We demonstrate the bias in ignoring the potential problems of reporting errors and simultaneity for a variety of special cases, but in the general case the biases are of ambiguous sign. The empirical nature of these biases is investigated using limiting long-standing illness (LLI) and recent contact with a General Practitioner (GP) in two waves of The UK Health and Lifestyle Survey. Biomedical measures of functioning are used as objective indicators of health status. We find evidence of substantial and significant differences between individuals in reporting thresholds and some evidence that the reporting of LLI may depend on recent visits to a GP. Adjustments for these biases significantly increase the estimated effect of morbidity on utilisation."
2521115,"This research examined elderly people's social network ties and their awareness of services available to them. For this sample of 1,224 persons aged 60 years or older, having nonkin advisers, membership in clubs, or contacts with other community agencies and availability of transportation, education, and moderate-size kin networks predicted service awareness. Lack of available kin, the presence of large kin networks, having kin confidants, and being old, poor, and female, or black inhibited service awareness."
7555215,"Using census and administrative agency data for 177 urban census tracts, variation in rates of officially reported child maltreatment is found to be related to structural determinants of community social organization: economic and family resources, residential instability, household and age structure, and geographic proximity of neighborhoods to concentrated poverty. Furthermore, child maltreatment rates are found to be intercorrelated with other indicators of the breakdown of community social control and organization. These other indicators are similarly affected by the structural dimensions of neighborhood context. Children who live in neighborhoods that are characterized by poverty, excessive numbers of children per adult resident, populations turnover, and the concentration of female-headed families are at highest risk of maltreatment. This analysis suggests that child maltreatment is but one manifestation of community social organization and that its occurrence is related to some of the same underlying macro-social conditions that foster other urban problems."
9577303,"In pregnancy, the additional demands for Fe are thought to be met principally through increased maternal dietary Fe absorption and by mobilization of maternal Fe stores. In a general population sample of 576 women we examined the maternal and dietary characteristics which influenced Fe stores (assessed by serum ferritin concentration) in early pregnancy. The effects of these characteristics on two measures of functional Fe status (mean cell volume and haemoglobin concentration) were also considered. Serum ferritin concentrations were lower in multiparous women (P < 0.0001) and in those with a lower BMI (P = 0.01), and rose with increasing alcohol intake (P < 0.0001). Ferritin concentrations fell with increasing Ca intake (P < 0.0001); the proportion of women with serum ferritin values < or = 12 micrograms/l rose from 14% of the women in the lowest quarter of Ca intake to 29% of the women in the highest quarter. Mean cell volume and haemoglobin concentration were not related to Ca intake in early pregnancy. Although Ca added to test-meals reduces Fe absorption, long-term Ca supplementation has not been shown to lower plasma ferritin concentration, suggesting that high habitual Ca intakes would be unlikely to influence Fe status in non-pregnant individuals. Our findings show that in early pregnancy there is an association between high dietary Ca intake and lower Fe stores. This effect of Ca on one aspect of Fe status may result from its influence on Fe bioavailability."
7467670,"The high degree of interindividual variability of processes of aging is mentioned and biographical factors influencing age stage and processes of aging were analyzed. A review of empirical biographical studies is presented, which emphasize a conceptualization of behavior in older age at the interaction of past experience, current situation, and future time perspective of the individual. As an example it is discussed how the mother experiences and reacts to her last child's leaving home (""empty-nest-reaction""). An analysis of the data of the BLSA (1965-1977) demonstrated many patterns of change. It could be shown that there exists consistency as well as variability in personality variables. It could be shown that the biographical and social context was closely related to these interindividual differences in consistency and change. Conditions are multidimensional rather than uniform. This high degree of interindividual variability of change calls for a differential gerontology."
2489983,"The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods."
6706795,"A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed. Smoking, use of drugs, sexual behavior, and drinking of alcoholic beverages at the age of 16 years was related to dropout from secondary school during the 2-year study period. The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed."
3701582,"Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors."
7610436,"Socioeconomic health differences (SEHD) are relatively small in childhood. In adolescence they almost seem to disappear and among young adults they re-emerge. This article deals with mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of health differences by studying a group of 10-11 year old children in The Netherlands (n = 908). The role of determinants of health in the relation between socioeconomic status and health (causation) is studied, as well as the influence of health on school performance (selection). Both causation and selection mechanisms prove to exist. Life style and life circumstances are unequally distributed among the socioeconomic groups and can (partly) explain the relation between socioeconomic status and health. The health of the children is related with school performance, which can be seen as health selection. This relation however was only found in the lowest socioeconomic groups. In the lowest socioeconomic groups less healthy children perform worse at school than healthy children. The unequal distribution of determinants of health and health selection in the educational career among children probably contribute to SEHD in adult life."
7226684,"In an effort to provide the clinician with suggestions for preventive and remedial approaches to adolescent pregnancy, the nature, medical, social, economic, and psychological aspects of the problem are reviewed and discussed. While the rate of adolescent pregnancy is declining, there are more than 560,000 deliveries to teenagers annually. Medical risks are significantly diminished by early and comprehensive prenatal care. The major complications continue to be social and economic. Lower I.Q.s in offspring of adolescent mothers have been reported. Failure to complete high school significantly increases the risk of unemployment, trapping the premature parent and her offspring in a web of poverty. A lack of a sense of future and viable alternatives may legitimize the option of motherhood in the minds of many adolescent girls. Furthermore, an ignorance and a denial of sexuality combined with the developmental imperatives of experimentation and rebellion place the adolescent at high risk for pregnancy."
3453175,"To explore the psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination (BSE) among women, we studied a stratified random sample of 264 women students, faculty, and staff in a university community. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported frequency of BSE, and predictors included measures of general health predispositions, variables of the Health Belief Model, the impact of a woman's social network, a set of secondary non-health-related barriers and benefits, and the woman's evaluation of her personal health care system. Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice."
1560664,"A survey was conducted of drinking, drug use attitudes, beliefs, personality and demographic characteristics of students on a university campus. Gender, ethnic and social group differences were also examined. It was concluded that a biopsychosocial matrix of determinants influenced alcohol consumption and its excessive consumption. Two general factors emerged from analyses of the results. They may be interpreted as entering into a complex approach-avoidance conflict where the net approach tendency determines overall alcohol consumption. Personality characteristics and presumably their biological correlates, as well as set and setting, or attitudes, beliefs and environmental influences contribute to the approach-avoidance conflict that determines abstinence or varying amounts of alcohol consumption."
9245679,"BACKGROUND: Within the CINDI framework, a European ""Quit and Win"" contest was organized in 1994. In Finland the number of participants was 5,879 (0.6% of smokers). In the CINDI demonstration area, North Karelia (NK), the participants numbered 618 (2.0% of smokers). This study compared abstinence maintenance among the participants in NK with the rates found elsewhere in Finland and analyzed determinants for successful quitting. METHODS: A follow-up study was conducted 12 months after the quit date with a sample of 2,114 participants. Response rates of 67-68% were achieved (n = 1,419). The abstinence was assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months. Two estimates are presented: (1) the proportion of abstainers among the respondents and (2) the proportion of abstainers among the sample, considering all nonrespondents smokers. The determinants for maintenance of smoking cessation were analyzed with logistic regression. RESULTS: Using the first estimate, the rates at 1/6/12 months were 75/36/28% in NK and 70/28/21% elsewhere (P < 0.01). Using the second estimate, the corresponding rates were 50/24/19% in NK and 46/19/14% elsewhere. The most significant determinants for successful quitting were sex, age, marital status, level of withdrawal symptoms, previous quitting attempts, and support received. CONCLUSIONS: The recruitment of smokers and the maintained cessation were more successful in the demonstration area. The difference between areas was explained by differences in the combined professional and lay support and by the sex and age distributions."
8105905,"Reports of clinical outcomes after commencement of dialysis treatment among elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are not been numerous. This paper describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the elderly treated for ESRD in Canada using the Canadian Organ Replacement Register data. Comparisons with younger age groups are also presented. Analyses of data for the period 1981-1991 indicated that the elderly (65+) represent an expanding portion of all new ESRD patients in Canada. Distributions of dialysis modalities showed no major differences by age groups (45-54, 55-64, 65-75, 75+). However, the overall usage of intermittent peritoneal dialysis has decreased over time (from 17% of patients in 1981-83 to 7% in 1990-91). Deaths from social causes were slightly more frequent among the elderly (15.9% of all deaths among those aged 65+ vs 10% among those aged 45-64). Moreover, deaths from infections were more common among patients on dialysis for a longer period of time and more common among patients on peritoneal dialysis than among those on hemodialysis. Discontinuations of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of the inability to cope increased with age. Patients with comorbid conditions were more likely to receive hemodialysis, and, as expected, the presence of these conditions increased with age and significantly reduced survival. Other determinants of survival included calendar period of registration, renal center size, and treatment modality. This paper illustrates the many changes over time in the elderly population treated for ESRD. Also of importance, however, is the elderly Canadian population with ESRD which is not presently treated."
2250037,"Data from the 1985-86 Japanese census are analysed to explore the determinants of the divorce rates in Japan's forty-seven prefectures, using two theoretical models: (a) the social integration model, which is shown to have a greater utility in predicting Japanese divorce levels than (b), the human capital model. Female emigration patterns play a significant role in affecting the divorce rate. Population increase and net household income are also important predictors of the Japanese divorce rate and urbanization has a great influence in modern Japan. Demographic and aggregate variables such as migration, urbanization, and socioeconomic factors are useful when organized under a social integration model."
2707901,"This study examines factors which contribute to elderly abuse and neglect by caregivers in a domestic setting. Methodological and conceptual variations and problems in previous studies have led to considerable confusion as to the determinants of this important social problem. A more rigorous research design was used in this study than has been previously employed. Fifty-nine abused elders from a model project site for the study of elderly abuse were compared with forty-nine non-abused clients from a home care program in the same agency. Using a research instrument designed by the authors, data related to the following aspects of the lives of the elders and their caregivers were collected: psychological status, stressful life events, social networks, mutual dependency, and the nature of their relationships. The study indicates that members of abusive families are more likely to have emotional problems which contribute to interpersonal difficulties. Abused elders are not more dependent on caregivers for many of their daily needs. However, the abused elderly and their caregivers have become increasingly interdependent prior to the onset of abuse because of the loss of other family members, increased social isolation, and the increased financial dependency of the perpetrator on the elderly person."
8172115,"The study assessed mortality and morbidity risks as related to nutritional status of moderate and strict vegetarians in Germany. The total cohort of 1904 self-identified persons was followed up for 11 y. Compared with national mortality rates for Federal Republic of Germany, the observed deaths for all causes were below expectation by a factor of 0.44 for men and 0.53 for women. The mortality for colon cancer was reduced [standardized mortality ration (SMR 44.1 for men and 77.9 for women]. No deaths were observed from rectal cancer. A vegetarian lifestyle of long duration (> or = 20 y) was associated with decreased overall and cancer mortality. Other determinants of decreased cause-specific mortality were physical activity, body weight, and strictness of adherence to the life-style. The relationship between a vegetarian and fiber-rich diet and a decreased risk for colon cancer has been reported in many studies. In this study, the influence of other factors such as health-conscious behavior and a healthy lifestyle seem to indicate partly stronger effects than nutrition itself. This may explain the generally better health of moderate vegetarians."
12314072,"The factors affecting the modern decline in fertility in the Netherlands are explored using data from censuses from 1930 to 1971 and additional unpublished sources. Particular attention is paid to the influence of religion, socioeconomic status, and region. The author concludes that ""a theory formulated by Lesthaeghe and Wilson on the relation between modes of production and secularization and the pace of fertility decline in Western Europe offers--in combination with van Heek's views on the special position of Dutch Roman Catholicism--a starting point for an explanation of why the fertility decline of Roman Catholics, self-employed and agricultural labourers lagged behind.""

3811607,"Data concerning histories of Adenoidectomy (Ad), Tonsillectomy (T) and Appendectomy (Ap) were collected from the escorts (mainly mothers) of 2296 children 3-12 years-old. The children were admitted as outpatients at the First Department of Paediatrics of the University of Athens or the Polyclinic of the Children's Welfare Center of PIKPA in Pireaus, during the last six months of 1983. Among children with median age of about six years, 12 percent had already had at least one operation (Ad, T or Ap); this proportion increased to about 25 percent among children with median age of about 10 years. The cumulative incidence of Ad and/or T was higher among boys, whereas the cumulative incidence of Ap was higher among girls. The age adjusted cumulative incidence of Ap was significantly higher in the lower social class, whereas there was no social gradient with respect to Ad or T. There were strong intra-individual correlations among the three studied operations; in particular the age adjusted cumulative incidence of Ap was 2.9 times higher among children with Ad and/or T than among children without any of these operations. Since there are no apparent biomedical reasons to account for the observed intra-individual associations, it appears likely, that these associations reflect parental or physician's attitudes leading to unjustifiable operations in some of the children."
3225143,"Subjects completed two brief questionnaires, one concerning the description of, and attitudes towards schizophrenia and schizophrenics and the second on the possible cause of schizophrenia. Both questionnaires yielded a clearly interpretable factor structure and the relationship between the cause and 'symptoms' was examined. The results are discussed in terms of the range, determinants and structure of lay beliefs in mental illness, particularly schizophrenia."
6706793,"Questionnaires addressing areas expected to relate to contraceptive use were completed by 230 female adolescents. Contraceptive use among the 130 sexually active subjects were predicted by a model composed of 12 scales assessing social permissiveness, costs and benefits of contraception, parent communication, boyfriend support, sex education and knowledge, attitudes about pregnancy and contraception, and access to contraception services. Scales from the predictive model which raise ideas for potential intervention strategies assessed parent communication, boyfriend support, and perceived costs and benefits related to contraception. Since there has been public concern that intervention programs for enhancing adolescent contraceptive use might also stimulate sexual activity, correlations were computed between the predictive scales and the measure of sexual experience among all 230 subjects. These data indicated that positive parent communication about sexuality and a perception of high benefits and low costs associated with contraceptive use were not positively correlated with sexual experience. Implications for the prevention of adolescent pregnancy are discussed with an emphasis on designing innovative sex education, improving parent-child communication, resolving conflicts in contraceptive decisionmaking, and supporting the role of boyfriends in contraceptive use."
7983095,"This study analysed factors associated with unintended pregnancy among adolescent and young adult women in Santiago, Chile. Three variations of a behavioural model were developed. Logistic regression showed that the effect of sex education on unintended pregnancy works through the use of contraception. Other significant effects were found for variables reflecting socioeconomic status and a woman's acceptance of her sexuality. The results also suggested that labelling affects measurement of 'unintended' pregnancy."
10924032,"The future of social medicine is based on 150 years of history and the rapidly evolving context within which medicine functions in modern societies. There are two views of social medicine. One is based on the vision of Guerin and, particularly, Virchow 150 years ago that: ""Doctors are the natural advocates of the poor, and social problems are largely within their jurisdiction."" The New York Academy of Medicine's Institute on Social Medicine 50 years ago reflected this broad view. Medicine, however, enamored of the biomedical paradigm and the advances in knowledge through biomedical research, largely abandoned this broad perspective, even as the knowledge about the social, behavioral, and environmental determinants of health was advancing rapidly. A second view of social medicine, and one that has influenced many in the past 30 years, was defined by McKeown and Lowe: ""Social medicine is concerned with a body of knowledge and methods of obtaining knowledge appropriate to a discipline. This discipline may be said to comprise (a) epidemiology, and (b) the study of the medical needs of society, or in the contemporary short hand medical care."" Social medicine, in my view, includes not only the definition of McKeown and Lowe, but the broader context within which medicine fits in society. The context is changing. The social contract as defined by Bismarck and Beveridge has to be redefined. Just as the New York Academy of Medicine provided the vision of social medicine 50 years ago, the Academy has given us a new vision with the publication of Medicine and Public Health: the Power of Collaboration in 1997. Authored by Dr. Roz Lasker, director of the Academy's Division of Public Health, the book identifies the key changes required by medicine and public health to advance the goals of medicine and public health for the benefit of both individual patients and the population as a whole. The book points the way for the future of social medicine by identifying not only what needs to be done, but also how to do it."
7282978,"The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology."
3186028,"The pattern of disease in New Zealand is changing and will continue to do so. Some trends are predictable, while others (such as the epidemic of AIDS) may be unexpected. Analysis of past improvements in health suggests that medical research would be more productive if greater attention were paid to the external influences and personal behaviour which are the chief determinants of health. Apart from such general implications, analysis of the changing patterns of disease is vital as a stimulus and guide for medical research of all kinds. More effective monitoring of disease trends in New Zealand will require improvement in the quality and timeliness of routine health statistics, and training of adequate numbers of epidemiologists to analyse and interpret the data. Such developments are essential if medical research is to make a full contribution to the health of New Zealanders."
3669072,"This study employed multivariate analyses and structural modeling procedures to examine a model for the determinants of adherence to medical regimens. Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction."
1921101,"Correlations among body weight and sociodemographic factors, including life-style were tested as social determinants of health in a sample of 5,201 adults in Korea. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which sociodemographic variables and life-style associated health behaviors explain body weight distribution. A second aim was to explain the relation of body weight and health status to stress the importance of body weight as an early risk indicator of health status. The canonical correlation between the weight distribution (underweight and overweight) and the independent variables was 0.29, 17% of the total variance was explained. Perceived health level represented the highest contribution (canonical coefficient 0.82) to body weight. Sociodemographic factors such as sex, economic status, and life-style factors such as smoking, exercise, regular meals and sleep showed comparatively high contributions to body weight. The relevance of body weight for health status including the rate of chronic disease and the rate of medical utilization was significant. Especially, underweight was clarified as being more important than overweight to morbidity level and medical utilization. These findings suggest that perceived body weight is an important indicator of health status and is thus a valuable variable to be considered for nursing intervention and health education related to the promotion of health."
1492502,"Complex associations between alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, eating habits and physical exercise are explored. Data from the 1985 German Cardiovascular Prevention Study are used to explore associations between these behaviours, separate for young men (n = 561) and young women (n = 509) between 25 to 34 years of age. Analyses concern three forms of associations: 1. associations between different categories of single health behaviours; 2. associations between various health behaviours, and 3. associations between health behaviours, and their social determinants. Contingency tables, cluster analyses and logistic regression analyses are applied. Cluster analyses identified subgroups with particular health behaviour patterns. One distinct pattern, similarly among men and women, was typified by increased physical exercise, less smoking and increased beer consumption. For young men, results from regression analyses showed significant effects of higher income and positive health attitudes on belonging to this distinct cluster. For young women cluster membership was significantly correlated with higher education and positive health attitudes. Results of the statistical analyses demonstrate the usefulness of a multi-methods approach in studying complex behaviour patterns. Finally the relevance of the present findings for future studies and applications is indicated."
11081011,"OBJECTIVE: To identify determinants of mental and physical health as a function of disease state in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A sample of 129 SLE patients (mean age 42.01 years; SD 11.09) was recruited from 9 immunology/rheumatology clinics across Canada. Patients completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress, social support, coping, stress, and health-related quality of life. Physicians rated disease activity (using the revised Systemic Lupus Activity Measure; SLAM-R) and damage (using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index). Mental and physical health composite scores were derived from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36. Patients were subdivided into more active (SLAM-R > or = 10; n = 38) or less active disease states (n = 91). RESULTS: Better mental health was predicted by more education and less emotion-oriented coping in the patients in a more active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.46). Better mental health was predicted by less stress, less emotion-oriented coping and more task-oriented coping in patients during a less active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.45). Better physical health was predicted by more emotion-oriented coping in patients in a more active disease state (P = 0.04; R2 = 0.11). Better physical health was predicted by less stress and younger age in patients during a less active disease state (P = 0.0001; R2 = 0.20). CONCLUSION: The positive association between emotion-oriented coping and better physical health in patients during a more active disease state suggests that this style of coping may be more adaptive in situations that are considered uncontrollable (e.g., SLE flare). Predictors of mental health were similar to those found in the literature, especially for SLE patients in a less active disease state."
2610569,"The results of a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of caries in a sample of 3,237 children aged 5 to 21 are described in relation to some objectives of the WHO program. The prevalence of caries is high in the sample: 1. 31.5% of the children aged 5 to 6 are free of caries (according to the WHO objectives, 50% of the children aged 5 to 6 should have no caries), 2. the mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMF/T index) in children aged 11 to 12 is 6.6 (The DMF/T should be less than or equal to 3). The frequency of toothbrushing is distributed as follows: 23% of the children brush their teeth once a week or less, 46% brush their teeth once a day, and 31% brush their teeth twice a day or more. The purpose and the frequency of the consultations at the dentist's office have been examined: 15% of the children never consult the dentist, 44% consult the dentist in case of toothache, and 41% go to the dentist's office for screening or control. Only 3.2% of the children use regularly and appropriately fluoride tablets. Since the variance of the results is large, it is difficult to distinguish explaining variables or determinants. However, the data indicate that social groups show differences in DMF indices as well as in the behaviors associated with dental hygiene and prevention."
6542479,"Reproductive and agonistic behaviors in Siamese fighting fish were investigated in eight experiments, and some consequences and determinants of these sequences were isolated. First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior."
6464823,"A sample of delinquent and nondelinquent male adolescents was assessed with respect to locus of control and intellectual achievement responsibility. Data were also gathered concerning age, family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and school grade. Results were subjected to a multivariate analysis and showed support for a multidimensional model of locus of control. There was no difference in expectancy of control for negative academic events between delinquents and nondelinquents. In general, birth order and delinquency were the two most important determinants of locus of control. Results are discussed in terms of previous literature on locus of control with particular consideration paid to expectations of control."
3793442,"We analyze the ethical issues related to the physician's role in informing about, advising, rejecting, or performing a definitive birth control procedure (sterilization). We define a rational request for tubal ligation, the limited delaying (or facilitating) role that guidelines for deciding on ligation should have, the justifiable reasons for rejecting a request, and the physician's obligations and options. We also consider the need to supply adequate information, the implications of recommending a second-best treatment, and the pivotal place of the ""likelihood of regret"" in medical decision-making."
9732071,"Data from a cohort of young HIV-negative gay and bisexual men were analyzed to identify determinants of sexual risk-taking at baseline. Gay/bisexual men aged between 18 and 30 completed a self-administered questionnaire including demographics, depression, social support, substance use, and consensual versus nonconsensual sex. Risk-takers were defined as those who had unprotected anal sex with casual male sex partners in the previous year; non-risk-takers were defined as those who reported consistent condom use during anal sex with all male partners in the previous year. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of sexual risk-taking. Of 439 men studied, risk-takers had less education, a higher depression score, less social support, and were more likely to report nonconsensual sex and recreational drug use relative to non-risk-takers. Independent predictors of sexual risk-taking were low education, nitrite use, low social support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.65; 95% CI, 1.04-2.59), and nonconsensual sex experienced as a youth or adult (AOR=1.85; 95% CI, 1.15-2.96). Young gay/bisexual men reporting nonconsensual sex, low social support, or nitrite use were significantly more likely to have recently had unprotected anal sex with casual partners. HIV prevention programs aimed at young gay/bisexual men should include sexual abuse counselling and foster community norms supporting safer sex practices."
7202850,"Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children."
3437081,"Although it is of both practical and theoretical importance very little work has been done on adolescents' knowledge of, and beliefs about, the economy. Two studies are reported in this paper--the first concerns the determinants of economic values in a population of 16-17 year old British schoolchildren, and the second concerns economic preferences and knowledge in a larger group of slightly older adolescents. By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on economic socialization."
3305594,"In this article, the literature on body image and related obesity perceptions is discussed. Research findings which span a 20 year period are summarized. Initially, Cheryl Rittenbaugh's concept of obesity as 'a culture bound syndrome' serves as a rationale for understanding sociocultural dimensions of body size perceptions. In this regard, the premise that perceptions of obesity and overweight have cultural determinants is substantiated in the reviewed literature. Societal preferences for body build and size and attitudes about weight are examined as a framework for understanding the impact that social perceptions have on individuals who are either overweight or obese. As a result of negative attitudes toward fatness, stigmatization of overweight people has been consistently documented. In related studies, investigators have centered on self-perceptions of obese and overweight individuals. According to the data, the existence of body image disturbance among extremely overweight individuals is a common phenomenon. However, evidence is also presented that suggests that normal weight individuals (especially women) may also have difficulty in accurately assessing their body size. The final focus of this paper is the relationship between body image and weight change behavior. As indicated in the discussion, this area of research has received the least amount of attention in the literature, and the present findings are contradictory. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research directions."
2692802,"Our emphasis in the past has been on disease prevention rather than health promotion. This emphasis served us reasonably well when morbidity was high throughout society and when interventions at the community level were able to achieve massive reductions. It is not faring as well now that the major shared environmental determinants of disease have been controlled. The present situation calls for changes in individual health-related behaviour and individual clinical interventions to achieve comparable progress. As difficult to win as collective commitments to community-level interventions have been, compliance in a free society by often unmotivated persons in numerous individual instances of decision making in daily life is even more difficult. Health promotion offers the promise of a quantum leap in improving the health status of the community by participating in behaviour perceived as not only responsible but appropriate and desirable, providing positive reinforcement rather than anxiety-provoking caution. Favourable social trends, such as physical conditioning and dietary changes may be encouraged through media interventions. There are biological limitations to this approach, however. Many healthful practices confer little benefit on large groups of people and a few may be harmful to selected groups. Vigorous promotion of weight reduction and obesity control, for example, may lead to profound dissatisfaction with body image and to severely self-destructive behaviour among those prone to eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive eating. Health promotion activities may fit well with social trends but their adverse potential can be aggravated because failure to comply can be penalized by peer disapproval in a way that disease prevention strategies usually are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6684973,"The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts."
9624723,"AIMS: This is the third of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status and mortality risk. Analysis of three general population surveys of women evaluated all-cause mortality rates by drinking pattern. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Raw data from three studies of adult women were evaluated. Logistic regression models controlled for confounding characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results. MEASUREMENTS: Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity, frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern (including long-term abstainers and former drinkers) as well as age and other confounding variables. Models also evaluated interactions of age and, respectively, long-term abstinence and former drinking. FINDINGS: In models in which age was controlled, odds of death for long-term abstainers and former drinkers (defined by volume or quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers; odds of death for moderate and heavy drinkers (defined by quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death were similar for abstainers and light drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death for heavy drinkers (defined by volume and quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When interactions of age and the two forms of abstinence were introduced, one study showed a significant effect of age and former drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Results were consistent with the hypothesis that characteristics of abstainers other than their non-use of alcohol may account for their higher mortality risk. With the exception of former drinkers compared to light drinkers, when interactions were introduced into models (for measures of quantity and frequency) findings were homogeneous across studies, lending generalizability to results."

9642904,"This study examines the determinants of social support among a sample of 642 caregivers of persons with AIDS living in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Respondents include both traditional family caregivers (mothers, spouses, other relatives) and non-traditional caregivers (friends, homosexual partners). Multiple regression analyses are conducted to assess the independent effects of six sets of variables on emotional and instrumental support: social-structural factors (age, education, employment status), caregiver's relationship to the person with AIDS, situational variables (caregiver's HIV status, patient's functional disability, interpersonal conflict), social network factors (contact with family, contact with friends, community integration), personal resources (mastery, caregiving competence), and use of formal community services (patient-directed services, caregiver-directed services). A number of factors and conditions appear to be relevant for caregiver support. For example, results indicate that network factors, including frequency of contact, conflict, and community integration, are importantly related to caregivers' perceptions of emotional support. There is also a trend suggesting lower emotional support among traditional family caregivers, relative to nonfamily caregivers, within gender categories. With respect to instrumental assistance with caregiving, factors that place greater demands and time constraints on caregivers, such as being employed and caring for an AIDS patient with greater functional limitations, appear to increase the level of informal instrumental support the caregiver receives. Partners and spouses, however, receive significantly lower instrumental assistance, independent of other factors. Implications of the findings are discussed."
12291764,"""In Canada, the proportion of women among immigrants fluctuates around 50 percent, with a slight increase in recent years. Another important characteristic of immigration...is a radical change in the composition of origin of flows in the past three decades--European-dominated streams have been replaced by those originating mostly in Asia. This paper focuses on female Asian immigrants in Canada.... Major Asian source countries of female immigrants (Hong Kong, Philippines, India, China, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Lebanon and Iran) give evidence to the growing importance of political push factors and sending countries' policies-facilitation factors as crucial determinants of international migration."""
9332807,"This study aimed to assess the clinical oral health outcome effects among schoolchildren participating in a school-based oral health education (OHE) programme. Local social, cultural and environmental conditions were determinants of the school-based OHE programme, which was compiled on the basis of prevailing beliefs and on what teachers and educational authorities considered to be important for the oral health of schoolchildren. Consequently, the practical aspects of oral hygiene and information on the cause and prevention of caries and gingivitis were the components of oral health education. The teachers were prepared to carry out weekly supervised toothbrushing sessions and monthly lessons on aspects of oral health for the school year in grade 4. Eight participating schools were selected for the clinical effect evaluation and four non-participating schools served as the control. In total, 309 children from the participating schools and 122 children from the non-participating schools were available for the evaluation. Their ages varied between 9 and 14 years. The mean plaque score, calculus score and gingival bleeding score at baseline and at follow-up examinations 3, 8, 15 and 36 months later were not significantly different for participating schools and controls. The mean DMFT value at baseline was 0.4 and 3 years later 0.9 in both the participating and control schools. In conclusion, the present study shows that the implemented school-based OHE programme did not result in significant reductions of the clinical parameters measured."
1512443,"Determinants of economic well-being among men 25-44, 45-64, and 65+ were examined using data from the 1984 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. A path analysis explored race, education, and occupational history effects on income adjusted for annuitized assets, household composition, and underreporting of unearned income. Direct and total education effects were undiminished among elderly persons, whose income derived mainly from benefits and assets, as compared with the nonelderly subjects whose income was dominated by earnings; education explained more of the variance in adjusted income for the elderly group than for the nonelderly. While Social Security income exerts an equalizing effect across educational attainment groups, private pensions and other important retirement income sources were highly education-dependent, producing a high overall degree of stratification on early-established socioeconomic characteristics."
3749967,Rumor and misinformation about oral contraceptives continue to prevail in much of Egypt. This study tests the hypothesis that rumor involvement can have a negative and independent impact on pill usage by focusing on a common misbelief that the pill causes 'weakness'. The data comes from a 1981-1982 national self-weighted sample survey of 3283 currently married men and women dealing with family planning and mass media behaviors. The analyses confirm that rumor involvement decreases the probability of current or future pill use by previous users and by those who have never used it. Correct knowledge about the pill is shown to enhance pill usage as do other determinants such as social support for birth control and the desire for no more children. The importance of providing strong contraceptive education programs giving deeper consideration to contraceptive and related health beliefs in delivering fertility regulation services is highlighted.
8690136,"Often in demography, individuals may change state over time for a variety of reasons. Competing-risks hazards models have been developed to model such situations. This paper describes the extension of the discrete-time competing-risks hazards model to a multilevel framework that allows for data at different levels of aggregation. The model is illustrated with data from the 1988 Chinese National Survey of Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence, which collected complete contraceptive histories. Women may stop using a method of contraception for a number of reasons; this paper describes how one can control for correlations between the outcomes of repeated spells of contraceptive use."
2785722,"In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact."
22077172,"Summary In order to unravel the complex set of the determinants of fertility, we suggest that the child-bearing process be separated into a sequence of events and intervals. As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval. The strong effect of ethnicity is consistent with a cultural interpretation, but important qualifications are noted."
10140222,"Something is definitely wrong with the American health care system. Too many citizens are denied health care, and health care costs continue to rise at an uncomfortable and intolerable rate. Ensuring care for all is a paramount goal. There is no way to simultaneously cover everyone; leave the reimbursement of physicians unrestrained; ensure instantaneous access to every imaginable high-technology service; subsidize the world's costliest and least efficient health bureaucracy; and contain costs. Widespread dissatisfaction in all quarters--physicians, hospitals, third-party payers, regulators and consumers--has led to an avalanche of reform proposals. Rapidly changing social, political, and economic environments; rising fiscal pressure; and an evolving understanding of the major determinants of health have also created pressure for changes. There are some new and hopeful signs that America is facing up to the need for changes in the health care delivery system. The Pan American Uni-Care Health Plan that is described in this article may serve as a reasonable balance among these competing priorities."
2649990,"A social epidemiological approach has been used to study social factors associated with chronic disease, as well as to promote community-oriented intervention programs to modify risk for cardiovascular disease. The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk."
3317879,"Social science research on cultural issues in maternal and child health has stressed some aspects and neglected others. From the perspective of both policy applications and theory development, new research efforts could profitably be directed to the following areas: cultural adjustments to changed energy and nutrient requirements in pregnancy and lactation; maternal illness; the mother/infant dyadic interaction; emic views of growth and development; determinants of infant and young child feeding; management of childhood illnesses; popular medicine and childhood illnesses; intra-household food distribution; household composition and maternal and child health; and macrolevel/microlevel linkages and health."
9004368,"The aim was to study the associations of childhood living conditions, together with past and present socioeconomic status, with adult health among Finnish men and women. The data were derived from a nationwide interview Survey on Living Conditions collected by Statistics Finland in 1986. The sample represents the non-institutional Finnish population aged 15 years or older. The number of respondents was 12,057 and the response rate 87%. In this study we analysed 30-year-old and older subjects. Two health indicators were analysed: first, limiting long-standing illness; and second, self-assessed health as ""below good"". Four different indicators of childhood living conditions were included: one concerning economic problems, and three concerning family related social problems during childhood. Additionally, the degree of urbanisation of the childhood living area was examined. Past and present socioeconomic status were measured by the status of origin, i.e. the respondent's father's and mother's education, and the status of destination, i.e. the respondent's own current education. Economic problems during childhood were associated with current health. The association of childhood social problems with health was somewhat weaker and less consistent than that of economic problems. A comparison of the mutual impacts of economic and social problems, respectively, shows that economic problems are stronger and more independent determinants of adult health than social problems. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, past and, particularly, present socioeconomic status are both important determinants of adult health. Current socioeconomic status showed strongest associations with adult health, but living conditions during upbringing, particularly economic problems and status of origin, were also significant predictors."

3811601,"In the context of the first Swiss National Health Survey preventive health behaviour was tested in 3419 Swiss citizens aged over 20 years. A health behaviour index including favourable health attitudes and good utilization of preventive health services was correlated with different social indicators. Age, sex and a good self-rated health were the most important factors associated with a high preventive health behaviour score. Education showed a less strong but also significant influence on positive health behaviour. Overall utilization of health services decreased with high preventive health behavior index."
7996589,"The term ""gender role"" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ""gender identity"" was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."
8044971,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify determinants of coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal female monkeys. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal females modulates reactivity of atherosclerotic coronary arteries. However, no studies have evaluated the factors that modulate coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal females. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five adult premenopausal female monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 32 months. During this time, monkeys were housed in small social groups and determined to be socially dominant (associated with normal ovarian function) or subordinate (associated with impaired ovarian function). After 32 months, coronary artery vasomotor responses to intracoronary acetylcholine, nitroglycerin, and serotonin were assessed by computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography. Coronary arteries of dominant monkeys dilated (+9 +/- 2%), whereas those of subordinate monkeys constricted (-6 +/- 2%) in response to acetylcholine (P < .05). There was no effect of social status on vascular response to nitroglycerin or serotonin (P > .10). Vascular responses to acetylcholine were independent of social status effects on plasma lipids, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis extent. The correlation between acetylcholine responses and plasma estradiol concentration measured on the day of angiography was r = .7 (P = < .01). Furthermore, dilation occurred only if plasma estradiol concentrations were greater than 60 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors and endogenous estrogen production are important modulators of acetylcholine-mediated dilation of atherosclerotic coronary arteries among premenopausal female monkeys."

Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review."
9484309,"This study examined determinants of the treatment climate in 89 psychiatric and substance abuse programs. Clearer policies giving patients more control, and more health and treatment services, were related to more supportive, autonomous, expressive, and practically oriented milieus. In contrast, more policy choice and daily living assistance were associated with less support, personal expression, and practical orientation. Programs in which staff had more paraprofessionals and better team functioning, and in which patients had more social resources and better mental functioning, tended to be more supportive and to have more emphasis on autonomy, personal expression, and practical orientation. Based on these results, we suggest some guidelines on how to change the treatment milieu to benefit patients' adjustment."
8668745,"Although virtually all major theories of health-protective behavior assume that precautionary behavior is related to perceived vulnerability, the applicability of this assumption to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preventive behavior has recently been called into question. This article uses qualitative and quantitative methods to review and integrate the literature relevant to the relation between perceived vulnerability to HIV and precautionary sexual behavior. Specifically, the purpose of the article is to determine whether the extent research supports 2 hypotheses regarding this relation; (a) Perceptions of personal vulnerability to HIV are reflections of current and recent risk and precautionary behavior, and (b) these perceptions motivate precautionary sexual behavior. In addition, it examines the conceptual and methodological strengths and weaknesses of the empirical literature on these questions and provides recommendations for future research."
24301041,"In order to examine the relationships among social network structure, types of social support, and determinants of support satisfaction, an alternative method was used to score the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ). Factor analysis procedures suggested that college students' (N=198) social networks consisted of four groups: nuclear family, other family, friends, and others. Satisfaction with support was positively related to the proportion of the network occupied by nuclear family and negatively related to the proportion of friends in the network. Evidence was found for the presence of both support specialists and support generalists in the networks of the college students. These results are discussed from a developmental perspective with attention to the implications for interventions."
7639909,"The population survey is an important tool in community health assessment, including the physical and psychological aspects of family health. It provides data on health status and health determinants not available from vital statistics and health service utilization. The Keewatin Health Assessment Study (KHAS), which was designed in collaboration with the Keewatin Regional Health Board (KRHB), surveyed a representative sample of the predominantly Inuit population in 8 communities in the central Canadian Arctic. The entire survey included 874 individuals in all age groups, of whom 440 were children and adolescents under 18 years of age, and consisted of questionnaires, clinical examination and laboratory tests. Of the large number of variables on which data were collected, some were of particular relevance to the health of children and the well-being of the family, including: (1) Child growth and development; (2) Nutrition and diet; (3) Social pathologies: suicide attempts and sexual abuse; (4) Oral health; and (5) Audiologic health. In addition to providing cross-sectional data, survey participants constitute a cohort which, if followed up longitudinally, can be used to determine the incidence of specific conditions and identify risk factors which promote or prevent their occurrence. An example of such a cohort study is one on acute respiratory infection. Surveys serve many functions--providing data for planning and evaluation, promoting community awareness of health issues, and addressing basic research questions. The KHAS is one of several surveys launched over the past several years which jointly will begin to provide a circumpolar perspective on the health of Inuit people."
7664129,"Following two previous articles which described changes that are occurring in suicide rates and trends in factors known to be associated with suicides, this article examines in greater depth the effect of occupation and geography on suicide mortality. For both men and women the highest risk occupations are mostly in Social Class I or II. The occupations at highest risk, which include several medical-related professions, and the method of suicide they choose, suggest that easy access to means of suicide is an important factor. Suicide rates for men aged 15-44 are generally higher in Inner London, rural areas, resort and retirement areas, and urban manufacturing areas."
28514037,"Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084)."
6695831,"The association between duration of breast-feeding and nutritional status was studied in a population-based sample of 802 children aged 12 to 35.9 months in Southern Brazil during 1982. The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis. These results are also consistent with a controlled trial on supplementary feeding in the Sudan."
2589474,"Data on nutritional intake and patterns of physical growth in the rural Andean community of Nunoa, Peru (elevation 4,000 m), are described and compared to data previously collected from this location. Food consumption data and selected anthropometric measures were obtained from a sample of 33 households. Estimates of caloric intake from this study are very similar to those obtained in Nunoa during the mid- and late 1960s. However, within the present sample, upper income (i.e., middle class) individuals have significantly higher caloric intakes than those of the lower income group and also appear to have an improved diet relative to individuals of 20 years ago. Anthropometric data show that children of the upper socioeconomic status (SES) group are significantly taller and heavier than the lower SES group children. Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not. These results indicate that nutritional factors have significantly contributed to the extreme pattern of slow growth previously reported for children of Nunoa and, moreover, demonstrate how social and environmental forces interact to create differential levels of stress that contribute to variation in biological well-being."
9696257,"The aim was to compare how general lifestyle, gender and occupational status determine dental health behavior. All the 1012 55-year-old citizens of Oulu (a medium-sized Finnish town) were invited to participate in this study. 780 of them did so. Information about frequency of toothbrushing, use of extra cleaning methods, use of sugar in coffee or tea, and time of the last dental visit, lifestyle, occupational status and gender was gathered from the 533 dentate subjects. Lifestyle was measured by means of questions about physical activity, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and dietary habits. Females and people with a healthy lifestyle brushed their teeth more often. Extra cleaning methods were used more often by people with a healthy lifestyle, whereas gender and occupational status had a weaker association. Males and people with a lower occupational status used sugar in coffee or tea more often. The time from the last dental visit was longer among workers and men; lifestyle had no significant association. At the population level oral cleaning habits are a matter of a health-oriented lifestyle and gender-related behavior. The dental visiting habit has a weaker association with general lifestyle."
3563565,"Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed."
3720261,"These case histories illustrate how medical, psychosocial, cultural and economic factors affect the elderly with chronic arthritis. Physicians need to be aware of their patient's attitudes, concerns, support systems and goals resulting from a lifetime of experience, to provide the most appropriate and effective care. 'Images of future are usually only caricatures of the present' (Starr, 1982), but based on current demography, one can predict trends for the future. It is likely that the elderly of the future will be better off financially, better educated, healthier, more politically connected and strident, but their social support systems will be less effective. The last stems from trends such as declining birth rate, an increasingly mobile society, diminished importance of the nuclear family, and the diminishing attractiveness of professions involved with providing maintenance care. This suggests that the physician and nurse, being the primary gatekeepers for the care of and services for the elderly, must be even more attentive to the non-biological determinants of arthritis disability."
1941394,"The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of multiple psychosocial and knowledge-related antecedent factors that may predict sexual and alcohol and drug use behaviors that are associated with the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus infection. Five hundred forty-four ninth-grade urban high school students were surveyed regarding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to STDs and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Results of multiple regression analyses indicate that higher levels of STD and AIDS knowledge were associated with lower levels of STD and AIDS anxiety (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), fewer negative attitudes toward people with AIDS (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), stronger perceptions of self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.03; p less than 0.01), and stronger peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.05). Negative attitudes toward people with AIDS were inversely related to knowledge (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001), social support (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.01), and perceived self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.01; p less than 0.05). Predictors of alcohol and drug use included perceived peer norms (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001) and strong peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.05; p less than 0.001). The best predictor of sexual risk behavior was alcohol and drug use (R2 delta = 0.07; p less than 0.001). Lower levels of knowledge (R2 delta = 0.14; p less than 0.01) and perceived peer norms (R2 delta = 0.05; p less than 0.05) predicted nonuse of condoms. Our results indicate that several factors relate to adolescent risk for STDs: the connection between peer influence and adolescent risk behaviors, the link between alcohol and drug use and sexual risk behavior, and the role of knowledge in determining nonuse of condoms."
6656327,"Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension."
10696158,"Physical, cognitive, and social factors play a central role in the lithium compliance of people with bipolar disorder. However, studies provide only a partial understanding of this phenomenon and there is currently no nursing model that takes into consideration a combination of factors. This study, based on Pender's preventive health beliefs model, was intended to identify the psychosocial determinants of lithium compliance. A random sample (n = 149) of outpatients at a large Montreal psychiatric hospital was used to measure lithium compliance on the basis of 5 criteria: compliance according to the nurse and according to the patient, appointment compliance, and compliance according to two criteria related to hyperuricemia. Polytomous logistic regression analyses were computed by regressing a composite of these criteria on sociodemographic variables and on the variables of the Pender model: susceptibility, seriousness, control over health, motivation to be healthy, perceived benefits and obstacles, and triggering factors. It appears that being female, being elderly, living with a partner, and perceived treatment benefits and obstacles are determining factors in lithium compliance. These results are all the more important in light of Quebec's newly implemented drug insurance plan, which could increase the obstacles to medication. Nurses will have to be increasingly vigilant with respect to these new obstacles and will have to adjust their interventions accordingly."
2723595,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."
8463204,"Operant and biological theories of the cause of self-injurious behavior (SIB) in people with a mental handicap are often viewed as mutually exclusive. In this single case study, interactions between features of Rett syndrome and operant conditioning as determinants of SIB are examined. Functional analysis by analog methodology indicated different functions for two forms of SIB shown by the subject: automatic reinforcement by sensory stimulation and escape from social interactions. It is suggested that features of Rett syndrome established conditions under which operant conditioning of self-injurious responding was maximized. The implications of this interaction between features of syndromes and operant conditioning for the conceptualization of the cause of SIB are discussed and it is proposed that the notion of a unitary cause of SIB is inappropriate. It is more productive to consider operant conditioning as the process that maintains responding against a background of predisposing and mediating factors which may be biologically determined."
4001231,"180 (15%) patients from 1208 first-hospitalized schizophrenic patients had suicidal tendencies. Our findings show that the suicidal tendencies of schizophrenic patients have their own features. These conclusions can be supported by the differences between the determinants of the suicidal tendencies of schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic population; such different determinants are: sex, age, family and suicidal method. Suicidal tendencies are more frequent among patients without formal thought disturbances. We explain this fact with an ""incoherence of decision processes"". The features of the suicidal tendencies of schizophrenic patients are based on the grounds of psychosis own dynamic."
3897476,"Several important events that have played a major role in shaping the destiny of neurological surgery are recounted: the birth of neurosurgery; the founding of scientific surgery; the origin and evolution of microvascular technique in cerebrovascular surgery. In each case, the clinical breakthroughs stemmed from an apparently irrelevant basic laboratory investigation. Also, in each case, the transfer of the laboratory results to the bedside required clinicians who were prepared by training and knowledge to recognize the clinical significance of the fundamental observations. History tells us that if we are to sustain neurological surgery as a vibrant surgical specialty, we must continue to give top priority to the preparation of young minds through education and research. It is more important to understand this now than ever before, because never before have we been so preoccupied with social and economic issues: a preoccupation that is threatening to divert our attention from the main determinants of our specialty's future viability--the acquisition and application of new knowledge."
6523992,"A comparison between rather short-lived (n = 60) and rather long-lived (n = 88) participants of the initial sample of the Bonn longitudinal study on aging (BOLSA) yielded evidence - with regard to differences in the central tendencies of these two groups - for a variety of determinants of longevity in old age. The statistical analyses included eight constructs or clusters of variables, respectively, that were either empirically or theoretically based and were supposed to have predictive power (intelligence, health status, satisfaction, personality, family involvement, socioeconomic/ecological aspects, coping techniques/dominant themes of life, general social participation). Within each ""cluster"", it could be referred to several different aspects. Besides defining general characteristics of longevious people, the purpose of the study was to look for differentiating aspects. Thus, a host of evidence was yielded for gender- and cohort-linked differences in the structure and relevance of the included central clusters with regard to ""prediction"" of advanced longevity in old age."
12321432,"""This paper will discuss the following: why population policies and programs have traditionally focused on women; what the limitations of current male contraceptives are and why research into new methods [has] proved unfruitful; and why these policies and programs would be more productive if they were to direct more attention toward men."""
7326949,"Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points."
2526781,"Among 269 functionally impaired elderly people residing on 53 Israeli kibbutzim, those cared for principally by informal caregivers were compared with those cared for principally by formal caregivers. The major findings were that the variables differentiating between primary reliance on formal versus informal care are similar to those that have been found in other studies, and that the availability of formal resources was not accompanied by withdrawal of informal supports."
2707492,"Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) inhibit their vocal behavior upon hearing the maternal alarm call of their species. The present study assesses the interaction of the ducklings' experiential history with the environment in which they are tested. If ducklings are reared and tested to the alarm call in small social groups, they respond by dramatically inhibiting their vocalizations. If, however, socially reared ducklings are tested to the alarm call individually in an open field, responsiveness drops precipitously. In addition, individually reared ducklings respond at a far greater level to the alarm call when tested individually, not in groups. Thus, there is an interaction between the rearing history and the testing environment such that the same rearing history leads to different behavioral outcomes depending on the context in which the ducklings are observed. This demonstrates the importance of behavioral context, in addition to developmental history, as one of the determinants of behavior."
6285155,"In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients."
8200878,"This paper explores the importance of gender differences in the impact of tropical diseases on women. Malaria and schistosomiasis are used as examples but most of the observations also apply to other diseases endemic to developing countries. The distinction between sex and gender is discussed and evidence of sex and gender differences in the determinants and consequences of malaria and schistosomiasis, particularly their economic, social and personal dimensions, is reviewed. Issues on which research and intervention studies are needed are identified."
12279766,"""The past decade has witnessed a substantial contraction in the size of the Irishborn community in Britain. This paper uses shift share analysis to assess the extent to which job losses amongst the Irish in Britain over the years 1971-1977 may have induced return migration to Ireland. The article concludes that such 'push' factors are likely to have been relatively weak in comparison to the 'pull' of an Irish economy considerably more buoyant than that of Britain."""
10647902,"Heart rate variability (HRV) measures are associated with coronary heart disease incidence and mortality. Therefore insight into the genetic and environmental determinants of these measures may have clinical relevance. We assessed the role of genetic and environmental factors of time domain and frequency domain HRV indices. Participants were 451 kibbutz members, aged 15 and up, belonging to 80 families. HRV indices were calculated from Holter recordings measured over 5 min. Our data indicate that for the two time- and four frequency domain indices, a mixture of two normal distributions fit the data significantly better than a single normal distribution (P<0.05). We used complex segregation analysis to infer the modes of inheritance of these HRV measures. We found evidence for possible involvement of a recessive major gene in the inheritance of the root mean square of successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD), which is predominantly vagally mediated. A putative major gene explains 28%-34% of the adjusted inter-individual variability. The SD, determined by a mixture of mechanisms, is influenced by environmental and polygenic effects, but not by a major gene. The findings regarding the heritability of the frequency domain indices were not conclusive. However, the involvement of genetic factors was not rejected. Additional studies in extended families are needed to confirm the involvement of major genes in the determination of the autonomic activity."
7833551,"The epidemic of HIV infection and disease in women, adolescents and children represents a complexly intertwined biological and social challenge to health care workers and researchers alike. When considering various issues in confronting this epidemic, women must be viewed as individuals important in their own right, as the primary caretaker of their family members (both infected and uninfected), and as the sexual partners of men who may or may not be infected. Of the myriad of compelling biological questions facing AIDS researchers today, two of the most interesting involve the timing and determinants of vertical transmission and the natural history of HIV infection and disease in women. Scientifically, confronting this epidemic involves research into pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection. Primary emphasis in the research arena in HIV/AIDS in the United States is focused on therapeutic and prophylactic research. Other research issues are very important, including studies of early diagnostic techniques, behavioral research concerning reproductive choices, the role of breastfeeding in HIV transmission, HIV-specific adolescent issues, and surrogate markers of disease progression."
7664962,"This paper attempts to explain the differences in birthweight observed between blacks, white Anglos, Chicanos, and other racial and ethnic groups. The analysis focuses on the role of income and financial assistance from relatives and public programs. Using data from the NLS Youth Panel, I construct a casual model of birthweight containing exogenous social and demographic risk factors and intervening proximate determinants of birthweight. A substantial part of the gap in birthweight between white Anglos and other ethnic groups (especially blacks) can be explained by the unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the latter. On the other hand, blacks and other minorities smoke less and have other favorable proximate characteristics that depress differences in birthweight. When these proximate determinants are controlled, large ethic differences in birthweight remain unexplained by income and other sociodemographic factors."
3646999,"This paper reports the results of an empirical study of psychological stress in nurses employed in a large Special Hospital and caring for mentally disturbed patients who may be a danger to themselves or to others. Such an environment would appear to be dangerous and stressful and the findings of this study show that this sample of nurses do indeed report relatively high levels of stress when compared to some other employed samples. Relationships between psychological distress, anxiety and depression and aspects of their jobs, such as job demands, supports and constraints, are discussed. Individual differences in experiences of stress are also considered."

The strains of globalization, geopolitical reorientation, and economic restructuring are having decisive effects on policies of immigration and multiculturalism. The consequences of such changes are difficult to predict, but in the authors' opinion they could lead to the breakdown of the 'Australian model' which has been remarkably successful in incorporating very large numbers of newcomers from varied backgrounds. The result might be considerable hardship and social tension."""
29357164,"This study introduces a new approach to identify determinants of competitive success in small mammals. An experimental population of Clethrionomys rufocanus consisting of laboratory-raised individuals with known origin and life history was introduced to a realistic competitive situation in the field. Successful females could be distinguished from nonsuccessful females on the basis of four individual attributes measured 25 d after they were released on the study plot, whereas males could not. The most consistent determinant of competitive success seemed to be the sex ratio of the litters in which females were born. Successful females originated from litters with a strongly female-biased sex ratio. These results are considered in the light of recent research on the consequences of prenatal conditions on female social behavior."
3788206,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."
9659409,"The demographic and economic transition that many developing countries are undergoing is producing important changes in diet and lifestyle that greatly impact on disease risks. Among the risk behaviors associated with socioeconomic transition and urbanization are excessive dietary fat intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and environmental contamination. Combined with a reduced infant mortality and increased life expectancy, those risk factors lead to an increasing prevalence of chronic disease like non-insulin dependent diabetes and coronary heart disease. This disease. This disease profile is a relatively new phenomenon in developing countries, where health programs have traditionally focused on ""acute"" interventions such as immunization or oral rehydration. A new approach will be needed to address chronic diseases, which frequently demand a life-long and technically complex medical management, and may have significant impact on the quality of life and productivity of the population. Efforts to address this situation should focus on a) expanding the information base on diet, nutritional status and lifestyle changes in populations migrating to urban areas; b) developing and evaluating approaches for improving diet quality in urban populations, including fortification and community-based supplementation programs; c) understanding better the social and behavioral determinants of nutritional status in the urban poor; and d) defining the role of the food industry and of agricultural production for improving the quality of the food supply in urban areas."
3494378,"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy."
3812821,"This paper attempts to define the characteristics of the ""insolvable problem"" in the dynamics of suicidal children. It posits that part of the underlying dynamics of suicidal children is being pressured to solve a problem, in the family milieu, which is beyond the child's--and often anybody else's--ability to resolve. Moreover, the paper outlines the possible relation between the insolvable problem and various determinants involved in suicidal behavior such as depression, helplessness, hopelessness, rigidity, etc. This discussion will be accompanied by case demonstrations."
2784523,"Three hundred forty-three family-practice patients were surveyed by questionnaire and medical record audit to evaluate the relationships between social support and medical care utilization. Social support was not associated with laboratory test ordering. The mean number of office visits per year was higher for patients with low versus high confidant support (4.71 vs. 3.81, P less than 0.10) and affective support (5.21 vs. 3.60, P less than 0.05). Mean total charges in 1 year were higher for patients with low versus high confidant support ($232 vs. $148, P less than 0.05) and affective support ($244 vs. $154, P less than 0.05). Poor confidant and affective support were both associated with longer visits. Structural measures of social support were not related significantly to any utilization indicator. These findings were maintained in multiple-regression models controlling for physical health and seven demographic characteristics. Second-order regression models revealed interaction by race, employment status, and sex. Blacks showed no effect of confidant support on office visits. Poor confidant support resulted in $201 more in total charges for the unemployed (P = 0.003) versus $49 more for the employed (P = 0.15). Women with low affective support had $119 more in charges (P = 0.001) versus $16 less for men (P = 0.82). The results suggest that low functional social supports are important determinants of increased medical service utilization and that they may have differential effects by race, sex, and employment status, all of which should be considered independently in future studies."
6520656,"Smoking during pregnancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including fetal and neonatal death. These consequences are tragic in many ways, but perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they are preventable if the smoker ceases to smoke during pregnancy. Although in some instances the so-called constitutional hypothesis is difficult to disprove, the available evidence seems more than convincing that it is smoking itself, and not the smoker's unique constitution, that is responsible. Cessation from smoking is clearly advisable at any time, but more so during pregnancy when every cigarette affects both the smoker and her unborn child."
8218426,"Post-psychotic depression (PPD) is defined as the development of depression during the phase of remission of schizophrenia. Two groups of DSM-III-R schizophrenics, one with PPD and the other without PPD (30 subjects in each group) were compared. Significantly more patients in PPD group belonged to nuclear families, had longer duration of psychotic phase of the illness, were hospitalised more frequently and had more sadness and anxiety-somatisation during florid illness phase. The PPD group also had more past history of depression. Although PPD patients had better premorbid personal-social adjustment in comparison with non-PPD group, they perceived themselves to be lacking in social support and had experienced more stressful life events. For patients in the PPD group, stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed age of onset, sadness during florid psychotic state, premorbid adjustment, social support and life events as significant determinants of severity of depression in the post-psychotic phase."
10480698,"BACKGROUND: The importance of paternal determinants in the occurrence of low birthweight and prematurity is not well known. We investigated these outcomes in siblings and paternal half siblings as a function of changes in putative external determinants between two births in fathers who had experienced the birth of a premature and/or low birthweight (PTB/LBW) infant. METHODS: All fathers who, between 1980 and 1992, had an infant born before 37 completed weeks' gestation or weighing <2500 g and a following child were studied. We identified 14 147 pairs of siblings from Danish national registers. The recurrence risk was studied in three sub-cohorts defined by the outcome in the index child (PTB only, PTB/LBW, LBW only). We estimated the recurrence risk in the younger sibling according to changes of female partner, municipality type, occupation, and father's social status. RESULTS: The overall recurrence risk was 16.7% for preterm delivery and 16.8% for LBW. Changing female partner was, as expected, associated with a reduction in the recurrence risk for both outcomes (RR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.27-0.60 for preterm delivery and RR = 0.38; 95% CI : 0.26-0.56 for LBW). None of the other studied factors was associated with changes in the recurrence risk. Fathers who changed partner had offspring with similar birthweight and gestational length between the three sub-cohorts, while a difference was evident in offspring to fathers whose female partner was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify any paternal factor of importance in the occurrence of LBW and preterm delivery."
3975667,"Attitudes of medical students towards the psychosocial aspects of illness is of serious concern to medical educators. It is thought that medical students are overwhelmingly disease-oriented and not sufficiently sensitive to the role of the psychological, emotional, sociological and economic factors in the etiology and management of illness. In the present study the ATSIM (Attitudes Towards Social Issues in Medicine) was presented to third year medical students and compared with their responses obtained 2 years previously when they were first year students. The data suggest that third year medical students have positive attitudes towards certain psychosocial issues (the importance of social factors as determinants of health or illness, the role of preventive medicine in maintaining health, the role of physician-patient interactions in patient care). These attitudes were positive during the students' first year and have been maintained during the course of medical school. These finding are contrary to previous studies which indicate a deterioration in attitudes during the course of medical school."
8372490,"This study examined the influence of educational achievement and occupational position on changes in risk behavior. Study population were 3753 men and women aged 25-64 years who were sampled by the first MONICA Augsburg Survey (Monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). The subjects were sampled in 1984-85, were followed up for three years, and were reexamined in 1987-88. The baseline findings showed for both men and women a statistically significant inverse association between current cigarette smoking and educational level. During the follow-up period the differences between highest and lowest educational levels increased significantly among men. In 1987-88 only 21% of the best educated men were smokers compared to 38% of those with the lowest educational level. Men with low educational levels also drank more alcohol than better educated men, whereas among women those with lowest educational level drank less alcohol than the better educated. Statistically independent of education and age it was found that male civil servants and farmers had the lowest proportion of smokers in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses. Among women, smoking was and remained most prevalent in simple white-collar occupations. In general, the findings indicate that the type of occupation and the actual working conditions have effects on life-style related risk factors which are in part independent of a social gradient. The results also suggest that the tendency to change unhealthy behavior is less pronounced in ""high risk"" groups."
12280179,"""Distinctive types of mobility are identified for the [U.S.] elderly, many of whom also move for traditional reasons. Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves."""

These findings are consistent with the evidence from other developing countries."""
3266155,"This article extends previous research on the household composition of older unmarried women, using a statistical model that treats each of a woman's surviving children as a distinct potential provider of a shared household. Additional possibilities--living alone, living with other nuclear-family relatives, and living with others--are also recognized, providing a varied range of household-structure opportunities for older women. The approach allows us to identify individual child attributes associated with the propensity to coreside with the older unmarried mother. The results confirm earlier findings regarding the importance of income, age, and disability status as determinants of the household composition of older women. We find, however, that unmarried children, especially sons, are more likely to share a household with an elderly mother than are married children. Working reduces the likelihood that a married daughter will live with her older mother. Overall, the findings suggest that the attributes, more so than the sheer numbers, of living children influence the household structure of their mothers."
3060449,"Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement."
3538185,"Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity."
3392764,"This paper presents part of a longitudinal study carried out in the three towns of Khartoum Province in the period December 1983 to April 1985. It was attempting to determine the duration of satisfactory breast-feeding in healthy breast-fed infants of mothers attending maternal and child health centres in the three towns; Khartoum, Khartoum-North and Omdurman. The main objective of the present paper is to compare samples from the three towns in terms of the factors affecting weight gain. Four hundred and thirty-nine infants were recruited at birth and home visited every 2 weeks. At each visit weight was measured and it was recorded whether any supplements had been given and whether the child had been ill. Length was measured every 4 weeks. There were significant differences between the samples from the three towns in attained weights and weight increments. Weight gains were lowest in the Khartoum North sample in the first 3 months, but from 3 to 6 months were highest, almost equalling the NCHS reference. In the Khartoum and Omdurman samples growth from 0 to 3 months exceeded the reference but from 3 to 6 months was less than the reference. Fifty per cent of infants were supplemented by 13 weeks in the Omdurman sample; the median time of supplementation in the other two samples was 17 weeks. Only in Khartoum did delaying supplementation seem to benefit growth. Infections were most common among the Omdurman sample.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
10304496,The diverse factors associated with sexuality among adolescents and the specific issues related to contraception in this developmentally diverse group result in complexity in policy formation. The future of an adolescent may be determined solely on the basis of access to supportive physical and emotional services funded by public and private sector monies. The purpose of this paper is to briefly present contemporary and social policies regarding pregnant adolescent health care. Suggestions as to how these policies can be translated into public adolescent health models are provided. The strategies will be related to primary and secondary public policy interventions.
8847107,"In the coming decades, demographic, economic and social changes will result in an increased proportion of elderly persons in the workforce in most industrialized countries. This trend is causing growing interest in the problems of the aging worker in current employment. The objective of this particular paper is to provide more insight into the impact of aging on the balance between physical work capacity and physical workload. To this end, the scientific literature in the field is reviewed and ordered by means of a specific conceptual model of ""aging and physical workload"". A progressive decline in physical work capacity, characterized by diminished aerobic capacity and muscular capacity, has consistently been reported. However, inter-individual differences appear to be considerable. The question of whether there are systematic differences in physical work demands between younger and older workers within occupations has been answered vaguely. Conflicting results in this matter bring into discussion the role of the actual working method as one of the determinants of the physical workload. An age-related imbalance between physical workload and physical work capacity is suggested to result in a chronic overload, increasing the risk of long-term health effects such as musculoskeletal complaints and disorders. For many aging workers in physically demanding occupations, extreme physical workloads, increasing the risk of disease or disablement, are still reported. The multiconceptual study of aging and physical workload in the present paper reveals several possibilities for preventive measures. However, as information is still lacking, additional research is needed, in particular on the onset and development of long-term effects on health in relation to age and work demands."
8319857,"This paper presents a theoretical framework for investigating psychosocial determinants of delayed prenatal care among disadvantaged women. This framework is based on the Health Belief Model (HBM), which postulates that beliefs concerning prenatal care are modified by psychological and social attributes and may predispose one to delay prenatal care enrollment. The HBM has a number of advantages for family medicine researchers in comparison to other models; its use in future investigations can provide the understanding necessary for overcoming psychosocial deterrents to entry into prenatal care."
3862402,"Analysis of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption patterns recorded in pregnancy could not detect a harmful effect of alcohol at levels below 2 glasses a day. Total abstainers fared very slightly worse than those who drank occasionally. Smoking was associated with lower birth-weight and a worse fetal outcome independent of socioeconomic status, parity, maternal age or alcohol consumption. There was evidence of an interaction between smoking and adverse social and parity factors in low birth-weight."
9878916,"This study aimed to describe the amount of (and trends in) violent deaths in the city of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, and to analyze their determinants. The article presents the spatial distribution of these deaths for the year 1991 and the differences regarding sex, age, and place of occurrence. It also analyzes the potential role of a series of socioeconomic factors, used as indicators of the population's living conditions. An exploratory ecological study was conducted to compare various groups. In 1991 there were a total of 1181 violent deaths in Recife. The study points to an overall mortality rate from external causes of 90.9/ 100,000 inhabitants. The two age groups 10-39 years and 60 years and over were those at highest risk of death. Males showed excess mortality in all age groups. The most important specific causes of death were homicides and traffic accidents, with 51.3% and 23.4%, respectively, of all violent deaths. The authors discuss the differences in the mortality rate from external causes in different social areas, defined according to living conditions and their relationship to the history of the development of Recife."
6148471,"A cohort of homosexual men at high risk of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was monitored to examine the relation between lifestyle, clinical conditions, T-lymphocyte subsets, and antibody to the AIDS-associated human retrovirus, human T-cell leukaemia virus III (HTLV-III). HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS."
9635219,"Accumulating evidence suggests that social contexts in early life have important and complex effects on childhood psychopathology. Spurred by the lack of an explicit operational definition that could guide the study of such effects, we define a social context operationally as ""a set of interpersonal conditions, relevant to a particular behavior or disorder and external to, but shaped and interpreted by, the individual child."" Building on this definition, we offer a series of recommendations for future research, based on five theoretically derived propositions: (a) Contexts are nested and multidimensional; (b) contexts broaden, differentiate, and deepen with age, becoming more specific in their effects; (c) contexts and children are mutually determining; (d) a context's meaning to the child determines its effects on the child and arises from the context's ability to provide for fundamental needs; and (e) contexts should be selected for assessment in light of specific questions or outcomes. As reflected in an increasingly rich legacy of literature on child development and psychopathology, social contexts appear to influence emerging mental disorders through dynamic, bidirectional interactions with individual children. Future research will benefit from examining not only statistical interactions between child- and context-specific factors, but also the actual transactions between children and contexts and the transduction of contextual influences into pathways of biological mediation. Because adverse contexts exert powerful effects on the mental health of children, it is important for the field to generate new, more theoretically grounded research addressing the contextual determinants of psychological well-being and disorder."
7258353,"In 1957 California began placing responsibility for public mental health services on county programs still vary widely in emphasis and size. The authors explored determinants of counties' unequal program developments using per capita expenditures as the measure of county services. Sociodemographic variables that help explain states' social program expenditures correlate weakly or not at all with county mental health expenditures. The most powerful predictor of these expenditures is number of psychiatrists per 10,000 population. Equal per capita expenditures, however, are not a reasonable goal; these can mask wide variations in program content, efficiency, and quality of care."
9246691,"This multilevel study of spatial variability in, and determinants of, birthweight was conducted using individual and ecological data in a geographically defined prospective birth cohort for 1986 in northern Finland. The study area comprises three large areas defined by latitude: Northern Lapland (NL), Southern Lapland (SL) and Oulu province (OP), comprising 74 localities with a total study population of 9216 singleton births. The mean birthweight was 3482 g for NL, 3537 g for SL and 3587 g for OP (NL vs. OP and SL vs. OP: P < 0.05). The crude rate for stillbirths was highest in NL. The women in the northernmost area were socially less privileged and the localities less prosperous compared with those in the southernmost area. Significant spatial clustering of mean birthweights was found (P = 0.0016), with highest birthweight in the south-western part of the study area. A variable expressing the wealth of each locality, the financial capacity category (FCC), had its lowest mean value in NL, with a range of one to six for the localities studied here. A multilevel multiple regression model showed that, after allowing for sex, gestational age, mother's age, height and hypertensive disorders, parity, body mass index, previous low birthweight child and smoking as individual determinants of birthweight, part of the residual variation could be explained by the locality wealth parameter. Using the multilevel model, the differences in mean birthweight across the three latitude areas persisted but were reduced (difference OP vs. NL reduced from 105 g to 86.5 g). The relationship between birthweight and FCC was inverse U-shaped with the highest mean birthweight estimated for localities occurring in the middle of the range (FCC = 3). The wealthiest urban localities (FCC = 6) and the most deprived localities (FCC = 1) both had a predicted birthweight about 60 g below the maximum at FCC = 3, if all other factors were held constant. This result, taken together with the spatial clustering of birthweights, suggests that there may be important social and environmental determinants of birthweight that have yet to be identified."
9220563,"While many works compare traits of homeless adults across levels of alcohol use, few specifically consider whether drinking status affects determinants of either homelessness or ""vulnerability"" to homelessness. This paper relies on a 1986 Chicago, Illinois sample (n = 535) to consider the potential contributions of resources, social network characteristics, disaffiliation, and mental health problems. Results suggest that resource problems may determine homelessness regardless of drinking status. But drinking-associated problems may raise the resource threshold for ""vulnerability,"" reduce the protection afforded by social networks against both homelessness and ""vulnerability,"" increase the deleterious impact of disaffiliation, and spur complicating mental health problems."

10281815,"The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious."
7945681,"The authors raise questions regarding the wide-spread calls emanating from lay and medical audiences alike to intensify the formal teaching of ethics within the medical school curriculum. In particular, they challenge a prevailing belief within the culture of medicine that while it may be possible to teach information about ethics (e.g., skills in recognizing the presence of common ethical problems, skills in ethical reasoning, or improved understanding of the language and concepts of ethics), course material or even an entire curriculum can in no way decisively influence a student's personality or ensure ethical conduct. To this end, several issues are explored, including whether medical ethics is best framed as a body of knowledge and skills or as part of one's professional identity. The authors argue that most of the critical determinants of physician identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a more subtle, less officially recognized ""hidden curriculum."" The overall process of medical education is presented as a form of moral training of which formal instruction in ethics constitutes only one small piece. Finally, the authors maintain that any attempt to develop a comprehensive ethics curriculum must acknowledge the broader cultural milieu within which that curriculum must function. In conclusion, they offer recommendations on how an ethics curriculum might be more fruitfully structured to become a seamless part of the training process."
3068425,"Well school-age children (N = 73) who had experienced the death of a sibling within one year of data collection were interviewed. Their reactions were related to the deceased sibling's age, nature of death, time interval since death, sex of child, and socioeconomic status. Subjects were located through registries of five hospitals and five municipalities of Rizal Province, Philippines. In addition to the interview, children produced stories about nine projective test pictures. Results showed that school grades dropped significantly after the sibling's death. Children's responses reflected three stages: (1) shock, disbelief, denial (10%); (2) guilt, protest, sadness (50%); and (3) acceptance and recovery (40%). Chi-square tests showed that Stage 1 was significantly associated with a younger age of the deceased sibling, more recent death (less than or equal to 6 months), and lower social class. With regard to the projective story themes, children whose siblings died suddenly (compared to those whose deaths were anticipated) had significantly higher loneliness themes. Children whose deceased siblings were of school age also gave significantly more death themes than children whose deceased siblings were younger."
8180289,"The concerns of relatively powerless groups may not be adequately addressed by health-care decisions based on market forces and on considerations of the general population. Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal. Available data are limited in their ability to assess impacts on small groups of health-policy decisions made for the population as a whole. A mechanism for surveilling such effects needs to be established to protect the interests of such groups, particularly when they have restricted alternatives."

3992291,"The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed."
2641329,"Attributions of responsibility have been shown to be important determinants of illness behavior in adults. This study examines the salience of attributional judgements among adolescents with cancer. Patients and their parents were categorized according to their attributions of responsibility for the cause of and solution to the adolescent's health problems into one of four attributional models. Of the four possible models, only two were represented: the medical and compensatory. Only 37.5% of parent/child pairs were concordant for model choice. Patients whose attributions conformed to those of the compensatory model sought more information (F = 5.1, (P = .03), were satisfied with the information supplied (F = 3.5, P = .07), and expressed the belief that a greater percentage of prescribed medications needed to be taken if a cure was to result (F = 4.1, P = .05). Side effects were more often experienced by patients whose responsibility attributions exemplified the medical model (F = 5.09, P = .03). Model concordance did not relate to parent/child agreement on health-related beliefs, patient age, sex, or compliance measures (P greater than .05). No relationship was found between parent-child model concordance and patient's self-reported medication compliance. The present data do not support the notion that attributions of responsibility for cause and solution of cancer should be important targets of interventions designed to increase medication compliance among cancer patients."
6139036,"A community sample of older adults was investigated to test some of the current hypothesis about the etiology of depression in the elderly. Multiple regression analysis showed that cognitive disturbances (memory, concentration), previous depressive episodes, and somatic health problems accounted for most of the etiological variance. Other variables, like stressful life events, financial problems, social isolation, alcohol use, age, sex, and previous somatic illnesses are significant but their numerical values are very small. Etiological insignificant were the variables: physical activities, competency in daily living, and support by ones own children."
9618614,"OBJECTIVES: Marijuana use among high school seniors increased during most of the 1970s, decreased throughout the 1980s, and has been increasing again during the 1990s. Earlier analyses of the classes of 1976 through 1986 attributed the historic trends during that period to specific changes in views about marijuana. This study examined whether recent increases in marijuana use among seniors and among students in earlier grades reflect similar processes. METHODS: Multivariate regression analyses were conducted on data from large annual nationwide surveys of high school seniors from 1976 through 1996 (approximate n = 61,000) and 8th and 10th graders from 1991 through 1996 (n's = 87,911 and 82,475, respectively). RESULTS: Individual lifestyle factors (grades, truancy, religious commitment, evenings out for recreation) correlated substantially with marijuana use but did not explain the historic changes in marijuana use. Rather, decreases in perceived risk of harmfulness and in disapproval can account for the recent increases in all 3 grades and for earlier decreases among seniors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that perceived risks and disapproval are important determinants of marijuana use. Accordingly, prevention efforts should include realistic information about risks and consequences of marijuana use."

Two hundred and eighty one were analysed for socio-biological factors related to under five mortality. Females had a higher mortality. About 2/3 of the deaths were in infants, and 90% in first 3 years. Most of the deaths (94%) occurred in the village itself, 58.4% did not seek any medical care during the terminal illness, 80-90% did not receive even a single dose of BCG, DPT or O.P.V., and 36.7% died in the first attack of illness. Though 68% had at least one episode earlier, 31.0% had been admitted in hospitals for an earlier episode of illness. In 42.8% of deaths, the birth order was IV or above. Deaths in socially and economically disadvantaged cases constituted 77.6%. The triad of diarrhea, ARI and malnutrition claimed 56% deaths. In 93% of the deaths, the mothers were illiterate and 96.4% were house wives. There was a sibling death earlier in the family in 78.3%, and 60.1% deaths were of those living in poor housing conditions. About 50% had radio for communication, 85.8% had bicycle for conveyance, and in 66.9% the family had piped water supply. All these findings have been discussed in the study."
2514523,"Contribution rates to the German statutory health insurance differ considerably between different sickness funds. While insurance benefits are largely standardized, these differences are widely regarded as a problem for the state's social policy. The health insurance bodies often offer hasty interpretations to justify the differences of contribution rates. These interpretations, however, cannot be checked on the basis of data from the annual reports of the health insurance. In reality, there is a number of determinants of the contribution rate which lie as well inside as outside the sphere of influence of the health insurance bodies. In order to estimate the respective impact of single determinants it is important to differentiate the health expenditures by age and sex of all insured persons (both the contribution paying members and their co-insured dependents). A further disentanglement of health expenditures into prices, quantities and structural components allows to identify the reasons of increases in health costs. This is also a necessary precondition for creating and implementing suitable measures that are directed to control health costs. At the same time, the improved information system of the statutory health insurance would contribute to a better understanding of the performance of the health system in general."
8091151,"The objective of the study was to assess the role of smoking parents' education, socioeconomic status and knowledge of the child's health as determinants of the child's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home. A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out by mailing a parent-administered questionnaire (response rate 80.3%) to a random sample of children aged 1 to 6 years, in Espoo. The present analyses focused on the 1003 children at whom one or both parents or guardians were currently smokers. A total of 253 children (25.2%) of smoking parents were reported to be exposed to ETS at home at the time when the questionnaire was filled in, while 750 (74.8%) children were not. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for being exposed to ETS were assessed in the logistic regression. The risk of exposure to ETS was significantly higher when the parents had no professional education, compared to university or college education (OR 2.42, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.43-4.11), but socioeconomic status was not associated with exposure. The risk was higher with a single parent or guardian than in families with two parents (2.17, 1.36-3.44). The risk decreased significantly for atopic children (0.61, 0.38-0.98), indicating that knowledge of the child's illness affects the smoking behavior of the parents."
3874527,"Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values."
12265102,"The aim of this paper is to assess the relative importance of economic and quality of life (QOL) factors as determinants of inter-metropolitan migration in the United States. The study is based on the generalized systemic gravity model of Alonso and on data from a sample of 25 SMSAs over the period 1965-1970. ""The most striking feature of the empirical results is the apparent lack of importance of origin economic and QOL factors as determinants of outmigration.... On the other hand, the empirical results suggest both economic and QOL factors to be significant determinants of inmigration."""
9639205,"A survey of 658 Aboriginal men and women living in 11 reserve communities in Ontario, Canada, was utilized to collect data on patterns of condom use. Individuals who had sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months were included in the analysis (n=400). Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression were used to analyse condom use in the previous 12 months. Eight per cent always, 31% sometimes, and 61% never used condoms. Rates of condom use differed with the number of sex partners in the last year, age, gender, having a steady sex partner, and marital status. Multiple logistic regression revealed that people most likely to use condoms were under the age of 30, male, did not have a long-term steady sex partner, had more than one sex partner, worried about pregnancy, were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS, and were not embarrassed to obtain condoms. Condom users who were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and who knew someone with HIV/AIDS were more likely to always use condoms. The most common reason for not using a condom was 'I was with my steady sex partner'. These results have implications for STD prevention efforts and for future research of sexual and STD preventive behaviour among Aboriginal people."
6699384,"Data from an Australian survey of 1,050 elderly men and women were analyzed with regard to sex differences in life satisfaction and its determinants. Men and women had very similar levels of education, health, financial satisfaction, subjective social integration, and morale. Little difference between sexes was found in the causal process determining life satisfaction. There was little or no interaction between sex and the other variables examined."
3232579,"Self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans are examined in relation to sex role orientations of late adolescents. Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys."
9465373,"This study researched the effects of cognitive variables on recycling behavior, as well as effects of various media of influence on the cognition and behavior. According to Hirose (1994), the decision making process for recycling consists of two steps. The first leads to goal intention of an ecological lifestyle. The second is related to behavior intention of recycling in line with the goal intention. Mass media, such as newspaper and TV, are thought to influence beliefs about environmental problems, including three determinants of goal intention: perception of seriousness, responsibility, and effectiveness. Personal media, such as personal contacts with pro-environmental activists, are thought to influence evaluation of behavior, including three determinants of behavior intention: evaluation of feasibility, cost and benefits, and social norms. Local media, such as municipal announcement and circular, are hypothesized to have a mixed effect of the two. Path analysis indicated that goal intention affected recycling behavior through behavior intention. Effects of the three media of influence on the cognitive variables were also consistent with the hypothesis."
