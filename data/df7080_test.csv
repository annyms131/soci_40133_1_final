1123717,"This study investigated the contribution of an individual's qualification for discussion group leadership (LGD) and the method of leadership conferral, election versus appointment, upon his group's response to a medical emergency. Five-person, face-to-face groups with high LGD leaders responded more frequently and more rapidly to a confederate member's diabetic reaction than did groups with low LGD leaders. Low LGD leaders were frequently overthrown, while groups with high LGD leaders experienced continuity of leadership. Conferral process had no discernible effect on helping or overthrows. It was concluded that a victim is the more fortunate if his group's leader is assertive."
887331,"Ideas about infant capabilities and toilet training practice have changed in the United States following cultural trends and the advice of child care experts. Anthropologists have shown that a society's specific infant training practices are adaptive to survival and cultural values. The different expectations of infant behavior of the East African Digo produces a markedly different toilet training approach than the current maturational readiness method recommended in America. The Digo believe that infants can learn soon after birth and begin motor and toilet training in the first weeks of life. With a nurturant conditioning approach, night and day dryness is accomplished by 5 or 6 months. The success of early Digo training suggests that sociocultural factors are more important determinants of toilet training readiness than is currently thought."
3788206,"The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects."
462150,"The socio-economic aspects of lung cancer are briefly considered, first, with regard to the causes conditioning its occurrence and clinical progress. Tobacco smoking, occupational exposure and air pollution are (in decreasing order of importance) the main determinants of lung cancer occurrence, which differs as between social classes. Social class also appears to be related to clinical progress of the disease. The economic consequences of lung cancer may be tentatively estimated, for a country like Switzerland, at 40 million Swiss francs per year, a sum which can be greatly reduced if a sustained collective effort at prevention is implemented."
3729384,"This study evaluated methods for empirically identifying environmental determinants of aggressive and disruptive behavior in three developmentally delayed children. A variety of sessions conducted on an inpatient treatment unit were designed to stimulate contingencies maintaining aggression and disruption in the subjects' natural environments. The basic analog conditions included: instructional demands, contingent social disapproval, and structured play. In addition, variations of the three basic conditions were developed based on informal observation and parental reports of naturally occurring contingencies. Results showed considerable variability both between and within subjects. However, for each subject a specific analog condition was shown to produce relatively higher rates of aberrant behavior. Subsequently, behavioral treatments based on assessment results were successfully implemented with two of the subjects. Results are discussed in terms of the importance and practical limitations of conducting systematic assessment of aberrant repertoires in developmentally delayed clients."
29398,"Impressions of a congress-visiting-journey through the highly-industrialized far-east Japan are the background for description of specific Japanese Psychotherapeutic-technics f.i.: the Morita-therapy, Naikan-therapy and the Fasten-therapy. To the analytically trained Psychosomatic-specialist of western mentality those medical applications appear rather bewildering if not frightening. Their psychodynamic and their effectiveness become more understandable regarding the social-cultural conditions in modern Japan founded and grown on a tradition thousands of years old. Psychoanalysis can't prosper there. During the congress of the ICPM (International College of Psychosomatic Medicine) in Kyoto it became evident to the author by visits to clinics and above all by experience of typical Japanese travelling impressions, how much just psychotherapy and it's special drive-dynamical intentions are to a major degree depending on social-cultural development, the norms of value, the religion and the philosophy of a society.--Nippon is unique--strange and fascinating."
26265,"The psychology of motivation in adult education has been mostly confined to the assessment of superficial causes for attending courses and seminars. The findings were not integrated in a ced in a conclusive theory of motivation elaborated for instance by American and German psychologists. Besides that the verbalized ""motives"" to attend courses were hardly correlated with other psychological and social context variables. An investigation of the relationship between verbalized ""motives"" to attend courses, certain personality dimensions (Freiburg Personality Inventory) and some aspects of the ""life space"" (occupational and non-occupatoinal) revealed that the motivation to participate in adult education is embedded in the context of psychological and socio-demographic factors and that the motive structure depends on the relevance of life-long learning, for example, to keep or improve the occupational status or to meet people involved in creative activities."
3791024,"The present study documented later developmental outcome in a group of 29 failure-to-thrive (FTT) infants who received extended hospitalization in infancy as an intervention for their growth failure. All infants were seen at approximately 3 years of age and were given standardized assessments of intellectual and physical development. A standard interview documented demographic variables, health problems, placements subsequent to hospitalization and additional psychological and medical treatment. Infants were divided into three groups dependent on medical and treatment factors. Means and percentages of occurrence of outcome variables were compared through either one-way ANOVAS or single sample chi-square tests with post hoc analyses. Correlational analyses were used to understand the relationships between outcome and relevant demographic, medical, and treatment variables. In general, the infants manifest persistent intellectual delays at follow-up despite maintenance of weight gains achieved during early hospitalization. More than half the group suffered from chronic health problems. A large percentage of infants had been removed from parental custody at the time of follow-up. Several demographic, medical, and treatment factors bore moderate relationships to developmental outcome. Infants who achieved more optimal growth tended to be full-term at birth, later born and without a question of physical abuse in their social histories. Intellectual functioning was related only to parental and caretaker socioeconomic status. Infants placed in foster care were unlikely to return to their families of origin. The findings suggest the need for further investigation into the determinants and outcome of extended hospitalization as a treatment for FTT."
2784327,"A survey of all registered deaths which occurred during 1981-1983 in women of reproductive age was carried out in Menoufia Governorate, Egypt. Surviving family members were interviewed by trained social workers, and information was collected on symptoms of the disease that led to death. The completed questionnaires were reviewed by a panel of local physicians and a cause of death was assigned by the panel. Maternal mortality was a leading cause of death, second only to heart disease. There were 190 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths and 45 maternal deaths per 100,000 married women aged between 15 and 49 years. Most of the maternal deaths (63%) were due to direct obstetric causes of which haemorrhage was the main cause. Another 27% of the maternal deaths were due to indirect obstetric causes of which rheumatic heart disease was the main cause."
2723595,"Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services."
910022,"A case-control study of 82 urban Dominican women with a malnourished child and 82 women with a well-nourished child of the same age, sex, and neighborhood of residence revealed that the women of the control group had significantly lower parity and also had fewer living children. More women in the case group had used contraception at one time. Nevertheless, the prevalence of current contraceptive use was identical in the two groups. More women in the control group had undergone one or more spontaneous or induced abortions. Although the women in both groups were selected from the same neighborhoods, there is evidence to suggest that the the women in the control group may have had higher family incomes. The higher incomes could well account, at least in part, for the difference in parity between the two groups as well as for the difference in nutritional status in the preschool children of the mothers of these groups."
6382590,"This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females."
2773911,"This study investigates the association of wartime stress variables and coronary artery disease as determined by coronary angiography in Lebanon in 1986, a country with an ongoing civil war for over a decade. A total of 127 patients who underwent coronary angiography at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were individually matched on age and sex with visitor controls free from any evidence of clinical coronary artery disease. Arteriographic cases (greater than or equal to 70% maximal stenosis) were compared with two control groups: arteriographic controls (entirely normal coronaries) and visitor controls. Findings suggest that there is a relation between exposure to both acute and chronic war events and coronary artery disease in this patient population. The reporting of exposure to acute war events was significantly higher in cases compared with both visitor controls (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.17-4.90) and arteriographic controls (OR = 2.8, 95% Cl 0.93-8.47). Crossing the ""green-lines"" that separate two belligerent sides, considered as an attribute of war-related chronic stress, was more frequent in cases compared with visitor controls (OR = 3.25, 95% Cl 1.54-6.89) and arteriographic controls (OR = 5.38, 95% Cl 1.65-17.6). The relation observed between wartime stress and coronary artery disease could not be explained by possible overreporting of stressful events in patients with suspected coronary artery disease or by an increase in clinical awareness for the disease for those under continuous stress. Adjusting for the effect of the well-established coronary artery disease risk factors did not alter the above findings."
958801,"Two methods of assessing personal space in young children were examined in a group of 24 boys and 24 girls, aged 3 to 6 yr. When sex of peer figures and affect attributed to them were varied, 3-yr.-olds made distance-cue judgements based on affect but failed to use affect cues in structuring personal space. However, 4- to 6-yr.-olds readily perceived and used distance to communicate the affective quality of peer relations. On both measures, perception of distance cues increased with age. Only girls also used sex of figures as a social cue in depicting appropriate distances."
6358327,"Theories from research in health education and compliance (adherence) behavior are reviewed and examined for their applicability to studies of self-management of childhood asthma. Specific theories discussed include: (1) the health belief model, (2) models of health, illness, and sick-role behavior, (3) social learning theory, (4) models of physician-patient relationships, (5) self-regulation model, (6) communication theory, (7) attribution, control, and decision-making theory, (8) grounded theory, (9) ecologic theory, and (10) family and social systems theories. A scheme to guide development and testing of theories in children's health and illness behavior is presented. The key common elements in the examined theories on adherence behavior are integrated and organized into a paradigm for the family determinants of the self-management of chronic illness."
256827,"Male homosexuality has complex determinants: biological, psychological, social, cultural and situational factors may be relevant, either inhibiting hetereosexuality or leading towards homosexuality. Environmental factors seem paramount, particularly significant early relationships, usually within the family. Especially implicated are the personalities and interaction of the parents, recent interest being especially in the father's role. Also relevant is the family as a complex social system and the modes of communication within it, both verbal and non-verbal. Social research and sociopolitical pressures have helped to liberalize attitudes to homosexually 'deviant' behaviour but have not added significantly to its understanding. Many factors are involved in determining whether homosexual men seek therapy and reach a particular therapist. These factors relate to the patient's and therapist's personalities; to different therapeutic philosophies and therapeutic goals; and to the formal and informal referral networks in society."
993963,An examination of the relationship of conservatism to reports of sexual experiences and reasons for nonparticipation was conducted using 64 male and 50 female introductory psychology students. Conservatism was found to be inversely related to the frequency and variety of sexual behaviors. High conservative subjects gave the reason that it was morally wrong more often than any other reason for not engaging in coital activities and more intimate forms of petting. Results were in accord with previous research and were interpreted as supporting the notion that the fear of loss of control of one's impulses and hence the basis for conservative attitudes are determinants of sexual experiences.
10304496,The diverse factors associated with sexuality among adolescents and the specific issues related to contraception in this developmentally diverse group result in complexity in policy formation. The future of an adolescent may be determined solely on the basis of access to supportive physical and emotional services funded by public and private sector monies. The purpose of this paper is to briefly present contemporary and social policies regarding pregnant adolescent health care. Suggestions as to how these policies can be translated into public adolescent health models are provided. The strategies will be related to primary and secondary public policy interventions.
1152751,"Precise data on levels of prescribing of psychoactive and other drugs by general practitioners have recently become available in Australia (Rowe, 1973a, b; Bridges-Webb, 1972). However, there has been little or no research into possible determinants of prescribing behaviour, for example, age, social background, work load, the nature of the practice, education and colleague networks. Nor have the attitudes, expectations, values or information levels of general practitioners been studied. The overseas literature in this field is confusing and scanty. There would seem to be good reason to investigate these aspects in Australian practices. A pilot study carried out in Canberra in 1972 suggests that a short structured questionnaire administered in a face-to-face interview could provide the necessary data."
3266155,"This article extends previous research on the household composition of older unmarried women, using a statistical model that treats each of a woman's surviving children as a distinct potential provider of a shared household. Additional possibilities--living alone, living with other nuclear-family relatives, and living with others--are also recognized, providing a varied range of household-structure opportunities for older women. The approach allows us to identify individual child attributes associated with the propensity to coreside with the older unmarried mother. The results confirm earlier findings regarding the importance of income, age, and disability status as determinants of the household composition of older women. We find, however, that unmarried children, especially sons, are more likely to share a household with an elderly mother than are married children. Working reduces the likelihood that a married daughter will live with her older mother. Overall, the findings suggest that the attributes, more so than the sheer numbers, of living children influence the household structure of their mothers."
670952,"Reactions of infants and young children to a stranger in an unfamiliar laboratory setting were examined to determine (a) variability in responses at six, 12, 24, and 36 months; (b) consistency of six and 12 month infants' responses to specific stranger behaviors; and (c) possible determinants of responses to strangers. The reactions of 136 male and female infants and children to a female stranger were recorded both when the stranger was actively trying to interact with the child and when the stranger sat quietly nearby after giving him a toy to play with. Both positive and negative reactions were observed at all ages, with one-year-olds showing greater distress than other age groups. Consistency was found in infant reactions to intrusive stranger behaviors. It was suggested that stangers are more likely to elicit curious-affiliative than cautious-avoidance behaviors from chidren if they are both attentive and appropriately to the child on the basis of his communications."
3237851,"The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
604890,"The present study investigated the determinants of the affective and denotative semantic structures in the process of self-conception. Three-mode data of semantic differential ratings of 11 ego-related concepts on a representative set of scales were obtained from a homogeneous group of 29 male college sophomores. Results for the scale mode indicated that after Osgood's three affective components were recaptured, three other orthogonal dimensions were interpretable denotative features. The concept mode consisted of five distinctive factors representing the multidimensional nature of self concepts. Differences among four types of subjects in their interactions between meaning systems and concept factors were highlighted by the rotated core matrix. Characteristics of subject-type homogeneities were further identified by regressions of their factor coefficients on a set of variables representing personality development, social behaviors, and attitudes."
7190778,"The critical determinants of extended diurnal death feigning were assessed in a refinement experiment in which visual and tactile cues during rearing and/or testing were systematically eliminated. Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing. It was concluded that visual novelty of the environment is the minimal condition for sustained death feigning by young chicks in the daylight hours."
658557,"Criticizing the static assumptions of previous socioeconomic and microeconomic models of marital fertility, particularly regarding the sequential and stochastic facets of family building, this paper advocates a dynamic perspective. Of particular concern is the assumption of equilibrium family size made by those who employ the static perspective. The equilibrium family size assumption implies that the parameters relating social and economic variables to fertility will be similar for all births, regardless of order. To test this assumption of constancy, a two-equation model of fertility and female employment is introduced. Contrary to the static perspective's implication of constant effects, substantial parity differences in the estimates of parameters for both equations are reported, as are several differences between blacks and whites. On the basis of this evidence, I conclude that the static decision-making framework should be replaced by a dynamic approach to marital fertility."
12314072,"The factors affecting the modern decline in fertility in the Netherlands are explored using data from censuses from 1930 to 1971 and additional unpublished sources. Particular attention is paid to the influence of religion, socioeconomic status, and region. The author concludes that ""a theory formulated by Lesthaeghe and Wilson on the relation between modes of production and secularization and the pace of fertility decline in Western Europe offers--in combination with van Heek's views on the special position of Dutch Roman Catholicism--a starting point for an explanation of why the fertility decline of Roman Catholics, self-employed and agricultural labourers lagged behind."" (summary in FRE)"
215853,"The health belief model is tested in the context of the swine flu vaccination program for senior citizens. Analysis is based on 232 responses to a questionnaire mailed to a simple random sample of 500 senior citizens in Tompkins County, New York. Social and psychologic variables identified by the model as important in determining utilization of preventive health services are: perceived susceptibility and severity of disease, perceived efficacy and danger associated with the preventive action, and general health motivations. Differences of means between users and nonusers for these variables are computed and compared with the results of a more sophisticated analytic technique--logit analysis--for use with dichotomous dependent variables. Results reveal that the health belief model accounts for 34 per cent of the variance in use of the vaccine by senior citizens. Perceived susceptibility to the disease and amount of danger associated with receiving the swine flu immunization are found to be the most important determinants of utilization."
6148471,"A cohort of homosexual men at high risk of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was monitored to examine the relation between lifestyle, clinical conditions, T-lymphocyte subsets, and antibody to the AIDS-associated human retrovirus, human T-cell leukaemia virus III (HTLV-III). HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS."
3933036,"The hypothesis was examined that the interaction of ethanol with the conditions under which it is administered may determine whether either preference or aversion for the drug develops. In Experiment 1, eight groups of food-deprived rats received injections of ethanol (175-1,400 mg/kg) in one environment and were later offered a choice between that environment and a different one previously associated with saline injections. Another eight groups were treated identically, except that food was available in both the saline and ethanol-paired environments. The groups given the drug without food showed no preference or aversion at low doses (175-700 mg/kg), but showed aversion at higher doses (1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg). When food was available, there was an increased preference for the environment paired with the 500 mg/kg dose and reduced aversion at the 1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg doses. In Experiment 2, placing two rats together increased each rat's preference for the environment associated with the other animal. However, rats pretreated with 500 mg/kg ethanol before being placed together showed a reduced preference for the environment associated with the drug and the other animal. Controls never paired with another rat showed no preference or aversion at the same ethanol dose. Thus, ethanol may interact with conditions such as the presence of food or another animal to determine final effects that are unique to those conditions."
1206385,"To investigate the contrary position of perceptual incongruity and social interaction theories regarding birth order and reactions to novel persons within the first year of life, novel persons were presented to 96 first and later borns 8 and 12 months of age. Because firstborns, exposed to more positive social interaction within the family within the first year of life, were more positive towards strangers than were the later borns, the authors concluded that by the end of the first year of life the nature of the infant's social interaction within the family, rather than the number of perceptual encounters, is the major determinant of infants' reaction to novel persons in their enviornment."
820651,"This paper surveys the types of issues with which health economists have been concerned. It is intended to introduce noneconomists to the kinds of questions that economists have regarded as important. Economists' work in the health economics area may be usefully divided into ""positive"" and ""normative"" studies. Positive studies are those designed to describe, or make predictions about, how the health care system, or parts of it, actually operate. Conversely, normative studies are intended to provide statements as to how the health care system should operate. The major areas surveyed include the concept and estimation of the ""production function"" for health, the distinction between private and social costs, determinants of prices of medical inputs, and benefit-cost analysis."
17093748,"This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting."
915694,"The determinants of creative productivity were specified in the form of six hypotheses. Using a multivariate cross-sectional time-series design with several controls, the lives and works of 10 classical composers were analyzed into consecutive 5-year age periods. Two independent measures of productivity were operationalized (works and themes), with each measure subdivided into major and minor compositions according to a citation criterion. It was consistently found across both productivity measures that (a) quality of productivity is a probabilistic consequence of productive quantity and (b) total productivity, while affected by age and physical illness, is otherwise free of external influences (viz., social reinforcement, biographical stress, war intensity, and internal disturbances). Due to the more selective nature of the thematic productivity measure, the criterion of total themes alone was affected by competition and a time-wise bias. The article closes with a brief discussion of the broad substantive utility of the methodological design."
6039186,"Although excessive population has long been a dilemma in certain areas of the world, current rates of growth present a global threat to all nations. Arguments based on economics, world peace, individual freedom, humanism and the preservation of life's amenities all point to the urgent need for programs to control birth rates. This applies to the United States also, although we have the advantage of a relatively high cultural and economic level from which to attack the problem. Modern psychiatry is increasingly committed to the Community Mental Health concept, which in part implies greater involvement with the element of the population that is socially and economically at a disadvantage. Effective treatment cannot ignore the effects on the patient of intolerable reality situations, often produced by successive unwanted pregnancies. In addition, a positive approach to family planning by psychiatrists and social workers will provide the structure needed for truly preventive psychiatry; as our knowledge of the determinants of psychosis, delinquency and mental retardation expands, selective counseling can do much to prevent these family and social tragedies. Both as world citizens and as practitioners of a profession, psychiatrists cannot afford to delay pledging their resources to the solution of so compelling a problem."
943161,"A behavioral genetic system has been investigated in which the Y chromosome of DBA/1/Bg mice makes an incremental contribution to the adult aggression of B10D1F1 hybrid mice. Crosses with C57BL/10/Bg, C57BL/6/Bg, and DBA/2/Bg have identified a minimum of one incremental and one decremental (suppressor) genetic factor (in addition to the Y chromosome) which are autosomal and which affect the expression of adult intermale aggression in these strains."
7376236,"Survey data from women in pregnancy risk in Venezuela and Kenya are used to examine the determinants of contraceptive intention, use, and the intention/use consistency. The five ranking determinants of contraceptive use are: intention to contracept, social support, accessibility, conjugal communication, and desire for additional children. All five determinants have direct and additive effects on contraception, but their relative impacts vary significantly between the two cultures. Contraceptive intention and use are highly consistent, while level of consistency varies significantly between the two samples and within each by various combinations of ranking variables and by parity. Major research and policy implications of the results are reviewed."
1187297,"The present study examined the saliency of size, movement, and human content variables in visual selective attention. Ss named stimuli present in motion pictures of real world scenes or in animated cartoon controls during a 15-sec. exposure period. Regardless of the type of presentation that they saw, Ss tended to name large and/or moving stimuli more often than small and/or nonmoving stimuli. Also, small human stimuli were named more frequently than small nonhuman stimuli, while there were no differences between the frequencies with which large human and nonhuman stimuli were named. The order in which Ss named stimuli was not related to either the size, movement, or human content variables. Results are discussed in terms of the generalizability of the results of previous studies to conditions simulating the real world."
1159611,"This study investigated factors affecting compliance, to orders from a formal authority. The design created a two-level status hierarchy in which subjects occupied identical low-status positions and responded to demands from a simulated high-status leader. Four components of authority-normativity,coervice power, collective justification, and success-failure-were manipulated as independent variables. Another component, the endorsement accorded the leader, was included in the design as a measured variable. Results indicated that compliance increased significantly when coervice power was high (rather than low), when justification was collective (rather than partisan), and when demands were normative (rather than counternormative). Contary ti the theoretical expectation, endorsement did not affect compliance by low-status members. The findings show that the normative aspect of legitimacy serves as a compliance-gaining base even when stripped of enforcing sanctions and under-lying goals and that the distinction between normativity and endorsement is valid for research on social power."
3754503,"Following opportunity to copulate with a female housed in an adjacent compartment, male Japanese quail spent 64% of their time near a window that provided visual access to the female (Experiment 1). This social proximity behavior persisted for at least 2 weeks of continual exposure to the window despite lack of further physical access to the female (Experiment 2) and was evident at all daylight hours (Experiment 3). Female Japanese quail stimulated more proximity behavior in male conspecifics than did other male Japanese quail or birds of other species (Experiments 4 and 5). However, many characteristics of the female quail were not critical. The female quail did not have to be previous sexual partners, familiar, sexually experienced, or reproductively competent to stimulate proximity behavior in males (Experiments 4 and 5). Experiment 6 demonstrated that the social proximity behavior was primarily a response to the visual aspects of the females. The results are discussed in relation to mate-guarding and surveillance behavior, and implications of the data for sexual classical conditioning of male Japanese quail are noted."
7418140,"Correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were studied in 4756 white males and females ages 20-59 years examined during a population survey conducted by 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined. These empirical findings from a cross-sectional study replicated across diverse populations were used to derive speculative estimates of the potential for modification of population levels of HDL cholesterol, consistent with hygienic intervention and lifestyle changes. The results of the study were considered in the context of the literature on determinants of HDL cholesterol."
2521115,"This research examined elderly people's social network ties and their awareness of services available to them. For this sample of 1,224 persons aged 60 years or older, having nonkin advisers, membership in clubs, or contacts with other community agencies and availability of transportation, education, and moderate-size kin networks predicted service awareness. Lack of available kin, the presence of large kin networks, having kin confidants, and being old, poor, and female, or black inhibited service awareness."
1271234,"A discrimination theory of selective perception was used to predict that a given trait would be spontaneously salient in a person's self-concept to the exten that this trait was distinctive for the person within her or his social groups. Sixth-grade students' general and physical spontaneous self-concepts were elicited in their classroom settings. The distinctiveness within the classroom of each student's characteristics on each of a variety of dimensions was determined, and it was found that in a majority of cases the dimension was significantly more salient in the spontaneous self-concepts of those students whose characteristic on thedimension was more distinctive. Also reported are incidental findings which include a description of the contents of spontaneous self-comcepts as well as determinants of their length and of the spontaneous mention of one's sex as part of one's self-concept."
3989430,"The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats."
1172393,"Previous work on agonistic behaviour in Quelea has been concerned primarily with hormonal variables. In the present series of experiments, a number of behavioural correlates of aggression and dominance are examined in male and bisexual groups. These include the effects of group arousal level on rates of agonistic encounters, the relationship between an individual's habitual level of activity and its relative dominance, aggressiveness and position on the perch in a resting ""flock"". The temporal patterning of encounters is analysed and the reasons why encounters tend to clump in time determined. The relationship between dominance in encounters over individual-distance infringements and dominance in encounters over access to a restricted food source is investigated and the effects of this on loss of weight in males and females determined. The results are discussed in relation to Ward's (1965) finging that in the wild females suffer higher mortality than males during the dry season and in relation to the general determinants of aggression in Quelea."
955763,"Reported national rates of suicide remain fairly stable from year to year and considerable differences persist between countries. Reported rates of suicide also differ from actual rates according to the social influences and the legal procedure both in attributing suicide and also in how the death is recorded and coded. This paper compares the rates of suicide and non-fatal self-poisoning in Scotland, England and Wales, and Ireland, and also examines suicide rates in people born in Ireland but now resident in England and Wales. The rise in overdose admissions to hospital which is continuing in relative degrees in all communities of Great Britain and Ireland, except Northern Ireland, does not seem to be correlated with trends in fatal suicide behaviour. Further studies on all aspects of the subject are needed to clarify the social determinants involved and to identify ways in which further increases can be contained."
1056816,"The dental treatment pattern and its determinants were surveyed in 1973 by interviews with a sample comprising 1,632 persons drawn to cover the total Norwegian population aged 15 and above. In all, 58% of the interviewees stated having visited a dentist during the year prior to the interview. In contrast, 16% had not consulted a dentist for at least 5 years. Fifty-five percent of the sample reported having received fillings at the last dental visit and 15% reported having received some periodontal and/or preventive treatment. Regular (at least annual) treatment attendance was claimed by 52% of the sample. However, some respondents had seemingly embellished their treatment behavior, and a relatively valid estimate for the current proportion of regular treatment attenders was considered to be 40% of the adult population in Norway. Sex and geographic region were found to be the most influential predictors of the recent treatment pattern, whereas school dental treatment had a major influence in youth. Dental conditions including the wearing of dentures was the reason most often given for not seeing a dentist on a regular basis."
508073,"One hundred forty-eight long-term stroke survivors and 148 control persons matched for age and sex, from the Framingham Study cohort, were examined for residual functional disability. Prevalence rates for 9 specific types of functional deficit ranged from 15% for institutionalization, to 63% for decreased vocational function in the group of stroke survivors. The comparable rates in the control group were significantly lower. Cardiovascular comorbidity was greater in stroke survivors than in controls. Removal of its apparent effects on function decreased the magnitude, but not the overall pattern, of documented disability in both groups. The most severe disabilities, institutionalization, dependence in mobility, and dependence in self-care, were the least prevalent. The more frequently documented types of functional deficit were those in which psychosocial and environmental factors are significant determinants."
452223,"Forty-four childless men and 51 vasectomized parents were compared as to their childhood backgrounds, marital satisfaction, social/emotional adjustment, physical and emotional problems attributed to the vasectomy, and attitudes toward vasectomy as a means of birth control. The findings suggested that for young married men, firmly committed to childlessness and in agreement with their wives regarding the necessity of the operation, vasectomy appears to be as physically and psychologically safe as in married parents for at least a two-year period. There were differences in the childfree men and fathers in styles of adjustment, with the childfree reporting themselves to be more independent, mobile, and less tied to tradition; these differences were seen as being more related to choosing a childfree life style than to the choice of vasectomy as a contraceptive method."
6365517,"The article considers the answers given by different schools of thought to the fundamental questions about the degree of autonomy of medicine and the kind of articulation between medicine and society as a whole and in its ""parts."" The answers vary with the thinking in the different social sciences and the philosophic schools associated with them. The author divides his presentation in two broad chapters: The first covers schools of thought in the health field, and attempts to delineate the philosophical foundations underlying the principal current schools of thought in this field, without attempting a history of the philosophical schools or analyzing each of them in detail. Thus, two idealist currents are studied which have exerted great influence in the health field--neopositivism and neo-Kantianism--and marxism as the materialist school, which recognizes the primary of matter, nature, and objective reality, and views consciousness as a property of matter. The second chapter considers the theoretical contest now going on among the schools of thought discussed in the first chapter, which try to explain the relationship between medicine and the social structure; the effectiveness of medical action, and the social determinants of disease. Prior to the seventies, the author says, the dominant view of the autonomy of medicine, its effectiveness, the potential for social change of the medical institutions, and the benefits to health of economic development, was endorsed by the predominance of positivism among these schools of medical thought. The view that medicine was broadly autonomous and at the same level with other subsystems such as the economic, the political and the educational subsystems, assumed the possibility of changing society by an effort begun through any of these ""sectors."" The enormous growth of productive forces that took place in the developed capitalist countries during the fifties, and even more during the sixties, collided at the end of the latter decade with the existing social production relations, which checked the progress of the production forces and generated a series of challenges in civil society to the aims of economic development and the achievements of science in relation to the inequality of the distribution of wealth. In the health sector, this was a time of criticism of the positivist view and of pointing out the negative effects of medicalization, highlighting the ideological and self-perpetuating character of medical institutions, and proposals for the demedicalization of society.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
6814269,"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful."
2807934,"A national sample of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged was created by merging the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey and its counterpart, the National Health Interview Survey for the same year. A weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might be useful in calculating home- and community-based long-term care clients' risk of institutionalization. A model containing patient characteristics, nursing home bed supply, and a climate variable correctly classified 98.2 percent of cases residing in nursing homes or the community. Physical dependency, mental disorder and degenerative disease, lack of spouse, being white, poverty, old age, unoccupied nursing home beds, and climate all appear to be determinants of institutional residency among the aged."
2926632,"Examined whether intrapersonal comparisons and social comparisons operate in similar ways to determine ratings of happiness. Events were varied to create positively and negatively skewed distributions. The events in each distribution were ascribed to either a single person or a group of people; Ss rated how happy they would feel if they experienced specific events within the distribution. Ratings for both intrapersonal and social comparisons were fit well by Parducci's (1984) range-frequency theory. Individual events received higher ratings when presented within the positively skewed context. Overall happiness, as measured by both the mean of the happiness ratings as well as direct ratings, was highest for the negatively skewed distributions. The effects of skewing were more pronounced for intrapersonal comparisons, but ratings were more closely defined by the range of experimental stimuli for social comparisons."
