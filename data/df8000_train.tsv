12481209	0	a	OBJECTIVE: The Russian mortality crisis of the early 1990s attracted considerable attention, but information on possible covariates of mortality is lacking, and concerns have been raised about the validity of official mortality data. To help elucidate the determinants of mortality, we examined whether indirect demographic techniques could be used to study mortality in countries such as the Russian Federation, where mortality data are inadequate, using input data independent from official vital statistics. METHODS: A national sample of the population was interviewed (n = 1600, response rate = 67%). Participants who had ever been married (82% of the sample) were asked about the date of birth and vital status of their first spouse. Spousal mortality was then estimated indirectly for the 531 men and 710 women for whom valid data were available. FINDINGS: The estimated risk of death between the ages of 35-69 years was 57% for male spouses and 17% for female spouses. Corresponding figures derived from national data for 1990 were 52% and 25% for the Russian Federation, and 31% and 20% for the United Kingdom. According to spouses' reports, 38% of their husbands died from cardiovascular disease, 22% from cancer, and 14% from injuries and accidents. Mortality of male spouses was inversely related to the education level of their wives, and the age-adjusted hazard ratios for death from all causes, compared to primary education, were 0.77 for secondary education and 0.57 for university education (trend P = 0.03). Mortality was also inversely related to ownership of household items, but not to size of settlement, pride in Russia, membership in the Soviet Communist Party, nationality or self-assessed social status. CONCLUSIONS: Although the indirect estimates were imprecise (partly owing to the small population size of the study), and mortality in women was probably underestimated (owing to many factors, including poorer reporting by males and high male mortality), our results are nevertheless consistent with the mortality pattern observed in official mortality data. The indirect technique thus appears to be a useful tool to study the determinants of mortality in the Russian Federation and other populations, where reliable or sufficiently extensive data are not available.
21431819	0	a	This paper introduces a series of research projects designed to fulfill the societal role of environmental health studies by investigating (1) the dynamic and complex relationships between environmental conditions and (2) health in an urban setting. Research in this first category has revealed the existence of the combined influence of multiple physical environmental factors on health and its mechanisms. In the second category, there have been a number of studies of the integrated influence of social environmental factors on health employing an aggregate modeling of multiple determinants of health and studies of individual topics related to social determinants of health. These research projects have contributed to the formulation of specific remedies and the development of comprehensive health policies. Participatory approaches have been used to enhance capacity building opportunities and to ensure that research results reflect the actual conditions in urban societies. Healthy Cities projects and programs have been developed in close collaboration with this type of research. Urban societies have become interdependent and share the same issues globally. Further research into the relationships between health and the environment in the context of urbanization will expand the base of evidence applicable to the complex realities in modern societies.
19957596	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To understand emotional, behavioral problems and related determinants among rural stranded children and to provide evidence for further psychological support. METHODS: A total of 3944 caregivers of children in the rural areas and aged 4 to 7 years but without parents around, were randomly selected. Data were collected through Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (the edition for parents, SDQ). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of children with behavioral/emotional problems was 43.6% among those stranded children including 8.3% having experienced emotional symptoms, 9.5% reported to be displaying 'conduct' problems, 8.7% exhibited significant hyperactivity/inattention, 18.9% experienced peer relationship problems and 16.8% having prosocial behaviors. The prevalence of behavioral/emotional problems was significantly higher in boys than those in girls and in lower age groups. Significant differences were also found in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and prosocial behaviors (P<0.01). The result from logistic regression analysis showed that factors as education level and motivation of the caregivers as well as financial support from the parents were related to emotional/ behavioral problems among the stranded children. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems was high among children living the rural areas but without their parents around which should call for psychological intervention.
6501638	1	a	This study was concerned with the determinants of adults' beliefs in the economic socialization of children through the use of pocket money (allowances). Over 200 adults completed a questionnaire on their beliefs concerning, for instance, how much and how often children should be given pocket money, as well as such things as whether they should be encouraged to work for it, save it, etc. The independent variables included the subjects' age, sex, education, voting pattern, religion, occupation and whether or not they were parents. The results showed that whereas there were few age or sex differences, the socio-economic class of the adults, and the fact that they did or did not have children did discriminate between the responses of the subjects. Findings were discussed in terms of the literature of economic socialization.
7241029	1	a	Differences were analysed between growth patterns and determinants of physical growth in two groups of normal infants at 24 months. Longitudinal data routinely collected in a mother and child clinic were analysed. At 24 months, 26% of cohort infants were at or below the 10th percentile for length (= 'small' infants); 98 of these were compared with 83 'medium' infants (between the 50th and the 75th percentile, for example). Excessive downward deviation of length percentiles was seen in 80% of 'small' infants. In 20% their birthweight was on the 10th percentile or below; 50% had a mother less than 155 cm tall; maternal stature was closely linked with socioeconomic factors. Of mothers with less than nine years of schooling, 70% had 'small' infants. In 95% of both groups growth attainment at two years could be predicted from data at 12 months. The known factors influencing deviant physical growth overlap with those of mental and social development. Growth deviation by itself may identify infants open to multiple risks, especially if their mothers have a low educational level. Further narrowing of the target group for specialised intervention strategies should be attempted.
17903047	0	a	BACKGROUND: To assess the inequity in seeking needed outpatient services in Iran and to investigate its influential factors. METHOD: The data were taken from a nation-wide Iranian health survey conducted in 2003. This study is based on individuals aged 15 years and over who had mentioned their need to seek outpatient care within two weeks prior to the day of the interview. The outcome was seeking needed outpatient care. The independent variables included respondents' age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, index of household economic status, health insurance status and residential place (urban vs. rural). RESULTS: Sixty-nine point five percent of those in need sought outpatient care. The rich (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.64 - 3.43) and the health insured (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.25 - 2.08), the pensioners and the retired (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.22 - 4.20), the housewives (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.07 - 2.95) were more likely to seek outpatient care than other occupations. On the other hand, people living in remote rural areas (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 - 0.57) were less likely to seek their needed outpatient care than those living in main rural areas and urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: As in different parts of the world, differences in seeking needed healthcare still exist across different groups in Iran. Indeed, seeking outpatient care in Iran is related not only to health system functions--like health insurance and health facilities--but also on factors beyond the scope of health authorities such as economic status and occupation. This study can be instrumental for the recent five-year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan of Iran which identified the reduction of inequalities in social determinants of health [corrected]
17595548	0	a	Morgan, Zamora and Hindmarsh make a compelling case for a national strategy on chronic disease prevention and management. The truths raised in the lead paper are not particularly inconvenient, but they do raise a number of uncomfortable questions: (1) Why are physicians not taking a more responsible and active role to prevent and manage chronic diseases on behalf of their patients? (Physicians must recognize that it is their professional responsibility and their job to provide their patients with the appropriate level of care for chronic conditions.) (2) Why are non-physician healthcare providers not playing a larger role to prevent and manage chronic diseases? (3) Why is there a greater focus on managing chronic diseases than on preventing or delaying them from happening? (4) Have we forgotten the profound impact of the social determinants of health on illness, life expectancy and death?
12614539	0	a	The number of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) being utilized by North America health care consumers is growing at an astounding rate. There is a need by both health care providers and consumers to categorize CAM in order to make meaningful comparisons and informed decisions on their use. Four paradigms of health and illness are proposed that classify medicines according to the basic assumptions of health and disease associated with each medicine. CAMs classified in the body paradigm are those that work through biologic mechanisms, or in other words, target biologic factors as the primary determinants of health. The mind-body paradigm extends the body paradigm to include factors such as stress, psychologic coping styles, and social supports as primary determinants of health and disease. The body-energy paradigm assumes health and disease are functions of the flow and balances of life energies. The body-spirit paradigm assumes that one or more transcendental aspects or personalities existing outside the limitations of the material universe can influence health and disease. It is postulated that there is a hierarchical relation among the four paradigms, such that each paradigm essentially subsumes the assumptions of the previous ones, but adds additional assumptions that qualify the previous ones. Implications of this framework for clarifying many contemporary issues in health care are discussed.
18410815	0	a	OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to (1) determine whether level of social support and living situation predicted emergency department (ED) use among older adults and (2) identify correlates of ED visits according to whether the patient was admitted to the hospital. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a longitudinal, prospective study was conducted. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, subjects who lived alone were 60% more likely to visit the ED than those who lived solely with their spouse. Neither type nor level of social support as measured by the Duke Social Support Index predicted ED use. Indicators of poor physical health (prior hospitalization, poorer self-rated health, and functional disability) were predictors of ED visits that resulted in hospitalization; however, these were not significantly associated with outpatient ED visits. DISCUSSION: Older adults who live alone are more likely to visit the ED. Additional study is needed to understand the determinants of outpatient ED visits.
19560371	0	a	PURPOSE: In middle-income countries, interest in the study of inequalities in health has focused on aggregate types of health outcomes, like rates of mortality. This work moves beyond such measures to focus on disease-specific health outcomes with the use of national health survey data. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the national Health and Welfare Survey 2003, covering 52,030 adult aged 15 or older, were analyzed. The health outcomes were the 20 most commonly reported diseases. The age-sex adjusted concentration index (C *) of ill health was used as a measure of socioeconomic health inequality (values ranging from -1 to +1). A negative (or positive) concentration index shows that a disease was more concentrated among the less well off (or better off). Crude concentration indices (C) for four of the most common diseases were also decomposed to quantify determinants of inequalities. RESULTS: Several diseases, such as malaria (C * = -0.462), goiter (C * = -0.352), kidney stone (C * = -0.261), and tuberculosis (C * = -0.233), were strongly concentrated among those with lower incomes, whereas allergic conditions (C * = 0.174) and migraine (C * = 0.085) were disproportionately reported by the better off. Inequalities were found to be associated with older age, low education, and residence in the rural Northeast and rural North of Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: Pro-equity health policy in Thailand and other middle-income countries with health surveys can now be informed by national data combining epidemiological, socioeconomic and health statistics in ways not previously possible.
16846943	0	a	Married women in India are increasingly at risk of HIV, often due to their husbands' extramarital sexual behaviour. Topical microbicides may provide protection to women who are unable to negotiate condom use. During the formative phase of a study to develop measures related to microbicide acceptability, we conducted in-depth interviews with 14 'high-risk' and 16 'low-risk' married women and 15 husbands. Some participants had recently completed a 2-week microbicide safety trial. A sequence of in-depth interviews with each participant explored the context of microbicide acceptability, including perceptions of couple harmony, vulnerability to HIV, sexual power, and ability to control life events. Women's perceptions of control and sexual power influenced attitudes towards microbicide use. HIV risk was most commonly associated with partner infidelity and easily detected, according to both men and women, by a lack of marital harmony. Despite this, high-risk women denied perceiving HIV risk until confronted with specific evidence of a husband's positive HIV or STI diagnosis. This study provides an in-depth examination of HIV risk for Indian married women, identifying potential determinants of microbicide use, and providing guidance for the development of psychometric scales to measure couple harmony, HIV risk perception, and sexual power and control.
18083444	0	a	BACKGROUND: Low educational attainment is a marker of socioeconomic status that correlates strongly with higher death rates from many conditions. No previous studies have analyzed national data to measure the number of deaths associated with lower education among working-aged adults (25-64 years) by race or ethnicity. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined comprehensively the relationship of education to cause-specific and all-cause mortality in the three largest racial or ethnic groups in the United States using national data. METHODS: Age-standardized, race/ethnicity-specific death rates from all causes and the 15 leading causes were measured among men and women aged 25-64 years by level of education based on U.S. national mortality data in 2001. The total number of deaths that potentially could be avoided among people aged 25-64 years was estimated by applying the mortality rates among college graduates (within each 5-year category of age, gender, and race/ethnicity) to each of the less-educated subpopulations. All analyses were performed in 2007. RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of all deaths among men aged 25-64 years (white, black, and Hispanic), and 38% of all deaths in women would not have occurred in this age range if all segments of the population experienced the death rates of college graduates. Black men and women had the highest death rates from all causes combined and from many specific causes at nearly all levels of education, and the largest average life years lost before age 65 years. However, the total number of deaths associated with low education status was not confined to any single racial group. About 161,280 deaths in whites, 40,840 deaths in blacks, and 13,162 deaths in Hispanics in this age range were associated with educational disparity. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially avoidable factors associated with lower educational status account for almost half of all deaths among working-aged adults in the U.S.; these deaths are not confined to any single racial or ethnic group. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to social determinants of health.
7204635	1	a	"Patient noncompliance is a substantial obstacle to the achievement of therapeutic goals. This paper reviews a number of practical interventions with demonstrated efficacy in enhancing patient adherence, including (1) improving patients' levels of information concerning the specifics of their regimens, reinforcing essential points with review, discussion, and written instruction, and emphasizing the importance of the therapeutic plan, (2) taking clinically appropriate steps to reduce the cost, complexity, duration, and amount of behavioral change required by the regimen and increasing the regimen's convenience through ""tailoring"" and other approaches, (3) obtaining a compliance-oriented history of the patient's prior experiences and present health beliefs and, where necessary, employing strategies to modify those perceptions likely to inhibit compliance, (4) improving levels of patient satisfaction, particularly with the provider-patient relationship, (5) arranging for the continued monitoring of the patient's subsequent compliance to treatment, (6) increasing staff awareness of the magnitude and determinants of the noncompliance phenomenon and attempting to develop an ""active influence orientation"" in each member of the health care team, (7) using such techniques as patient-provider contracts to involve the patient in therapeutic decisions and in the setting of treatment objectives and creating incentives (through rewards and reinforcements) for achieving these objectives, (8) arranging for as much continuity of provider (and other staff) as possible, (9) establishing methods of supervising the patient, including involvement of the patient's social support network, and (10) involving fully the assistance of all available health care providers, assigning specific roles and responsibilities for activities directed at improving adherence to treatment."
17435436	0	a	There are important disparities in health outcomes between racial/ethnic minorities and majorities in all countries where minority health has been investigated. This holds true for the largest minority population of Europe, the Roma, although research data related to Roma are scarcer and more contested than for other minorities. We discuss major obstacles that hinder or prevent the collection of reliable data in Roma and other minorities. The definitions and classification systems on race/ethnicity vary widely, pointing to the social construction of both race and ethnicity. Imprecision in taxonomy and definition of target groups is compounded by challenges in data collection, analysis, and interpretation, along with ethnocentricity that shapes the perspectives and approaches of the researchers. However, administrative data collection on race/ethnicity serves legitimate purposes although such data must comply with less-stringent quality requirements as opposed to data meant for scientific analysis. Research on minorities should consider race/ethnicity as proxy indicators of complex health determinants, and should aim at dissecting these determinants into separate items. Careful documentation of methodology and active involvement of the minorities themselves can increase trust between the investigators and the research subjects, which can in turn improve research on minority health.
2858150	1	a	"The validity of a questionnaire developed to assess negative attitudes towards drug therapy by relatives of schizophrenic patients is examined. The questionnaire items are tested against the statement: ""Patients should not take drugs, they can only be helped by good advice"". The prejudice of relatives of schizophrenics against drug therapy may have an effect on the patients' compliance to maintenance therapy and, subsequently, on their relapse rate. A number of factors, social and psychological, were examined as possible determinants of the negative attitudes of relatives. These factors include age, sex, profession, education, positive family history, and use of drugs among the relatives; mental state, residence, duration of illness, relapse rate and clinical features in the patients. Poor education of relatives correlated to negative attitudes towards drug therapy."
6814269	1	a	"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful."
11759165	0	a	"This paper considers actual German trends of impact factors contributing to hygienic risks in domestic settings: Have there been or are there still alterations which may be relevant and which should have consequences for hygiene behavior? How is hygiene consciousness organized in the German society? Each of the alterations of hygiene determinants described below may appear to be marginal when looked at separately, thus disregarding any relationship to hygiene. However, as a whole to anticipate the conclusion they have clearly altered the hygiene risks in the household; some risks have decreased but others have grown worse. The author intends to initiate an objective discussion on home hygiene in Germany. The intention is not creating a sterile environment in the home but to realize the ""hot spots"" of hygiene in modern domestic settings in order to develop a targeted hygiene."
3120234	1	a	This study was undertaken to determine the reliability of self-reported sexual behavior using the test and retest technique when used with self-reported sexual behavior. The subjects were 116 asymptomatic homosexual men who participated in another study (an examination of behavioral and demographic determinants of HIV antibody status). The subjects were asked to complete two questionnaires. The first contained demographic and sexual behavior questions. The second, administered an average of 6 weeks later, used a subset of the questions in the first questionnaire. The reliability of the test-retest procedure was measured by the Kappa statistic, which assesses the proportion of agreement between two data items, accounting for the amount of agreement expected by chance. The highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa was found with demographic information, smoking history, and sexual orientation. Self-reported sexual behaviors for the previous 6 months generally had the next highest degree of reliability as measured by Kappa. Questions examining change over the previous 5 years had the lowest reliability. Behavior changes during the time between questionnaires, subjectivity of the answer categories, and social desirability of the answers are three factors that may result in a lack of reliability in this self-reported sexual behavior questionnaire. This raises methodological concerns about the measurement of behavioral risk factors for AIDS and the ability to assess meaningfully subjective reports of behavioral change.
12339589	1	a	"""This article surveys significant changes in fertility and nuptiality in Central and Western Europe since the middle of the 19th century.

10899475	0	a	PURPOSE: To identify risk and protective factors for initiation of sexual intercourse before age 16 years at the level of the individual, family, and school. METHODS: A longitudinal study based on a cohort of 1020 people born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972/73 and followed up to age 21 years. Demographic characteristics of the sample were similar to the New Zealand population of that age, except that a smaller proportion (3%) were Maori or Pacific Island Polynesian. Information on individual, family and school factors was collected by interview with parents at ages 3, 5, 7 and 9 years and then by postal questionnaire two-yearly up to 15 years. Subjects were assessed two-yearly from age 3 years and interviewed about their behaviours and ambitions at ages 11, 13, and 15 years. Questions about age at first intercourse were asked by computer at age 21 years. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model associations with age of first intercourse less than 16 years. RESULTS: Data on age at first intercourse were available for 926/1020 (91%) of surviving members of the cohort assembled at age 3 years. Overall 27.5% of males and 31.7% of females reported sexual intercourse before age 16 years. In multivariate analyses the independent predictors for early sexual initiation for males were: not having outside home interests at age 13 years, no religious activity at age 11 years, not being attached to school at age 15 years, a low reading score, and a diagnosis of conduct disorder in early adolescence. For females, independent predictors were: socioeconomic status in the middle range, mother having her first child before age 20 years, IQ in the middle range, not being attached to school, being in trouble at school, planning to leave school early, cigarette smoking and higher self-esteem score. CONCLUSIONS: Individual and school factors appear to be more important than family composition or socioeconomic status in the decision to have sexual intercourse before age 16 years. The lowering of age at first intercourse may be partly a cohort effect related to high rates of teenage childbearing in the mothers' generation, and to changes in social acceptability of early sexual behaviour.
6391257	1	a	Data from 1002 households indicated that contextual factors (group size, subsequent activity) and individual difference factors (sex, extroversion, drinking frequency) differentially influenced consumption and normative ratings. These findings suggest that contextual cues serve as determinants of drinking norms and that drinking behavior reflects individual variation in sensitivity to these cues.
6520880	1	a	This study tests two theories regarding the attitude and behavioral determinants of women's coital and masturbatory orgasmic responsiveness. Data from 115 sexually active women were analyzed using latent-variable structural equation models. Twenty-one variables are used to represent seven latent constructs: Parent Sexual Attitudes, Sexual Latency, Sexual Behavior, Dating Competence, Social Assertiveness, Subjective Masturbatory Responsiveness, and Subjective Coital Responsiveness. Two specific theories are tested with these constructs. Each theory predicts a different structural arrangement among these latent factors with the fundamental difference being whether behavior predicts responsiveness or vice-versa. Two alternate models were found to reflect the data adequately. In both instances, attitudes predicted behavior and, in general, orgasmic responsiveness tended to be a function of behavior.
6542479	1	a	Reproductive and agonistic behaviors in Siamese fighting fish were investigated in eight experiments, and some consequences and determinants of these sequences were isolated. First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior.
17347035	0	a	BACKGROUND: In complying with required life style changes Heart Failure (HF) patients often depend on their partners. However providing care may cause burden and affect the health of these partners. The aim of this study was to investigate determinants of caregiver burden in order to identify caregivers who are at risk. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, caregiver burden and potential determinants were measured in partners of HF patients. Demographic and clinical data were assessed in HF patients, partners completed questionnaires on caregiver burden (the Caregiver Reaction Assessment, CRA), caregiving tasks performed, physical and mental health status and quality of the marital relationship. RESULTS: In total 357 partners (75% female, mean age 67 years) participated. The physical health status of HF patients was only significantly associated with two domains of caregiver burden, 'disruption of daily schedule' (p<0.01) and 'loss of physical strength' (p<0.01). No associations were found with age, co-morbidity and LVEF. All domains of the CRA were mainly associated with the partner's own mental health (p<0.01) and with providing personal care to HF patients (p<0.01). Gender differences were only found with regard to the domain of 'feeling a lack of family support'. CONCLUSION: The assessment of caregiver burden should focus on the mental strength of partners. Furthermore when assistance in personal care is needed, additional support, either informal or professional, may be indicated.
18787497	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To examine patient-perceived communication styles (empathic and dominant communication styles) of Korean physicians in rehabilitation and their effects on patient outcomes (patient satisfaction and compliance). DESIGN: A total of 150 rehabilitation patients from a large university hospital in Korea were interviewed with a 26 item-questionnaire. RESULTS: Only 30% of the patients considered their physicians as highly affective whereas about 55% of them viewed their doctors as highly dominant. Physicians' affective and cognitive empathic communication styles were significantly and positively correlated with both patient satisfaction and compliance. Correlation analysis showed that physicians' dominant communication style was significantly but negatively related to patient satisfaction. However, compliance, cross-tabulation, and regression analyses suggested that physicians' dominant communication style may not be a good predictor of patient satisfaction and compliance. Those patients who perceived their physicians as highly affective or highly cognitive showed the highest rates of being completely satisfied, whereas none of those patients who ranked their physicians as least affective or least cognitive said that they were completely satisfied. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the existing findings in the West that physician's communication styles were major determinants of the patient outcomes. Patients' highly negative view of their physicians' dominant communication style might raise some concerns about Korean physicians' authoritarian attitudes toward their patients.
7372385	1	a	This paper focuses on the position of the nurse in the division of labor in health care and the occupational strategies British hospital nurses have adopted in response to their changing employement situation. The authors suggest a Marxist framework as an alternative to current approaches to the study of occupational strategy, which tend to focus on the level of distribution relations. An adequate analysis of the situation of hospital nurses, the paper suggests, depends upon locating the occupation within the wider setting of the mode of control and delivery of health care. The central feature of this setting is the dominance of medicine and medical technology, and the main factors shaping it are the activities of individual capitalists involved in the health industry and the State operating within the constraints of capital in general and within the context of class struggle. It is suggested that the characteristic feature of nurses' occupational strategy--the vacillation between professionalism and unionism--can best be understood in relation to the changing mode of control and delivery of health care and nurses' contradictory position within the social relations that constitute that mode.
15885866	0	a	Time preferences for health has a role in informing discounting practice in economic evaluation of health care interventions. Yet virtually no empirical evidence on time preferences for health are available for sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this paper are therefore to estimate time preferences for health in Tanzania, and to explore the relationship between time preferences for one's own private health and for others health. Determinants of time preference rates are also explored. A sample of the general population participated, and each person was asked to indicate the maximum duration of more distant ill-health they would be willing to accept in return for a specified delay in the onset of the condition. People were randomised to answer either questions in the context of their own health or in the context of others health. Estimations were done using clustered least squares regression with robust standard errors. The implied mean and median discount rates were 0.07 and 0.058, respectively. Time preferences for one's own and others' health--conceptualised as social health--seem to be roughly the same in this sample, but people seem to discount the most severe health condition at a significantly lower rate than the least severe condition.
12062922	0	a	PURPOSE: Studies worldwide show that self-rated health (SRH) is a robust predictor of mortality among the elderly. Only few studies have focussed on a middle-aged population and no such study has been reported from Germany. This study examined the association between SRH and mortality in a middle-aged, population based cohort from Germany, using data from the MONICA (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases) Augsburg project. METHODS: The cohort comprises 1521 men and 1498 women aged 35-64; they were followed over 11 years from 1984-1995. Participants provided extensive data on medical conditions and cardiovascular risk factors through interviews and examinations. SRH was assessed globally and in comparison to those of the same age. We estimated relative hazards for mortality from all-causes and cardiovascular disease according to self-ratings of health. RESULTS: Among males the adjusted hazards rate ratio (HRR) of mortality from all-causes was 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.2) for combined fair/poor perceived health compared with good/excellent health. Women with fair/poor ratings had no increased risk of dying (HRR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.9). Men who perceived worse health than persons of the same age showed an adjusted HRR of 1.7 (95% CI 1.0-2.9) as compared to those perceiving better health; in women the adjusted HRR was 1.9 (95% CI 1.0-3.7). The adjusted hazards for dying from cardiovascular diseases in men were 1.3 (95% CI 0.8-2.1) for those perceiving fair/poor and 1.7 (95% CI 0.7-3.7) for those perceiving worse health. CONCLUSIONS: Self-rated health was a predictor of mortality in a middle-aged German population and contains information that is not entirely reflected in underlying medical conditions and risk factors. Self-assessments of health in comparison to individuals of the same age were stronger and more consistently associated with mortality. Global self-ratings of health and self-ratings in comparison to those of the same age may measure slightly different dimensions and the effect of self-rated health may differ among men and women.
17448554	0	a	This paper uses the British Health and Lifestyle Survey (1984-1985) data and the longitudinal follow-up of May 2003 to investigate the determinants of premature mortality in Great Britain and the contribution of lifestyle choices to socio-economic inequality in mortality. A behavioural model, which relates premature mortality to a set of observable and unobservable factors, is considered. A maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) approach for a multivariate probit (MVP) is used to estimate a recursive system of equations for mortality, morbidity and lifestyles. Health inequality is explored using the Gini coefficient and a decomposition technique. The decomposition analysis for predicted mortality shows that, after allowing for endogeneity, lifestyles contribute strongly to inequality in mortality, reducing the direct role of socio-economic status. This contradicts the view, which is widely held in epidemiology, that lifestyles make a relatively minor contribution to observed socio-economic gradients in health.
7397056	1	a	A Paracetamol elimination was measured, using serial saliva samples, in 114 London factory and office workers, 76 Whites and 38 Asian immigrants. 2. Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man.
7371381	1	a	The intent of this paper is to present a representative, though not exhaustive, overview of the current literature on social networks, with an emphasis on research linking social networks to psychological adaptation. This overview includes a review of social network concepts; and analysis of the multiple determinants of social networks; an analysis of the varied effects of social networks; and the implications for policies and practices of community mental health centers. This paper adopts the view that the concept of social network is a useful tool in examining both the functional and the dysfunctional influences of one's primary group on individual adaption.
7326949	1	a	Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points.
2724173	1	a	A nonrandom socioeconomically homogeneous convenience sample of 150 young adolescent mothers, 260 older adolescent mothers, and 242 older mothers was analyzed according to their standing on key determinants of parenting. The results of a discriminant analysis showed that the young teen mothers differed from the older mothers in terms of knowledge of child development, punitive attitudes toward childrearing, and level of depression. Accuracy of classification was improved with the discriminant function for younger and older mothers, but decreased by 20% for older adolescents.
12162837	0	a	"This piece presents evidence that inequities in information are an important determinant of health inequities and that eliminating these inequities in access to information, especially by using new information and communication technologies (ICTs), could represent a significant advance in terms of guaranteeing the right to health for all. The piece reviews the most important international scientific research findings on the determinants of the health of populations, emphasizing the role of socioeconomic inequities and of deteriorating social capital as factors that worsen health conditions. It is noteworthy that Latin America has both socioeconomic inequities and major sectors of the population living in poverty. Among the fundamental strategies for overcoming the inequalities and the poverty are greater participation by the poor in civic life and the strengthening of social capital. The contribution that the new ICTs could make to these strategies is analyzed, and the Virtual Health Library (VHL) is discussed. Coordinated by the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME), the VHL is a contribution by the Pan American Health Organization that takes advantage of the potential of ICTs to democratize information and knowledge and consequently promote equity in health. The ""digital gap"" is discussed as something that can produce inequity itself and also increase other inequities, including ones in health. Prospects are discussed for overcoming this gap, emphasizing the role that governments and international organizations should play in order to expand access to the global public good that information for social development is."
6597061	1	a	The aim of the present study was to suggest a causal model of dental caries and to discuss some quantitative interpretations of this model. Three age groups of children (4, 8 and 13 yr) from three different areas in Sweden were included. The caries status of the children was examined. A 7-day record (4-and 8-yr-olds) and a dietary history (13-yr-olds) were used to estimate food intake. Sociodemographic data and data of caries preventive measures were obtained from parents/children. A causal model of dental caries is suggested and some quantitative interpretations are made by means of path analyses. Hypothetical examples of results of changes in caries determinants are given.
7275378	1	a	Principal components analysis was used to delineate motivational patterns associated with illicit drug use in a population of U.S. Navy enlisted men (n = 867) undergoing drug rehabilitation. Patients indicated which of 31 reasons for drug use were associated with various drugs. Four components emerged from this analysis, labeled Insight-Seeking, Therapeutic Needs, Sentience, and Pleasure-Seeking. Higher order factor analysis revealed the presence of a general factor, labeled General Sensation-Seeking. Multiple regression procedures were used to relate the derived dimensions to actual drug use behavior. The significant relationships observed among the factor analytic patterns in predicting overall drug involvement were shown to lead to increased explanation concerning interrelationships among personality needs and social resources. The findings suggested a number of hypotheses pertaining to increased understanding of motivational patterns underlying initiation and continuation of illicit drug use.
17348755	0	a	Health inequalities are no longer an issue only for developed countries. In recent years there is agreement that all countries present health inequalities regardless of their level of wealth. In low-income countries and especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the majority of the poor people live as well as their children, research on child health inequalities is still scarce. This review of evidence suggests that if Mozambique is to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) by 2015 further research on important determinants of disparities in child mortality is urgently needed.
19841546	0	a	AIM: To assess the impact of socio-demographic and clinical variables on the oral hygiene and periodontal status in a sample of mentally disabled subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample comprised of 171 mentally disabled subjects attending a special school in Udaipur, India. Oral hygiene status was assessed by Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) and periodontal status by Community Periodontal Index. RESULTS: Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that the best predictors in the descending order for oral hygiene index were disabled sibling, medical diagnosis, IQ level, education of mother and father. Having Down syndrome, less educated parents, poor economic status and a disabled sibling were the most important predictors for poor periodontal status. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlighted that the oral hygiene and periodontal status of the present study population is poor and was influenced by medical diagnosis, IQ level, disabled sibling, parent's level of education and economic status.
18266845	0	a	AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of self-efficacy on depression and to consider the mediating effect of self-care behaviour. BACKGROUND: Depression is a problem for kidney transplant recipients and can compromise their quality of life. From other studies on chronic illnesses, self-efficacy and self-care behaviour have been considered to be potential determinants for depressive symptoms. However, none of these previous studies have investigated the relationships among these variables in kidney transplantation recipients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey employing correlation design and purposive sampling was used. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven persons who had received a kidney transplant participated. A self-administrated questionnaire and a medical record audit were used to collect data. The data were analysed using correlation and hierarchical linear regression methods. RESULTS: The average score of depressive symptoms was 8.61 SD 7.64. Among the participants in the study, 32.8% had scores of depressive symptoms higher than 11 (indicating mild to severe symptoms of depression). Self-efficacy and self-care behaviour had direct negative effects on depressive symptoms. Self-care behaviour had partial mediating effect on the relationship between self-efficacy and depression. Total variance explained was 23%. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are still a problem that need to be addressed among kidney transplantation patients. Patients who have higher self-efficacy and higher self-care behaviour will have lower depressive symptoms. Our results support that self-efficacy is the significant predictor of depressive symptoms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Self-efficacy is a powerful and modifiable determinant of depressive symptoms. We should design interventions that focus not only on the skill aspects of self-care behaviour but also on those that have a strong connection with self-efficacy. We could incorporate the self-efficacy-enhanced strategies as proposed by social cognitive theory into the kidney transplantation care programme.
3434387	1	a	"Previous studies reveal that career guidance is usually based on a mixture of meritocratic criteria (academic ability and achievement) and nonmeritocratic considerations (students' SES and their social labeling by counselors). The present study argues that school counselors in affluent neighborhoods emphasize the meritocratic criteria, while those in poorer neighborhoods tend to focus on the more nonmeritocratic. This hypothesis is examined in a random sample of 210 male, primary school graduates from the 10 state schools of an Israeli town, 125 of whom are from schools in affluent neighborhoods, and 85 from schools in poorer neighborhoods. A path analysis of determinants of guidance to specific high school tracks shows that students' ethnicity and labeling as problematic directly affect guidance by counselors only in the poor neighborhoods. The effect of students' ""problems"" is due to their being labeled as problematic with respect to psychological or physical attributes rather than to behavioral problems at school. The findings are subsequently interpreted as reflecting a patronizing attitude toward lower status students by counselors. Additional studies which may further elaborate the determinants of guidance in poor versus affluent neighborhoods are proposed."
3686078	1	a	Lifestyles of groups and individuals are significant determinants of the health status of a population. Behaviour with respect to such areas as alcohol, food, drugs, tobacco, physical exercise, etc., correlates with medical and social well-being and are thus on the agenda for modern health care. The present article reports a study of how such lifestyle habits, notably alcohol and tobacco consumption, are addressed in medical consultations. The results indicate that the areas of smoking and drinking are sensitive and that specific communicative strategies are used for introducing these topics and for eliciting information. Smoking habits are addressed in 75% of the consultations and alcohol habits in 30%. In most cases, the information exchanged is shallow and gives only a fragmentary picture of patients' habits. There is little evidence of attempts to influence patients' attitudes and behaviours and the physicians do not contextualise possible relationships between such lifestyle habits and health in the light of their medical knowledge. In this sense, a potentially very influential face-to-face encounter is not used as a vehicle for attempting to eliminate such significant causes of poor health.
7282978	1	a	The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology.
19204797	0	a	BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) conducted the World Health Survey (WHS) between 2002 and 2004 in 70 countries to provide cross-population comparable data on health, health-related outcomes and risk factors. The aim of this study was to apply Grade of Membership (GoM) modelling as a means to condense extensive health information from the WHS into a set of easily understandable health profiles and to assign the degree to which an individual belongs to each profile. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper described the application of the GoM models to summarize population health status using World Health Survey data. Grade of Membership analysis is a flexible, non-parametric, multivariate method, used to calculate health profiles from WHS self-reported health state and health conditions. The WHS dataset was divided into four country economic categories based on the World Bank economic groupings (high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low income economies) for separate GoM analysis. Three main health profiles were produced for each of the four areas: I. Robust; II. Intermediate; III. Frail; moreover population health, wealth and inequalities are defined for countries in each economic area as a means to put the health results into perspective. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses have provided a robust method to better understand health profiles and the components which can help to identify healthy and non-healthy individuals. The obtained profiles have described concrete levels of health and have clearly delineated characteristics of healthy and non-healthy respondents. The GoM results provided both a useable way of summarising complex individual health information and a selection of intermediate determinants which can be targeted for interventions to improve health. As populations' age, and with limited budgets for additional costs for health care and social services, applying the GoM methods may assist with identifying higher risk profiles for decision-making and resource allocations.
11923901	0	a	The purpose of this paper is to present a comparative analysis of the determinants of physical activity among adolescents in Taiwan and in the United States. Pender's Health Promotion Model (HPM) served as the theoretical framework for both studies (Pender, 1996). The major determinants of health behavior in the HPM are perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, activity-related affect, interpersonal influences, situational influences, commitment to a plan of action, and immediate competing demands. In Taiwan, 969 middle school students (55% males; 45% females) from Taipei provided data for the study. In the United States, the sample was collected from 286 late elementary and middle school students (48% males; 52% females). Results showed the gender differences in activity levels were apparent in the youths from both countries. In both Taiwanese and American youths, boys were more active than girls. Cross-cultural differences in the importance of barriers to physical activity emerged. Among Taiwanese adolescents, barriers did not emerge as a significant direct predictor of physical activity as they did among US adolescents. Perceived efficacy directly predicted physical activity among Taiwanese youths while it indirectly predicted physical activity and appeared to be mediated by beliefs regarding exercise benefits and barriers among American youths. In addition, the paths of effect for interpersonal influences were different when Taiwanese and US youths were compared. The findings from this paper have important and culturally-relevant information that can inform future physical activity intervention studies with diverse adolescents.
17062544	0	a	A variety of cognitive and behavioral self-management skills have been posited as protective in terms of adolescent substance use. This study examined whether these skills measured in the 7th grade served a protective function in 9th grade substance use across ethnically diverse samples of adolescents. Participants consisted of Black (n = 461) and Hispanic (n = 320) urban youth and White suburban youth (n = 757). Structural equation modeling indicated that a second order Self-Management Skills latent factor consisting of first order latent factors of Decision-Making, Self-Regulation, and Self-Reinforcement skills was protective for adolescent substance use across racial/ethnic subgroups. However, Self-Management Skills were more strongly protective for suburban White youth and less protective for urban minority youth. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that predictive power of risk and protective factors derived from psychosocial theories varies widely across racial/ethnic subgroups of youth and is weaker among racial/ethnic minority youth compared to White youth. An important next step is to broaden the focus of etiology research from individual-level determinants to studying adolescent substance use behavior in the context of the cultural background and primary social settings of young people, such as family, school, and community environments.
2768294	1	a	A life table analysis is made of the duration of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea in Orissa, India, taking one variable at a time using data from a baseline survey of fertility and mortality (BSFM) conducted on the lines of the World Fertility Survey. Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age. The durations of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea are strongly related.
2807934	1	a	A national sample of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged was created by merging the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey and its counterpart, the National Health Interview Survey for the same year. A weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might be useful in calculating home- and community-based long-term care clients' risk of institutionalization. A model containing patient characteristics, nursing home bed supply, and a climate variable correctly classified 98.2 percent of cases residing in nursing homes or the community. Physical dependency, mental disorder and degenerative disease, lack of spouse, being white, poverty, old age, unoccupied nursing home beds, and climate all appear to be determinants of institutional residency among the aged.
19742279	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial symptoms are common in patients with heart failure. Little research, however, has been done to determine which psychosocial factors influence primary care patients' consultation frequency in the case of heart failure. METHODS: We recruited 310 primary care patients with heart failure by analysing electronic patient records. At baseline, psychological distress (anxiety and depression; HADS), disease coping (FKV), negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS-14), disease-specific quality of life (MLHFQ) and social support (F-SozU) were measured by validated questionnaires. Severity of heart failure (according to NYHA-classification and Goldman's Specific Activity Scale) and sociodemographic characteristics were documented by self-report instruments. Nine month later, patients were contacted by telephone in order to assess GP consultation frequency. Logistic regression was done to determine whether these psychological, medical and sociodemographic factors were associated with primary care utilisation. RESULTS: On average, patients consulted their general practitioner (GP) 8.2 times during nine months. Female subjects and patients with higher levels of perceived heart failure severity, physical problems and anxiety or depression as well as those living alone visited their GP significantly more often. In multivariate analysis, frequent attendance in general practices was predicted by physical problems and living alone. These factors explained 11.6% of the variance of frequent attendance in general practices. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors of help-seeking behaviour in heart failure patients focus on mental and physical discomfort and a lonely home situation. These factors might need to be compensated by GP consultation. GPs should address the rearrangement of physical, mental, and social resources to strengthen self-reliance of patients with heart failure.
6542479	1	a	Reproductive and agonistic behaviors in Siamese fighting fish were investigated in eight experiments, and some consequences and determinants of these sequences were isolated. First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior.
20044965	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Societies that foster socially supportive networks produce healthier populations. Social support is a significant determinant of health among Canada's Inuit population; however, little is known about the characteristics that provide access to social support among Inuit. This exploratory analysis describes how 4 types of social support (namely, positive social interaction, emotional support, tangible support and affection and intimacy) differ in relation to various determinants of health. STUDY DESIGN: Micro-data from the Arctic Supplement of the 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (n = 26,290) was used. METHODS: Cross-tabulations and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine levels (high/low) of the 4 types of social support among the full Inuit sample (n = 26,290) as they relate to age, gender, geographic region, marital status, Aboriginal language use and participation in traditional harvesting activities. RESULTS: Certain subsegments of the Inuit population were less likely to report high levels of social support, including men, the elderly (aged 55+) and the unmarried. Some Inuit-relevant determinants were also found to decrease the odds of reporting high levels of social support, including being unable to speak or understand an Aboriginal language, not participating in traditional harvesting activities and living in Nunavik. CONCLUSIONS: Research that frames Inuit health within the social determinants of health is in its relative infancy; however, evidence from the social epidemiological literature indicates that those with diminished access to social support also suffer poorer health outcomes. Future research should build on the findings of this study to examine how the relationship between various health outcomes (e.g., respiratory disease, suicide attempts, self-rated health) and social support may respond along a social gradient. Such analysis will build on the paucity of literature specific to Inuit health and social conditions and set priorities for policy and programming efforts that will improve the social determinants of Inuit health.
7183557	1	a	Some social gerontologists have argued that the aged status in America results in distrust of and despair with the social order (anomia) independent of other determinants: lack of access to the means of achievement of life goals and social isolation. This argument was tested with a multivariate regression analysis utilizing data on 354 white men aged forty and older from the 1974 General Social Survey. The Srole anomia scale was used as the dependent variable. Multiple indicators of life chances and social participation were used; health and verbal intelligence were employed as controls. The results showed no relationship between age or other indicators of life chances and anomia, net of education and/or verbal intelligence. Prior studies reporting that age and anomia are causally related probably have done so due to lack of adequate control variables and/or due to cohort effects from the lesser education of the older population in the United States. Compared when employing appropriate controls, aged American males are not more anomic than middle-aged males.
17721671	0	a	"BACKGROUND: Psychoeducational groups are a common component of interventions in schizophrenia. AIMS: To explore patients' views about wanted and unwanted effects of group psychoeducation. METHOD: Subjective feedback of 103 participants of a psychoeducational intervention as well as data from two specific focus groups-one with ""enthusiastic"" and one with ""critical"" participants-were analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participants emphasized the importance of information received and of exchanging information with others suffering from the same disorder. Positive effects on coping, activation and social interaction were reported. Perceived overemphasis on illness related information produced defensive reactions, whereas the integration of quality of life topics was appreciated. A pleasant group atmosphere and clinical stability were suggested as important determinants of success. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative analyzses of participants' views help to understand the potentials of a psychoeducational intervention in schizophrenia."
6737199	1	a	This research compares the relative impact of major life events, chronic stressors, and minor daily stressors on daily reports of mood. Analyses are based on daily diary data combined with interview data derived from a longitudinal study of 96 women sampled from the population of persons using the services of a neighborhood health center in Boston. The most important direct determinants of mood were found to be concurrent daily stressors and physical symptoms, and previous levels of psychological well-being. Life events and chronic stressors had indirect effects on mood through these other variables. The results serve to confirm and extend previous studies on the determinants of short-term changes in mood. The advantages and disadvantages of the temporal aggregation of time-series data are discussed.
14616913	0	a	BACKGROUND: In a recent project, commissioned by the European Union, a set of Child Health Indicators were identified and recommended for use in all Member States. In that work, by a group of European experts, children's development was one of the key areas that were reviewed to clarify its role in this set of indicators. This paper deals with neurological (in a broad sense), social and moral aspects of development; other aspects, such as nutrition and physical growth, mental health, quality of life were dealt with in other areas. METHODS: A number of methods are used to monitor children's neurodevelopment, to identify early deviations that could be treated or alleviated. Few tests fulfil basic criteria of screening and quality of evidence. For Child Health Programmes, developmental surveillance is instead recommended. As a proxy to social development, as part of children's process of adaptation into society, education indicators are recommended, such as suggested by OECD and UNICEF. Moral development is discarded as an indicator, because norms and values vary too much between countries. CONCLUSION: For now the Child Health Indicators of Life and Development Project found no ground to recommend any particular method or combination of methods for a general monitoring of children's neurological, intellectual, language and moral development, and for including the results as national indicators of children's health and well-being in EU. For social development, indicators in the educational area seem most promising, as they have been proposed and used by OECD and UNESCO. In an ambitious monitoring programme, these indicators could be included as determinants of children's health and development.
3538185	1	a	Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity.
3392764	1	a	This paper presents part of a longitudinal study carried out in the three towns of Khartoum Province in the period December 1983 to April 1985. It was attempting to determine the duration of satisfactory breast-feeding in healthy breast-fed infants of mothers attending maternal and child health centres in the three towns; Khartoum, Khartoum-North and Omdurman. The main objective of the present paper is to compare samples from the three towns in terms of the factors affecting weight gain. Four hundred and thirty-nine infants were recruited at birth and home visited every 2 weeks. At each visit weight was measured and it was recorded whether any supplements had been given and whether the child had been ill. Length was measured every 4 weeks. There were significant differences between the samples from the three towns in attained weights and weight increments. Weight gains were lowest in the Khartoum North sample in the first 3 months, but from 3 to 6 months were highest, almost equalling the NCHS reference. In the Khartoum and Omdurman samples growth from 0 to 3 months exceeded the reference but from 3 to 6 months was less than the reference. Fifty per cent of infants were supplemented by 13 weeks in the Omdurman sample; the median time of supplementation in the other two samples was 17 weeks. Only in Khartoum did delaying supplementation seem to benefit growth. Infections were most common among the Omdurman sample.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2943159	1	a	The maladaptive behavior of 474 persons from a residential facility for mentally retarded individuals was investigated. Eleven independent variables pertaining to demographic and environmental characteristics were initially related to the frequency and topography of residents' maladaptive behavior. Multiple regression analysis revealed that maladaptive behaviors were related to sex, social age, chronological age, resident's time spent on outside activities, number of residents per direct-care staff member, presence of sensory handicaps, and ambulation. Results were related to existing literature and discussed in terms of their use for intervention efforts and differential assignment of resources.
25125929	0	a	BACKGROUND: Female genital mutilation/cutting is a harmful practice which has effect on female's wellbeing. However, the practice has continued to prevail in many cultures. Research on the social determinants of the practice and its continuation are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess whether attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation is predicted by gender role perception among adolescents in Jimma zone. METHODS: This study used data collected in the first round of Jimma Longitudinal Family Survey of Youth. A total of 2084 adolescents were identified from 3700 households and one adolescent were interviewed from each household using structured questionnaire. Data on the socio-demographic characteristics, religiosity, access to electronic media, perception of gender role, attitude towards continuation of Female circumcision was collected. Descriptive and multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze the data using SPSS for windows version 16.0. Statically tests were performed at the level of significance of 5%. RESULTS: Of the 2084 adolescents, 1146 (55.0%) were aged 12-14 years, 1025 (49.2%) females and 749 (35.9%) from rural areas. The majority, 1289 (61.9%) were Muslims and 1351 (64.8%) Oromo. Five hundred seventy three (28.1%) of the male youth did not agree to the importance of marrying a circumcised girl. However, 149 (13.8%) and 258 (12.7%) agreed that it is very important and important, to marry a circumcised girl, respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, perception of gender role, sex, place of residence, highest education in the household and religion remained to be important predictors of attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation after adjustment for age and ethnicity. Adolescents who had low gender role perception were 1.4 times more likely to have a positive attitude towards the continuation of the female genital mutilation (OR: 95%CI, 1.41: 1.02-1.94). Female adolescents were 36% less likely to support (P<0.01) the continuation of FGM compared to their male counter parts (OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.49, 0.83). Compared to urban youth, those who live in semi urban and rural areas were 1.46 and 1.52 times more likely to have a positive attitude towards the continuation of the FGM practice, respectively (P<0.05). Similarly the Probability of having positive attitude towards the continuation of the FGM practice decreased steadily as the highest educational level in the household increased. CONCLUSION: One-fifth of the youth support the continuation of the practice. Low gender roles perception, being from the rural areas, household's lower level of education and being Muslim were strong predictors of the attitude towards the continuation of female genital mutilation. Improving perception of adolescents towards gender roles through effective behavior change communication, and involving religious leaders in the campaign against the practice of female genital mutilation is recommended as a useful strategy to ban the practice.
7424897	1	a	The major epidemiologic characteristics of hepatitis A virus (NAV) infections in Greece were studied in a sample of 877 Air Force recruits, 19-25 years old coming from every geographic region of Greece. Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) were detected by solid phase radioimmunoassay in 83.8% of the recruits. Antibody frequency varied significantly in the various geographic regions of Greece and was inversely related to the size of the community. It was further shown that the prevalence of HAV infection was highly related to the recruit's social class and years of education as well as number of siblings and number of persons per room. These findings in accordance with previous reported data show that hepatitis A is hyperendemic and should be regarded as a childhood infection in Greece. Prevailing socioeconomic, hygienic living and housing conditions should be considered as the main epidemiologic determinants of HAV infections.
28514037	1	a	Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084).
14686137	0	a	Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient.
15822090	0	a	OBJECTIVE: We examined the potential for ethnicity to moderate the relationships between awareness and internalization of sociocultural ideals of appearance and between internalization and body dissatisfaction. METHOD: Spanish (n = 100), Mexican American (n = 100), and European American (n = 100) female participants completed measures of sociocultural attitudes and body dissatisfaction. Path analysis using maximum likelihood with robust standard errors tested the relationships across and within ethnic groups. RESULTS: There was evidence for the mediational effect of internalization on the relationship between awareness and body dissatisfaction. Furthermore, both relationships were significantly stronger for European American women than for Mexican American or Spanish women (the predicted moderator effect). DISCUSSION: Results demonstrate how ethnicity may protect against the development of eating disorder symptoms and suggest that eating disorder prevention should involve denouncing the thin ideal, minimizing appearance as an indicator of value, and emphasizing traits other than appearance as determinants of worth.
2916712	1	a	The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.
14757305	0	a	The objective of the study was to examine the sociodemographic and clinical factors influencing gender-specific attempted suicide. Suicide attempters, 40 males and 88 females, seen on a consultation-liaison psychiatric service over a period of 42 months (from January 1, 1999 to June 30, 2002) were compared on sociodemographic and clinical variables. The female attempters [22.99 years (SD 8.1)] were younger than their male counterparts [25.15 years (SD 9.5)] [P = 0.0002]. A higher proportion of the male attempters were engaged in outside occupations, compared with their female counterparts who were mainly full-time housewives or engaged in domestic duties [P = 0.003]. Alcohol misuse was more associated with male suicide attempts [P = 0.001]. Ninety percent of male attempters and 54.6% of the female attempters had the intention to die [P = 0.001]. Although depressive episode was the most common psychiatric disorder in male attempters, followed by neurotic and stress-related disorders, while neurotic and stress-related disorders ranked first in female attempters followed closely by depressive episode, the difference was not significant. However, significantly more male attempters required pharmacotherapy and psychological intervention than their female counterparts [P = 0.002]. More females had marital difficulties, although comparing the two groups on social difficulties did not yield a significant difference. Method used, personality disorders, previous attempt, repeat attempt, race, religion, and marital status were not significant distinguishing factors. Younger age, lack of employment outside home, marital problems, and nondeath motives were more influential in female attempted suicide, while alcohol misuse and severe psychiatric morbidity were more frequently associated with male attempted suicide. The findings support gender-specific preventive and interventional strategies.
12406469	0	a	While there is a large and growing literature investigating the relationship between an individual's employment status and health, considerably less is known about the effect on this relationship of the context in which unemployment occurs. The aim of this paper is test for the presence and nature of contextual effects in the ways unemployment and health are related, based on a simple underlying model of stress, social support and health using a large population health survey. An individual's health can be influenced directly by own exposure to unemployment and by exposure to unemployment in the individual's context, and indirectly by the effects these exposures have on the relationship between other health determinants and health. Based on this conceptualization an empirical model, using multi-level analysis, is formulated that identifies a five-stage process for exploring these complex pathways through which unemployment affects health. Results showed that the association of individual unemployment with perceived health is statistically significant. Nevertheless, this study did not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the association of unemployment with health status depends upon whether the experience of unemployment is shared with people living in the same environment. Above all, this study demonstrates both the subtlety and complexity of individual- and contextual-level influences on the health of individuals. Our results caution against simplistic interpretations of the unemployment-health relationship and reinforce the importance of using multi-level statistical methods for investigation of it.
6358327	1	a	Theories from research in health education and compliance (adherence) behavior are reviewed and examined for their applicability to studies of self-management of childhood asthma. Specific theories discussed include: (1) the health belief model, (2) models of health, illness, and sick-role behavior, (3) social learning theory, (4) models of physician-patient relationships, (5) self-regulation model, (6) communication theory, (7) attribution, control, and decision-making theory, (8) grounded theory, (9) ecologic theory, and (10) family and social systems theories. A scheme to guide development and testing of theories in children's health and illness behavior is presented. The key common elements in the examined theories on adherence behavior are integrated and organized into a paradigm for the family determinants of the self-management of chronic illness.
16088090	0	a	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The importance of careful theory-based intervention planning is recognized for fruit and vegetable promotion. This paper describes the application of the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol to develop the Pro Children intervention to promote consumption of fruit and vegetable among 10- to 13-year-old schoolchildren. METHODS: Based on a needs assessment, promotion of intake of fruit and vegetable was split into performance objectives and related personal, social and environmental determinants. Crossing the performance objectives with related important and changeable determinants resulted in a matrix of learning and change objectives for which appropriate educational strategies were identified. Theoretically similar but culturally relevant interventions were designed, implemented and evaluated in Norway, the Netherlands and Spain during 2 school years. RESULTS: Programme activities included provision of fruits and vegetables in the schools, guided classroom activities, computer-tailored feedback and advice for children, and activities to be completed at home with the family. Additionally, optional intervention components for community reinforcement included incorporation of mass media, school health services or grocery stores. School project committees were supported. CONCLUSION: The Pro Children intervention was carefully developed based on the IM protocol that resulted in a comprehensive school-based fruit and vegetable promotion programme, but culturally sensible and locally relevant.
29313991	0	a	1. The spatial organization of a badger population (North Nibley) is described before and after it was subjected to a UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food badger removal operation (BRO) intended to control bovine tuberculosis. Comparison is made with an undisturbed badger population (Woodchester Park). 2. The Woodchester Park population was organized in group territories with clearly defined boundaries that remained stable during the 3 years of study (1995-97). In North Nibley, however, the badgers' spatial organization was severely perturbed in the first year and, to a lesser extent, also in the second year after the BRO, with badgers using latrines further away from their setts. This resulted in enlarged social group ranges that were difficult to define and overlapped considerably. 3. The disturbance was observed in the removal groups, those immediately adjacent, as well as those at a distance of one or two social groups from the removal area, with an unexpected indication that the latter groups may have been the most affected. 4. The apparent increase in the size of the group ranges in North Nibley was likely to have been caused by an increased proportion of badgers making extra-group excursions in the aftermath of the BRO. 5. Initial recolonization was almost exclusively by females. 6. Although such perturbation might be expected to facilitate disease transmission between badger social groups, there was no evidence that any infectious animals had survived the BRO. However, there were further cattle breakdowns in the area. 7. The behaviour of badgers after the BRO also provided an opportunity to test predictions made by competing hypotheses about the main determinants of the badger's socio-spatial behaviour.
6359827	1	a	Representative theories and research associated with biosocial and psychosocial explanations of juvenile delinquency in the context of the family are reviewed. The studies discussed demonstrate that biological, psychological, and social forces are all determinants of parent-child relations in the development of delinquency. Theories and research are also reviewed which show how biosocial and psychosocial orientations toward antisocial behavior can be integrated into a unified understanding of delinquency. It is concluded that biosocial and psychosocial theories of delinquency must be considered before a full understanding of delinquent conduct can be reached.
12215241	0	a	The psychosocial and behavioral determinants of smoking cessation from late adolescence to early adulthood were investigated in a sample of 711 individuals followed from 1990 (grade 12) to 1995. Analyses stratified by sex indicated that female smokers were more likely to quit 5 years later if they had fewer friends who smoked, less parental approval of their smoking, weaker intentions to continue smoking, higher smoking resistance self-efficacy and better grades at grade 12. Several of these associations could be accounted for by smoking quantity. Similar analyses for male smokers indicated that those who eventually quit were more likely to have fewer cigarette offers, weaker intentions to smoke, better grades and an intact nuclear family at grade 12. The associations for males could not be explained by smoking quantity. Interaction analyses showed few significant sex differences in the predictors of smoking cessation. Results suggest that cessation programs should continue to target parental and peer influences, as well as skills at resisting social influences to smoke, through late adolescence, but do not indicate that such programs need to be adapted to the special needs of male and female smokers.
6667732	1	a	An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
10750613	0	a	BACKGROUND: To investigate social variation in birthweight and length of gestation in Estonia in the period of transition to a democracy and market economy. METHODS: All live births resulting from singleton pregnancies reported to the Estonian Medical Birth Registry in 1992-1997 (n = 84, 629) were studied with respect to social variation in birthweight and preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation). The results were adjusted for maternal age, parity, education, nationality, marital status, smoking in pregnancy, sex of the infant (and gestational age). RESULTS: Between 1992 and 1997, mean birthweight increased from 3,465g to 3,497g (P < 0.001) and the preterm rate fell from 5.8% to 5.1% (P = 0.001). Maternal education, marital status and nationality were all independently related to the mean birthweight and the risk of preterm birth. The mean difference in birthweight between children of mothers with basic and university education was 87 g (95% CI : 74-100). Children born to mothers of non-Estonian compared to Estonian nationality were on average 77 g lighter (95% CI: 70-84). While the effect of nationality and marital status on birthweight was relatively stable during the study period, differences in birth outcome by maternal education became stronger. CONCLUSIONS: The mean birthweight increased and the preterm rate decreased in Estonia as a whole during the transition. However, the improvements were not shared equally by all social groups. An increase in variation in birthweight by maternal education was particularly notable.
20011672	0	a	"Although it is widely assumed that work careers begin after the completion of schooling, most enrolled high school students are also workers. Teenage workers are heavily concentrated in the low wage service sector, but they are also found as supplemental part-time workers in many occupations, including clerical, retail sales, and blue collar employment. Gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic origins are important determinants of the types of jobs that teenage students hold. Students from advantaged socioeconomic origins and students with above average grades are more likely to work in ""good jobs,"" defined by lower hours of work per week and higher status."
16273992	0	a	Most studies investigating correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver burden have focused on the role of objective factors as opposed to subjective factors. Although objective variables (e.g., caregiver age, patient dementia severity, functional status) have been shown to be significantly associated with burden, the correlations generally are modest and explain relatively little of the variability in caregiver outcomes. Moreover, many of these objective variables are not modifiable and are of limited use in the development of caregiver interventions. Thus, there continues to be a need to identify powerful and modifiable determinants of caregiver burden. This study examined the role of two subjective factors-self-efficacy and depressive symptoms-as predictors of AD caregiver burden. Based on a sample of 80 AD caregivers, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy and depressive symptoms each had a significant independent effect on the experience of burden even after accounting for objective factors. These findings suggest that caregiver interventions aimed to reduce burden may benefit from the incorporation of specific strategies to increase self-efficacy and decrease depressive symptoms.
3058621	1	a	"This paper reviews several psychological models to explain disturbed food intake: the ""psychosomatic theory"", the ""stimulus-binding theory"", the ""concept of restraint eating"", closely related to the ""concept of latent obesity"", the ""set-point-theory"" and the ""boundary model"". All are based on the assumption that there are biological regulating processes of body weight (and with this also of feelings of hunger, appetite and satiation as the determinants of food intake), nevertheless the resulting body weight can be inconsistent with social standards and individual self-concepts. In this case a cognitive control of food intake (dieting behaviour) is activated for weight regulation, which in turn interacts with biological regulatory mechanisms, and as a result leads to specific behavioural dispositions which can be supported by experiments."
4076484	1	a	This paper has analyzed a theoretical model of mobility decision-making. The model relies entirely on individual-level factors rather than macro-level factors as determinants of migration decision-making. The individual-level variables included in the model are: recent mobility history, urban social contacts, information about urban areas, evaluations of different locations, migration plans, and actual movements in the period subsequent to an initial interview. The empirical results indicate that with some exceptions there are relatively strong links of the type suggested in the model among these variables. The model was evaluated separately for two groups of villages for movement to Bangkok and for movement to Northeast Thai towns. Thus, four submodels were estimated, providing an opportunity to observe how robust the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins. Although certain differences are found among the four submodels, the overwhelming feature is their similarity. Where differences do exist, they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process. Clearly, a villager's previous history of movement is a key factor affecting subsequent movement and the entire decision-making process. The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center. Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans. Except in one submodel, evaluations have a significant effect on plans; and the existence of plans--which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts, information, and evaluations--is the only factor other than previous mobility which has a significant direct effect on subsequent movement. Thai policy makers are searching for ways to stimulate the growth of regional urban growth centers and reduce the growth of Bangkok. From the standpoint of intervention, a key variable in this process would appear to be information. Not only is information level related to evaluations of an urban area and mobility plans, but, compared to other variables in the model, it appears to be relatively amenable to modification by inputs deriving from a source external to the village itself. It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly, though both could be indirectly influenced by informational inputs. Movement history would be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate; while villagers could be sponsored for short trips to town, this is not likely to produce much long-range effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
14742058	0	a	Medical education has historically relied on the rational choice model as a vehicle for promoting health behavior change, and has largely overlooked the powerful relationships between social class and health behaviors. The rational choice model, which assumes that people can choose to pursue behaviors that are needed for their health, has some clinical utility, especially in some circumstances, but it runs the risk of missing key sources of influence and of blaming the victim. The biopsychosocial model provides an alternative basis for teaching about health behavior change. Health behavior needs to be understood in a broad social context, in which social class is recognized as playing a large part in shaping many people's health behaviors through multiple pathways, including limited opportunities for self-fulfillment, financial constraints, health beliefs, self-efficacy, stress, and social support. In addition to highlighting the limitations of the rational choice model, we illustrate how to integrate the socio-cultural context into teaching about behavior change. Specific curricular suggestions include exercises for: (1) increasing students' awareness of their own biases regarding unhealthy behaviors and individual responsibility for change; (2) enhancing knowledge of social factors that impact health; (3) building advocacy skills; (4) learning from patients; and (5) practicing counseling skills through role-plays.
3175556	1	a	The purpose of this study was to identify and rank potential determinants of respirator use among painters in the construction industry. As part of a health survey of union painters, 169 male spray painters were questioned about their own beliefs concerning the consequences of wearing cartridge respirators, as well as about the perceived attitudes of others in the workplace toward respirators. Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success.
3966042	1	a	Mother-infant interactions of adolescent and nonadolescent mothers are compared, and the impact of maternal age, ego development, education, and child care support on these interactions is examined. Thirty primiparous, white, lower- to middle-class mothers (half less than or equal to 17 years) and their healthy full-term infants (8 months) were studied. Interactions were videotaped during face-to-face interactions and teaching sessions. Child care support and ego development were assessed. During face-to-face interactions, only one difference was found between adolescent and nonadolescent mothers: nonadolescent mothers showed more positive affect toward infants. During teaching, nonadolescent mothers talked more, showed more positive affect toward infants, and demonstrated tasks more often. Individual differences during face-to-face interactions were more related to mothers' ego development and support whereas teaching interactions were mostly associated with maternal age. Thus, maternal age was a stronger predictor of interactive style during teaching. This may partially explain noted cognitive deficits in infants of teenage mothers. However, individual differences among all mothers in ego development, education, and support were significantly related to interactions. Thus, teenage mothers with less education and support and lower ego development may represent a higher risk subgroup of adolescent mothers providing less optimal care-giving environments for their infants.
3046313	1	a	Most data from several countries shows Seventh-day Adventist men to have lower rates of ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality. Similar data for women are somewhat conflicting. There is clear evidence that Adventists have lower serum total cholesterol and lower serum HDL cholesterol with the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol being similar to that of non-Adventists. The risk relationships of this ratio may differ in different populations. There is a certain amount of evidence that vegetarians may have lower blood pressures but this is not clearly supported by data from Seventh-day Adventists. The lower risk for IHD in Adventist men, at least, is probably related to their dietary habits, nonsmoking status, possibly their better exercise habits, and greater social support.
3538185	1	a	Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity.
22085142	1	a	Abstract A sample survey of 2,012 married and single women aged 18-59 in Madrid was in part focused on causes of late marriage, which has for a long time been characteristic of Spain. It was found that age at marriage was not related to a variety of socio-economic measures, to parental restrictions on courtship, nor to birth order or number of siblings. Direct economic motivations appear to have affected length of courtship but scarcely age at marriage. Ages at marriage differ in different areas of Madrid, even when key demographic and social variables are controlled; and evidence from a sub-sample of interviews suggests that it may be a characteristic of different families. Along with clear evidence of normative patterns supporting long courtships and late marriages, such data point to the potential importance of sociological variables, and to the need for similar research on determinants of men's ages at marriage.
15193571	0	a	"PURPOSE: To: (a) establish criteria for defining positive health behaviors and lifestyle; and (b) identify characteristics of adolescents who practice a healthy lifestyle. METHODS: Responses from a 1998 survey via questionnaire, of 1487 students, from a public high school, Cambridge, Massachusetts, were used to assess correlates of healthy lifestyle choices. Strict and broad assessments of healthy behaviors were defined for students: use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs; sexual behavior; attempted suicide. Whereas the ""strict"" criteria included only those adolescents who did not practice any of the behaviors in question, the broad criteria reflected experimentation and moderate risk-taking. The prevalence of positive behaviors was assessed by demographic and student characteristics. In addition, logistic regression models were created to predict determinants of teenagers' healthy lifestyles using both strict and broad definitions. RESULTS: Using strict criteria of healthy lifestyle, significant predictors were being female, born outside the United States, higher academic performance, and fewer stressful life events. Using a broad definition of a healthy lifestyle, significant predictors were being non-Caucasian, in the lower grade levels at the school, higher academic performance, and fewer stressful life events. In both models, peers' approval of risky behaviors negatively influenced teens' lifestyles, whereas parents' disapproval of risky behaviors was a positive influence. CONCLUSIONS: These results reinforce the importance of school, peer, and parent support of positive behaviors. It is important for public health workers and families to understand and define healthy lifestyles choices for adolescents."
19563694	0	a	This paper examines the gender differential in health and its socioeconomic and demographic determinants in the old-age population of India based on the National Sample Survey 60th round data collected in 2004. As in developed countries, older women in India report poorer self-reported health and experience greater immobility compared with men. Stepwise logistic regression analysis shows that the gender differential in health is linked to various socioeconomic and demographic variables and that the gender gap could be narrowed with appropriate policy intervention. Specifically, paying special attention towards improving the socioeconomic status of widowed/separated women could attenuate a substantial portion of the observed gender gap in the health of the old-age population.
12119990	0	a	A decline in daily physical activity levels is clearly a major factor contributing to the current obesity epidemic affecting both developed and developing countries in the world. This escalating problem is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and reduced psychosocial health. Thus, increasing physical activity has become the strategy of choice in public health strategies to prevent obesity. Efforts to improve levels of physical activity in the population rely upon an accurate understanding of the determinants of physical activity. Most research has focused on environmental and social influences, while the potential for physical activity to be controlled by intrinsic biological processes has been largely overlooked. This review presents some of the compelling and diverse evidence that has emerged recently showing that physical activity energy expenditure is a critical factor in both the successful regulation of energy balance in normal individuals, as well as the abnormal regulation of energy balance that characterizes obesity. Although the metabolic and genetic factors involved in these regulatory processes remain mostly unidentified, some novel discoveries have been made in this area recently and these are described within this review.
6514971	1	a	The issue of symptom formation in patients is discussed in terms of evolution relating to cultures and changes in disease patterns. Determinants of symptoms depend upon a host of factors including the individual's developmental history and personality, the setting in which illness develops, the contemporary social status of the individual, the cognitive and affective state, and the resources based on learning that the individual has in coping and adapting to stressful situations threatening the stability of the organism.
3169388	1	a	A prospective study was carried out on 133 neurologically deviant infants, 205 with mild abnormalities and 230 normal newborns to compare behavioural and cognitive development with neonatal and nine-year-old neurological condition. Overtly handicapped children were excluded. Major determinants of school failure were the severity of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) and social class. Main risk factors for distractable and clumsy behaviour were MND classification and male sex; for troublesome behaviour male sex and interval complications after two years of age; and for timid behaviour, family adversity. Definite neonatal neurological deviancy contributed both directly and by its association with MND to problems in behaviour and scholastic abilities. Mild neonatal neurological abnormalities and adverse obstetrical events contributed only indirectly to behavioural and learning problems. Preterm birth (less than 34 weeks) was the sole obstetric variable directly related to some of the outcome variables. The difference between home and school perception of the children's behaviour is emphasized.
20198904	0	a	Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression.
3529452	1	a	The literature was reviewed to assess whether the evidence implicating socio-environmental (SE) factors as determinants of adult lung function was sufficient to require that they be taken into account in epidemiological studies, together with other factors, such as age and smoking. In six studies involving 11,000 adults resident in the USA, France and Denmark forced expiratory volume in 1 second was related to social class and/or one of a number of other factors including education, area of residence and housing status. Trends in three other studies involving approximately 15,000 children resident in the UK and the USA were similar. The consistency of the findings makes it difficult to escape the conclusion that SE factors should be taken into account in comparisons of lung function between populations when the purpose is to assess the role of other environmental factors such as occupational exposure.
20841128	1	a	This article presents a multidimensional model of psychosocial determinants of health behavior for health promotion research and policy analysis. Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented.
12280179	1	a	"""Distinctive types of mobility are identified for the [U.S.] elderly, many of whom also move for traditional reasons. Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves."""
3678537	1	a	This research has expanded our understanding of the determinants of adolescent sexuality in several directions. We have used a study of mothers and children to construct and estimate a model of the intergenerational transmission of sexual attitudes and behavior. With data collected from both mothers and children, we were able to proceed further than most past research and to consider both the attitudes and behaviors of mothers as reported by the mothers themselves. These data permitted an investigation of the determinants of maternal attitudes concerning adolescent sexuality as well as an examination of the influences of the attitudes and experiences of mothers on the attitudes, perceptions, and behavior of children. Obviously, limiting the study to white families prevents generalization of our findings to other subgroups of the population. The findings demonstrate the importance and relevance of parental and adolescent attitudes in understanding adolescent sexuality. Premarital sexuality is a salient issue to both young people and their parents. There are, however, very important and substantial differences in the attitudes of parents and children. On average, the attitudes of young people today are much less restrictive than those of their parents, reflecting either life cycle differences or the impact of social change. The intergenerational difference is recognized by young people themselves and probably affects the ability of parents to assist their maturing children in adjusting to and dealing with their sexuality--a difficulty likely to be reflected in the relative lack of success sexually active young people have in preventing pregnancy. Our findings also add to the research literature in demonstrating that although children, on average, have more permissive attitudes than their parents, the attitudes of individual parents tend to be reflected in the attitudes of individual children. Children whose mothers have less restrictive attitudes have, on average, less restrictive attitudes themselves. Further, the attitudes of mothers are also reflected in the behavior of their children, so on average, mothers with more permissive attitudes have children who are more sexually active. The influence of maternal attitudes, however, is stronger for children's attitudes than for their behavior. Of course, variability in children's attitudes and behavior--and even their perceptions of maternal attitudes--can only be partially explained by the attitudes of their mothers; but presumably, if the attitudes of other important family members, including fathers and siblings, were known, the prediction of adolescent attitudes would improve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2707492	1	a	Mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) inhibit their vocal behavior upon hearing the maternal alarm call of their species. The present study assesses the interaction of the ducklings' experiential history with the environment in which they are tested. If ducklings are reared and tested to the alarm call in small social groups, they respond by dramatically inhibiting their vocalizations. If, however, socially reared ducklings are tested to the alarm call individually in an open field, responsiveness drops precipitously. In addition, individually reared ducklings respond at a far greater level to the alarm call when tested individually, not in groups. Thus, there is an interaction between the rearing history and the testing environment such that the same rearing history leads to different behavioral outcomes depending on the context in which the ducklings are observed. This demonstrates the importance of behavioral context, in addition to developmental history, as one of the determinants of behavior.
3437081	1	a	Although it is of both practical and theoretical importance very little work has been done on adolescents' knowledge of, and beliefs about, the economy. Two studies are reported in this paper--the first concerns the determinants of economic values in a population of 16-17 year old British schoolchildren, and the second concerns economic preferences and knowledge in a larger group of slightly older adolescents. By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on economic socialization.
18186918	0	a	BACKGROUND: This study examines associations between female participation in a microcredit program in India, known as self help groups (SHGs), and women's health in the south Indian state of Kerala. Because SHGs do not have a formal health program, this provides a unique opportunity to assess whether SHG participation influences women's health via the social determinants of health. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used special survey data collected in 2003 from one Panchayat (territorial decentralized unit). Information was collected on women's characteristics, health determinants (exclusion to health care, exposure to health risks, decision-making agency), and health achievements (self assessed health, markers of mental health). The study sample included 928 non elderly poor women. RESULTS: The primary finding is that compared to non-participants living in a household without a SHG member, the odds of facing exclusion is significantly lower among early joiners, women who were members for more than 2 years (OR = 0.58, CI = 0.41-0.80), late joiners, members for 2 years and less (OR = 0.60, CI = 0.39-0.94), and non-participants who live in a household with a SHG member (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.32-0.90). We also found that after controlling for key women's characteristics, early joiners of a SHG are less likely to report emotional stress and poor life satisfaction compared to non-members (OR = 0.52, CI = 0.30-0.93; OR = 0.32, CI = 0.14-0.71). No associations were found between SHG participation and self assessed health or exposure to health risks. The relationship between SHG participation and decision-making agency is unclear. CONCLUSION: Microcredit is not a panacea, but could help to improve the health of poor women by addressing certain issues relevant to the context. In Kerala, SHG participation can help protect poor women against exclusion to health care and possibly aid in promoting their mental health.
3629664	1	a	Data from a 1982 sample survey of 3,830 married women below age 50 in a district of Beijing City are applied to the Bongaarts model of the proximate determinants of fertility. A total fertility rate (TFR) of 0.75 births per woman is estimated from the model, compared with a TFR of 1.24 actually observed from the survey. The estimated TFR (0.75) results from the assumed total fecundity (TF) of 15.30 births per woman being inhibited by the indexes of the proximate determinants of fertility, most notably non-marriage (.280), contraception (.315), and induced abortion (.586). The effects of two other proximate determinants, lactational infecundability and spousal separation, were negligible. Comparative data from other countries confirm that the study area has very low levels of fertility and marriage, a very high prevalence of induced abortion, and a small effect of lactational infecundability. The extremely low level of fertility was, thus, achieved through a high level of induced abortion. Future research needs and policy implications associated with the study are discussed.

2629118	1	a	The relationships between employment status and Type A behavior pattern have been investigated with data from the first MONICA Survey Augsburg, F.R.G., 1984/85 (MONICA = Monitoring of trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). Study population was a two-stage cluster sample of 5312 men and women, aged 25-64 (response 79.4%). Measurement instruments were interviews and a self-administered questionnaire. Type A was measured by the Framingham Type A behavior scale. In multiple logistic regression analyses. Type A behavior among men was studied as a function of various occupational positions [blue-collar, white-collar, civil (public) servants, self-employed], controlling for age, educational level, marital status, and interaction effects. In those analyses it was found that the occupational position 'self-employed' was the best predictor of Type A behavior (odds ratio 3.0 compared to blue-collar employees). Since most of the employed women were white-collar employees (a very homogeneous group) Type A behavior among women was studied as a function of full-time and part-time employment, with the same control variables as were included in the analyses for men. Taking into account the statistical significant interaction effect age by employment, it could be shown that the odds of being Type A for a 50 yr old woman was 3.5 compared to a housewife at the same age. In summary the findings show strong relationships between work situation and Type A behavior for both men and women. Especially the self-employed men have more Type A behavior patterns, so may have higher CHD risk.
3817461	1	a	The authors attempt to understand the nature of denial of illness by an examination of two patients with serious and disfiguring physical disorders who postponed medical treatment for over a decade. Both patients subsequently had dramatic negative reactions to the therapeutic efforts of physicians caring for them. Various social, experiential, and characterologic determinants are discussed. In addition, the authors argue that the illness served important organizing functions: it sheltered these patients from the exigencies of everyday life; it allowed them to defeat the physician's efforts to effect a cure; and, finally, the disfigured physical state appeared to correspond to their internalized defective self-image and self-esteem.

17905053	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Sickness absence is a major occupational health problem, but evidence for associations between potentially modifiable psychosocial work factors and sickness absence is still scarce. We studied the impact of relational justice and effort-reward imbalance on subsequent rates of sickness absence. METHODS: The Whitehall II prospective cohort study of British civil servants, 10,308 men and women, was established between 1985 and 1988. Indicators of effort-reward imbalance and the relational component of organizational justice were constructed from questions included at baseline. Participants were classified into three groups (low, intermediate, and high) for both effort-reward imbalance and relational justice. Short (< or =7 days) and long (>7 days) spells of sickness absence during 1985-1989 and 1991-1995 were used to study immediate and longer term effects of work characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, employment grade, and baseline health, men and women with low relational justice had increased risks of long spells of sickness absence of 14% and 28% in comparison to men and women experiencing high levels of justice. Similar effect sizes (25% and 21%) were found for high vs. low effort-reward imbalance. Both work measures also predicted short spells of sickness absence. Effort-reward imbalance (men and women) and relational justice (women only) each predicted long spells of sickness absence independently of the other. CONCLUSIONS: Both relational justice and effort-reward imbalance are important determinants of sickness absence. Workplace interventions to improve these aspects of working conditions have the potential to reduce levels of sickness absence.
18386045	0	a	OBJECTIVE: While health inequalities among employees are well documented, their variation and determinants among employee subpopulations are poorly understood. We examined variations in occupational class inequalities in health within four employment sectors and the contribution of working conditions to these inequalities. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the Helsinki Health Study in 2000-2002 were used. Each year, employees of the City of Helsinki, aged 40-60 years, received a mailed questionnaire (n = 8,960, 80% women, overall response rate for 3 years 67%). The outcome was physical health functioning measured by the overall physical component summary of SF-36. The socioeconomic indicator was occupational social class. Employment sectors studied were health care, education, social welfare and administration (n = 6,557). Physical and mental workload, and job demands and job control were explanatory factors. Inequality indices from logistic regression analysis were calculated. RESULTS: Occupational class inequalities in physical health functioning were slightly larger in education (1.47) than in the other sectors (1.43-1.40). Physical workload explained 95% of inequalities in social welfare and 32-36% in the other sectors. Job control also partly explained health inequalities. However, adjusting for mental workload and job demands resulted in larger health inequalities. CONCLUSION: Inequalities in physical health functioning were found within each employment sector, with minor variation in their magnitude. Physical workload was the main explanation for these inequalities, but its contribution varied between the sectors. In contrast, considering psychosocial working conditions led to wider inequalities. Improving physical working conditions among the lower occupational classes would help reduce health inequalities within different employment sectors.
2649990	1	a	A social epidemiological approach has been used to study social factors associated with chronic disease, as well as to promote community-oriented intervention programs to modify risk for cardiovascular disease. The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk.
19558191	0	a	Chronic diseases are now the major causes of death and disability worldwide, and non-communicable diseases (NCD) account for the majority of the global health burden. About half of premature deaths are related to health-risking behaviours that are often established during youth and extend to adulthood. While these diseases might not be curable, they are preventable. Prevention is possible when sustained actions are directed at individuals and families, as well as at the broader social, economic and cultural determinants of NCD. A 'life-course' approach to promoting healthy behaviour should begin early in life. The aim of this article is to discuss the impact of the 'health-promoting school' (HPS) on improvements in youth health. HPS can be described as a holistic, whole-school approach in which a broad health education curriculum is supported by the environment and ethos of the school. HPS moves beyond individual behavioural change to consider organizational and policy change such as improving the physical and social environment of the school, as well as its curricula and teaching and learning methods. A positive culture for health would facilitate higher levels of health literacy by helping individuals tackle the determinants of health better as they build the personal, cognitive and social skills for maintaining good health. There is reasonable evidence to demonstrate that the whole-school approach using the HPS framework is effective in improving health, ranging from physical activities and healthy eating to emotional health. Schools adopting the HPS framework have demonstrated changes in culture and organizational practice to become more conducive to health improvement. These schools were reported to have better school health policies, higher degrees of community participation, and a more hygienic environment than non-HPS schools, and students in these schools had a more positive health behaviour profile. Health promotion and disease prevention is essential to reduce the healthcare burden of children and adolescents. HPS would help to combat the global burden of childhood obesity by promoting healthy eating behaviours and encouraging higher levels of physical activity. There are gaps in service provision for children and adolescents from both the health and education perspective; the HPS framework has the potential to develop a mechanism of closer integration with the primary healthcare system, making youth health services more school based and student centred. A new model of interconnection between HPS and different components of primary healthcare can be evolved to make services for disease prevention and health promotion more student friendly.
7249932	1	a	The authors have investigated reasons for medication compliance in a population of epileptic patients. The hypothesis that the health care belief model would be predictive of medication-taking behavior was validated. A pilot study was constructed which investigated the comparative responses of compliant and noncompliant epileptic outpatients to questions regarding demographic, clinical history, and attitudinal characteristics. Noncompliant patients were characterized as having a longer duration of epilepsy, more complicated dosage regimens, and more changes in medication. In addition, noncompliant patients both demonstrated more confusion over medication directions and less insight into the need for anticonvulsants and feared addiction to their medication. They had a lower level of satisfaction with their health care and were more frequently subject to the social complications of epilepsy. The authors suggest that a more holistic approach be taken when attempting to reverse noncompliant behavior.
16986650	0	a	The purpose of this study is to examine the association between lacking emotional support from parents early in life and adult alcohol abuse. A series of logistic regression models were run with data collected from a nationally representative sample of over 2500 adults ages 25-74. The findings reveal a linear relationship between level of deficiency in early maternal support and odds of alcohol abuse during adulthood, with even moderate deficiencies being associated with elevated risk. Further examination suggests that this association persists throughout adulthood. This association does not appear to be explained by the early initiation of alcohol use, but poor psychological well-being during adulthood does account for a large portion of this association. These findings expand our understanding of the risks associated with poor parental support during childhood, and underscore the importance of adopting a life course perspective in studying the social determinants of alcohol problems among adults.
6814269	1	a	"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful."
6706795	1	a	A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed. Smoking, use of drugs, sexual behavior, and drinking of alcoholic beverages at the age of 16 years was related to dropout from secondary school during the 2-year study period. The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed.
3806448	1	a	Social psychological models of health care behaviour frequently take as their starting point perception of the illness. This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed.
14686137	0	a	Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient.
2928145	1	a	Reward allocation in selected American universities was investigated using tenure receipt as the most valuable faculty reward. Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review.
12613711	0	a	Mothers and children constitute the majority of the population and can be considered vulnerable populations. Their health is essential for personal, community, and country development. The ultimate goal of Mother and Child Health (MCH) teaching in schools of public health is to improve the health of women and children. This can be achieved by preparing professionals in the foundations of MCH either as practitioners, policy makers, or researchers. The content of MCH teaching should answer the local needs and include international and global aspects, considering the multifactorial determinants of health. Courses can be integrated into the MPH program or constitute a track within the MPH. Teaching methods should be interactive, including classroom activity and fieldwork. Faculty should be multidisciplinary.
16948157	0	a	BACKGROUND: A significant and growing number of people work long hours. Research examining impacts is limited, but raises concerns about risks to the worker, the family, the employer, and the community. The purpose of this report, which is authored by the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Long Work Hours Team, is to motivate and guide future research by proposing a framework for studying long work hours and discussing research gaps. METHODS: The NORA Long Work Hours Team examined research reports and literature reviews, and gathered input from a conference on long work hours organized by the Team and faculty from University of Maryland. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A framework is proposed for long work hours, including determinants, outcomes, and moderating factors of long work hours, suggesting that studies need to include more clear and complete descriptions of work schedules, worker characteristics, and the work environment, and need to consider a wider range of possible health, safety, social and economic outcomes for workers, families, employers, and the community. Additional studies are needed on vulnerable employee groups and those critical to public safety. More studies are also needed to develop interventions and test their effectiveness.
19654137	0	a	INTRODUCTION OR BACKGROUND: Debate over relationships between economic growth, wealth, health and health inequity is long-standing and ongoing. The main message of this paper is that economic growth, while necessary, is not a sufficient condition in itself for achieving equitable health. SOURCES OF DATA: This review surveys and draws on research into principal factors commonly linked with improving health-income, health care, individual behavior-suggesting, using work from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, that these are better understood in a broader social determinants of health framework. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The paper acknowledges that post-war globalization has seen significant growth, poverty reduction and greater economic resources at individual and household levels all of which can contribute to better health. But it also highlights renewing inequity in global health during the period. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: It argues that over-reliance on market-driven growth, which fails to address deep-rooted social inequalities in economic resources key to accessing social determinants of health, and in the key determinants of health themselves have contributed to increasing inequity in health outcomes. GROWING POINTS: Commitment to market-driven growth remains evident in national policy-making worldwide. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: With increasing health inequity, and calamitous global economic events in 2008-09, the centrality of this commitment needs urgently to be reviewed.
19771953	0	a	This study addresses recent public health policies in Norway, asking how policies on health inequalities have developed over the past 20 years. The authors focus on how the problem has been defined, what goals have been set, and what means have been put forward to achieve them. The data consist of official documents and interviews of key actors in research and the health bureaucracy. The results indicate that the theme of health inequalities has developed from a non-topic to a high-priority topic in Norway's public health policy. This change has been accompanied by formulation of clear goals and an overarching and long-term strategy, including concrete means to reduce health inequalities. Over the past five years, the problem definition has changed from one of individualization with a focus on health behaviors to a structural understanding that emphasizes the problem of the gradient and social determinants of health. Norway is on the move from a state of political indifference toward action in developing comprehensive, coordinating policy.
10990339	0	a	China's dual employment system plays a crucial role in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV-related safe and unsafe sexual practices among young Chinese people. Social and psychological determinants of safe and unsafe sexual practices for HIV infection among young people in Sichuan, China were examined. Our findings indicate that changes in China's social structure and employment system impact upon the social contextual involvement and socio-sexual practice of young Chinese people. The findings in the study suggest that the employment-related contextual involvement was a major predictor in the relationships between demography, information, and psychological risk-taking factors on one hand and the people's safe and unsafe sexual practices on the other. Self-employed people (officially called 'getihu') were more likely than the state-employed people to engage in unprotected sex with casual sexual partners. As China undergoes social restructuring and many state-employed people are laid off, the risk may also extend into the broader non-self-employed population as more state-employed people become involved not only in the self-employed getihu's socioeconomic activities but also in their unconventional socio-sexual practices. Collective vulnerability to STI and HIV, due to the current socio-sexual practices of the getihu young people, has created a new frontier for STI and HIV prevention in today's China, as well as demonstrating the importance of collective action with STI and AIDS prevention strategies within relevant social and sub-cultural contexts.
16140897	0	a	Whether the determinants of linear growth can have independent effects beyond the critical infancy period has been questioned. This research uses uniquely suited data from >2000 youths from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Study in the Philippines to examine the association between diet and height in the postinfancy period. Anthropometric, diet, and other data were collected bimonthly from 0 to 2 y, and at the mean ages of 8, 11.5, 15.5, and 18.5 y. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to quantify the mean effects of diet diversity and energy intake on height across increments demarcated by the postinfancy data (2-8.5, 8.5-11.5, 11.5-15.5, and 15.5-18.5 y). We examined whether the effects differed by socioeconomic status (SES) and age. Effects with P < 0.05 were considered significant. Each additional unit of diet variety (range 0-8 U) was associated with a significant 0.33-cm increase in height in boys. Each additional 100 kcal (4186 kJ) was associated with significant increases in height of 0.05 cm in boys, and 0.02 cm in girls. Significant interactions (P < 0.15) with SES showed that each 100 kcal increase in energy intake was associated with a 0.08-cm increase in height at low SES with no difference at high SES. In both boys and girls, the effects of energy intake decreased with age, as shown by a significant age interaction (P < 0.15). The methods used incorporate the longitudinal nature of the data to offer a unique examination of the association between diet and height in the postinfancy period.
3049068	1	a	This article presents a critique of current models of preventive behavior. It discusses a variety of factors that are usually overlooked-including the appearance of costs and benefits over time, the role of cues to action, the problem of competing life demands, and the ways that actual decision behavior differs from the rational ideal implicit in expectancy-value and utility theories. Such considerations suggest that the adoption of new precautions should be viewed as a dynamic process with many determinants. The framework of a model that is able to accommodate these additional factors is described. This alternative model portrays the precaution adoption process as an orderly sequence of qualitatively different cognitive stages. Data illustrating a few of the suggestions made in the article are presented, and implications for prevention programs are discussed.

12600275	0	a	BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal complaints are frequent and have large consequences for public health. Information about the prognosis after presentation in general practice is far from complete. Knowledge about determinants of the clinical course of musculoskeletal complaints is essential for management decisions and to inform patients about their prognosis. The purpose of this study is to provide information about the prognosis of musculoskeletal complaints other than low back pain by studying the course of these complaints in general practice and to identify determinants of this course. METHODS: Patients of 18 years and older, who present in general practice with a new episode of a musculoskeletal complaint of the neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, arm, hip, knee, ankle or foot, are recruited by their general practitioner (GP). Participants will receive complaint-specific questionnaires by mail at baseline and after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. The following putative determinants of the course of the complaints will be investigated: sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics of the complaint, psychosocial job characteristics, physical workload, physical activity during leisure time, pain coping, mood, kinesiophobia, social support, optimism. The primary outcomes are perceived recovery, pain, functional status, sick leave and overall quality of life.
20531266	0	a	"Within nursing, cultural competency is seen as an important mechanism for reducing racial and ethnic health disparities; however, after years of attempted implementation of ""cultural competence,"" minimal evidence exists demonstrating a relationship between culturally competent interventions and improved health outcomes or reduced disparities. We examine how cultural competency as an intervention for tackling health disparities is undertheorized and misguided, and deflects attention and efforts needed to address broader social determinants of health. We provide a historical overview of cultural competency, critiques of the concept, and recommendations for moving beyond cultural competency as a means of diminishing health disparities."

METHODS: Stratified cluster sampling strategy was employed to select the participants who had pregnancy since 1998 to complete the interview administered ""maternal health care questionnaire"". A total of 462 women participated in the study. RESULTS: Of the 462 women, 387 received prenatal care services, the most common maternal health care services. Only 144 women got post-natal visits at least once. Maternal age and education had significant impacts on the use of maternal health care services including prenatal examinations and birth in hospitals (P<0.05). Low-income (< Yen 1000) women used less maternal health care services than the high-income (> Yen 5000) women (P<0.05). The women who were covered by the cooperative medical insurance scheme and poverty alleviation scheme used more prenatal care and post-natal services and were more likely to deliver babies in hospitals than those who paid the services entirely out of pocket (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Poor social and economical situation has a detrimental impact on the use of maternal health care services, which might be associated with poor education and low financial capacities of the women."
10813470	0	a	The objective of this study is to determine the effect of permethrin insecticide-treated bed net (PITN) use on the incidence of febrile episodes and on household malaria expenses in Benin. Over the course of one year, 208 randomly selected PITN user and non-user households were visited weekly to determine expenditures on febrile morbidity and its treatment, and to monitor spending on malaria prevention. Multivariate analyses were performed to distinguish the effects of PITN use from other important determinants of morbidity, such as malaria-related beliefs and practices, income, and other socio-economic variables. Results from the logistic regression analysis show that the use of PITNs decreases the risk of febrile episodes by 34% in children living in the rural zone. Multiple regression analysis reveals that PITN use does not reduce prevention and treatment expenses. These expenses are significantly associated with women's income. This report also discusses other factors associated with febrile morbidity and malaria-related expenditures.
16403215	0	a	BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination rates among adults 65 years and older or less than 65 years with high risk medical conditions are still below Healthy People 2010 recommended levels of 90%. This study was designed to: 1) assess self-reported pneumococcal vaccination rates following health center level interventions to increase adult vaccination rates; and 2) determine factors associated with vaccination. METHODS: Tailored interventions to increase immunizations were implemented at two inner-city health centers. We surveyed 375 patients 50 years of age and older. Multivariate logistic regression examines the predictors of 1) self-reported pneumococcal vaccination and 2) combined self-reported influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. Both of these models were stratified by age group (50-64 years and 65 years and older). RESULTS: Pneumococcal vaccination rates were 45% by self-report, 55% by medical record review, 69% for patients 65 years old and older, 32% for patients 50-64 years; they did not differ by race. Receipt of the previous season's influenza vaccine was significantly related to pneumococcal vaccination among both younger and older patients. Receiving both the pneumococcal vaccine and the most recent influenza vaccine compared with receiving neither, among younger patients was related to unemployment, more frequent physician visits, and belief that those who do not receive the flu shot are more susceptible to the flu. For older patients, receipt of both vaccines was related to nonsmoking status, believing that friends/family think the patient should be vaccinated, seeing posters advertising flu shot clinics, and belief that those who do not receive the flu shot are more susceptible to the flu. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that improving overall pneumococcal vaccination rates among eligible adults, has the potential to eliminate racial disparities. Interventions delivering vaccination messages specific to older and younger adult groups may be the best strategy for improving adult vaccination rates.
14717564	0	a	This paper aims at articulating a conceptual framework for monitoring equity in health and healthcare. The focus is on four main questions: What is health equity? What is monitoring? What are the essential components of a system for monitoring health equity? and Why monitor health equity? Monitoring equity in health and healthcare requires comparing indicators of health and its social determinants among social groups with different levels of underlying social advantage, i.e. groups who occupy different positions in a social hierarchy. A framework is presented for formulating the key questions, defining the social groups to be compared, and selecting the health indicators and measures of disparity that are fundamental to monitoring health equity. Although monitoring health equity is a scientific endeavour, its fundamental objective is guided by values; technical challenges should be addressed as part of a broader strategy to confront the political obstacles to greater equity.
15234641	0	a	PURPOSE: To determine the rates of patient adherence to key evidence-based therapies at 6 months after hospital discharge for an acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: In this nonrandomized, prospective, multinational, multicenter study, adherence to aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 6 months after discharge for myocardial infarction or unstable angina was assessed in 21,408 patients aged 18 years or older. Patients were enrolled at 104 tertiary and community hospitals representing a broad range of care facilities and practice settings (e.g., teaching vs. nonteaching). RESULTS: Of 13,830 patients, discontinuation of therapy was observed at 6-month follow-up in 8% of those taking aspirin on discharge, 12% of those taking beta-blockers, 20% of those taking ACE inhibitors, and 13% of those taking statins. In a multivariate analysis, adherence to beta-blocker therapy was higher in patients with a myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.47), hypertension (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.54), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.61), or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.45). Aspirin adherence was higher among patients cared for by cardiologists (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.75; P <0.001) than among those cared for by nonspecialists. Male sex and prior heart failure were associated with improved adherence to ACE inhibitor therapy. Hypertension was associated with poorer adherence to statin therapy (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Among patients prescribed key evidence-based medications at discharge, 8% to 20% were no longer taking their medication after 6 months. The reasons for noncompliance are complex, and may be elucidated by future studies of medical and social determinants.
17852976	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Rate of non-attendance following invitation for breast cancer screening is related to several socioeconomic conditions. To what extent this reflects differences with regard to individual and environmental circumstances, respectively, has received little attention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of individual socioeconomic and area-level determinants on variations in non-attendance among geographic areas in an urban mammographic service screening programme. METHODS: The study population consisted of 32,119 women invited for mammographic screening in 1990-93, residing in 97 neighbourhoods in the city of Malmo in Sweden. The influence of the individual factors age, marital status, education, housing accommodation, household income, and area-level circumstances, e.g. rate of migration and rate of being gainfully employed, on the rate of non-attendance was assessed by multilevel analysis. RESULTS: Area rates of nonattendance ranged from 18% to 63%. Of the total variability in non-attendance, 4.3% was between neighbourhoods. This effect was significantly reduced when adjusting for the individual factors. The area-level factors, migration, and rate of being gainfully employed reduced and almost erased the neighbourhood variance in non-attendance. CONCLUSION: In addition to individual socioeconomic factors, area-level factors seem to be important determinants of neighbourhood rates of non-attendance in an urban mammographic screening programme. In a public health perspective neighbourhoods may be targeted in order to affect the problem of non-attendance in mammographic screening.
16076786	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of design features and clinical and social cues on the extent of disagreement among participants in a formal consensus development process. METHODS: Factorial design involving 16 groups consisting of 135 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 mental health professionals from England. The groups rated the appropriateness of four mental health interventions for three conditions (chronic back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome) in the context of various clinical and social cues. The groups differed in three design features: provision of a systematic literature review (versus not provided), group composition (mixed versus GP only), and assumptions about the healthcare resources available (realistic versus idealistic). Disagreement was measured using the mean absolute deviation from a group's median rating for a scenario. RESULTS: None of the design features significantly affected the extent of disagreement within groups (all p>0.3). Disagreement did differ between treatments (closer consensus for cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural therapy than for brief psychodynamic intervention therapy and antidepressants) and cues (closer consensus for depressed patients and patients willing to try any treatment). CONCLUSION: In terms of the extent of disagreement in the groups in this study, formal consensus development was a robust technique in that the results were not dependent on the way it was conducted.
15331814	0	a	Each year, up to three million deaths due to malaria and close to five billion episodes of clinical illness possibly meriting antimalarial therapy occur throughout the world, with Africa having more than 90% of this burden. Almost 3% of disability adjusted life years are due to malaria mortality globally, 10% in Africa. New information is presented in this supplement on malaria-related perinatal mortality, occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy, undernutrition, and neurologic, cognitive, and developmental sequelae. The entomologic determinants of transmission and uses of modeling for program planning and disease prediction and prevention are discussed. New data are presented from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe on the increasing urban malaria problem and on epidemic malaria. Between 6% and 28% of the malaria burden may occur in cities, which comprise less than 2% of the African surface. Macroeconomic projections show that the costs are far greater than the costs of individual cases, with a substantial deleterious impact of malaria on schooling of patients, external investments into endemic countries, and tourism. Poor populations are at greatest risk; 58% of the cases occur in the poorest 20% of the world's population and these patients receive the worst care and have catastrophic economic consequences from their illness. This social vulnerability requires better understanding for improving deployment, access, quality, and use of effective interventions. Studies from Ghana and elsewhere indicate that for every patient with febrile illness assumed to be malaria seen in health facilities, 4-5 episodes occur in the community. Effective actions for malaria control mandate rational public policies; market forces, which often drive sales and use of drugs and other interventions, are unlikely to guarantee their use. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria is rapidly gaining acceptance as an effective approach for countering the spread and intensity of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and other antimalarial drugs. Although costly, ACT ($1.20-2.50 per adult treatment) becomes more cost-effective as resistance to alternative drugs increases; early use of ACT may delay development of resistance to these drugs and prevent the medical toll associated with use of ineffective drugs. The burden of malaria in one district in Tanzania has not decreased since the primary health care approach replaced the vertical malaria control efforts of the 1960s. Despite decentralization, this situation resulted, in part, from weak district management capacity, poor coordination, inadequate monitoring, and lack of training of key staff. Experience in the Solomon Islands showed that spraying with DDT, use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and health education were all associated with disease reduction. The use of nets permitted a reduction in DDT spraying, but could not replace it without an increased malaria incidence. Baseline data and reliable monitoring of key outcome indicators are needed to measure whether the ambitious goals for the control of malaria and other diseases has occurred. Such systems are being used for evidence-based decision making in Tanzania and several other countries. Baseline cluster sampling surveys in several countries across Africa indicate that only 53% of the children with febrile illness in malarious areas are being treated; chloroquine (CQ) is used 84% of the time, even where the drug may be ineffective. Insecticide-treated bed nets were used only 2% of the time by children less than five years of age. Progress in malaria vaccine research has been substantial over the past five years; 35 candidate malaria vaccines are in development, many of which are in clinical trials. Development of new vaccines and drugs has been the result of increased investments and formation of public-private partnerships. Before malaria vaccine becomes deployed, consideration must be given to disease burden, cost-effectiveness, financing, delivery systems, and approval by regulatory agencies. Key to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness will be collection and prompt analysis of epidemiologic information. Training of persons in every aspect of malaria research and control is essential for programs to succeed. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is actively promoting research capacity strengthening and has established networks of institutions and scientists throughout the African continent, most of whom are now linked by modern information-sharing networks. Evidence over the past century is that successful control malaria programs have been linked to strong research activities. To ensure effective coordination and cooperation between the growing number of research and control coalitions forming in support of malaria activities, an umbrella group is needed. With continued support for scientists and control workers globally, particularly in low-income malarious countries, the long-deferred dream of malaria elimination can become a reality.
20695043	0	a	In Nigeria, freshmen constitute a risk group of adolescents and young adults capable of engaging in unsafe sexual practices. This study documents the associated factors to sexual risk behaviours practices of University of Ibadan, Nigeria freshmen. Eight hundred and forty one (841), freshmen who attended a routine orientation program were asked to respond to a questionnaire. Results showed that 30.8% were sexually active and 47% did not use condom in their last sexual episode. Associated with sexual risk behaviours include: being a male freshman increasing age; lower tendency for violence; increase sexual compulsivity; alcohol abuse; history of rape and a history of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA). Three variables: alcohol abuse; history of CSA and increasing age remained significant in a multiple regression analysis. The paper presents the first evidence of vulnerability of freshmen to sexual risk practices in a Nigerian University.
4045008	1	a	This article reviews cognitive-behavioral assessment principles and procedures. The functions of such assessments are noted, and issues and advances in cognitive assessment are discussed. The need for integrated cognitive, behavioral, and affective assessments is then explored. Finally, conceptual methodological, and clinical issues in the integration of assessments and study of reciprocal determinants are presented.
19390298	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Most studies of successful aging have used restricted definitions based on the absence of disability and identified a small number of predictors. The authors aimed to examine whether a broad multidimensional definition of successful aging has good construct validity and identified a wider range of predictors that are relevant for multifaceted interventions. METHODS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal data analyses were performed on 1,281 community-living Chinese elderly of 65 years and above in the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study cohort. Successful aging was measured in multiple dimensions of functioning and wellness: cognitive and affective status, physical health, social functioning and engagement and life satisfaction, and a summary composite measure created across dimensions to form a dichotomous variable. Potential determinants included sociodemographic, psychosocial, behavioral variables. RESULTS: Successful aging was determined in 28.6% of respondents and in multivariate models was significantly (p <0.05) associated with age (OR = 0.90), female gender (OR = 1.37), > or =6 years of education (OR = 2.31), better housing (OR = 1.41), religious or spiritual beliefs (OR = 1.64), physical activities and exercise (OR = 1.90), and low or no nutritional risk (OR = 2.16). CONCLUSION: In contrast to findings based on more restricted biomedical definitions of successful aging, a multidimensional definition of successful aging identified more variables including demographic status, psychosocial support, spirituality, and nutrition as salient determinants.
2573873	1	a	Sociopharmacology is based on interdisciplinary research involving pharmacology, epidemiology, social medicine and sociology. It aims at finding out the social determinants of drug intake. How this goal is approached stepwise is shown in the case of the benzodiazepine group of active substances.
6495362	1	a	In Sri Lanka in 1975, the majority Sinhalese had a much higher use of contraception than either the Sri Lanka Tamils or the Moors. This study uses a national sample of women of childbearing age gathered by the Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey in 1975 to assess four possible reasons for differential contraceptive use: (1) differences in socioeconomic position; (2) cultural differences; (3) minority status; and (4) differential access to family planning services. The first three explanations focus on differences in the demand for contraception while the fourth explanation focuses on differences in the availability of contraceptives. The socioeconomic, cultural, and minority status hypotheses fail to explain the higher contraceptive use among the Sinhalese. The evidence is consistent with the idea that ethnic differences in contraceptive use were largely caused by differential access to family planning services.
19323024	0	a	Local health determinants, perceived by a local community in Mueang District, Khon Kaen Province, were explored using a qualitative approach during November 2006. Health determinants could be classified into three categories: environmental, individual and family, and institutional factors. Community perspectives on health determinants included flooding, habits of lottery buying, fluctuation of vegetable market prices, and job opportunities. Community participants gave high value to the social determinants of health as opposed to environmental/biomedical factors, considering that such conditions could positively build social cohesion and even lead to better well-being. They prioritized flooding as a major environmental health determinant that affected villagers' physical and mental health, as well as family income. For social health determinants, they also indicated that many villagers were addicted to lottery buying that led to mental and financial problems within families.
3788206	1	a	The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.
6663350	1	a	The epidemiological and clinical profile of Chronic Post-Traumatic Headache (CPTH) has been studied in 57 out of 130 consecutive patients hospitalized, following closed head injuries, at the Institute of Neurosurgery of the University of Milan. The incidence of CPTH has been 44%. Age of the patients ranged between 4 and 69 years. Clinical pictures included closed head injuries of different degree of severity: mild, moderate and severe. Time of onset, headache frequency, character, intensity, duration and associated symptoms showed a great degree of variability. However, chronic muscle contraction headache was the commonest clinical syndrome followed by migraine. Moderate correlations have been found between the severity of CPTH disturbance of consciousness, following the head trauma, and positive findings at CT scan. Moreover the comparison of personality profiles (MMPI) of CPTH (n=26) with a post-traumatic control group, without headache (n=17) showed higher scores on hypocondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales only in the severe CPTH group. Age of the patients, duration of unconsciousness, neurological deficits, course length and pending litigation or compensations were unrelated to the occurrence and outcome of CPTH. These findings suggest the importance of both physical and psychological determinants (social or emotional maladjustment) in the pathogenesis of CPTH.
16902386	0	a	BACKGROUND: With the widespread dissemination of the Internet throughout the world of health, it would be relevant to report on current knowledge about health information search on the Internet from the consumers' standpoint. METHODS: We conducted a bibliographical research over the past five years and distinguished between international and French studies. RESULTS: For a long time, the (mostly US) studies have been merely descriptive. The studies highlight that the factors associated with health searches on the Internet are similar to the factors underlying the digital divide. Consumer searches are deemed efficient although search skills are comparatively below standard. Attempts are underway to set up tools, circulate them widely, and ensure better quality information on the Internet. However, comprehension and literacy are still issues in some social groups. Regarding the impact on consumer health per se, a (positive) effect of the Internet seems to emerge but research should be continued. CONCLUSION: Many of the behaviors, uses or limits addressed in this paper pertain to any information search on the Internet but other problems or differences also occur in the specific area of health. Longitudinal investigations are needed, specifically to gain deeper insight into the impacts we have addressed, while rolling out a comprehensive approach to the temporal evolution of user practices and experiences. Specifically, the central issue is still to determine how (and for whom) the Internet alters information search behaviors and, in fine, to what extent this affects health behaviors and the recourse to healthcare.
19324728	0	a	Mammalian societies in which females dominate males are rare, and the factors favouring the evolution of female dominance have yet to be clearly identified. We propose a new hypothesis for the evolution of female dominance and test its predictions with empirical data from the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a well-studied species characterized by female dominance. We suggest that constraints imposed by the development of a feeding apparatus specialized for bone cracking, in combination with the intensive feeding competition characteristic of spotted hyenas, led to the evolution of female dominance. Specifically, we propose that protracted development of the feeding apparatus in young hyenas led to selection for increased aggressiveness in females as a compensatory mechanism for mothers to secure food access for their young after weaning. Our analyses yielded results consistent with this hypothesis. Morphological and behavioural measurements indicate that skull development is indeed protracted in this species; spotted hyenas do not achieve adult skull size or feeding performance capabilities until after sexual maturity. The period between weaning and completed skull development is particularly challenging, as indicated by high mortality. Finally, maternal presence between weaning and full skull maturity, as well as the relative ability of females to aggressively displace conspecifics from food, are important determinants of offspring survival.
14986809	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of low socioeconomic status indicators, specifically parental educational and occupational characteristics on neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: Analysis of 3372 newborn infants admitted to five National Collaborative Perinatal Neonatal Network centers (1 February 2000 to 31 January 2002). Outcomes included birth weight, gestational age, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and length of hospital stay. The independent effects of mother's education and occupation as well as father's occupation on health outcomes were assessed by means of stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 271 (8.0%) infants were of low birth weight, 306 (9.1%) were preterm, 410 (12.2%) had NICU admissions and 240 (7.1%) were hospitalized for more than a week. After adjusting for maternal gravidity, age, smoking during pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications, parental socioeconomic characteristics had no significant impact on low birth weight or preterm birth. NICU admission and prolonged hospitalization were significantly correlated with skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled paternal occupations. Illiterate mothers had nearly 3-5 times the risk of NICU admission and prolonged hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Both father's occupation and mother's education play an important role as determinants of neonatal morbidity characteristics.
3723341	1	a	We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report.
19849915	0	a	BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY: This study aimed to investigate associations between area-level socioeconomic disadvantage (central heating, car ownership and residents in professional occupations), individual-level socioeconomic position (social class and educational qualifications) and contraception use in the UK for the period 1990-1991. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted on cross-sectional data from the National Survey of Attitudes and Lifestyles of 9793 women, 16-59 years of age, residing in 646 postcode districts throughout the UK. RESULTS: Women with lower levels of formal education were less likely to use contraception than women with higher education [odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.44-0.57]. Women in the middle and low social class groups were less likely to use contraception than women in the higher social class group (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.97 and OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56-0.79, respectively). The association between social class and contraception use varied significantly across postcode districts (p < 0.001). The contraception use of women in the lowest social class group varied the most geographically. Women in the lowest quintiles of disadvantage were less likely to use contraception than women in the most advantaged quintiles according to all three measures, namely central heating (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.94), car ownership (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.84) and residents in professional occupations (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.93). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although more information is needed to understand how area and individual socioeconomic characteristics are associated with contraceptive use, this study suggests that policy on contraceptive use needs to be extended beyond individually targeted approaches and needs to take into account socioeconomic determinants of contraceptive use.
17020496	0	a	BACKGROUND: Profound advances in biomedical science have contributed to increased longevity and improved quality of life for many Americans. Despite this progress, a heavier burden of disease is borne by some population groups in the United States, particularly the poor and underserved. Landmark reports published since 1973 have highlighted these health disparities, explored their causal factors, and outlined strategies to reduce them. More recent research studies underscore the results of these early reports that identify social position, economic status, culture, and environment as critical determinants of who develops and survives cancer and of the quality of life of cancer survivors. METHODS: The Patient Navigation Program was established in Harlem, New York, in 1990 to address the dramatic disparities in breast cancer mortality among minority women in the community. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The success of the Harlem Patient Navigation Program has provided the impetus for the development of many similar patient navigation programs across the country and for federal support for Patient Navigation research to address the critical need for effective interventions to eliminate cancer health disparities, particularly among minorities and the underserved.
3359393	1	a	Parents who had been placed in an orphanage as children rated the behaviour of all their children who were between the ages of 6-18 years on a children's behaviour survey instrument. All families were intact and the parents had not requested professional help for marital problems. A significant number of relationships were found between parental background variables and higher reported levels of conflict with siblings and with parents, dependent-unassertive behaviour, and undemandingness in the children. Although sampling difficulties preclude generalization, the results suggest that repercussion of events in the lives of the first and second generation that are usually pathogenic may be seen in the third generation, even when the second generation may not be grossly adversely affected. These events most frequently related to individual differences in the third generation in the area of undercontrol of aggression directed toward parents and siblings.
3293236	1	a	Cancer of the esophagus poses a unique challenge for students of cancer prevention. The role of nutritional determinants and other environmental factors in modulating esophageal cancer has received increasing support from data collected during the last decades. Ecologic, geographic, economic, and cultural variables appear to be collectively operational in determining the nutritional profiles of high-risk populations in the Asian esophageal cancer belt and discrete hyperendemic pockets throughout the world. Altering dietary staples, preventing food contamination by mycotoxins, using molybdenum as a chemical fertilizer, modifying social habits, and adding deficient micronutrients to diets of high-risk groups will potentially avert the development of this devastating malignant neoplasm.
3975667	1	a	Attitudes of medical students towards the psychosocial aspects of illness is of serious concern to medical educators. It is thought that medical students are overwhelmingly disease-oriented and not sufficiently sensitive to the role of the psychological, emotional, sociological and economic factors in the etiology and management of illness. In the present study the ATSIM (Attitudes Towards Social Issues in Medicine) was presented to third year medical students and compared with their responses obtained 2 years previously when they were first year students. The data suggest that third year medical students have positive attitudes towards certain psychosocial issues (the importance of social factors as determinants of health or illness, the role of preventive medicine in maintaining health, the role of physician-patient interactions in patient care). These attitudes were positive during the students' first year and have been maintained during the course of medical school. These finding are contrary to previous studies which indicate a deterioration in attitudes during the course of medical school.
12101586	0	a	This study examined the determinants of attitudes toward intergroup support. The data was collected from the participants of a simulated society game (SIMINSOC; Hirose, 1997). The global society in the game includes rich and poor regions, and the poor regions need to obtain support from rich regions for survival. One hundred and thirty-two participants were randomly assigned to either rich or poor regions and were engaged in various activities in the game. The level of ingroup identity was manipulated by facilitating group activities in some groups but no in others. Then they answered questions regarding the identification, attributions of responsibility, and attitude toward support provision. The results indicated that the identification toward the ingroup increased attribution bias. Furthermore, the identification toward the global society increased the intent to provide support among those from the rich regions. The discussion considered the importance of including intergroup variables in the attributional approach to support provision.
3058621	1	a	"This paper reviews several psychological models to explain disturbed food intake: the ""psychosomatic theory"", the ""stimulus-binding theory"", the ""concept of restraint eating"", closely related to the ""concept of latent obesity"", the ""set-point-theory"" and the ""boundary model"". All are based on the assumption that there are biological regulating processes of body weight (and with this also of feelings of hunger, appetite and satiation as the determinants of food intake), nevertheless the resulting body weight can be inconsistent with social standards and individual self-concepts. In this case a cognitive control of food intake (dieting behaviour) is activated for weight regulation, which in turn interacts with biological regulatory mechanisms, and as a result leads to specific behavioural dispositions which can be supported by experiments."
18415929	0	a	Unplanned and premature discharge from in-patient alcohol or drug detoxification is a common and severe problem in the treatment of substance abuse. So far, most of the relevant studies focused on drug detoxification, whereas only few studies also investigated alcohol detoxification. The aim of the present study was to comparatively identify and analyse determinants of unplanned discharge during in-patient treatment in both diagnostic groups which simultaneously underwent detoxification under the same treatment setting. Subjects were 239 consecutive admissions (alcohol: n = 90; illegal drugs: n = 149) to a specialised qualified detoxification unit at the Psychiatric University Hospital of Heidelberg during the year 2000. Data on sociodemographical and psychosocial variables, medical history, psychopathological findings on admission and presence of psychiatric and/or somatic comorbidity as well as intensity level of withdrawal symptoms were collected retrospectively and analysed with respect to the prediction of planned/unplanned discharge. The high overall rates of unplanned discharge (alcohol: 43.3 % and drugs 62.4 %) confirm the previously reported figures. Treatment success of drug patients was rather affected by sociodemographical and psychosocial factors such as level of education, delinquency, unemployment and hepatitis C diagnosis. Relating to alcohol patients psychopathological findings on admission including orientation, affective state and cognition were most relevant for planned discharge. Furthermore, the results of this study underline the central role of motivation during in-patient treatment as well as the importance of a planned treatment continuation after discharge from the detoxification program.
15935621	0	a	To compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) for patients with epilepsy and health subjects, we collected the clinical and demographic data and information on health states by using the Taiwan version of World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQOL)-BREF questionnaire in 296 patients (aged 19-73 years) with confirmed active epilepsy visiting the clinic of National Taiwan University Hospital, and 296 age-, gender-, municipal- and education-matched Taiwanese healthy subjects sampled from a national health interview survey. Multiple regression analyses with stepwise selection strategy were conducted to study risk factors for impairment of HRQL. Patients with epilepsy have poorer HRQL than the healthy population in physical, psychological and social domains but not in environment domain (p<0.005). Patients with less than 4 attacks during the previous 1 month had a better score in the availability and quality of health and social care in environment domain than healthy subjects (p<0.05). After controlling other determinants, seizure frequency, and comobid with other diseases are the important factors in predicting HRQL for epilepsy patients. Patients with employment and married had a significantly better HRQL. Effective control of seizure frequency and thoughtful promotion of positive attitudes in community are essential to improve the HRQL of epilepsy patients.
15087153	0	a	This paper is a follow-up of earlier findings by the Kagera AIDS Research Project (KARP), which documented declining trends in the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection in the Kagera region of Tanzania. The paper examines socio-cultural and sexual behavioral changes as possible determinants of the observed declining trends in Bukoba, the largest urban area of the region. The study used in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, field observations and ethnographic assessments to collect the required data. The findings suggest that since the initial years of the epidemic there have been significant changes in sexual behaviors, norms, values, and customs that are considered high-risk for HIV transmission. The findings show an increase in condom use, abstinence, zero grazing (sticking to one sexual partner) and uptake of voluntary HIV testing while traditional practices such as polygamy, widow inheritance, excessive alcohol consumption, and sexual networking are declining. We suggest that these changes are partly a result of the severity of the epidemic itself in the study area, and interventions that have been carried out in this area since 1987. The major interventions have included health education, the distribution of condoms, AIDS education in schools, voluntary HIV counseling and testing. These are encouraging findings that give hope and we believe that other places within Tanzania and other countries experiencing a severe AIDS crisis have much to learn from this experience. However, changes in norms and behavior are vulnerable; people in Kagera are still at risk and there is a need for continued intervention together with monitoring of the direction of the epidemic.
3538185	1	a	Health professionals concerned with improving the nutritional status of populations are facing numerous problems ranging from emaciation to overnutrition. This review article addresses the complexity, the relative significance and the interaction of factors leading to the nutritional profile of specific groups and individuals. When availability of food is threatened, the programs designed to reduce the incidence of malnutrition must balance the food supply with energy resources and population needs as well as encourage economic improvement of food distribution systems. For those persons having access to an abundant food supply, social forces and technological factors may affect food patterns, resulting in unbalanced diets associated with chronic diseases. Misinterpretation of reliable scientific findings is a major cause of abnormal nutrition behaviour. Overreaction to health messages may precipitate such conditions as anorexia nervosa or nutrient toxicity. Adverse food reactions, real or imagined, lead to restrictions in food selection. Excessive austerity in food use negates the pleasure of eating, a useful mechanism in food choice ensuring food diversity.
3529424	1	a	Much of the research on the recent resurgence of malaria in Third World areas has focused on the problem of vector resistance arising out of the widespread use of pesticides in conjunction with the development of large-scale agricultural projects. Evidence from southern Africa, and particularly from Swaziland, where a resurgence of malaria has occurred in the absence of pesticide-resistant strains of Anopheles mosquitoes, suggests that changes in agroecosystems, labor utilization and settlement patterns, which are also associated with large-scale agricultural development, may play an equally important role in the resurgence of malaria. Renewed efforts to control malaria must, therefore, take account of the social and economic, as well as the biological determinants of this disease.
17855458	0	a	This article reviews the Canadian literature on health issues for homeless/street youth couched in terms of the broad determinants of health. A description of the target population is presented, followed by a discussion of the health risks associated with living in marginal and precarious situations ;on the street'. In particular, the potential consequences of engaging in the risky and often dangerous activities (e.g. substance abuse and high-risk sex) associated with the street lifestyle are discussed. Key conclusions drawn from the relevant literature are taken into consideration in a final section that includes a discussion of the policy implications of this work.
12072146	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Research of the determinants of inpatient aggression indicates that certain environmental hospital variables play a role in triggering aggression in psychiatric hospitals. Yet, how patient, staff and ward variables interact in eliciting aggression is not well understood. METHOD: On the basis of earlier findings, a model was proposed in which psychopathology and distorted cognitions of the patient are combined with environmental and communicational stressors that are specific for psychiatric wards. RESULTS: The proposed model elucidates how certain patient, staff and ward characteristics may interact in causing aggression. The model also emphasizes that repeated inpatient aggression may be the result of a vicious circle, i.e. inpatient violence is often followed by an increase in environmental and/or communication stress on the patient, thereby heightening the risk of a repeated outburst of violence. CONCLUSION: Although tentative, the model may shed light on the mechanisms that lead to (repeated) violence.
11470388	0	a	A population-based study of 1810 persons, aged 75+, was investigated to evaluate the role of dementia and other chronic diseases as determinants of institutionalization in the elderly. The study population was examined at baseline and after a 3-year interval. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, functional dependence, dementia, cerebrovascular disease and hip fracture were associated with living in an institution at baseline. Additionally, functional dependence, hip fracture and dementia were also associated with moving to an institution during the 3-year follow-up. In a similar analysis, including only nondemented subjects, the Mini-Mental State Examination emerged as one of the strongest determinants. The population attributable risk percentage of institutionalization during the 3-year follow-up due to dementia was 61%. This study confirms that dementia and cognitive impairment are the main contributors to institutionalization in the elderly, independently of their sociodemographic status, social network, or functional status.
18434246	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of 2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors: perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal knowledge of health issues.
18366252	0	a	BACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.
18479518	0	a	BACKGROUND: The overall number of involuntary admissions is increasing in many European countries. Patients with severe mental illnesses more often progress to stages in which acute, coercive treatment is warranted. The number of studies that have examined this development and possible consequences in terms of optimizing health care delivery in emergency psychiatry is small and have a number of methodological shortcomings. The current study seeks to examine factors associated with compulsory admissions in the Amsterdam region, taking into account a comprehensive model with four groups of predictors: patient vulnerability, social support, responsiveness of the health care system and treatment adherence. METHODS/DESIGN: This paper describes the design of the Amsterdam Study of Acute Psychiatry-I (ASAP-I). The study is a prospective cohort study, with one and two-year follow-up, comparing patients with and without forced admission by means of a selected nested case-control design. An estimated total number of 4,600 patients, aged 18 years and over, consecutively coming into contact with the Psychiatric Emergency Service Amsterdam (PESA) are included in the study. From this cohort, a randomly selected group of 125 involuntary admitted subjects and 125 subjects receiving non-coercive treatment are selected for further evaluation and comparison.First, socio-demographic, psychopathological and network characteristics, and prior use of health services will be described for all patients who come into contact with PESA. Second, the in-depth study of compulsory versus voluntary patients will examine which patient characteristics are associated with acute compulsory admission, also taking into account social network and healthcare variables. The third focus of the study is on the associations between patient vulnerability, social support, healthcare characteristics and treatment adherence in a two-year follow-up for patients with or without involuntarily admittance at the index consultation. DISCUSSION: The current study seeks to establish a picture of the determinants of acute compulsory admissions in the Netherlands and tries to gain a better understanding of the association with the course of illness and patient's perception of services and treatment adherence. The final aim is to find specific patient and health care factors that can be influenced by adjusting treatment programs in order to reduce the number of involuntary admissions.
3481909	1	a	Problems with current definitions of mental retardation were recognized. Classification systems based on the behavioral capabilities of retarded persons were criticized since there are so many noncognitive determinants of performance. It was proposed that mental retardation be defined solely by IQ scores at least 2 SDs below the population mean. This suggestion was predicated on the view that the behavioral sciences currently have no better way to assess intellectual functioning. Etiology was seen as such a significant predictor of group differences that the organic, familial, and undifferentiated categories would be used in classification. Social adaptation and expected performance were seen as correlates of class membership rather than defining features of retardation, since they have no reliable method of measurement. Problems of labeling were discussed, but the practice was deemed useful if it leads to beneficial services and interventions.
16442195	0	a	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of cognitive functioning, psychopathology, and severity of extrapyramidal side effects on community outcome in a group of Greek outpatients with schizophrenia. Participants were 40 outpatients with schizophrenia (25 men). Social adjustment was assessed with the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Severity of symptoms of schizophrenia was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Finally, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered in order to assess the following cognitive domains: executive functioning/set shifting, executive functioning/inhibition, fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, attention, visuospatial ability, and psychomotor speed/visual scanning. Total scores on the QLS were significantly correlated with negative symptoms, parkinsonism, and performance on the fluency tasks. Interpersonal relations subscale was significantly related with negative symptoms and fluency. No significant relationship was found between the Instrumental Role Functioning subscale and the PANSS, ESRS, or any cognitive domain. Scores on the Intrapsychic Foundation subscale were significantly correlated with negative symptoms and fluency. Finally, scores on the Common Objects and Activities subscale were significantly related with severity of negative symptoms, parkinsonism and visual memory. Our findings suggest that severity of negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, especially performance on fluency tasks and visual memory, as well as parkinsonism, are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia.
3219420	1	a	The psychological consequences of cancer are most frequently reactive and do not constitute a major psychiatric illness. Anxiety and depression are the two main psychological disorders which occur frequently but with variable intensity according to the type of disease, its course, as well as the individual and social background of the patient. Physical factors such as digestive disorders, pain, mutilation and sterility can undermine the psychological adaptation. Cognitive impairment is generally due to neurological localizations of the disease or to metabolic abnormalities. The interrelationship between somatic and psychological factors must be carefully analyzed in order to recognize the determinants of suffering and abnormal coping or behavior.
20841128	1	a	This article presents a multidimensional model of psychosocial determinants of health behavior for health promotion research and policy analysis. Frequently, health promotion focuses almost exclusively on intrapsychic determinants and on individual level behavior. Based upon Field Theory and attitude theories, this proposed model holds that in populations with comparable sociodemographic and biological status (exogenous variables) a health behavior is a function of direct and interaction effects of five key intrapsychic and external variables. These are: behavioral intentions, social support, accessibility of means for action, personal autonomy, and action situation. Empirical tests with cross-cultural studies in Venezuela, Kenya, and the Philippines provide substantial support for the model. The findings suggest that while health promotion strategies should deal with intrapsychic determinants of behavior, key extrapsychic factors (such as social support, quality and accessibility of health care measures, and situational factors) all have direct and independent effects on health behavior as well. Health promotion research and interventions which aim exclusively at intrapsychic determinants would thus have rather limited overall value. The article discusses key research and policy implications of the model presented.
17960295	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Alcohol misuse in college students represents a significant public health problem. Toward improving the understanding of determinants of collegiate alcohol misuse, the current study examined several dimensions of impulsivity in relation to hazardous drinking in college students. METHOD: A one-way, two-group, cross-sectional design was used to compare hazardous drinkers (HZD) with social drinkers (SOC). HZD drinkers were required to score 6 or more on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT); SOC drinkers were required to score 1-5 on the AUDIT. The sample comprised 93 participants (56% HZD; 76% male) who were recruited from a medium-sized public university. Participants were assessed under neutral conditions using the Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire (EIQ), Delay Discounting Task (DDT), and Stanford Time Perspective Inventory (STPI). RESULTS: Consistent with predictions, HZD participants exhibited significantly greater impulsivity on the EIQ-Impulsivity subscale (p < .001), the STPI-Present Hedonism subscale (p < .01), and the STPIFuture subscale (p < .01); however, no differences were evident on the DDT (p > .40). The HZD group also scored marginally higher than the SOC group on the EIQ-Venturesomeness subscale (p < .10). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that greater impulsivity is associated with alcohol misuse in college students, most prominently in the area of propensity toward risk-taking and nonplanning (EIQ-Impulsivity subscale). The correspondence between these findings and previous studies, methodological considerations, and the need for prospective studies on impulsivity and alcohol misuse in college students are discussed.
3175556	1	a	The purpose of this study was to identify and rank potential determinants of respirator use among painters in the construction industry. As part of a health survey of union painters, 169 male spray painters were questioned about their own beliefs concerning the consequences of wearing cartridge respirators, as well as about the perceived attitudes of others in the workplace toward respirators. Intended respirator use was more strongly associated with beliefs than was past use. The most important beliefs concerned discomfort or inconvenience. Other determinants that were associated with respirator use were respirator availability, cigarette smoking, and social influences. It was concluded that the most effective intervention strategy to increase respirator use would be multidimensional and that efforts to change only a worker's beliefs may have limited success.
3494378	1	a	"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy."
2529668	1	a	"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers."
19712011	0	a	Menopause is a natural physiological event that usually begins in women between the ages of 48 and 55 years. In many cases, this event is associated with unpleasant somatic-vegetative, urogenital or psychological symptoms. To test the health and social demographic factors (especially household income level) that influence willingness to pay (WTP) for a new hormone-free treatment in women of menopausal age. 1365 women between the ages of 45 and 73 years were surveyed about their health and WTP for the new treatment. WTP was evaluated with a closed-ended binary questionnaire (four groups with different levels of co-payment between euro15 and euro60), using the contingent valuation method. The average WTP was calculated according to the area under the demand function. Factors contributing to payment readiness were examined by means of binary logistic regression. WTP was significantly affected by women's opinion of the new medication, the level of co-payment required, net household income, whether currently in treatment for menopausal symptoms, and Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) values. Compared with other factors, the level of co-payment was predicted to have a negative impact on WTP. Income level is an important factor in WTP and correlates highly with several other health-related variables (WHO-5 index, MRS value, receipt of other menopause medicines and existing co-morbidity). The average co-payment that our group of women was willing to pay was between euro17 and euro35 per month, or euro24 to euro42 for women who were currently receiving treatment for symptoms of menopause. While interpreting the results, it should be considered that the hypothetical therapy was assumed to be a new non-reimbursable alternative to conventional therapy offered under the existing statutory framework for health insurance in Germany. Despite some methodological limitations, these results are useful for examining the factors affecting WTP and incremental utilities for future medicine dealing with menopause.

20198904	0	a	Drug use is a complex behavior with multidimensional determinants, including social, psychological, cultural, economic, and biological factors. Blood borne viral infections including hepatitis C virus are transmitted when an uninfected intravenous drug user (IVDU) uses injection equipment, especially syringes, that have previously been used by an infected person. The transmission can also result from sharing other injection equipment such as 'cookers' and 'cottons'. Recent studies have shown that the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse have declined substantially since the introduction of needle exchange. Infection with hepatitis C may spontaneously resolve during the acute stage and never progress to chronic infection, or the infection may become chronic without medical complications, or the infection may become chronic with progressive medical complications. Regular testing for infection is an important strategy for secondary prevention of chronic hepatitis C infection. Care for hepatitis C is a vital component of a comprehensive health program for persons using illicit drugs. Such care includes screening for transmission risk behavior, prevention counseling and education, testing for HCV antibody and RNA. IDUs found to have chronic HCV infection should be assessed for the presence and degree of liver disease and evaluated for treatment for HCV Hepatitis C care also requires providing access to treatment for substance use and abuse. Therapy with opioid agonists, including methadone maintenance treatment, has been shown to diminish and often eliminate opioid use and reduce transmission of infection. Approval of buprenorphine makes office-based pharmacotherapy for opioid addiction possible. When considering treatment for hepatitis C, particular attention must be paid to mental health conditions. As a group, IDUs exhibit higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders than the general population. IFN-based regimens for hepatitis C are often complicated by neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including depression, insomnia, and irritability. Strong linkages with mental health services, whether on-site or within the community, are a vital component of comprehensive health programs for IDUs and are particularly important during treatment for hepatitis C. Past episodes of depression or other psychiatric disorders are not absolute contraindications for the treatment for HCV infection. Some authors recommend prophylactic antidepressant therapy before initiating treatment for HCV in patients thought to be at a high risk of depression.
15369573	0	a	AIMS: To compare low-rate daily smokers (one to five cigarettes/day) with other daily smokers, using the Transtheoretical Model of Change as a framework. DESIGN: Mail survey with a follow-up after 7 months. SETTING: A randomly selected population sample in French-speaking Switzerland, in 1998. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2338 daily smokers aged 25 + years, including 95 smokers of one to five cigarettes/day, 324 smokers of six to 10 cigarettes/day, 399 smokers of 11-15 cigarettes/day and 1520 smokers of 16 + cigarettes/day, and 1765 people (75% of 2338) at 7-month follow-up. FINDINGS: Compared with smokers of 16 + cigarettes/day, low-rate smokers of one to five cigarettes/day included more women (67% versus 46%, P < 0.001), were 4 years younger (P < 0.001), were less motivated to quit smoking (62% versus 37% in the 'precontemplation' stage of change, P < 0.001), thought that quitting would be easier (-3.4 points on a 0-10 scale, P < 0.001) and were less bothered by the risk of smoking. Low-rate smokers were taking control more actively over their smoking, e.g. they more often stayed away from places where people smoked, sat in the no-smoking sections in public places and tried to delay as much as they could their first cigarette of the day. Only 45% of low-rate smokers were still in the same category 7 months later. CONCLUSIONS: For many smokers, low-rate smoking may result from a conscious effort to limit their cigarette consumption. Being a low-rate smoker was a temporary condition for most people. Low-rate smokers should be considered as a specific, although heterogeneous group.
6706793	1	a	Questionnaires addressing areas expected to relate to contraceptive use were completed by 230 female adolescents. Contraceptive use among the 130 sexually active subjects were predicted by a model composed of 12 scales assessing social permissiveness, costs and benefits of contraception, parent communication, boyfriend support, sex education and knowledge, attitudes about pregnancy and contraception, and access to contraception services. Scales from the predictive model which raise ideas for potential intervention strategies assessed parent communication, boyfriend support, and perceived costs and benefits related to contraception. Since there has been public concern that intervention programs for enhancing adolescent contraceptive use might also stimulate sexual activity, correlations were computed between the predictive scales and the measure of sexual experience among all 230 subjects. These data indicated that positive parent communication about sexuality and a perception of high benefits and low costs associated with contraceptive use were not positively correlated with sexual experience. Implications for the prevention of adolescent pregnancy are discussed with an emphasis on designing innovative sex education, improving parent-child communication, resolving conflicts in contraceptive decisionmaking, and supporting the role of boyfriends in contraceptive use.

In concentrating on the 'push' factors responsible for gross out-migration over the period 1966-71, the study considers aspects of several dimensions: spatial, economic, social, ethnic and demographic. However, in order to explore the ramifications of interaction between migration and these multifaceted factors, a model is construed which dwells not only on the forces responsible for out-migration, per se, but also on those capable of regulating rural economic structure and agricultural welfare."""

19288207	0	a	BACKGROUND: Work-related health research has traditionally focused on identifying risks rather than determinants of good health. Our knowledge of variation in ill health is thus greater than our understanding of such variations in good health. PURPOSE: In this study, the associations between work-environment exposures and good health are examined. We are especially interested in contrasting our indices of ill health with a narrow measure of good health. Moreover, the salutary effect of sense of coherence (SOC) is explored, focusing particularly on its moderating role. METHOD: Data stem from the panel of Swedish level of living surveys for 1991 and 2000. The analysis is based on a sample of 2,334 employed men and women. Logistic regressions are used. RESULTS: Assessed work-environment factors are to a large extent related, in a mirrored way, to good health and ill health. The models' fit are, however, generally better for the latter. Our findings also indicate that SOC has a protective role for individuals exposed to work risks such as stress and high physical demands. CONCLUSION: To improve our understanding of what promotes good health, research needs to focus on salutary factors. One such salutary factor explored in this paper is sense of coherence.
6573998	1	a	The purpose of the present investigation was to study dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status in the adult Danish population. The study group comprised 5151 persons (86.7% of the original sample) who were interviewed in order to determine living conditions. Questions on dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status were included. 61% of the adult Danish population in the age group 20-69 had regular dental visits. Dental visit habits varied according to urbanization, age, sex and social group. Among well off persons 85% had regular dental visits as opposed to only 40% in the disadvantaged social group. Well off persons and persons with regular dental visits more often claimed good dental health than persons in the disadvantaged social group and among the non-regular visitors. In the higher social group 13% reported to have removable dentures in contrast to 51% in the disadvantaged social group. To isolate determinants of dental visits a multiple dummy-regression analysis was performed. Nearly 50% of the variation in dental visit habits was explained by the variables: urbanization, sex, age, perceived dental health status, education, work in exhausting jobs, income, social background and perceived psychological problems. Efforts to bring a greater part of the adult population in Denmark in contract with the dental health service system should consider these findings.
19577695	0	a	The world's almost 400 million Indigenous people have low standards of health. This poor health is associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, poor hygiene, environmental contamination, and prevalent infections. Inadequate clinical care and health promotion, and poor disease prevention services aggravate this situation. Some Indigenous groups, as they move from traditional to transitional and modern lifestyles, are rapidly acquiring lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, and physical, social, and mental disorders linked to misuse of alcohol and of other drugs. Correction of these inequities needs increased awareness, political commitment, and recognition rather than governmental denial and neglect of these serious and complex problems. Indigenous people should be encouraged, trained, and enabled to become increasingly involved in overcoming these challenges.
7226684	1	a	In an effort to provide the clinician with suggestions for preventive and remedial approaches to adolescent pregnancy, the nature, medical, social, economic, and psychological aspects of the problem are reviewed and discussed. While the rate of adolescent pregnancy is declining, there are more than 560,000 deliveries to teenagers annually. Medical risks are significantly diminished by early and comprehensive prenatal care. The major complications continue to be social and economic. Lower I.Q.s in offspring of adolescent mothers have been reported. Failure to complete high school significantly increases the risk of unemployment, trapping the premature parent and her offspring in a web of poverty. A lack of a sense of future and viable alternatives may legitimize the option of motherhood in the minds of many adolescent girls. Furthermore, an ignorance and a denial of sexuality combined with the developmental imperatives of experimentation and rebellion place the adolescent at high risk for pregnancy.
16290129	0	a	This paper investigates the determinants of regional variations in outpatient antibiotic consumption using Swiss data. The analysis contributes to the debate on appropriate antibiotic use by improving the understanding of its determinants, and may help to define more effective health care policies to reduce the resistance phenomenon. Findings suggest that Switzerland exhibits relatively low levels of consumption among European countries. There are significant differences between cantons both in the per capita antibiotic sales and defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants (DID). Econometric estimations suggest that DID are significantly related to per capita income, antibiotic price, the density of medical practices, demographic, cultural and educational factors. The incidence of bacterial infections is also relevant. Appropriate policies affecting antibiotic consumption in the community can be designed by looking at crucial determinants in the model and their related impact.
18442310	0	a	Understanding the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on physical development in children is important, especially in developing countries where considerable inequalities persist. This is the first study to examine the association between SES on bone development at the whole body, femoral neck, and lumbar spine in black children living in Soweto and Johannesburg, South Africa. Linear regression models were used to study associations between SES during infancy and current SES, anthropometric, and DXA-derived bone mass in 9/10-yr-old children (n = 309). Findings suggest that current SES measures, rather than SES during infancy, are stronger predictors of current whole body bone area (BA) and whole body BMC after adjusting for body size, pubertal development, physical activity, habitual dietary calcium intake, and body composition. SES had no significant effect on either hip or spine bone mass. Caregiver's marital/cohabiting status (indicator of social support) and whether there was a television in the home (indicator of greater income) at age 9/10 yr were the most important socio-economic determinants of whole body BA and BMC. SES has a significant independent effect on whole body BMC through its impact on BA. This suggests that poverty alleviation policies in South Africa could have a positive effect on bone health.
18397458	0	a	CONTEXT: The influences of gender and geography are increasingly being acknowledged as central to a comprehensive understanding of health. Since little research on rural women's health has been conducted, an in-depth qualitative approach is necessary to gain a better initial understanding of this population. PURPOSE: To explore the determinants of health and their influence on rural women's health. METHODS: From November 2004 to September 2005, 9 focus groups and 3 individual interviews were conducted in 7 rural southwestern Ontario communities. Sixty-five rural residents aged 26 years and older participated in the study. Semi-structured interview questions were used to elicit participants' perceptions regarding determinants of rural women's health. FINDINGS: Four Health Canada determinants (employment, gender, health services, and social environments) and 3 new determinants (rural change, rural culture, and rural pride) emerged as key to rural women's health. CONCLUSIONS: Although health determinants affect both urban and rural people, this qualitative study revealed that rural women experience health determinants in unique ways and that rural residents may indeed have determinants of their health that are particular to them. More research is needed to explore the nature and effects of determinants of health for rural residents in general, and rural women in particular.
7419352	1	a	Most of the 'variance' in human food selection can be attributed to culture and individual experience. It is argued that while rigorous research on biological determinants of food selection is very valuable, we must also invest heavily in more exploratory, social science oriented studies. Only in this way can we approach most of the major determinants of food choice. We must recognize that food selection is multidetermined and context dependent. At this early stage of scientific development in this field, we must be willing to consider tradeoffs between rigor or quantification and promising preliminary and qualitative studies.
15133693	0	a	OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess fetal, antenatal, and pregnancy determinants of unexplained antepartum fetal death. METHODS: This is a hospital-based cohort study of 34,394 births weighing 500 g or more from January 1995 to December 2002. Unexplained fetal deaths were defined as fetal deaths occurring before labor, without evidence of significant fetal, maternal or placental pathology. RESULTS: Ninety-eight unexplained antepartum fetal deaths accounted for 27.2% of 360 total fetal deaths. Two-thirds of these deaths occurred after 36 weeks' gestation. The following factors are independently associated with unexplained fetal deaths: primiparity (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.21, 2.86); parity of five or more (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.26, 3.26); low socioeconomic status (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.14, 2.86); maternal age 40 years or more (OR 3.62; 95% CI 1.22, 4.52); maternal age of 18 years or less (OR 1.79; 95% CI 0.82, 2.89); maternal prepregnancy weight greater than 70 kg (OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.85, 3.68); fewer than three antenatal visits in women whose fetuses died at 31 weeks or more (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.08, 2.48); birth weight ratio (defined as ratio of birth weight to mean birth weight for gestational age) between 0.85 and 0.94 (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28, 4.18) or over 1.45 (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.75, 3.21); trimester of first antenatal visit. Previous fetal death, previous abortion, cigarette smoking, fetal sex, low maternal weight, fetal-to-placenta weight, and post date pregnancy were not significantly associated with unexplained fetal deaths. CONCLUSION: Several factors were identified that are associated with an increased risk of unexplained fetal deaths.
16351702	0	a	PURPOSE: To review the current literature about potential determinants of fruit and vegetable intakes and effective intervention strategies to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables among 6-12-year-old children. METHODS: A structured review of literature located in PubMed and Psychinfo electronic literature databases. RESULTS: Of all determinants, the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables and taste preferences were most consistently and most positively related to consumption. There was some evidence that parental fruit and vegetable intakes, knowledge of intake recommendations and skills had a positive association with children's intakes, whereas television viewing, exposure to television advertisement, and having a snack bar at school were associated with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables. Multi-component school-based interventions that combined classroom curriculum, parent and food service components showed the greatest promise for fruit and vegetable promotion among children. School fruit and vegetable subscription programmes, scout-based interventions, and fruit and vegetables education via computer multi-media channels also appear promising. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should improve the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables to children, and should aim to improve their taste preferences for them. Such interventions should be of a multi-component nature, school-based or use other social channels and may include multi-media channels.
16174145	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To test the role of social determinants-including race, education, income, and demographic factors-of child mental health services use, defined as having had a visit to a mental health professional for depression, attention-deficit, or for any reason. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Child/Young Adult supplement, a nationally representative sample of 7-14-year-old children born to women who were 14-22 years old at the start of data collection, in 1979. African Americans and Latinos were over-sampled, and population weights are available to make nationally representative inferences. STUDY DESIGN: Indicators of mental health service use were regressed on social and economic determinants, family structure variables, and insurance variables, controlling for need as captured by several different symptom scales. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Girls are much less likely to obtain needed treatment for externalizing behavior disorders than are boys, and are somewhat less likely to obtain needed treatment for depression than boys. Middle children are less likely to obtain needed treatment for any mental health problem than are oldest, youngest, or only children. The presence of the father inhibits the likelihood that the child will receive treatment, particularly for depression. African Americans and Latinos are less likely than white children to receive treatment. In contrast to these rich results for the social and demographic determinants of children's specialty mental health utilization, the economic and insurance variables (including maternal education and income) seem to hold little predictive power. CONCLUSIONS: These results argue for interventions to sensitize parents-especially fathers-to the need to pay attention to the mental health needs of their children, in particular girls and middle children. The analysis also suggests that the literature on intrahousehold decision making and on the gender dimensions of investment in children is worth extending to mental health treatment decisions.
12007554	0	a	The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which respondents provided the same answers to a health-related lifestyle questionnaire in self- and interviewer-administered forms. A total of 234 subjects completed a 110-item questionnaire in both interviewer and self-administered forms. Modes of administration were separated by a 2-week interval. The order was determined by random allocation. The presence and the extent of the tendency to give socially acceptable responses were evaluated using percentage of bias calculated as the ratio of the difference in proportion of positive responses or the mean between interviews and questionnaires and those in questionnaires. All percentages of bias were in the positive direction, ranging from 1.4% (physical exercise) to 26.1% (general life stress). The average percentage of bias was higher in women than in men and were stronger for younger respondents. The age differences between interviewer and respondent were inversely and most strongly related to percentage of bias. Self- and interviewer-administered questionnaires yield very similar results in discriminating between subjects, but the interviewer-administered questionnaire showed systematically more desirable responses to questions related to lifestyle factors. The differences in characteristics between interviewer and respondent may be important determinants of the socially desirability bias in the interview.
6701952	1	a	This paper applies the diffusion of innovations model to the study of the birth control discontinuance of first-time users in the Dominican Republic. Two sets of factors are examined: social characteristics of the adopters are used to test Rogers's and Shoemaker's contention that discontinuers have more traditional values than continuers; and the adoption decision process is analyzed to identify the relationship of communication factors to discontinuance. Although number of children and experience of method problems were the major determinants of discontinuance, unfavorable information from friends and other birth control users was a significant factor. Rumor was found to have little effect on a women's decision to continue or discontinue.
17472062	0	a	"Health is an axiological category, which does not possess measurable matter parameters. The problem of health is sometimes raised in families, social circles and institutions. Due to the fact that students of special pedagogy have contacts with school children with health deficits, they have to be fully aware of the fact how significant predicator health is in their own development. The target of this study was to show the output of the research aimed at seeking an answer to the following question: What level of knowledge about health and its determinants in their own perception is presented by the students on the grounds of the educational specialty they have chosen? The research comprised 84 students of 1st, 3rd and 5th years of the faculty of special pedagogy (different specialties) aged from 18 to 24. The research material was collected by an interview questionnaire elaborated by themselves and categorized conversation (""a ladder"") concerning three of the following basic questions: 1) the amount of general knowledge about health they possessed; 2) the amount of their knowledge of factors conditioning a human's state of health; 3) the amount of the awareness of the importance of one's care for his or her own health and for that of others. The output received in the research shows a mean degree of satisfaction of special pedagogy students with the level of their knowledge concerning health. Their statements connected with their self-assessment of that level should make one reflect upon the subject in question."
24896982	1	a	An experimental model was constructed using seven postulates derived from the experimental results of Zayan (1974, 1975a,b,c, 1976). The model specifies the relative importance of several asymmetries in predicting aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus helleri . These asymmetries concern difference between duellists with respect to: prior residence in the tested area (vs intrusion); immediate social experiences of dominance or submission; social isolation; individual familiarity and recognition. The predictions of the general model were checked experimentally and confirmed; a multiple orthogonal regression accounted for about 97% of the variance in our experimental results. The basic experimental results serving as postulates were confirmed and could be generalized; a new synthetic and predictive model was formulated concerning the determinants of aggressive dominance in Xiphophorus .
3788206	1	a	The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.
3222582	1	a	The Childhood Antecedents of Smoking Study (CASS) investigated patterns of cigarette smoking among junior and senior high school students in an upper midwest school district. Four biannual school-based surveys were conducted over two years. A cohort of 72 smokers was identified and followed to determine who continued smoking and who quit. Discriminant analysis was used to study social, psychological, and environmental factors predictive of quitting smoking. Compared to continuing smokers, quitters reported having fewer friends and siblings who smoked, they were less likely to view the cigarette smoker's image as positive, and lived in families where parental involvement with teenagers was high (based on the reports of parents). These results are consistent with the view that social influences are strong determinants of patterns of adolescent smoking behaviour.
7467670	1	a	"The high degree of interindividual variability of processes of aging is mentioned and biographical factors influencing age stage and processes of aging were analyzed. A review of empirical biographical studies is presented, which emphasize a conceptualization of behavior in older age at the interaction of past experience, current situation, and future time perspective of the individual. As an example it is discussed how the mother experiences and reacts to her last child's leaving home (""empty-nest-reaction""). An analysis of the data of the BLSA (1965-1977) demonstrated many patterns of change. It could be shown that there exists consistency as well as variability in personality variables. It could be shown that the biographical and social context was closely related to these interindividual differences in consistency and change. Conditions are multidimensional rather than uniform. This high degree of interindividual variability of change calls for a differential gerontology."
2608821	1	a	"Controversies are commonplace among scientists who endorse different ideas about the determinants of homosexual orientation and their concomitant social and political implications. To measure the relationship between beliefs about the determinants of homosexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuals, we asked 745 respondents in four societies about their beliefs concerning the origins of homosexual orientation. Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that homosexuals are ""born that way"" held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who believed that homosexuals ""choose to be that way"" and/or ""learn to be that way."""
3714667	1	a	Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in different socioeconomic and educational groups in Finland. The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers.
15156843	0	a	Health-related behavior is a function of the sociocultural and environmental contexts in which it occurs. With South Asian immigrants, a comprehensive approach that focuses on community and individual factors may be more effective than an individualistic one. This article explores the factors that may influence HIV/AIDS-related health care seeking by South Asian immigrants to the United States. It focuses on South Asians from Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. The need to involve the community in any intervention process is discussed. An understanding of the determinants of HIV-related health care seeking and behavioral change factors can help social work practitioners develop effective interventions for and with South Asian immigrants.
11584147	0	a	BACKGROUND: This investigation sought to determine how different parenting styles are related to general self-regulatory processes that are linked to alcohol use and abuse. Self-regulation and, more specifically, thoughts of control over drinking are forms of positive self-control mechanisms. Parenting styles are known determinants of both negative and positive self-control mechanisms in offspring. According to social learning theory, stronger relationships between parenting style and self-regulatory processes would be expected from the parent who is the same sex as the respondent. METHODS: A total of 144 female and 107 male college students currently using alcohol were administered a questionnaire on their alcohol use and problems, perceived style of parenting (authoritarian, permissive, or authoritative) of their parents, self-regulation, and perceived control of drinking. A model linking parenting styles, self-regulatory processes, and control over drinking with alcohol use and alcohol problems was tested across sex groups by using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: In general, the parenting style of the parent of the same sex as the respondent's was found to be significantly related to self-regulation, which is known to be protective against alcohol use and abuse. A permissive parent of the same sex as the respondent was negatively associated with good self-regulatory processes for both men and women. Having an authoritative mother was also shown to be related to higher levels of self-regulation for women. CONCLUSIONS: Self-regulation mediated the pathway from a permissive parenting style to perceived drinking control, which, in turn, mediated the pathway from self-regulation to alcohol use and problems. Finally, self-regulation mediated the positive pathway from an authoritative mother to perceived control over drinking for women.

3049068	1	a	This article presents a critique of current models of preventive behavior. It discusses a variety of factors that are usually overlooked-including the appearance of costs and benefits over time, the role of cues to action, the problem of competing life demands, and the ways that actual decision behavior differs from the rational ideal implicit in expectancy-value and utility theories. Such considerations suggest that the adoption of new precautions should be viewed as a dynamic process with many determinants. The framework of a model that is able to accommodate these additional factors is described. This alternative model portrays the precaution adoption process as an orderly sequence of qualitatively different cognitive stages. Data illustrating a few of the suggestions made in the article are presented, and implications for prevention programs are discussed.
2589474	1	a	Data on nutritional intake and patterns of physical growth in the rural Andean community of Nunoa, Peru (elevation 4,000 m), are described and compared to data previously collected from this location. Food consumption data and selected anthropometric measures were obtained from a sample of 33 households. Estimates of caloric intake from this study are very similar to those obtained in Nunoa during the mid- and late 1960s. However, within the present sample, upper income (i.e., middle class) individuals have significantly higher caloric intakes than those of the lower income group and also appear to have an improved diet relative to individuals of 20 years ago. Anthropometric data show that children of the upper socioeconomic status (SES) group are significantly taller and heavier than the lower SES group children. Moreover, the children of the wealthier families are taller and heavier than the children measured 20 years ago at the same location, whereas the poorer children are not. These results indicate that nutritional factors have significantly contributed to the extreme pattern of slow growth previously reported for children of Nunoa and, moreover, demonstrate how social and environmental forces interact to create differential levels of stress that contribute to variation in biological well-being.
7124811	1	a	Social desirability and intellectual limitations were investigated as possible determinants of two response biases--acquiescence and naysaying--among mentally retarded respondents. Results clearly indicated that naysaying and acquiescence occur more frequently among lower IQ individuals and naysaying occurs more frequently concerning prohibited behavior, whereas respondents acquiesce regarding desirable behavior. These results suggest that intellectual limitations predispose people to biased responding, whereas social desirability factors determine the type of bias.
3197680	1	a	The purpose of this investigation was to inquire into the multietiological determinants of psychopathology and social competence in children with epilepsy. The relationship between behavioral functioning as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist and a variety of biological, psychosocial, medication and demographic risk factors was investigated in a sample of 183 children with epilepsy aged 6-16. Several risk factors were found to be related to each behavioral measure. The results are discussed both in terms of their implications for models of psychopathology in epilepsy as well as their relationship to previous findings in the epilepsy/psychopathology field.
3803557	1	a	Rates of teenage pregnancy, birth and abortion vary greatly among states. Because states that have high birthrates tend to have low abortion rates, pregnancy levels vary much less than do the birth and abortion measures. The role of unintended pregnancy is highlighted by the fact that in states that have very high pregnancy rates, the adolescent abortion rate is higher than the birthrate and the abortion rate combined in states that have the lowest pregnancy rates. A series of multivariate analyses that controlled for the percentage of the state population that was black, poor and metropolitan showed that social factors tend to be more important determinants of state differences in teenage pregnancy, birth and abortion levels than are policy-related variables, particularly for whites. Nevertheless, some policy measures have important associations for both races, especially for blacks. Social factors. High rates of population growth and residential mobility over the previous decade, a high crime rate, a high teenage suicide rate, extensive circulation of sexually explicit magazines, a large percentage not voting in elections and a high level of stress are all associated with high pregnancy-related rates for teenagers. The percentage of children living in female-headed households correlates positively with abortion and pregnancy levels among white teenagers, but has no significant association with the birthrate. The percentage of a state's population that belongs to fundamentalist religious groups is positively associated with adolescent birthrates. Political liberalism correlates with relatively low pregnancy rates and birthrates but with a somewhat higher likelihood of pregnancies being terminated by abortion. In states where women's status is higher, birthrates are lower, but abortion levels are higher. Policy measures. States that have high proportions of teenagers dropping out of school and of young women not graduating from high school tend to have high pregnancy rates and birthrates and a somewhat lower proportion of pregnancies ending in abortion. Increased spending on education is associated with relatively high abortion rates (and, therefore, pregnancy rates). The higher the teacher-student ratio, the lower the adolescent birthrate and the more likely the pregnant teenager is to have an abortion. Welfare payments to teenage mothers are negatively associated with both black and white teenage birthrates, and higher maximum payments are associated with relatively high abortion levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
10281815	1	a	The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious.
3354493	1	a	In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking.
6473033	1	a	Personality determinants of characteristic trends in inferred hemispheric utilization were investigated using conjugate lateral eye movement as an index of hemispheric involvement. The Adjective Checklist provided a number of personality and cognitive-style variables. Two independent samples were assessed, a group of 54 undergraduate psychology students and a group of 39 mechanical engineering students. Subjects were classified as predominantly right-, left-, or bidirectional movers. Discriminant analyses significantly separated these groups in terms of checklist scales. Accuracy of classification was 51.9% in the psychology sample and 89.7% in the engineering sample. A bidirectional pattern in eye movement was associated with a more adaptive and well-adjusted personality style than unidirectional consistency.
17661604	0	a	BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months postpartum is promoted internationally as the preferred method of feeding infants. Infants of parents with a history of asthma in particular could benefit from a longer period (6 months) of breastfeeding, because this may reduce the chance of developing an allergic disease. The aim of this study was to identify psychosocial behavioral determinants of the intended duration and actual initiation of breastfeeding in families with a predisposition to asthma. METHODS: This prospective study was part of a randomized trial in which breastfeeding for 6 months was promoted. The 89 women participating completed a breastfeeding questionnaire based on the Attitude-Social Influence-Self-Efficacy model in the second trimester of their pregnancy. This served as the baseline measurement. RESULTS: Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses showed that attitudinal beliefs were significantly associated with the intended duration to breastfeed (p = 0.01) and the intention was the strongest predictor for the actual initiation of breastfeeding (OR: 8.2; 95% CI: 1.5 to 44.3). CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding promotion needs to focus on the health advantages and other advantages of breastfeeding for 6 months, especially in high-risk groups, in order to increase the intention to breastfeed, which appeared to be a strong predictor for actual behavior.
2926701	1	a	This study used a subsample of 543 married couples from a large group of families in Utah, who were originally studied to assess the genetic and environmental determinants of hypertension. Excluding individuals on medication and controlling for the major risk factors for hypertension, evidence was obtained for cross-spouse blood pressure associations equal in magnitude to self-psychosocial and demographic measures. Observed spouse-spouse similarity for blood pressures remained significant after adjustment for shared psychological factors. It is speculated that different aspects of each spouse's nonmarital environments (e.g. work, social support) have differential impacts on the marital environment and on physiologic indicators of health.

3244671	1	a	The relationship between serum alpha-tocopherol level and many of its possible determinants was studied in 1,373 cancer-free Finnish men and women age 40-79 years. Dietary data were available from a subsample of 301 persons. The mean alpha-tocopherol level in the serum samples stored at -20 degrees C was 8.6 mg/liter among men and 10.5 mg/liter among women. Intake of margarine, vegetable oils, and green vegetables predicted the serum level of alpha-tocopherol. Altogether six food groups accounted for about 10% of the variation. The levels also varied with age, geographical area, type of population, occupation, socioeconomic status, and marital status. They were positively correlated with serum cholesterol and serum vitamin A in both sexes, and with body mass index and serum selenium in men. Altogether these variables accounted for over 40% of the variation in alpha-tocopherol levels. The level of serum alpha-tocopherol, which is associated with the dietary intake of vitamin E, is dependent upon living conditions.
19583043	0	a	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between cognitive and behavioural factors of preadolescents and those of their mothers, assessed in terms of self-efficacy beliefs and toothbrushing among Turkish and Finnish population in the framework of Social Cognitive Theory. The specific objective was to test if this possible association worked regardless of cultural differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires for Finnish (n = 338) and Turkish (n = 611) pre-adolescents and their mothers were used to collect the information on cognitive (pre-adolescent and maternal self-efficacy) and behavioural factors (toothbrushing frequencies). RESULTS: Turkish mothers and pre-adolescents reported lower levels of self-efficacy and toothbrushing than did their Finnish counterparts (P < 0.005). Finnish pre-adolescents reporting high self-efficacy were more likely to have mothers with high levels of self-efficacy (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.16 to 3.93), (P = 0.014). Similar positive associations emerged between Turkish (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.70 to 3.52), (P = 0.001) and Finnish (OR = 6.76, 95% CI = 2.21 to 20.65), (P = 0.001) pre-adolescent self-efficacy and maternal recommended (twice daily) level of toothbrushing behaviour. For pre-adolescents' toothbrushing, their own self-efficacy was the common explanatory variable. Binary logistic regression models revealed that the maternal toothbrushing accounted for the Turkish pre-adolescents' toothbrushing behaviour, whereas maternal self-efficacy did so for the Finnish pre-adolescents' (P < 0.001) toothbrushing behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the need for integration of pre-adolescent self-efficacy and maternal cognition and behaviour into oral health intervention programmes because of their relation to recommended toothbrushing behaviour among pre-adolescents, regardless of cultural differences. These findings seem to fit with the Social Cognitive Theory, which emphasises the significance of cultural factors and cognition as the determinants of behaviour.
6723941	1	a	As the number of Canadian women who have had induced abortions increases with each succeeding year, the number at risk--and the actual incidence--of repeat abortion also increases. Some researchers have argued that women who have more than one induced abortion are less well adjusted, others that they are less willing to use contraceptives, perhaps because of anxiety about sexuality. Still others have suggested that repeat abortion is unrelated to the psychology or attitudes of individual women, but rather is an inevitable result of imperfect contraceptives, imperfect contraceptive practice and the availability of legal abortion for the termination of unwanted pregnancies. A group of 580 women seeking abortions were interviewed at the Montreal General Hospital and given a number of psychological tests. About one in five of these women were having repeat abortions. The women having repeat abortions were older, less likely to be married and more tolerant of legal abortion than were women having their first abortions. They also had intercourse more frequently than the first-abortion patients. Women obtaining a repeat abortion were slightly more likely to have been using contraceptives at the time they became pregnant, but they did not differ from first-abortion patients in the types of methods that they used. On no other social or demographic characteristics, measures of psychological adjustment or attitudes about sexuality were there any important differences between the groups. A more complex statistical analysis reveals that the two most important factors differentiating first-abortion and repeat-abortion patients are age and coital frequency--both of which are variables that reflect added exposure to the risk of unintended pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15627221	0	a	BACKGROUND: Social context (demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and sociopolitical features of the environment) influences the epidemiology and consequences of individual behaviors that affect health outcomes. This article examines the role of social context in heterosexual networks that facilitate the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), particularly in relation to persistent racial disparities in rates of STIs in the United States. METHODS: Review of the medical, public health, and social science literature. RESULTS: Contextual factors, such as poverty, discrimination, epidemiology of illicit drug use in the community, ratio of men to women, incarceration rates, and racial segregation, influence sexual behavior and sexual networks directly and indirectly through a variety of mechanisms. Disparities in these contextual features likely contribute substantially to the persistence of marked racial disparities in rates of STIs. CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of contextual factors and the sharply contrasting social contexts for blacks and whites, exclusive emphasis on individual risk factors and determinants is unlikely to produce solutions that will significantly decrease HIV rates among blacks. Effective HIV prevention in this population will require multidisciplinary research to address the contextual factors that promote patterns of sexual networks that facilitate transmission of STIs.
2700144	1	a	Sexual and marital relationships change throughout marriage and the transition to parenthood can be seen as a psychosocial crisis. Recent studies do not support the finding of Masters and Johnson (1966) that there is a mid-trimester rise in sexual responsiveness. Sexual behaviour decreases towards the end of pregnancy and a number of studies have found that in the majority of mothers there is only a slow return to pre-pregnancy levels in the first postnatal year. Some of the factors influencing the rate of return are discussed. Breast-feeding is important because of the hormonal changes it produces and it has been said to stimulate sexual feelings in both mother and baby. There is some evidence that breast-feeding has an adverse effect on sexuality in the first postnatal year. It is not clear whether this could be related to differences in hormone levels or differences in feeding behaviour. Fatigue and contraception have largely been ignored in studies of factors influencing postnatal sexual behaviour. Women who went on to breast-feed were found to be very similar on antenatal measures of sexual behaviour to those who went on to bottle-feed. The method of feeding is the major influence on the hormonal status, and the experience of painful intercourse reported by breast-feeding mothers may be related to low oestrogen levels. Breast-feeding persistence is influenced by both social and psychological factors and its effect on sexual behaviour is discussed.
3975667	1	a	Attitudes of medical students towards the psychosocial aspects of illness is of serious concern to medical educators. It is thought that medical students are overwhelmingly disease-oriented and not sufficiently sensitive to the role of the psychological, emotional, sociological and economic factors in the etiology and management of illness. In the present study the ATSIM (Attitudes Towards Social Issues in Medicine) was presented to third year medical students and compared with their responses obtained 2 years previously when they were first year students. The data suggest that third year medical students have positive attitudes towards certain psychosocial issues (the importance of social factors as determinants of health or illness, the role of preventive medicine in maintaining health, the role of physician-patient interactions in patient care). These attitudes were positive during the students' first year and have been maintained during the course of medical school. These finding are contrary to previous studies which indicate a deterioration in attitudes during the course of medical school.
11594699	0	a	This is a study of psychosocial outcomes of adolescents born to teenage mothers. Adolescents'problem behaviors, psychological well-being, social support, school variables, and sexual behaviors are compared across three groups- those born to mothers 17 or younger, mothers 18-19 years old, and mothers 20 or older. Analyses from two samples of African American adolescents from Maryland (n = 205) and Michigan (n = 570) are reported. The results from both samples indicate that mother's age at birth is unrelated to adolescents' psychosocial outcomes. These two studies add to the limited number of analyses that examine adolescent outcomes for children of teen mothers. The results suggest that efforts to understand social structural determinants of healthy and problematic adolescent development may be more informative than examining the effects of mother's age. They also suggest that teen pregnancy prevention programs may be more effective if they are part of a larger prevention strategy that incorporates social structural change efforts and not only a focus on individual level change.
15629682	0	a	Accidental drug overdose continues to be a substantial cause of mortality for drug users. Characteristics of the neighborhood built environment may be important determinants of the likelihood of drug overdose mortality independent of individual-level factors. Using data from the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, we conducted a multilevel case control study using data on accidental overdose deaths as cases and non-overdose accidental deaths as controls. We used archival data from the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey and the Mayor's Office of Operations to assess characteristics of neighborhood external (e.g. dilapidation of buildings) and internal (e.g. quality of utilities in houses) built environment. Multilevel analyses were used to assess the relations between the neighborhood built environment and the likelihood of overdose death. Six out of the eight characteristics of the external environment studied and three out of the six characteristics of the internal environment studied were significantly associated with the likelihood of fatal drug overdose in multilevel models after adjusting for individual-level (age, race, sex) and neighborhood-level (income, drug use) variables. Deterioration of the built environment, particularly the external environment, is associated with an increased likelihood of fatal accidental drug overdose. Disinvestment in social resources, psychosocial stressors, neighborhood differences in response to a witnessed overdose, and differences in vulnerability to the adverse consequences of drug use in different neighborhoods may explain the observed associations.
3916715	1	a	Health promotion has become an official health policy of this country, and it is being pursued through efforts to change individuals' health-related behavior. This approach is based on the assumption that it is in fact an individual's behavior that most directly determines his or her health status. But how good is the evidence that supports this assumption? Specifically, is the evidence sufficient for this assumption to outweigh the long-standing finding that social and economic conditions have a strong relationship to health status? The major support for the behavior approach derives from the coronary heart disease risk-factor studies and the Alameda County Study. In a series of reports over time, the relationship between individuals' health practices and their health status generally, as well as that between heart disease and cancer specifically, have been established by these studies. These observations, however, have not been confirmed when deliberate efforts have been made to change those practices. The evidence in support of the importance of social and economic conditions to health status has been documented through a long series of studies in this country, which have found a direct relationship between individuals' socioeconomic status and their health status. This relationship, however, has not in this country been tested by intervention. Only a few studies have examined the interrelationship between these two approaches to health promotion, but the evidence to date has failed to suggest that either one is the mediator of the other. We must, therefore, conclude that pursuing a policy of health promotion based on either approach to the exclusion of the other would indeed be short-sighted health policy.
12601262	0	a	The present study investigated work-related determinants of return to work. Our hypothesis was based on the strain hypothesis of the Demand-Control-Support model, which postulates a relation between job demands, job control and support at work on the one hand, and the aetiology of health complaints on the other hand. High demands were hypothesized to obstruct return to work, whereas high control and high support were thought to have a positive effect on return to work. This hypothesis was tested in a population of employees who were sick-listed for 6-8 weeks. Return to work, as operationalized by the categories (i) not working; (ii) return to work with adjustments; and (iii) full return to work, was determined 4 months after the onset of the sick leave. The hypothesis was tested by logistic regression analyses. High job demands were the least predictive of full return to work. However, the likelihood of employees with high job demands returning to work with adjustments was higher than the likelihood of them not working. Therefore, job demands might also work as a pressure to return to work (compare this with Smulders and Nijhuis, 1999). Furthermore, high skill discretion in combination with high job demands predicted working with adjustments in comparison with not working. Finally, high supervisor support was the most predictive of return to work without adjustments, and the least predictive of not working.
3992291	1	a	The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed.
19553025	0	a	Socioeconomic determinants of injury have been associated with risk of burn in the UK and USA, but the relative significance of this impact is largely unknown across Canadian populations. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to risk of burn in the province of British Columbia (BC) and identify the extent to which these findings are generalizable across both urban and rural population groups. Measures of SES were based on province-wide comparisons using data obtained from the Canada Census using the Vancouver Area Neighbourhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX). Results illustrate that the effects of SES and increased injury risk are substantial, though the most pronounced variations were exhibited across each SES stratum for urban areas and with less demonstrable effect when itemized by injury type within rural areas. Although conservative, the results from this study illustrate that burns disproportionately affect populations of greater relative socioeconomic disadvantage and continued efforts to also address social inequities and their link to injury incidence is likely to be more effective than targeting individual behavior alone when trying to reduce and eliminate their occurrence.
19821997	0	a	BACKGROUND: With African health-care systems facing exploding demand for HIV care, reliable methods for assessing adherence and its influencing factors are needed to guide effective public-health measures. This study evaluated individual patient characteristics determining antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and the predictive values of different measures of adherence on virological treatment failure in a cohort of patients in a routine-care setting in Cameroon. METHODS: Longitudinal study over 6-months following ART introduction, using patients questionnaires and hospital and pharmacy records. RESULTS: At the end of the 6 months study period, 219 of 312 patients (70%) returned to the pharmacy to refill their medication, 17% (51) were lost to follow-up, 9% (28) were dead and 4% (14) were transferred to other care centres. Virological treatment failure at 6 months was experienced by 26 patients, representing 13% of patients with available viral load value. Pharmacy refill irregularity was the most powerful predictor (odds ratio 12.4; P < 0.001) of virological treatment failure, compared with CD4 cell count increase at 6 months (odds ratio 7.8; P = 0.002) or self-reported adherence at one month (odds ratio 1.1; P = 0.85). Low intensity of ART side-effects after one month was strongly associated with survival (odds ratio 0.11; P = 0.001). Patients starting ART with CD4 cell count <100 cells/mm3 had a greater risk of dying during the follow-up period (odds ratio 2.69; P = 0.02). Compared with asymptomatic CDC stage A patients, CDC stage B (odds ratio 5.72) and CDC stage C patients (odds ratio 16.9) had higher risk of becoming lost to follow-up (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analyses, pharmacy non-adherence was less frequent in women (adjusted odds ratio 0.56; P = 0.05) but more frequent in patients with high monthly income (odds ratio 3.24; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Pharmacy-refill adherence might be considered as an alternative to CD4 count monitoring for identification of patients at risk of virological failure, especially in resources-scarce countries. The study confirmed the difficulty in demonstrating clear associations of individual patient factors and treatment outcomes. The substantial loss to follow-up and deaths occurring within 6 months after initiating ART emphasise the need to understand the best timing of ART initiation and further elucidate and educate on the underlying reasons for delaying initiation of ART in resource-limited countries.
16297230	0	a	Experts contend that weather and climate forecasts could have an important role in risk management strategies for community water systems. Yet, most water managers make minimal use of these forecasts. This research explores the determinants of the use of weather and climate forecasts by surveying managers of community water systems in two eastern American states (South Carolina and the Susquehanna River Basin of Pennsylvania). Assessments of the reliability of weather and climate forecasts are not driving their use as water managers who find forecasts reliable are no more likely to use them than are managers who find them unreliable. Although larger systems and those depending on surface water are more likely to use forecasts for some (but not all) purposes, the strongest determinant of forecast use is risk perceptions. Water managers who expect to face problems from weather events in the next decade are much more likely to use forecasts than are water managers who expect few problems. Their expectations of future problems are closely linked with past experience: water managers who have had problems with specific types of weather events (e.g., flood emergencies) in the last 5 years are likely to expect to experience problems in the next decade. Feeling at risk, regardless of the specific source of that weather-related risk, stimulates a decision to use weather and climate forecasts.
15578812	0	a	AIM: To examine infant growth characteristics and their socio-demographic determinants in Severodvinsk, northwest Russia. METHODS: Length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length Z-scores of 1,067 infants born in 1999-2000 in Severodvinsk were calculated on the basis of the data on the length and weight obtained from the medical files. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate independent effects of maternal age, education, occupation, marital status, weight, parity, sex of the baby, and breastfeeding duration on infant growth. RESULTS: At the age of 12 months, 1.1% of the infants were stunted, 1.1% underweight, and 0.5% wasted in comparison with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 reference population. The mean Z-scores for length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length were 0.48+/-0.93, 0.38+/-1.04, and 0.65+/-1.03, respectively. Mean weight-for-length Z-scores considerably increased from birth to 12 months, while length-for-age Z-score remained largely unchanged. In regression analysis, length-for-age Z-scores were lower by 0.43 (p=0.028) and by 0.30 (p<0.001) in infants born to mothers with basic and unknown education, respectively. Positive trends between linear growth and maternal age (p=0.027) and education (p=0.024) were observed. No social variations in weight-for-length Z-scores were found. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting were lower than previously reported from Russia, which may reflect good overall socio-economic conditions in the town. Social variations in linear growth indicate the existence of inequalities in infant health, which may further increase with age.
18665062	0	a	STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study presents a case analysis of how 3 urban medical centers with differing ownership models, within 1 metropolitan area, ration access to uncompensated care to uninsured patients. METHODS: Data was triangulated from 3 sources: hospital financial reports by service line for a fiscal year, a survey of 292 self-pay patients, and the self-pay policies and practices of clerical personnel described in a previous publication. RESULTS: Although the public, for-profit and not-for-profit institutions used different strategies for managing self-pays, there were also commonalities in the experiences indigent patients reported. The public institution provided the broadest access to the largest percentage of self-pay patients but offset the burden with the most successful prepayment and collection practices. The for-profit site obeyed federal regulations mandating emergency care but severely curtailed other services, and the not-for-profit limited assess (but not to the extent of the for-profit) and pursued collection (but not to the extent of the public). At all sites, actual practices by clerical staff often diverged from institutions' written self-pay policies. The probability of being turned away because of inability to pay ranged from 0% to 40% with front line personnel exercising considerable discretion on a case-by-case basis. CONCLUSIONS: Large institutional providers balance their particular social and legal obligations with strategies to limit access and optimize prepayment and collection. Stated policies generally do not reflect the practices of personnel. Uninsured patients are forced to navigate a capricious system that manages them as a liability rather than as a legitimate client.
19608320	0	a	Research shows that interprofessional collaboration has become an important factor in the implementation of effective healthcare models. To date, the literature has not focused on the collaboration between medical doctors and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) healthcare practitioners, an example of interdisciplinary collaboration called integrative healthcare (IHC). Drawing on in-depth, semi-standardized interviews conducted with 21 practitioners working in Canadian IHC clinics, this paper explored and interpreted how IHC is experienced by those working in Canadian IHC clinics. The interview questions and analysis were guided by the Input, Process, Output conceptual framework drawn from the organizational management theory (McGrath, J. E. (1964). Social psychology: A brief introduction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.) to study collaboration within teams. We found that constructs contributing to collaboration included practitioners' attitudes and educational background, as well as external factors such as the healthcare system and financial pressures. Major processes affecting collaboration included communication, patient referral and power relationships. These determinants of collaboration were found to result in learning opportunities for practitioners, modified burden of work and ultimately, higher affective commitment toward the clinic. These constructs serve as a guide for further investigation of interprofessional collaboration within an IHC clinic. This exploration of interprofessional collaboration in IHC identified a broad array of key factors associated with interprofessional collaboration. These factors are critical to better understand the functioning of IHC clinics, and provide guidance for creation or maintenance of successful clinics.
3585703	1	a	This study examined personal and contextual predictors of active and avoidance coping strategies in a community sample of over 400 adults and in a sample of over 400 persons entering psychiatric treatment for unipolar depression. Sociodemographic factors of education and income (except for active-cognitive coping), personality dispositions of self-confidence and an easy-going manner, and contextual factors of negative life events and family support each made a significant incremental contribution to predicting active and avoidance coping. Among both healthy adults and patients, active and avoidance coping were positively associated with negative life events. Individuals who had more personal and environmental resources were more likely to rely on active coping and less likely to use avoidance coping. Moreover, for both groups, most of the predictors continued to show significant relations with active and avoidance coping strategies even after the stable component in coping was controlled in a longitudinal design. A comprehensive framework to understand the determinants of coping can be of practical value in suggesting points for therapeutic interventions aimed at fostering more adaptive coping efforts.
7372385	1	a	This paper focuses on the position of the nurse in the division of labor in health care and the occupational strategies British hospital nurses have adopted in response to their changing employement situation. The authors suggest a Marxist framework as an alternative to current approaches to the study of occupational strategy, which tend to focus on the level of distribution relations. An adequate analysis of the situation of hospital nurses, the paper suggests, depends upon locating the occupation within the wider setting of the mode of control and delivery of health care. The central feature of this setting is the dominance of medicine and medical technology, and the main factors shaping it are the activities of individual capitalists involved in the health industry and the State operating within the constraints of capital in general and within the context of class struggle. It is suggested that the characteristic feature of nurses' occupational strategy--the vacillation between professionalism and unionism--can best be understood in relation to the changing mode of control and delivery of health care and nurses' contradictory position within the social relations that constitute that mode.
2489986	1	a	Because of the importance of contraceptive behaviour in most societies today a better understanding is needed of the social and behavioural factors affecting contraceptive decisions and choices of individuals and couples. This paper examines the need for longitudinal, theoretically-based studies of contraceptive use dynamics, including the timing, duration and interaction of reproductive events which may be more important than contraceptive technology in the social, cultural and economic context of fertility control. New research methods and appropriate analysis of data are relevant. Consideration of the social context is essential for the formulation and implementation of effective policies relating to the provision of contraceptive services.
11525391	0	a	The present article reviews research about the psychological determinants of human eating behavior. A hypothetical model of food choice and intake is introduced, presenting various factors influencing eating behavior. Internal factors include sensory food aspects. Among the external factors are information, the social context and the physical environment. Processes such as mere exposure, Pavlovian conditioning and social learning shape the relationships between these factors, food liking and eating behavior. The relative contribution of the various determinants is discussed. In spite of a scarcity of studies, liking for the sensory aspects of food seems to be at the center of the development, maintenance and change of dietary patterns. Consequently, efforts for promoting healthy eating behavior might benefit from an increased attention towards learning principles and food likes in the development of interventions. Existing intervention strategies are criticized and preliminary suggestions are formulated to enhance their effectiveness.
3669671	1	a	Analysis of data from a survey of employed adults in Detroit indicates that frequency of intoxication is associated with a masculine self-orientation among men and a feminine self-orientation among women during alcohol use. The study calls attention to the importance of fathers' drinking, life events, social class relations and a generalized alienation from self, work and society for understanding frequency of intoxication and masculine and feminine orientations during alcohol use. A path analysis suggests that the men and women who become intoxicated may regain a sense of self and relationships to others that they do not have in sober everyday life. Implications for future research on heavy drinking and self-orientations during alcohol use are discussed.
3720261	1	a	These case histories illustrate how medical, psychosocial, cultural and economic factors affect the elderly with chronic arthritis. Physicians need to be aware of their patient's attitudes, concerns, support systems and goals resulting from a lifetime of experience, to provide the most appropriate and effective care. 'Images of future are usually only caricatures of the present' (Starr, 1982), but based on current demography, one can predict trends for the future. It is likely that the elderly of the future will be better off financially, better educated, healthier, more politically connected and strident, but their social support systems will be less effective. The last stems from trends such as declining birth rate, an increasingly mobile society, diminished importance of the nuclear family, and the diminishing attractiveness of professions involved with providing maintenance care. This suggests that the physician and nurse, being the primary gatekeepers for the care of and services for the elderly, must be even more attentive to the non-biological determinants of arthritis disability.
19628619	0	a	The term 'social vaccine' is designed to encourage the biomedically orientated health sector to recognize the legitimacy of action on the distal social and economic determinants of health. It is proposed as a term to assist the health promotion movement in arguing for a social view of health which is so often counter to medical and popular conceptions of health. The idea of a social vaccine builds on a long tradition in social medicine as well as on a biomedical tradition of preventing illness through vaccines that protect against disease. Social vaccines would be promoted as a means to encourage popular mobilization and advocacy to change the social and economic structural conditions that render people and communities vulnerable to disease. They would facilitate social and political processes that develop popular and political will to protect and promote health through action (especially governments prepared to intervene and regulate to protect community health) on the social and economic determinants. Examples provided for the effects of social vaccines are: restoring land ownership to Indigenous peoples, regulating the advertising of harmful products and progressive taxation for universal social protection. Social vaccines require more research to improve understanding of social and political processes that are likely to improve health equity worldwide. The vaccine metaphor should be helpful in arguing for increased action on the social determinants of health.
3399999	1	a	Theoretical consideration of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) suggests that the key determinants of transmission dynamics are the duration of infectiousness and the extent to which subgroups in the population interact sexually. We used two empirical correlates to represent these concepts: (1) the force of infectivity, calculated by summing all the days of potential infectivity (the time between last sexual exposure and treatment of the contact) generated by a given case, and then summing the days for all cases within a given subgroup; (2) self-selection, representing the observed probability that members of a given subgroup select sexual partners from within their own group. Using data gathered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, we estimated that a single group i.e., black, male, heterosexual, military personnel residing in the core areas, generated 27% of the force of infectivity. Subgroups that select greater than 50% of their sexual partners from outside their sociodemographic boundaries generated a rate for the force of infectivity that was 4.5 times higher than the rate for self-selectors. These findings confirm the core group theory and suggest strategies for control of STD.
15239775	0	a	Terms such as 'molecular epidemiology' and 'genetic epidemiology' have been coined to depict the change from 'traditional epidemiology', concerned with disease determinants at the community or society level, over to 'modern epidemiology', which is concerned with determinants operating at the individual level or even below, i.e. at the organ, tissue, cell, or molecular level. In this commentary, we point out to the limitations of this development and suggest that more emphasis is placed on making the presumed causal disease models explicit, when investigating the relationship between putative determinants and disease. Understanding the disease processes at the micro-level is insufficient for understanding disease at the individual level; and disease patterns at the population level cannot be understood unless it is realized that individuals exist in a variety of contexts that cannot be reduced to individual attributes.
15081204	0	a	This new study goes beyond the well-established correlation between mortality differentials and occupational status, to focus on the impact of professional careers on mortality risk. It shows heterogeneity in the mortality risks within occupational classes, strongly related to the type of occupational moves experienced. The occupational data are taken from the French longitudinal census sample-using 1968 and 1975 census records-and mortality risks are estimated over the 1975-1980 period, for both occupational classes and pathways between classes. Results show a close relationship between occupational mobility and mortality. For men, favorable occupational moves-e.g. from clerks to upper class-put them less at risk of mortality than their counterparts who remained in their class. An inverse relationship is found for unfavorable moves. In most cases, the mortality risks of the movers are in between the risks in the class left and in the class joined. Similar patterns apply to specific groups of women only (upper classes, manual workers, clerks) for which occupational moves are probably driven, as for most men, by mortality related determinants (level of education, qualifications, health, etc.). The findings strongly support the use of a dynamic approach, based on individuals' experiences, to improve our understanding of mortality differentials.
6128936	1	a	"The research, upon which this article is based is part of a program on ""Social Integration"" sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation. A sample of 4500 persons aged more than 59 years were interviewed in 1978. The theoretical approach was to identify the elements of successful aging under the conditions of swiss society, which are: the quality and degrees of independence and self determination of personality, continuity of the manner of living and adequate handling of the changing conditions of life in the third age including physical, mental, communicational and economic mutations. To reach this goal the survey measured the socio-economic conditions of the investigated population, their psycho-physical ability, how old people compensate deficits: the conditions essential for life, integration in leisure, private contacts, public opinions and political participation. The results show that a great majority is satisfied with the conditions of dwelling, occupation and economic conditions. But in all dimensions of life we also found minorities oppressed, threatened or deprived. Psycho-physical fitness proved to be in good state for a great majority and only a few percent were in a physical or mental condition which did not grant them independence and self-determination. This diagnosis was assisted by the results of two newly developed tests for meaning ability."
7031748	1	a	Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes.
17307053	0	a	Type 2 diabetes mellitus confers an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), in part owing to the effects of the metabolic syndrome, a clustering of risk factors that often accompanies the diabetic state. It is likely that the combination of hypertension, diabetic dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance produces an enhanced, atherogenic environment within the circulation. In keeping with a multifactorial approach to CVD risk reduction, intensive glycemic control could hypothetically have multiple beneficial effects on the metabolic and macrovascular systems of the patient with type 2 diabetes. When considering risk factor modification in this population, it is important to consider both the biological mechanisms of disease and the social determinants that contribute to disparities in health.
2773911	1	a	"This study investigates the association of wartime stress variables and coronary artery disease as determined by coronary angiography in Lebanon in 1986, a country with an ongoing civil war for over a decade. A total of 127 patients who underwent coronary angiography at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were individually matched on age and sex with visitor controls free from any evidence of clinical coronary artery disease. Arteriographic cases (greater than or equal to 70% maximal stenosis) were compared with two control groups: arteriographic controls (entirely normal coronaries) and visitor controls. Findings suggest that there is a relation between exposure to both acute and chronic war events and coronary artery disease in this patient population. The reporting of exposure to acute war events was significantly higher in cases compared with both visitor controls (odds ratio (OR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.17-4.90) and arteriographic controls (OR = 2.8, 95% Cl 0.93-8.47). Crossing the ""green-lines"" that separate two belligerent sides, considered as an attribute of war-related chronic stress, was more frequent in cases compared with visitor controls (OR = 3.25, 95% Cl 1.54-6.89) and arteriographic controls (OR = 5.38, 95% Cl 1.65-17.6). The relation observed between wartime stress and coronary artery disease could not be explained by possible overreporting of stressful events in patients with suspected coronary artery disease or by an increase in clinical awareness for the disease for those under continuous stress. Adjusting for the effect of the well-established coronary artery disease risk factors did not alter the above findings."
18833350	0	a	"As we have seen a global increase in asthma in the past three decades it has also become clear that it is a socially patterned disease, based on demographic and socioeconomic indicators clustered by areas of residence. This trend is not readily explained by traditional genetic paradigms or physical environmental exposures when considered alone. This has led to consideration of the interplay among physical and psychosocial environmental hazards and the molecular and genetic determinants of risk (i.e., biomedical framing) within the broader socioenvironmental context including socioeconomic position as an upstream ""cause of the causes"" (i.e., ecological framing). Transdisciplinary research strategies or programs that embrace this complexity through a shared conceptual framework that integrates diverse discipline-specific theories, models, measures, and analytical methods into ongoing asthma research may contribute most significantly toward furthering our understanding of socially patterned disease. This paper provides an overview of a multilevel, multimethod longitudinal study, the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment and Social Stress (ACCESS), as a case study to exemplify both the opportunities and challenges of transdisciplinary research on urban asthma expression in the United States."
2694206	1	a	In recent developmental and psychosomatic studies the focus shifts from pathogenic to health protective factors. Literature on coping with daily stresses, life events and biographic determinants is reviewed. Despite conceptual (negative health definitions, divergent theoretical backgrounds and values) and methodological problems (reliance on self-report and trait measurement) moderate, however consistent health protective affects of personal resources are shown. These are mainly generalized attitudes of persons toward self and their environment (e.g. optimism, internal locus of control, self-efficacy, commitment). Contrasting influential concepts (sense of coherence, hardiness) the bias toward self-reliant, internal control as health protective resource is criticized and a plea is made for conjoint consideration of health-protective influences of social relationships.
19769587	0	a	Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 has been shown to suppress the growth of a wide range of microbial plant pathogens as well as invertebrate pests such as root nematodes. Hydrogen cyanide, a secondary metabolite produced by the bacterium, has been credited as being one of the determinants of its biocontrol ability. The use of biocontrol agents against social insect pests such as termite Odontotermes obesus has limitations because of behavioural adaptations that include (1) removal of the pathogen when grooming by the termites and (2) isolation of infested members of the colony. In this study, we show that cyanide of bacterial origin may inhibit cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) of the termite respiratory chain and demonstrate that HCN-producing bacteria such as P. fluorescens can actually kill a macroscopic insect pest by cyanide poisoning. This ability of pseudomonad metabolites such as cyanide, which can bring about pest death by blocking respiration through inhibition of CCO rather than infection or predation, can potentially overcome the behavioural adaptations of social insect pests such as termites and represents an attractive option for insect pest management.
2916712	1	a	The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.
7143281	1	a	Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae. Aspects of coping problems, primarily the disease-related, but also those of intra- and inter-personal nature are discussed.
2801628	1	a	Ethics code books provide only general guidelines and are inadequate in resolving explicit ethical dilemmas that frequently occur in community intervention. Ethical choices often reflect personal values as well as professional role proscriptions and are difficult to resolve for a number of reasons. It often is not clear to whom the interventionist should be accountable, or what the long-range impact may be of specific programs that seem to have short-term benefit. Value clashes can occur between consultants and consultees, even when both groups believe that they represent the best interests of vulnerable client groups. Since personal values are important determinants of ethical choices, whenever possible, they should be communicated openly so community groups can understand the interventionist's values before community projects begin. It also is important to share ethical dilemmas with professional colleagues in order to provide community psychologists with constructive feedback from their professional peers, and to help others anticipate similar value conflicts in their own work. These points are illustrated by discussion of the vignettes presented by O'Neill (1989) and by additional examples drawn from my own experience.
12471853	0	a	I examine racial differences in child stunting in mid-1990s South Africa and Brazil, two multiracial societies with different histories of legal support for racial discrimination. Using data from nationally representative household samples linked to community-level measures, the analysis shows that racial inequality in the distribution of socioeconomic resources across households and communities explains much of the racial difference in stunting in both countries. Even after these factors are controlled, however, the results indicate that in South Africa, nonwhite children are still at greater risk of growth faltering than are white children. The nature of socioeconomic and racial differences in children's growth is examined, and major determinants are discussed. These findings suggest that although state-sanctioned racism may help to explain the greater racial inequality in stunting in South Africa than in Brazil, the eradication of a disadvantage for nonwhites will depend on changes in the same fundamental socioeconomic inequalities that characterize both nations.

Most of those infected never fall ill, but individuals who do can recover if they have access to effective therapies. This paper discusses certain ethical and ethnographic issues raised by cases in which patients are infected with M. tuberculosis strains resistant to at least the two most powerful drugs on which therapy is usually based. In most poor countries, people with such multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were, until very recently, considered ""untreatable."" In addition to being consigned to a permanent state of ill health, they were also at risk of transmitting their resistant strain to others. In this paper we discuss the logic of ""cost-effectiveness,"" which international health policy-makers utilized to make the case that treatment of MDR-TB is not feasible in resource poor settings. These analyses, which have held sway in public health policy for many years, are flawed, we argue, because they ignore and conceal the social determinants of access to health services and often rely on assumptions rather than evidence. We propose that policies based solely on analyses of cost-effectiveness of specific interventions for individual settings can be short-sighted and, because they do not pay sufficient attention to the social, political, economic, epidemiological and pathophysiological factors influencing the production of health, will ultimately hinder progress toward effective global TB control."
6738684	1	a	Food behaviour involves the totality of the actions of man which aim at satisfying his nutritional need. It is based on psychical reflection, decision and assessment processes. Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance.
18390066	0	a	Breast cancer, the commonest malignancy in women, is now the most common cancer in Nigeria, but little is known about the quality of life (QOL) of Nigerian women breast cancer survivors and the predictive factors that may influence their QOL. Health-related QOL (HRQOL) was evaluated in 35 Nigerian women receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer at the University College Hospital, Ibadan by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ - C30 version 3). Linear regression procedures were used to evaluate the association of HRQOL outcomes with medical and socio-demographic factors. Physical functioning (PF), Emotional functioning (EF) and Cognitive functioning (CF) scores were above average (76.9 +/- 20.6, 61.9 +/- 30.3 and 60.0 +/- 32.1 respectively) while Role functioning (RF) and Social functioning (SF) scores were below average (46.2 +/- 36.6 and 40.9 +/- 42.8 respectively). High symptom scale scores were recorded for fatigue, pain and financial difficulties (52.7 +/- 32.8, 59.1 +/- 34.4 and 71.4 +/- 38.8 respectively). Age had no significant influence on any of the functional and symptom scale scores as well as the overall QOL. The overall QOL was significantly related to PF, CF and SF. It was also significantly and inversely related to the scores of fatigue, nausea and vomitng, pain, insomnia and financial difficulty. The findings of this study provide important information on QOL and their correlates among Nigerian women undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer and are helpful in developing treatment strategies accordingly.
3701582	1	a	Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors.
6644542	1	a	Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition.
12282631	1	a	This paper reviews recent new trends in population structure in the world and its major regions in order to access the determinants of those trends and explore issues regarding the recent and projected changes in the age structure of population and the relationships of those changes to social and economic development. In particular, the paper compares the change in age structure projected by the Population Division of the UN Secretariat in its most recent 3 series--namely, those completed in 1984, 1986, and 1988. By and large, the most recent UN assessment projects that a larger proportion of the world population will be aged 60 and over in 2000 and 2025 than was previously estimated. Those changes in projections can be observed for the world and for the more developed countries as a whole, and for the regions of Africa, Latin America, Northern America, East Asia, Europe, and Oceania. While the recommendations of the International Conference on Population called attention to the importance of changes in population structure, this paper recommends urgent government action in planning social programs for the aged because of the greater eminence of population aging in many settings. The case of Japan is used to illustrate the growing importance of increases in life expectancy as a determinant of age structure changes (in relation to fertility decline), a point that is reinforced through a cruder decomposition of UN estimates and projections for several European countries.
19803115	0	a	This study assesses the importance of customer-contact intensity at the service encounter level as a determinant of service quality assessments. Using data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, it shows that performance-driven human resources practices play an important role as determinants of employee customer orientation and service capability in both high-contact (outpatient healthcare) and low-contact (benefits claim processing) human service contexts. However, there existed significant differences across service delivery settings in the salience of customer orientation and the congruence between employee and customer perceptions of service quality, depending on the intensity of customer contact. In both contexts, managerial attention to high-performance work systems and customer-orientation has the potential to favorably impact perceptions of service quality, amplify consumer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency.
2925863	1	a	Social support, family functioning, self-perceptions of appearance, school, behavior, athletics, and social competence, as well as daily hassles/microstressors, were investigated as determinants of general self-esteem in 41 children with congenital/acquired limb deficiencies. Classmate, parent, teacher, and friend social support all were significant predictors of self-esteem. Family conflict and organization were also significantly associated with self-esteem, as were microstressors. The overall model of significant predictor variables accounted for 66% of the variance in general self-esteem. General self-esteem also was significantly predictive of depressive symptomatology. The findings suggest a number of factors which are potentially modifiable and which might enhance general self-esteem in children with visible physical handicaps.
7204635	1	a	"Patient noncompliance is a substantial obstacle to the achievement of therapeutic goals. This paper reviews a number of practical interventions with demonstrated efficacy in enhancing patient adherence, including (1) improving patients' levels of information concerning the specifics of their regimens, reinforcing essential points with review, discussion, and written instruction, and emphasizing the importance of the therapeutic plan, (2) taking clinically appropriate steps to reduce the cost, complexity, duration, and amount of behavioral change required by the regimen and increasing the regimen's convenience through ""tailoring"" and other approaches, (3) obtaining a compliance-oriented history of the patient's prior experiences and present health beliefs and, where necessary, employing strategies to modify those perceptions likely to inhibit compliance, (4) improving levels of patient satisfaction, particularly with the provider-patient relationship, (5) arranging for the continued monitoring of the patient's subsequent compliance to treatment, (6) increasing staff awareness of the magnitude and determinants of the noncompliance phenomenon and attempting to develop an ""active influence orientation"" in each member of the health care team, (7) using such techniques as patient-provider contracts to involve the patient in therapeutic decisions and in the setting of treatment objectives and creating incentives (through rewards and reinforcements) for achieving these objectives, (8) arranging for as much continuity of provider (and other staff) as possible, (9) establishing methods of supervising the patient, including involvement of the patient's social support network, and (10) involving fully the assistance of all available health care providers, assigning specific roles and responsibilities for activities directed at improving adherence to treatment."
18537814	0	a	This paper investigates the determinants of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture utilization for cancer patients who are simultaneously having conventional Western medical treatments. This study used five leading cancers in Taiwan, namely cervical, breast, lung, liver and colorectal cancers. A total of 2499 cancer patients were interviewed, of which 2034 had full information and were analysed. Logistic regressions were used for both TCM and acupuncture. The results showed that type of cancer and cancer duration determine the utilization for alternative treatments. While socio-economic factors also affect choice of alternative medicine, the magnitude differs by types of alternative treatment and cancer. Compared with men and older patients, women and younger patients tend to prefer alternative medicine, and patients from south have higher preference for alternative medicine, which could be a reflection of local culture. Our results are useful for the government to determine higher users of TCM and acupuncture among cancer patients, and make policies to suit these patients' needs.
11338939	0	a	Flashbulb memories are vivid and long-lasting memories for the reception context of an important public event (Brown & Kulik, 1977). They are assumed to be triggered by emotional factors (i.e., intensity of emotional feeling, appraisal of the original event) and by social factors (i.e., social sharing of the news, following media debate about the event). The present study investigated the memory for the death of the former President of France F. Mitterrand in two social groups, i.e., French and Belgian people. This study tests whether the flashbulb memory attributes, the memory for the original event, and the impact of the emotional and social determinants of flashbulb memory differed across groups. The results indicated that the flashbulb memory for Mitterrand's death is affected by group provenance, as French people showed higher levels of recall for the flashbulb memory attributes and their determinants than Belgian people. Time impaired recollections in both groups, so that flashbulb memories appear prone to decay and share the same destiny as ordinary memories. The theoretical construct of concern--as the most basic antecedent of emotional experiences and its related appraisal (Frijda, 1994)--is discussed in order to explain the differences in memory of the two social groups.
3585703	1	a	This study examined personal and contextual predictors of active and avoidance coping strategies in a community sample of over 400 adults and in a sample of over 400 persons entering psychiatric treatment for unipolar depression. Sociodemographic factors of education and income (except for active-cognitive coping), personality dispositions of self-confidence and an easy-going manner, and contextual factors of negative life events and family support each made a significant incremental contribution to predicting active and avoidance coping. Among both healthy adults and patients, active and avoidance coping were positively associated with negative life events. Individuals who had more personal and environmental resources were more likely to rely on active coping and less likely to use avoidance coping. Moreover, for both groups, most of the predictors continued to show significant relations with active and avoidance coping strategies even after the stable component in coping was controlled in a longitudinal design. A comprehensive framework to understand the determinants of coping can be of practical value in suggesting points for therapeutic interventions aimed at fostering more adaptive coping efforts.
16204363	0	a	CONTEXT: Ghrelin may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying risk factor clustering observed in the metabolic syndrome, but this has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to study the association between ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome and identify social and behavioral determinants of ghrelin. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: The setting of this work was the Rancho Bernardo Study. PARTICIPANTS: Study subjects included 1513 men and women, aged 51-90 yr in 1984-1987. OUTCOMES: Total ghrelin, measured by RIA, and the metabolic syndrome, defined using Adult Treatment Panel III diagnostic criteria, were the outcome measures. RESULTS: Levels of ghrelin (mean +/- SD) did not differ between the 848 men (1451 +/- 532 pg/ml) and the 665 women (1459 +/- 672 pg/ml) or by age. Education, alcohol intake, and smoking history were each significantly and positively associated with ghrelin in a dose-related manner, independent of body mass index (BMI). Compared with participants with the lowest third of ghrelin levels, the age- and sex-adjusted odds of having the metabolic syndrome were 18% lower in the middle third and 53% lower in the highest third. This corresponds to a 21% decrease per SD increase in ghrelin (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.69, 0.89; P < or = 0.001); this was attenuated to 13% (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.75, 1.01; P = 0.07), after adjustment for BMI. Of the five metabolic syndrome components, only the association between ghrelin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was independent of BMI. A significant association independent of BMI was also observed between insulin and ghrelin. CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin levels are influenced by lifestyle factors. The inverse association between endogenous ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome is largely explained by the strong ghrelin-BMI association.
18201163	0	a	ISSUE ADDRESSED: The high rates of mental health issues confronting Indigenous populations make it imperative that action to promote mental health and prevent the development of mental health problems is effective. An accumulating evidence base for mental health promotion now exists; however, it remains significantly underdeveloped for Indigenous groups. METHODS: This paper outlines the key findings of a systematic review of the literature undertaken to identify attributes of effective Indigenous mental health promotion interventions. RESULTS: Conclusive evidence of the efficacy of Indigenous mental health promotion interventions could not be determined because the evidence base is limited. However, this review did highlight several important findings. First, there were few well-conducted intervention evaluations; in many, the design was weak and insufficient information was supplied to assess effectiveness. Second, Indigenous mental health promotion initiatives commonly focused on individual behaviour change, rather than the broader social, ecological or policy determinants. Third, many interventions involved extensive Indigenous participation, thus supporting cultural relevance and community involvement, essential for the future of Indigenous mental health promotion. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence about effective mental health promotion and prevention interventions for Indigenous populations.
17712693	0	a	Various studies indicate that school- or university-based HIV prevention curricula can reduce the prevalence of sexual risk behaviour among adolescent youth in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, effective HIV/AIDS prevention education may be problematic, if the needs of youth are not served adequately. To date, little attention has been given to the motivation of youth to learn about HIV/AIDS and about their preferences for HIV/AIDS curriculum design options. The aim of this study was to get insight into the determinants of the motivation of youth to learn about HIV/AIDS prevention and to assess their curriculum design preferences. Students from a university in Tigray, Ethiopia, filled out a structured questionnaire, which assessed demographics, variables that according to the Theory of Planned Behaviour are related to the motivation to learn, and their preferences for independent, carrier and integrated HIV/AIDS curriculum designs. On average, participants were highly motivated to learn about HIV/AIDS. Motivation to learn was primarily related to social norms and was not related to self-efficacy to discuss HIV/AIDS in class. The often discussed reluctance to discuss sexuality and condom use in curricula in Sub-Saharan Africa, seems to be more related to existing negative social norms, than to lack of self-efficacy. Participants revealed a high preference for the independent, carrier and integrated curriculum design options. However, students with a higher motivation to learn about HIV/AIDS were more attracted to the independent course design.
7397056	1	a	A Paracetamol elimination was measured, using serial saliva samples, in 114 London factory and office workers, 76 Whites and 38 Asian immigrants. 2. Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man.
16053643	0	a	"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence that demographic determinants, socioeconomic determinants, chronic diseases, and functional capacity have on self-rated health among elderly persons (60 years and older) living in the city of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and to investigate the existence of differences between men and women in terms of their self-rated health. METHODS: The study was carried out using data collected in the city of Sao Paulo as part of a project called Health, Well-being, and Aging in Latin America and the Caribbean (the ""SABE project""). We analyzed data on 2,135 elderly individuals (58.6% women; mean age, 69.4 years; median age, 68.0 years). The dependent variable was self-rated health (good or poor). The following independent variables were considered: (1) demographic ones (age, sex, marital status, and living arrangements (whether the elderly person lived alone or with others)), (2) socioeconomic ones (schooling and income), (3) the number of chronic diseases (hypertension, arthritis or rheumatism, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, bronchitis or emphysema, embolism or stroke, and cancer), and (4) functional capacity. To estimate the association between self-rated health and the independent variables and to study gender differences, a multiple binary logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The presence of chronic diseases in association with gender was the strongest determinant of self-rated health among the elderly in Sao Paulo. Among men with four or more chronic diseases, they were 10.53 times as likely to characterize their health as poor; among women with four or more chronic diseases, the ratio was 8.31. Functional capacity, schooling, and income were also strongly associated with self-rated health, and the influence of age was significant. The elderly women were more likely to report good self-rated health than were men when the women or men either had no chronic diseases or had two or more. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the need for simultaneous, comprehensive actions in the health sector, social services, and the economic sector to address the main determinants of self-rated health in order to promote well-being and quality of life among the elderly."
2768294	1	a	A life table analysis is made of the duration of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea in Orissa, India, taking one variable at a time using data from a baseline survey of fertility and mortality (BSFM) conducted on the lines of the World Fertility Survey. Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age. The durations of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea are strongly related.
16137331	0	a	BACKGROUND: This study focuses on determinants of a healthy work environment in two departments in a Swedish university hospital. The study is based on previously conducted longitudinal studies at the hospital (1994-2001), concerning working conditions and health outcomes among health care personnel in conjunction with downsizing processes. Overall, there was a general negative trend in relation to mental health, as well as long-term sick leave during the study period. The two departments chosen for the current study differed from the general hospital trend in that they showed stable health development. The aim of the study was to identify and analyse experiential determinants of healthy working conditions. METHODS: Thematic open-ended interviews were carried out with seventeen managers and key informants, representing different groups of co-workers in the two departments. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and an inductive content analysis was made. RESULTS: In the two studied departments the respondents perceived that it was advantageous to belong to a small department, and to work in cooperation-oriented care. The management approaches described by both managers and co-workers could be interpreted as transformational, due to a strain of visionary, delegating, motivating, confirmative, supportive attitudes and a strongly expressed solution-oriented attitude. The daily work included integrated learning activities. The existing organisational conditions, approaches and attitudes promoted tendencies towards a work climate characterised by trust, team spirit and professionalism. In the description of the themes organisational conditions, approaches and climate, two core determinants, work-pride and confidence, for healthy working conditions were interpreted. Our core determinants augment the well-established concepts: manageability, comprehensiveness and meaningfulness. These favourable conditions seem to function as a buffer against the general negative effects of downsizing observed elsewhere in the hospital, and in the literature. CONCLUSION: Research illuminating health-promoting aspects is rather unusual. This study could be seen as explorative. The themes and core dimensions we found could be used as a basis for further intervention studies in similar health-care settings. The result could also be used in future health promotion studies in larger populations. One of the first steps in such a strategy is to formulate relevant questions, and we consider that this study contributes to this.
11564854	0	a	"Seattle Partners, an Urban Research Center (URC) funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is a partnership of community agency representatives, community activists, public health professionals, academics, and health care providers whose mission is to improve the health of urban Seattle, Washington, communities by conducting community-based participatory research. This article describes the development and characteristics of Seattle Partners. Using primarily qualitative methods, including periodic in-depth interviews, evaluators identified the components necessary for Seattle Partners to maintain a collaborative and establish a research center driven by community interests. Seattle Partners is run by an unrestricted and inclusive board that has spent 5 years developing both an operating structure and various research interventions. Operating under Community Collaboration Principles, the board identified social determinants of health as the priority area in which to work. Collaboration, ""small and concrete"" accomplishments, skilled individuals, and funder support directly influence the success of the center. Decision making, project selection, and board composition have all been challenges to work through. Learning how to do and sustain the work are lessons being learned as Seattle Partners matures."
2692802	1	a	Our emphasis in the past has been on disease prevention rather than health promotion. This emphasis served us reasonably well when morbidity was high throughout society and when interventions at the community level were able to achieve massive reductions. It is not faring as well now that the major shared environmental determinants of disease have been controlled. The present situation calls for changes in individual health-related behaviour and individual clinical interventions to achieve comparable progress. As difficult to win as collective commitments to community-level interventions have been, compliance in a free society by often unmotivated persons in numerous individual instances of decision making in daily life is even more difficult. Health promotion offers the promise of a quantum leap in improving the health status of the community by participating in behaviour perceived as not only responsible but appropriate and desirable, providing positive reinforcement rather than anxiety-provoking caution. Favourable social trends, such as physical conditioning and dietary changes may be encouraged through media interventions. There are biological limitations to this approach, however. Many healthful practices confer little benefit on large groups of people and a few may be harmful to selected groups. Vigorous promotion of weight reduction and obesity control, for example, may lead to profound dissatisfaction with body image and to severely self-destructive behaviour among those prone to eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive eating. Health promotion activities may fit well with social trends but their adverse potential can be aggravated because failure to comply can be penalized by peer disapproval in a way that disease prevention strategies usually are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
3067531	1	a	The present paper will review and discuss research issues and findings of recent cross-cultural studies of severe mental disorders. The paper is divided into two main sections. The first section will discuss: (1) the concept of culture, (2) hierarchical levels of human behavior determinants, (3) the cultural variability continuum, and (4) the concept of self. The second section will discuss: (1) epidemiology, (2) culture and clinical phenomenology in severe disorders, and (3) culture as an etiological determinant. The paper closes with a discussion of some conclusions and suggestions for future research.
11264268	0	a	"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of self-rated health to a measure of physical status, based on a professional rating of the individual's health from a strictly physical point of view. METHODS: A random selection of 407 people over the age of 20 from the north-western catchment area of greater Stockholm were invited in 1995 to a physical examination, including a self-report questionnaire with questions about self-rated health, lifestyle, psychosocial factors and quality of life. A measure of physical health on a 5-point graded scale was constructed using the information from the records of the physical examination as a base. RESULTS: Self-rated health and the professional ratings of health coincided in approximately 60% of the cases. There were a relatively large number of cases where the ratings were contradictory. The correlation between the scales was 0.45. Comparison between the two ratings with respect to association with potential determinants showed that physical factors naturally explained most of the variances in physical health, whereas social and mental well-being and somatic conditions (women) were the most important explanatory variables for self-rated health. Irrespective of whether they had ""favourable"" or ""unfavourable"" health, those with ""poor"" self-rated health also had perceived lower social and mental well-being, less appreciation, more somatic conditions (women) and worse coping abilities (men). CONCLUSIONS: With mental, psychosocial and social problems becoming more pronounced in sickness patterns for primary care patients, self-rated health could be a helpful device, especially when time resources for consultations are short. This measure could also give a more global view of the patient's situation when effectivity and rationality can be a threat to a holistic view of the patient."
17472062	0	a	"Health is an axiological category, which does not possess measurable matter parameters. The problem of health is sometimes raised in families, social circles and institutions. Due to the fact that students of special pedagogy have contacts with school children with health deficits, they have to be fully aware of the fact how significant predicator health is in their own development. The target of this study was to show the output of the research aimed at seeking an answer to the following question: What level of knowledge about health and its determinants in their own perception is presented by the students on the grounds of the educational specialty they have chosen? The research comprised 84 students of 1st, 3rd and 5th years of the faculty of special pedagogy (different specialties) aged from 18 to 24. The research material was collected by an interview questionnaire elaborated by themselves and categorized conversation (""a ladder"") concerning three of the following basic questions: 1) the amount of general knowledge about health they possessed; 2) the amount of their knowledge of factors conditioning a human's state of health; 3) the amount of the awareness of the importance of one's care for his or her own health and for that of others. The output received in the research shows a mean degree of satisfaction of special pedagogy students with the level of their knowledge concerning health. Their statements connected with their self-assessment of that level should make one reflect upon the subject in question."
3751657	1	a	The aim of the present study was to relate children's aggression levels to social determinants of interest (i.e., child-rearing measures, day-care attendance, peer group influence, and TV-watching) in a sample of Chinese children in the People's Republic of China. A sample of 290 primary school students (155 boys and 135 girls, mean age 10.3) in grade four in Beijing were investigated using the Multi-Faceted Aggression Inventory. The children's parents were asked about child-rearing measures and day-care experience for the child. Teachers rated the children's aggression, school achievement level, and membership in the Young Pioneers. Despite acknowledged limitations, the findings in this study gave evidence that according to a person-environment interaction perspective, the Chinese children's individual differences in aggression were influenced by the restricted environment. As aggressive behaviour is undesired and suppressed in the Chinese culture in and outside the home, the Chinese children seemed to show lower levels and less variation of aggression behaviour than children in permissive environments (e.g., Sweden). However, when analysing sex differences in aggression environmental influences alone might not explain the differences.
17880688	0	a	BACKGROUND: Given the increasing importance of obesity in China, prevention interventions encouraging physical activity by middle school students are needed. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how a rapid elicitation method can be used to identify salient consequences, referents, and circumstances about physical activity as perceived by middle school students and to provide suggestions for interventions and quantitative research. METHOD: A theory-based qualitative study using a self-completion elicitation was conducted with 155 students from two middle schools in Beijing, China. Following the Theory of Planned Behavior, six open-ended questions asked students for their perceptions about performing physical activity at least 60 minutes each day: advantages of participating in physical activity; disadvantages of doing so; people who approve of participation; people who disapprove; things that make it easy; and things that make it hard. Content analysis revealed categories of salient consequences, reference groups, and circumstances. RESULTS: While the three most frequently mentioned advantages elicited from the students were physical health consequences (e.g., will strengthen my body (58.7%)), four of the salient advantages were not (e.g., will improve my grades (12.2%)). Parents were the most frequently mentioned social referent (42.6% as approving; 27.7% as disapproving) when students were asked who might approve or disapprove of their participation. Circumstances perceived to hinder daily physical activity included having too many assignments and not having enough time. CONCLUSION: While many of the beliefs about physical activity elicited from this study were similar to those found with students from England and the US, several were unique to these students from Beijing. The results of this qualitative research suggest that interventions to encourage physical activity among middle school students should address: perceived consequences of physical activity on academic achievement and other factors beyond physical health; barriers of not having enough time and having too many assignments perceived to hinder frequent physical activity; and parental approval. More rigorous research on psychosocial determinants with close-ended items developed from these open-ended data and with larger sample sizes of students is necessary. Research with parents and school staff will be needed to understand the perceptions of these stakeholder groups key to creating the students' social environment.
18091003	0	a	BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent and disabling psychologic pathology. Longitudinal research on the predictors of posttraumatic stress symptomatology is limited. METHODS: We recruited 2752 participants to a prospective, population-based cohort study by conducting a telephone survey of adult residents of the New York City metropolitan area in 2002; participants completed 3 follow-up interviews over a 30-month period. Censoring weights were estimated to account for potential bias. We used generalized estimating equation logistic regression models with bootstrapped confidence intervals to assess the predictors of posttraumatic stress over time in multivariable models. RESULTS: Predictors of posttraumatic stress over time included ongoing stressors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91 per 1 unit increase in number of stressors, [95% confidence interval = 1.55-2.36]) and traumatic events (OR = 1.92 per 1 unit increase in number of traumatic events [CI = 1.71-2.22]), social support (compared with high levels, OR = 1.71 for medium [1.09-2.52]; OR = 1.57 for low [1.08-2.35]), low income (OR = 0.87 per $10,000 increase [0.81-0.92]), female sex (1.60 [1.11-2.23]), and Latino ethnicity (compared with white, OR = 1.74 [1.05-2.97]). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that ongoing stressors play a central role in explaining the trajectory of posttraumatic stress over time, and that factors beyond the experience of stressors and traumas may account for sex and ethnic differences in posttraumatic stress risk. Interventions that focus on reducing ongoing adversity may help mitigate the consequences of traumatic events.
2740943	1	a	Fertility, health, and family planning are not independent factors, but rather involve a series of biological and social mechanisms in close interaction with one another. The impact that a high fertility rate has on health is reflected mainly in a rise in the rates of maternal and child mortality. Similarly, fertility has a greater negative effect upon the health of groups characterized by high reproductive risk, high parity, short intergenesic intervals, and unwanted pregnancies. On the other hand, family planning -and specifically the use of contraceptive methods-helps to achieve a lowering of the fertility rate and also has a positive effect on maternal-child health. This situation can be observed in the case of Mexico, where fertility rates and tendencies, as well as maternal and child mortality, have been reduced during the past decade.
2916712	1	a	The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.
3300728	1	a	Famines are sustained, extreme shortages of food among discrete populations sufficient to cause high rates of mortality. Signs and symptoms of prolonged food deprivation include loss of fat and subcutaneous tissue, depression, apathy, and weakness, which progress to immobility and death of the individual, often from superimposed respiratory or other infections. The social consequences of famines are disruption from mass migrations of people in search of food, breakdown of social behavior, abandonment of cooperative effort, loss of personal pride and sense of family ties, and finally a struggle for individual survival. Famines have been common ever since the development of agriculture made human settlements possible. Food shortages due to crop failures caused by natural disasters including poor weather, insect plagues, and plant diseases; crop destruction due to warfare; and enforced starvation as a political tool are by no means the only causative factors. Many of the worst famines have been due to poor distribution of existing food supplies, either because of inequities that result in a lack of purchasing power on the part of the poor or because of political interference with normal distribution or relief movements of food. Europe and Asia, which in the past experienced frequent severe famines, sometimes with deaths in the hundreds of thousands or millions, have now largely eliminated famines through social and technological change. However, in Africa, political and social factors have destroyed the capacity of many populations to survive drought-induced variations in local food supplies and prices. Thus, famines are due to varying combinations of inadequacy of food supplies for whatever reason and the inability of populations to acquire food because of poverty, civil disturbances, or political interference. Despite the role of natural causes, the conclusion is inescapable that modern famines, like most of those in history, are man-made.
3338865	1	a	This research examines differential vulnerability to environmental stressors among white and black elderly and non-elderly disaster victims. The research identifies the determinants of psychosocial recovery for those four demographic groups. A total of 431 families who were victims of a tornado were interviewed for the study. A path model of the determinants of psychosocial recovery is presented, and observations are made regarding intervention strategies for older disaster victims.
4061712	1	a	The extent to which the values attached to health states are similar in different cultures or social groups is important for understanding health and illness behaviors and for developing standardized health status measures. A cross-cultural study was conducted to compare the health status values obtained in a United States population (Seattle, Washington) with those from another English-speaking culture (London, England) on the Sickness Impact Profile, a standardized measure composed of 136 items. London judges rated the severity of dysfunction described in each item on an equal interval scale using the same methods of scaling and analysis employed in the Seattle study. A regression of English mean item values on US mean values yielded a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of -0.07, indicating that judges gave strikingly similar ratings to most items. Agreement was higher at the more severe end of the dysfunction continuum than at the least severe end, a finding consistent with the notion that what constitutes health is more difficult to define than what constitutes illness. While a universal conception of dysfunction may exist in English-speaking societies, the social and cultural determinants of health status values deserve more systematic study.
17473623	0	a	This study aimed to establish the determinants of health-related quality of life in a rural and an urban sample of Xhosa-speaking people with disability. The sample was a convenience sample and was identified through a 'snowballing' process initiated by enumerators who were all members of Disabled People South Africa. The Xhosa version of the EQ-5D was utilized and the visual analogue scale which ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) was used as the dependent measure. The sample consisted of 244 rural and 61 urban respondents, demonstrating a preponderance of physical disabilities. The urban sample reported more problems in each of the descriptor domains. The visual analogue scale score showed a bimodal distribution. The results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the presence of pain detracted most from health-related quality of life (-20%), followed by anxiety and depression (-10%), and difficulty with performance of usual activities (-10%). Rural participants, with the same impairment level, reported 8% poorer health-related quality of life. The mean visual analogue scale scores were low (in the 60s), and would indicate that the majority of people living with disability do not necessarily adapt to their functional limitations and continue to experience diminished health-related quality of life. The bimodal distribution, however, did indicate that some respondents enjoyed good health-related quality of life. There is a need to manage symptoms, particularly pain and depression, as these have a severe negative impact on health-related quality of life. The rural setting seemed to contribute to a worse perceived health-related quality of life. This effect needs to be factored in when evaluating programmes.
15827917	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To study the employment rate and determinants of return to work for persons with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in Taiwan. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Taiwan community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-nine people who had sustained traumatic SCI, had been completely rehabilitated in a university hospital between 1989 and 2002, and who were between 18 and 60 years of age at the time of interview in 2003. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A structured questionnaire was used to identify demographic and injury-related status, functional status, and pre- and postinjury work-related information. RESULTS: At the time of survey, only 47% of the participants were engaged in remunerative employment. Cox regression analysis, with time elapsed between injury and survey as the underlying time axis, showed that education and functional independence were associated with employment. Subjects with a high school education had a 2.2-fold higher chance (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.8) of returning to work than those without. Subjects with higher scores on the Barthel Index and ability to use public or private transport independently had a 2.7-fold higher chance (95% CI, 1.5-4.9) of returning to work than those unable to travel independently. Other factors significantly associated with employment included marital status, with marriage having a favorable influence; age at injury, with age below 25 years being favorable; preinjury occupation; and vocational training after injury. The importance of functional independence training in rehabilitation is stressed. CONCLUSIONS: Functional independence was a strong factor predicting return to work. Rehabilitation focused on education, vocational training, self-care ability, community mobility, and environmental modifications could improve employability after SCI.
3701583	1	a	Seventy-eight students enrolled in summer-session college courses were randomly assigned to serve either as counselors or as clients for a 20-min, role-played peer counseling session. All of the subjects completed a battery of standardized personality measures. Each counselor interacted with two clients. Prior to the sessions, the counselor was led to believe that one of the clients was especially introverted and that the other client was especially extraverted. Dependent measures were based on clients' change scores on a mood adjective rating scale administered before and after the peer counseling sessions. Analyses showed that counselors who were more successful at biasing their clients in the direction of their expectancies (a) scored higher on measures of Dogmatism, Nurturance, and Social Recognition, (b) scored lower on Impulsivity, and (c) were more likely to be women. Clients who were more susceptible to counselor bias scored higher on the Self-Monitoring Scale, the Self-Monitoring Other-Directedness subscale, and Social Recognition. These results are discussed in light of previous research and their implications for research on interpersonal expectancy effects.
16380367	0	a	This paper reports on an exploratory study of nursing home bankruptcy. From state and industry data regarding nearly 1,000 California facilities, it was possible to identify 155 homes in five chains (multi-facility organizations) that were operating in bankruptcy in 2000. When compared with facilities in non-bankrupt chains, while the bankrupt chain facilities had significantly worse financial liquidity, higher administrative costs, and higher payables to related parties, they also had more Medicare residents, fewer Medicaid residents, better solvency, and were located in less competitive county markets and in areas with higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. These findings indicate that, rather than facility characteristics and local market factors, strategic decisions taken at the corporate (chain) level are the major determinants of nursing facility bankruptcy status.
19851709	0	a	OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence and determinants of cigarette smoking in Morocco. METHODS: A sample of 9,195 individuals aged 15-90 years, were randomly selected, using a stratified cluster sampling technique. A cross-sectional, household, community-based survey was conducted using a tested questionnaire. The interview covered personal, social and educational characteristics of the respondents and their smoking status. The association between current smoking and sociodemographic variables was estimated. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current smoking was 31.5% for males and 3.1% for females. In men, smoking was associated with lower educational level. In women, it was associated with higher educational level and social class. CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking remains an important public health problem in Morocco. A comprehensive strategy for tobacco control is needed.
21974736	0	a	Exercise plays a key role in the prevention and delay of the onset of Type 2 diabetes and in the management of this disorder. To determine if there are differences in key social-cognitive determinants of exercise and self-reported physical activity levels between adults with diabetes and those without the condition, a random selected sample of adults was surveyed. A telephone interview assessed physical activity behaviour and key social-cognitive constructs from major health behaviour change theories/models. The mean energy expenditure was not significantly different between the diabetes (n = 46) and the non-diabetes (n = 1556) groups. The diabetes group reported significantly lower scores for self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control, but higher for fear of, and vulnerability to, general health and cardiovascular disease threat. The data suggest that it may not be necessary to promote health threat messages, as threat is already high for this diabetes population and studies have shown that excess threat does not promote recommended exercise and health behaviours. Instead, the low levels of self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control among those with diabetes emphasize the importance of designing specific strategies (e.g., skills, incremental success) to increase their self-confidence in undertaking physical activity.
3453175	1	a	"To explore the psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination (BSE) among women, we studied a stratified random sample of 264 women students, faculty, and staff in a university community. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported frequency of BSE, and predictors included measures of general health predispositions, variables of the Health Belief Model, the impact of a woman's social network, a set of secondary non-health-related barriers and benefits, and the woman's evaluation of her personal health care system. Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice."
11202034	0	a	"The end of the last millennium witnessed an unprecedented degree of public awareness regarding mental disorder as well as motivation for policy change. Like Sartorius, we contend that the continued stigmatization of mental illness may well be the central issue facing the field, as nearly all attendant issues (e.g., standards of care, funding for basic and applied research efforts) emanate from professional, societal, and personal attitudes towards persons with aberrant behavior. We discuss empirical and narrative evidence for stigmatization as well as historical trends regarding conceptualizations of mental illness, including the field's increasing focus on genetic and neurobiological causes and determinants of mental disorder. We next define stigma explicitly, noting both the multiple levels (community, societal, familial, individual) through which stigma operates to dehumanize and delegitimize individuals with mental disorders and the impact of stigma across development. Key developmental psychopathology principles are salient in this regard. We express concern over the recent oversimplification of mental illness as ""brain disorder,"" supporting instead transactional models which account for the dynamic interplay of genes, neurobiology, environment, and self across development and which are consistent with both compassion and societal responsibility. Finally, we consider educational and policy-related initiatives regarding the destigmatization of mental disorder. We conclude that attitudes and policy regarding mental disorder reflect, in microcosmic form, two crucial issues for the next century and millennium: (a) tolerance for diversity (vs. pressure for conformity) and (b) intentional direction of our species' evolution, given fast-breaking genetic advances."
16397202	0	a	While the role of impaired cognition in accounting for functional outcome in schizophrenia is generally established by now, the overlap is far from complete. Moreover, little is known about the potential mechanisms that bridge between cognition and functional outcome. The aim of this article is to aid in closing this gap by presenting a novel, more ecologically valid approach for neuropsychological assessment. The new approach is motivated by the view that metacognitive processes of self-monitoring and self-regulation are fundamental determinants of competent functioning in the real world. The new approach incorporates experimental psychological concepts and paradigms used to study metacognition into current standard neuropsychological assessment procedures. Preliminary empirical data that support and demonstrate the utility of the new approach for assessment, as well as remediation efforts, in schizophrenia are presented and discussed.
18341123	0	a	Renewed international interest in the structural determinants of health manifests itself in a focus on the social determinants of health and the public policy antecedents that shape their quality. This increased international interest in public policy in support of the structural determinants of health has had little traction in the United States. This should be surprising since the United States presents one of the worst population health profiles and public policy environments in support of health among wealthy developed nations. The U.S. position as a health status and policy outlier results from long-term institutional changes that are shaped by political, economic, and social forces. U.S. public health researchers' and workers' neglect of these structural and public policy issues conforms to the dominant ideological discourses that serve to justify these changes. The author presents some means by which public health researchers and workers can challenge these dominant discourses.
20108607	0	a	BACKGROUND: The social gradient in body weight (for example, obesity) departs from the social gradient in other health outcomes. Innovative approaches are needed to understand the observed patterns. This study examines time-use patterns by indicators of socio-economic position, and considers the implications of variations in time use for the social gradient in weight reported in other studies. DATA AND METHODS: The data are from respondents aged 25 to 64 to Canada's 1986 and 2005 General Social Surveys, which focused on time use. Participation in various activities was examined by sex, and by personal income and education, stratified by sex, in both years. RESULTS: Higher-income men and women were more likely than those of lower income to spend time in paid work, commuting and eating out, and less likely to spend time sleeping. Men and women with higher education were more likely than those with lower education to spend time in physical activity (2005 only) and reading. These time-use patterns plausibly contribute to the social gradient in obesity reported in other Canadian studies. INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that there is value in looking beyond a narrow range of health behaviours toward broader measures of daily routines to gain insight into the social determinants of weight and health.
12882263	0	a	Although the place of death of patients with terminal cancer is influenced by multiple factors, few studies have systematically investigated its determinants. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the patients' sociodemographic, clinical and support network variables on the place of death of terminally ill cancer patients under the care of home care agencies in Japan. Among 528 patients from 259 home care agencies, 342 (65%) died at home and 186 (35%) died at a hospital. From the multivariate logistic regression model, patients who expressed the desire for receiving home care at referral [odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.19, 1.09-4.40] in addition to the family caregiver's desire for the same (OR, 95%CI: 3.19, 1.75-5.81), who had more than one family caregiver (OR, 95%CI: 2.28, 1.05-4.94), who had the support of their family physician (OR, 95%CI: 2.23, 1.21-4.08), who were never rehospitalized (OR, 95%CI: 0.04, 0.02-0.07), who received more home visits by the home hospice nurse during the stable phase under home hospice care (OR, 95%CI: 1.25, 1.02-1.53), and who were in the greatest functionally dependent status during the last week prior to death (OR, 95%CI: 8.60, 4.97-14.89) were more likely to die at home. Overall, this model could accurately classify 95% of the places of death, which is higher than other published studies. A clearer understanding of factors that might influence the place of death of terminally ill cancer patients would allow healthcare professionals to modify healthcare systems and tailor effective interventions to help patients die at their place of preference.
16953359	0	a	"The article provides an overview of the contemporary literature on the social and psychological factors which are associated with migration. Derived from the operationalisation of ""migration"" and an examination of the methodological peculiarities of migration research, a (transactional) stress model of migration is proposed incorporating potentially stress-eliciting influences of migration including occupational pressures, social isolation and/or family-related problems and their impact on psychological and physical health. There are inconsistencies in the findings regarding psychological health, which can in part be explained through the phenomena of the ""healthy migrant effect"", duration of stay in the host culture or the culture-specificity. Moreover, a discussion is provided of the extent that disorders associated with differentially stressed migrants will be manifested in the health care system. Finally, concluding remarks are offered together with a short discussion of the implication of these findings for future research and social and health policy decision-making."
16700397	0	a	This study investigated the attitudes of Omani adolescents towards gender roles and women's empowerment in taking household decisions, and the determinants of their positive attitudes. A national representative secondary school-based sample of 1670 boys and 1675 girls completed a self-administrated questionnaire with 2 indices: Adolescents' Attitudes Towards Gender Roles and Adolescents' Attitudes Towards Women's Empowerment. Other questions included demographic data, risk behaviour lifestyle, proxies to mental health and social environments expected to predict attitudes towards gender role. Eight variables predicted higher scores in both indices: sex, age, socioeconomic class, sleep problems, self-esteem, current smoking, history of indulging in violent behaviour and parental relations.
6474230	1	a	The paper examines role of social support, structural-environmental and perceptual variables in explaining variation in illness behaviour in a sample of 240 adults with impaired hearing. The specific behaviour examined is physician visits over a 12 month period. We find that previous experience with illness and perceived health status are important variables with respect to illness behaviour and that the relevance of these variables and social support vary considerably by level of psychological distress. While the addition of psychological distress as an explanatory variable makes little contribution, the variation in the power of the model to explain variation in behaviour across levels of distress is substantial. Our findings argue strongly for increased awareness of the role of social and psychological factors in illness behaviour, particularly among those who plan and deliver health care services.
14520621	0	a	BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that patients' perceptions may be more important than objective clinical assessments in determining quality of life (QOL) for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: We interviewed 165 hemodialysis patients from 3 sites using a QOL questionnaire that included the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and the McGill QOL (MQOL) scale, which includes a single-item global measure of QOL (Single-Item QOL Scale [SIS]). The MQOL scale asks patients to report their most troublesome symptoms. We also initiated the use of a Support Network Scale and a Spiritual Beliefs Scale. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 60.9 years, 52% were men, 63% were white, and 33% were African American. Patients had a mean treatment time for ESRD of 44 months, mean hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL (118 g/L), mean albumin level of 3.7 g/dL (37 g/L), and mean Kt/V of 1.6. Forty-five percent of patients reported symptoms. Pain was the most common symptom (21% of patients). There was an inverse relationship between reported number of symptoms and SWLS (P < 0.01), MQOL scale score (P < 0.001), and SIS (P < 0.001). The Spiritual Beliefs Scale correlated with the MQOL scale score, SWLS (both P < 0.01), and SIS (P < 0.05). The Support Network Scale score correlated with the MQOL Existential (P = 0.01) and MQOL Support (P < 0.01) subscales. No clinical parameter correlated with any measure of QOL, spiritual beliefs, or social support. CONCLUSION: Symptoms, especially pain, along with psychosocial and spiritual factors, are important determinants of QOL of patients with ESRD. Additional studies, particularly a longitudinal trial, are needed to determine the reproducibility and utility of these QOL measures in assessing patient long-term outcome and their association with other QOL indices in larger and more diverse patient populations.
12481209	0	a	OBJECTIVE: The Russian mortality crisis of the early 1990s attracted considerable attention, but information on possible covariates of mortality is lacking, and concerns have been raised about the validity of official mortality data. To help elucidate the determinants of mortality, we examined whether indirect demographic techniques could be used to study mortality in countries such as the Russian Federation, where mortality data are inadequate, using input data independent from official vital statistics. METHODS: A national sample of the population was interviewed (n = 1600, response rate = 67%). Participants who had ever been married (82% of the sample) were asked about the date of birth and vital status of their first spouse. Spousal mortality was then estimated indirectly for the 531 men and 710 women for whom valid data were available. FINDINGS: The estimated risk of death between the ages of 35-69 years was 57% for male spouses and 17% for female spouses. Corresponding figures derived from national data for 1990 were 52% and 25% for the Russian Federation, and 31% and 20% for the United Kingdom. According to spouses' reports, 38% of their husbands died from cardiovascular disease, 22% from cancer, and 14% from injuries and accidents. Mortality of male spouses was inversely related to the education level of their wives, and the age-adjusted hazard ratios for death from all causes, compared to primary education, were 0.77 for secondary education and 0.57 for university education (trend P = 0.03). Mortality was also inversely related to ownership of household items, but not to size of settlement, pride in Russia, membership in the Soviet Communist Party, nationality or self-assessed social status. CONCLUSIONS: Although the indirect estimates were imprecise (partly owing to the small population size of the study), and mortality in women was probably underestimated (owing to many factors, including poorer reporting by males and high male mortality), our results are nevertheless consistent with the mortality pattern observed in official mortality data. The indirect technique thus appears to be a useful tool to study the determinants of mortality in the Russian Federation and other populations, where reliable or sufficiently extensive data are not available.
2746717	1	a	The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.
11144870	0	a	The purpose of the present investigation was to study prevalence of periodontal disease among 30 to 39-years-old from Oporto in the north of Portugal. In addition, an attempt was made to elucidate possible periodontal disease determinants in this population. A random sample consisting of a total of 322 individuals was drawn based on electoral lists. The attendance rate was 61%. The CPITN index was used and the results indicate a high prevalence of periodontal disease and a substantial need for periodontal treatment in this population, with 41% of the individuals investigated having one or more sites with a CPITN score 4 (pockets deeper than 5.5 mm). Dental visiting habits, gender (lower CPITN scores for females) and oral hygiene were the determinants most significantly associated with variation in CPITN scores.
10287174	1	a	"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3771282	1	a	Thirty-six female subjects took part in a study involving using pre-weighed table and cooking salt pots, along with complete urine collections for 7 days. Urinary sodium excretion was determined, and was used as an estimate of sodium (salt) intake. Other measures taken were, most preferred concentration of salt in soup, blood pressure, body weight and height, along with questionnaires on general food preferences, attitudes to adding table salt to foods, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). Table salt (7 per cent) and cooking salt (8 per cent) were found to account for only a small proportion of total sodium intake, the major part (89 per cent) being from non-discretionary salt present in foods. Subjects, divided on the basis of table salt use and total intake, were found to differ in the most preferred concentration of salt in soup, but not in their sensitivity to variations from their ideal. Table salt use was predicted very well by the individual's attitude, and to a lesser extent by perceived social pressure. The only other variable related to higher table salt use was a lower preference for fruit on the general food preferences questionnaire. The lower preference for fruit was also related to higher total salt intake, which was also predicted by a lower neuroticism score on the EPI. While extraversion was positively related to non-discretionary salt intake, this relationship was not significant for total salt intake.
6849845	1	a	Between 1969 and 1980 1443 patients with vesicovaginal fistulas were operated on in Ahmadu Bello University Hospital in Northern Nigeria. They have been studied in relation to their obstetric, social and environmental background. The preventable nature of the lesion was explored particularly with respect to age, parity and obstructed labour, and to traditional practices including 'gishiri cutting', which alone accounts for 13% of all the fistulas. Vesicovaginal fistulas are still a major cause for concern in many developing countries; measures for prevention include universal education and improved status of women in society as well as improved and accessible medical services.
7020985	1	a	The association between reported alcohol intake and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration is examined in an effort to establish whether it was a cause-and-effect basis. A cross-sectional descriptive study of several populations reveals a strong and consistent dose-response pattern: Social drinkers have mean HDL cholesterol levels that are higher than those of teetotalers by as much as 33%. Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period. The evidence supports the conclusion that alcohol habits are probably one of the determinants of plasma HDL cholesterol level. A clarification of the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical medicine awaits future clinical efforts.
17093748	1	a	This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting.
7259481	1	a	In 1973, 532 persons desiring to quit smoking and seeking the Hermano therapy of chirothesia were questioned prior to the ritual treatment session. Typical smoking behavior, social background, and personality tests were documented. At intervals of 4 months, 1 year, and 5 years after treatment the group was examined with a follow-up questionnaire. In two earlier studies Gmur evaluated the results of this treatment after 1 year and analyzed in detail the various factors which influence these results. The present paper investigates the determinations for success with a follow-up study 5 years after treatment. The analysis show that the treatment was seldom successful for persons with an accentuated addiction-like smoking behavior. There were no findings proving a correlation between personality pattern and/or sociodemographic data and treatment success. No criteria was found to suggest indications for the successful application of the Hermano therapy.
3384511	1	a	Empirical data on Japanese American drinking behavior are scarce. The present study was a random sample (N = 295) of households in Los Angeles with Japanese surnames. Japanese Americans born in the United States tended to drink less than those born in Japan. The study also observed significant gender differences in Japanese American drinking behavior which were attributed to ascribed social roles. Other demographic and social determinants of drinking were examined through two logistic regression models. The first model predicted drinking (as opposed to abstaining), while the other distinguished heavy drinkers from those who drank alcohol in more moderate amounts. Potential reference groups (e.g., parents, friends, church groups, etc.) were often significant in predicting whether and how much a Japanese American drank.
19946998	0	a	The oral health of disadvantaged social groups is worse at all the ages than that of the favored groups. If tooth decay prevalence decreases, this disease is still unequally distributed: 20% of the children, those with the weakest socio-economic statute (SES), concentrate 60% of the decays. Edentulism strikes significantly more people with weak SES. The inequalities of oral health reflect those of general health. Evidence of the inequalities in oral health is exposed even in the developed countries. Different models of intervention are presented: risk groups identification and targeting by specific programs; oral health community approach which includes socio-economic and public health measures aiming all the population; insurance approach to be combined with the preceding ones.
19550161	0	a	In sub-Saharan Africa, social factors such as religion have been linked with significant child morbidity and mortality. In religiously multi-denominational societies, one dominant religious group tends to subject the other groups to some form of economic, social or political discrimination, resulting in inequities in child survival. This study assessed the influence of individual- and community-level indicators underlying the association between religion and under-five mortality using multilevel logistic regression modelling. There is a significant association between religion and under-five mortality, which is considerably attenuated by sequentially adjusting for other risk factors. The effect of religion on under-five mortality is influenced by contextual-level characteristics of the community. Traditional religion is associated with under-five mortality, which is attributed to individual- and community-level indicators. Policy measures aimed at tackling child health inequities due to social factors such as religion need to consider the significance of the context in which mothers in different communities live, when healthcare interventions are being planned.
15552859	0	a	"The international congress called ""Birth Quality-Life Quality"" has been a key scientific event in Poland resulting in great changes in perinatal care. Improvements in the quality of care at maternity wards were not limited to purely medical issues. Attention became increasingly focused on psycho-social problems of women after parturition. Emphasis is now directed to support by the doctors and nurses and efforts to acquaint young mothers with the benefits of natural feeding, as well as to prepare them for taking good care of their child. Social support is seen as an important tool in the improvement of care over the mother and child. The present study has classified social support according to J. House as informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing. Informational support consists of methods to cope with specific problems that require delivery of information and teaching of new skills. Emotional support focuses on demonstrating care, winning trust and showing empathy. Instrumental support is reflected by delivery of goods or services to persons in need. Finally, worthing support aims at promoting self-esteem. The aim of this study was (1) to analyze the determinants of informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing support and to compare the needs for different types of support among primiparas and multiparas at an obstetrics ward with the rooming-in system; (2) to study correlations between availability and demand for social support; (3) to determine the expectations of patients as to sources of informational, emotional, instrumental and worthing support and as to methods and means used during delivery of informational support. The study was done in a group of 200 women giving birth at the Department of Obstetrics and Perinatology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin. A special questionnaire was developed to determine the needs for support. A modified Social Support Score was also used. It was found that the demand for all determinants of informational support was greater among primiparas than multiparas. In the lactation part, significant differences were noted for 25 determinants (Tab. 1). Similarly, significant differences were noted for 13 determinants of neonatal care and nursing (Tab. 2) and for 9 determinants of postpartum self-care (Tab. 3). A large demand for most determinants of emotional support was noted in the study and reference groups. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were revealed as to 3 determinants representing feeling of safety by the woman during hospitalization (Tab. 4). It was found that the demand for all determinants of instrumental support was greater among primiparas than multiparas (Tab. 5). There were no significant differences in worthing support needs (Tab. 6). Primiparas significantly more often expected informational and instrumental (p < 0.001), as well as emotional support (p < 0.05) (Tab. 7) in comparison to multiparas. The need for social support at a maternity ward was found to be independent of the available support (Tab. 8). The most frequently expected source of informational support is the nurse/midwife at the maternity ward, as well as the doctor at the ward and the outpatient unit. Worthing and instrumental support is usually expected of the husband and the family. The usual methods of delivering support include discussions, training, and demonstration. Brochures remain the preferred vehicle for delivering support (Tab. 9)."
7267860	1	a	This paper analyzes the decisions which take place at the entrance gate of the mental hospital-the organizational and client factors which influence the decision to admit. More specifically, it explores variations in the determinants between first admissions and readmissions. In the process, a theoretical model will be developed, based on a study of admissions to state hospitals, which may help explain several of the underlying and continuing obstacles confronting efforts to reduce readmissions.
11818587	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mental health among severe hearing-impaired adults in the Netherlands, separately by prelingual and postlingual age of onset. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-three face-to-face interviews were carried out by persons with practical skills in communication with hearing-impaired people. RESULTS: Of prelingually and postlingually deaf men, 27.1% and 27.7%, respectively, reported mental distress (scores on the General Health Questionnaire > or = 2), and among women these figures were 32.4% and 43.2%. These rates are higher than in the general population (men: 22.0%; women: 26.6%). Among the prelingual category, none of the demographic or hearing loss-related characteristics was associated with mental health status as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Of these variables, only additional impairment or serious illness was associated with the brief Symptom Checklist (SCL-8D). Among the postlingual category, female gender and equilibrium disturbance was associated with both the GHQ and SCL-8D, and additional impairment or serious illness with the SCL-8D. For both categories, the risk of mental distress also was higher in those with more communication problems, lower levels of self-esteem, and poorer acceptance of the hearing loss. Opportunities for identification in youth and social support were not associated with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health status differs between the hearing-impaired and the general population, but not as much as is sometimes suggested. Mental distress is greater in those in certain categories of the hearing-impaired.
17307955	0	a	This paper advocates that mental health promotion receive appropriate attention within health promotion. It is of great concern that, in practice, mental health promotion is frequently overlooked in health promotion programmes although the WHO definitions of health and the Ottawa Charter describe mental health as an integral part of health. It is suggested that more attention be given to addressing the determinants of mental health in terms of protective and risk factors for both physical and mental conditions, particularly in developing countries. Examples of evidence-based mental health programmes operating in widely diverse settings are presented to demonstrate that well designed interventions can contribute to the well-being of populations. It is advocated that particular attention be given to the intersectorial cooperation needed for this work.
19553025	0	a	Socioeconomic determinants of injury have been associated with risk of burn in the UK and USA, but the relative significance of this impact is largely unknown across Canadian populations. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to risk of burn in the province of British Columbia (BC) and identify the extent to which these findings are generalizable across both urban and rural population groups. Measures of SES were based on province-wide comparisons using data obtained from the Canada Census using the Vancouver Area Neighbourhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX). Results illustrate that the effects of SES and increased injury risk are substantial, though the most pronounced variations were exhibited across each SES stratum for urban areas and with less demonstrable effect when itemized by injury type within rural areas. Although conservative, the results from this study illustrate that burns disproportionately affect populations of greater relative socioeconomic disadvantage and continued efforts to also address social inequities and their link to injury incidence is likely to be more effective than targeting individual behavior alone when trying to reduce and eliminate their occurrence.
12822692	0	a	Data from the Health and Retirement Study, 1992-1994, were used to analyze (1) the prevalence and incidence of self-reported work disability among older working-age populations over a two-year period, and (2) the effect of the stability/changes in physical and functional health conditions, controlling for socioeconomic and occupational characteristics, on the stability/changes in self-reported work ability/disability. Findings show a high rate of transitions into and out of work-disabled status over the two-year period. Findings also show that, although objective physical and functional health problems and low self-ratings of health at wave 1 were significant determinants of self-reported work disability at wave 1, most subsequent changes in objective physical and functional health conditions over the two-year period were not significantly associated with the changes in self-report of work disability between wave 1 and wave 2. Especially, improved health conditions were not significantly associated with regained work ability between the two waves. Of the demographic variables, female gender significantly increased the likelihood of reporting work disability at wave 2, and being Black or Hispanic significantly decreased the likelihood of reporting regained work ability at wave 2. Research and policy implications of the findings are discussed.
16466523	0	a	This paper reviews several studies that investigated the potential role of genetic factors in determining fertility outcomes. Our review demonstrates convincingly that fertility contains genetic variance; that is, differences between humans in their genetic make-up affects their fertility outcomes and fertility-related behaviours. This finding is robust using both heritabilities and coefficients of genetic variation, and using both direct measures of fertility outcomes and also fertility precursors like fecundity, marriage, fertility expectations and attempts to get pregnant (proception). Moreover, genetic variance can change over short periods of time or across educational levels, specifically for females, and the relevance of genetic variance seems to increase during times of increasing reproductive choice.
11938363	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of admitted patients and the patterns of their service utilization over a decade from March 1988 to March 1998. METHODS: Prospective data compilation using a structured questionnaire, hospital records and follow-up observations at King Fahd Hospital of the University in Al-Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 1366 patients (683 of each sex) had 2217 admissions in 10 years. By the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition criteria, 19.5% had schizophrenia, 15.2% bipolar disorder, 9.9% depressive episodes, 8.6% acute and transient psychotic disorders, 7.7% adjustment disorders and 7.6% dissociative disorders. Males were more frequently admitted for schizophrenia and females for mood and anxiety disorders. Most non-Arab expatriates were diagnosed as acute and transient psychotic, stress-related or dissociative disorders. Re-hospitalizations constituted 28% of all admissions. The mean length of stay was 25 days per admission and 41 days per patient. The overall bed occupancy rate was 84.9%. A subgroup of 16.9% of patients, mostly with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, consumed 62.3% of the bed occupancy. CONCLUSION: Gender and immigration were the main determinants of variance in patient characteristics, nosological distribution and pattern of service use. More beds are needed. Psycho-educational programs should be intensified to reduce the social stigma and societal intolerance to mental patients. Active family involvement improves compliance and might reduce re-hospitalization rates. Heavy service consumers should be transferred to long-stay facilities.
16539960	0	a	Foreign migration in Spain is at present a priority in the social and demographic context the country. At a worldwide level, trends in the evolution of population and social, political and economical indicators, appear to maintain for the coming years, the present trends on migrations from poor countries to the rich ones. In the health area, considering migration as a relatively recent phenomena in Spain, and considering that is mainly constituted by young and healthy population, there are not still data available on the main health needs of migrants related to aging. Data from other countries with a longer migrant tradition, shows mental health disorders and social and cultural barriers for adaptation, as basic health determinants for older migrants. Related to the effects in the health system, the inclusion of the aging factor in general population and migrant needs, offer an optimistic panorama for future planning. Migrant aging in Spain, despite of its middle and long term perspective, do require a progressive adaptation of knowledge and resources to cover future needs. Considering this coming future, health professionals do need to be trained in intercultural skills and knowledge.
11966887	0	a	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceived oral health status and to explore its relationship with clinically assessed dental fluorosis among school children in Arusha town, Tanzania. METHODS: A total of 478 students (mean age 15.7 years) completed questionnaires administered in the schools during May to July 2000. Clinical photos of the upper and lower incisors were taken under field conditions. A total of 461 slides were rated under laboratory conditions. The severity of dental fluorosis in the permanent maxillary central incisors was assessed using the Thylstrup & Fejerskov Index (TFI). RESULTS: The prevalence of dental fluorosis at TFI score > or = 2 was 74%. A total of 67% of boys and 70% of girls rated their teeth as yellow to brown, 58% of boys and 68% of girls (P < 0.05) confirmed dissatisfaction with their dental appearance. Kappa values of 0.40-0.44 were obtained between dental fluorosis (TFI > or = 2) and self-reported discoloration. The proportion of school children reporting dissatisfaction with oral condition and dental appearance increased with increasing TFI scores. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis explained 21% and 32% of the variance in the dissatisfaction with oral condition and dental appearance scores; TFI scores 11% and 15% of variation in points, and social and psychological variables 11% and 17%. CONCLUSION: Whereas dental fluorosis at different diagnostic cut-off points impacts self-rated oral health negatively, social and personal factors are as important in shaping the responses of school children to oral condition and dental appearance.
11777189	0	a	The object of this study was to investigate how the information status with regard to diagnosis, in addition to social and clinical factors, influenced emotional functioning and quality of life in a group of cancer patients in Turkey. A consecutive sample of 100 cancer patients being treated for different diagnoses in a tertiary care centre were prospectively evaluated. Data on patient disease and social characteristics, clinical factors, and scores on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) were analysed by logistic regression models. A significant proportion (44%) of the patients did not know of their diagnosis of cancer. The scores on functional and symptom scales and global health status/quality of life according to QLQ-C30 did not differ according to the information given or not given on diagnosis. However, the independently significant determinants of good emotional functioning were male gender (P=0.002), low serum alanine transferase levels (P=0.025), good social functioning (P=0.002), and the absence of constipation (P=0.005). In Turkey, it is still common for cancer patients not to be informed of their diagnosis, and there is a great need to improve this situation. Honest disclosure of the truth does not worsen any dimension of quality of life in general or emotional functioning in particular. On the contrary, those with hepatic dysfunction, female gender, poor social functioning and constipation are the ones at increased risk of poor emotional functioning, and these patients may benefit from psychological screening.
3701583	1	a	Seventy-eight students enrolled in summer-session college courses were randomly assigned to serve either as counselors or as clients for a 20-min, role-played peer counseling session. All of the subjects completed a battery of standardized personality measures. Each counselor interacted with two clients. Prior to the sessions, the counselor was led to believe that one of the clients was especially introverted and that the other client was especially extraverted. Dependent measures were based on clients' change scores on a mood adjective rating scale administered before and after the peer counseling sessions. Analyses showed that counselors who were more successful at biasing their clients in the direction of their expectancies (a) scored higher on measures of Dogmatism, Nurturance, and Social Recognition, (b) scored lower on Impulsivity, and (c) were more likely to be women. Clients who were more susceptible to counselor bias scored higher on the Self-Monitoring Scale, the Self-Monitoring Other-Directedness subscale, and Social Recognition. These results are discussed in light of previous research and their implications for research on interpersonal expectancy effects.
3933036	1	a	The hypothesis was examined that the interaction of ethanol with the conditions under which it is administered may determine whether either preference or aversion for the drug develops. In Experiment 1, eight groups of food-deprived rats received injections of ethanol (175-1,400 mg/kg) in one environment and were later offered a choice between that environment and a different one previously associated with saline injections. Another eight groups were treated identically, except that food was available in both the saline and ethanol-paired environments. The groups given the drug without food showed no preference or aversion at low doses (175-700 mg/kg), but showed aversion at higher doses (1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg). When food was available, there was an increased preference for the environment paired with the 500 mg/kg dose and reduced aversion at the 1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg doses. In Experiment 2, placing two rats together increased each rat's preference for the environment associated with the other animal. However, rats pretreated with 500 mg/kg ethanol before being placed together showed a reduced preference for the environment associated with the drug and the other animal. Controls never paired with another rat showed no preference or aversion at the same ethanol dose. Thus, ethanol may interact with conditions such as the presence of food or another animal to determine final effects that are unique to those conditions.
15002889	0	a	BACKGROUND: Several models have been proposed to explain the causes of periodontal diseases. None have adopted the life-course approach. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between social, psychosocial and biological conditions experienced in early life and through the life course and gingival bleeding on probing. METHODS: A two-phase study was carried out in Brazil. In Phase I, 652 13-year-olds were clinically examined and interviewed. In Phase II, 311 families were randomly selected for an interview to collect information on the teenager's state at birth and selected impacts in their early years of life. Clinical examination included assessment of dental caries, periodontal and dental trauma status. The data analysis used logistic regression and the models were determined using stepwise procedure. FINDINGS: Adolescents who were born in a non-brick house, who were living in an overcrowded house at 13 years of age, those whose mother had less than 8 years of education, who were at a lower school grade for their age, those who reported high levels of paternal punishment and those who were from reconstituted families were significantly more likely to experience high levels of bleeding gums after probing. CONCLUSION: Early life and life-course experiences were important determinants of the level of gingival bleeding after probing in adolescents.
18226218	0	a	BACKGROUND: Europe has experienced warmer summers in the past two decades and there is a need to describe the determinants of heat-related mortality to better inform public health activities during hot weather. We investigated the effect of high temperatures on daily mortality in three cities in Europe (Budapest, London, and Milan), using a standard approach. METHODS: An ecological time-series study of daily mortality was conducted in three cities using Poisson generalized linear models allowing for over-dispersion. Secular trends in mortality and seasonal confounding factors were controlled for using cubic smoothing splines of time. Heat exposure was modelled using average values of the temperature measure on the same day as death (lag 0) and the day before (lag 1). The heat effect was quantified assuming a linear increase in risk above a cut-point for each city. Socio-economic status indicators and census data were linked with mortality data for stratified analyses. RESULTS: The risk of heat-related death increased with age, and females had a greater risk than males in age groups > or =65 years in London and Milan. The relative risks of mortality (per degrees C) above the heat cut-point by gender and age were: (i) Male 1.10 (95%CI: 1.07-1.12) and Female 1.07 (1.05-1.10) for 75-84 years, (ii) M 1.10 (1.06-1.14) and F 1.08 (1.06-1.11) for > or = or =85 years in Budapest (> or =24 degrees C); (i) M 1.03 (1.01-1.04) and F 1.07 (1.05-1.09), (ii) M 1.05 (1.03-1.07) and F 1.08 (1.07-1.10) in London (> or =20 degrees C); and (i) M 1.08 (1.03-1.14) and F 1.20 (1.15-1.26), (ii) M 1.18 (1.11-1.26) and F 1.19 (1.15-1.24) in Milan (> or =26 degrees C). Mortality from external causes increases at higher temperatures as well as that from respiratory and cardiovascular disease. There was no clear evidence of effect modification by socio-economic status in either Budapest or London, but there was a seemingly higher risk for affluent non-elderly adults in Milan. CONCLUSION: We found broadly consistent determinants (age, gender, and cause of death) of heat related mortality in three European cities using a standard approach. Our results are consistent with previous evidence for individual determinants, and also confirm the lack of a strong socio-economic gradient in heat health effects currently in Europe.
17242835	0	a	Agriculture and health are linked in many ways. First, agriculture is essential for good health: it produces the world's food, fibre and materials for shelter; in many countries it is also an important source of livelihood among the poor. At the same time, agriculture can be linked with poor health, including malnutrition, malaria, foodborne illnesses, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), livestock-related diseases, chronic diseases and occupational ill-health. Health also affects agriculture: people's health status influences the demand for agricultural outputs, and in agricultural communities, poor health reduces work performance, reducing income and productivity and perpetuating a downward spiral into ill-health. This paper presents an overview of the bidirectional links between agriculture and health with a focus on the developing world. It develops a conceptual framework that brings together the various links between agriculture and health into a single broad framework. The framework comprises the core components of the agricultural supply chain (producers, systems and outputs), key health concerns and the mechanisms of common interaction between the agricultural and health components: income, labour, environment and access -- all key social determinants of health. These links between agriculture and health present an opportunity for the two sectors to work together to find solutions to each other's problems. Yet the health and agricultural sectors remain poorly coordinated. Leadership from global health and agricultural institutions is needed to build policies and good governance to facilitate integration, while capacity building is needed at all levels to help translate the conceptual links into comprehensive action on the ground. Health and agricultural researchers likewise need to work more closely together to achieve common goals.
19850895	0	a	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Riks-Stroke, the Swedish Stroke Register, was used to explore patient characteristics and stroke services as determinants of patient dissatisfaction with acute in-hospital care. METHODS: All 79 hospitals in Sweden admitting acute stroke patients participate in Riks-Stroke. During 2001 to 2007, 104,876 patients (87% of survivors) responded to a follow-up questionnaire 3 months after acute stroke; this included questions on satisfaction with various aspects of stroke care. RESULTS: The majority (>90%) were satisfied with acute in-hospital stroke care. Dissatisfaction was closely associated with outcome at 3 months. Patient who were dependent regarding activities of daily living, felt depressed, or had poor self-perceived general health were more likely to be dissatisfied. Dissatisfaction with global acute stroke care was linked to dissatisfaction with other aspects of care, including rehabilitation and support by community services. Patients treated in stroke units were less often dissatisfied than patients in general wards, as were patients who had been treated in a small hospital (vs medium or large hospitals) and patient who had participated in discharge planning. In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictor of dissatisfaction with acute care was poor outcome (dependency regarding activities of daily living, depressed mood, poor self-perceived health). CONCLUSIONS: Dissatisfaction with in-hospital acute stroke care is part of a more extensive complex comprising poor functional outcome, depressive mood, poor self-perceived general health, and dissatisfaction not only with acute care but also with health care and social services at large. Several aspects of stroke care organization are associated with a lower risk of dissatisfaction.
18484442	0	a	While imposing research has been conducted with respect to the biological determinants of painful menstruation, little is known about the psychosocial factors, including work-related stress that might influence menstrual pain. We conducted a study in which we aimed to determine besides the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea whether menstrual pain was associated with job control, co-worker social support, job security and dissatisfaction with the job. Data of 2772 working women aged 18-55 years, participants in the Hungarostudy 2002 nation-wide representative survey was analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between work stress factors and menstrual pain. Altogether 15.5% of women reported to experience menstrual pain that limits their daily activity. Low job control, low co-worker social support and low job security were found to be associated with a higher risk for menstrual pain even after controlling for the effect of age, educational attainment, parity status, smoking, body-mass index and treatment for gynecological problems. Job dissatisfaction was also related to dysmenorrhoea, albeit not significantly. The relationship between work-related psychosocial factors and painful menstruation deserves further investigation in order to determine the possible pathways of this association.
14563081	0	a	Conservatives are taking aim at the field of public health, targeting its efforts to understand and control environmental and social causes of disease. Richard Epstein and others contend that these efforts in fact undermine people's health and well-being by eroding people's incentives to create economic value. Public health, they argue, should stick to its traditional task--the struggle against infectious diseases. Because markets are not up to the task of controlling the transmission of infectious disease, Epstein says, coercive government action is required. But market incentives, not state action, he asserts, represent our best hope for controlling the chronic illnesses that are the main causes of death in industrialized nations. In this article, we assess Epstein's case. We consider his claims about the market's capabilities and limits, the roles of personal choice and social influences in spreading disease, andthe relationship between health and economic inequality. We argue that Epstein's critique of public health over-reaches, oversimplifies, and veils his political and moral preferences behind seemingly objective claims about the economics of disease control and the determinants of disease spread. Public health policy requires political and moral choices, but these choices should be transparent.
17151800	0	a	Engagement is a core component of effective educational programs for children with autism. Analysis of 711 naturalistic goal-directed classroom behaviors of four school-age children with autism and four comparable children with Down syndrome (DS) was conducted. The definition of engagement was expanded to include child compliance and congruence. A main finding was both child and environmental factors influenced type of engagement. Children with DS produced 20% more goal-directed behaviors that were both congruent and compliant compared to children with autism. Large group instruction was associated with less congruent engagement but more compliant engagement for children with autism. These findings suggest specific types of engagement which may lead to advances in developing evidence-based practices for specific developmental disorders.
20069167	0	a	The 1st National Environmental Health Conference, in December 2009, presents countless challenges to the field of Public Health. It debates key concepts as development, sustainability, production and consumption processes, democracy and public policies; advocating for innovative, interdisciplinary and intersectorial aspects of Environmental Health. The Conference recovers and articulates important themes for the Public Health, and also indicates the need of reflecting the socio-environmental determinants of health at the present time, in order to provide progresses in the construction of guidelines and actions to health surveillance and promotion. This article discusses the characteristics of the Brazilian model of development, its impacts and conflicts within social, environmental and health fields. We use theoretical and empirical contributions from the fields of Ecological Economy and Political Ecology, as well as, experiences of cooperation with the Brazilian Network on Environmental Justice and several social movements. Two cases are discussed in more detail: the first related to agribusiness and the use of pesticides, and the other about the expansion of the iron and steel industry in Brazil. We conclude proposing some elements that could be incorporated by a research agenda committed to the debate about the 'socioenvironmental crisis'.
2801277	1	a	This study investigated the relationships among family environment, demographic measures, the decisions made by unintentionally pregnant adolescents regarding postdelivery plans and the certainty with which these decisions were made. Subjects were 175 pregnant adolescents, ages 14 through 22, who intended to carry their pregnancies to term. Greater uncertainty was associated with living with both natural parents or with mother only. Higher levels of negative affect were related to lower levels of perceived family cohesion, independence, expressiveness, and intellectual-cultural orientation. Age, trimester of pregnancy, and family constellation also were related to levels of negative affect. Discriminant analysis revealed that subjects choosing adoption were more likely to be older and to be white than were those choosing to keep the child. They also tended to perceive higher levels of expressiveness and independence in their families. The implications of these findings for the delivery of services and for future research efforts in this area are discussed.
7580222	1	a	Experimental studies indicate instructions (told received nicotine > told received placebo) and drug history (exsmokers > never-smokers) increase the degree to which the stimulus effects of nicotine will serve as a reinforcer in humans. Cross-study comparisons and correlational data suggest schedule (concurrent > single access to nicotine and placebo), duration of exposure (longer > shorter exposure), and setting (therapeutic > experimental settings) also increase the reinforcing effect of nicotine. Empirical study of when and how environmental factors control the reinforcing effects of nicotine is crucial to specifying multicausal models of tobacco dependence.
2576262	1	a	Historically, concerns about rapidly growing populations and resources that could not support them persuaded governments of developing countries to initiate family planning programs. Between the early 1960s and the early 1980s, the number of governments supporting these programs increased from 7 to approximately 120. Today, 52 governments in developing countries provide support to family planning programs because of the demographic rationale, and 65 governments do so because of human rights and health considerations: The effective use of family planning significantly diminishes infant, child, and maternal mortality and morbidity. Forty-five percent of married women of reproductive age worldwide are practicing contraception today; however, 69% do so in East Asia and only 11% in Africa. Female sterilization and use of intrauterine devices are the most popular methods in developing countries, and oral contraceptives and condoms, in developed countries. Of the 400 million women of reproductive age, 140 million (35%) are relying on family planning methods requiring male cooperation and less than 60 million (15%) are using oral contraceptives. More than half of these oral contraceptive users live in four countries: the United States, Brazil, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany. On the other hand, the percentage of currently married women, aged 15 to 19 years, who have never used any form of contraception is as high as 85% to 90% in Bangladesh, Sudan, and Pakistan. In many developing countries, there is a statistically significant correlation between women's use of contraception and years of education. Other important factors influencing contraceptive prevalence include the established or perceived side effects of currently available methods, the status of women, the political climate, and a number of behavioral and social determinants.
6419709	1	a	This double-blind, controlled study of XYY and XXY men found in a birth cohort of 4,591 tall men born in Copenhagen assessed evidence of delinquent and aggressive behavior and explored the role of hormonal determinants in the behavioral and psychological differences noted among groups. Information from social records, a structured psychological interview, and projective tests did not support the notion that men with sex chromosome anomalies are particularly violent or aggressive. Hormonally, XYY men had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than matched control groups. In contrast, XXY men had higher levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin, but low concentrations of testosterone. There was a significantly positive relation among all subjects as well as XY controls alone between plasma testosterone level and evidence of criminal convictions. A proportionate increase in testosterone levels was noted when subjects were divided into nondelinquents, delinquents without violent convictions, and delinquents with violent convictions. The relation between testosterone level and criminal behavior was not reflected in measures of aggression derived from the psychological interview and projective tests. There was no specific evidence that testosterone is a mediating factor in the criminal behavior of XYY men.

4049019	1	a	This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
16900304	0	a	BACKGROUND: Social network has considerable impact on physical and mental health. Patients experiencing first-episode psychosis early in adult life may experience severe problems concerning development and maintenance of their social network. METHODS: A total of 547 first-episode psychotic patients (18-45) were randomised to standard or integrated treatment, (ACT, social skills training and family intervention), and followed up at 2 years. RESULTS: Service use or psychotic symptom score did not influence the social network size, measured after the first 2 years of treatment. Small network size was associated with long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), poor premorbid adjustment, male gender and severe negative symptoms. The number of friends at 2-year follow-up was predicted by age, A-level status, negative symptoms and number of friends at entry, while the determinants for number of family contacts were age, gender, disorganised dimension and family contacts at entry. CONCLUSIONS: Premorbid functioning, network size at entry and DUP is closely related to small social network size. The integrated psychosocial treatment programme was not sufficient to address this problem.

Food behaviour has social and historical determinants and forms accordingly to the dialectic relation of biological, social and economic conditions. Hunger, thirst and appetite are perceived as nutritional need which results from the requirements of energy, nutrients and liquid, and is satisfied by the food behaviour in conformity with the actual material potential, situational influences, subjective ideas, interests, attitudes and knowledge as well as other psychical properties. Consequently, food behaviour is rich in variations with dynamic and conservative features. Motives as well as will components are essential constituent conditions of food behaviour. For this reason, empirical studies arteo provide psychological cognition concerning the subjective reflection of the nutritional requirements, the requirement-standard integration, the sensation of stimulation and the decision-making in food behaviour, the ultimate goal being to deduce measures for food behaviour guidance.
2558204	1	a	To identify factors associated with the decision to consult with dyspepsia, patients with dyspepsia were identified from a postal survey in the community. A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.
31968907	1	a	"Results of a long-term field study on the ecology and social organization of two groups of black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus chamek) in Peru are reported. Demography, ranging patterns, and activity budgets provide insight into some of the proximate determinants of fission-fusion social organization in this species and illustrate the different strategies used by males and females to gain access to critical resources. Longitudinal data on known individuals provide evidence for male natal philopatry and female emigration at sexual maturity in this population. Interbirth intervals are long (mean = 34.5 months) in comparison with most other primate species, and 5 of 15 infants seen within a few days of birth died or disappeared before they were a year old. Home ranges are large (150-250 ha) and fairly discrete; overlap with neighboring groups is on the order of 10-15%. Males and females differed substantially in their ranging patterns; females, particularly those with infants, restricted much of their ranging to a ""core area"" 20-33% the size of the total group range, whereas males ranged more evenly over the entire area occupied by the group. Daily path length varied over almost an order of magnitude from 465 m to 4,070 m, with a mean of 1977 m. Males spent more time traveling and less time feeding than most females. These results are compared with those obtained in previous studies of Ateles and with similar data from other primate species to assess their implications for the evolution of fission-fusion sociality in spider monkeys. The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of very similar social organizations in spider monkeys and chimpanzees are discussed."
10632790	0	a	As the significance of social determinants of health has been revealed and the socio-environmental perspective of health promotion has become prominent, family nurses have attempted to move away from disease-treatment models of practice towards emancipatory, health promoting practice. This paper describes a multidisciplinary team's pedagogical experience of developing emancipatory family health promoting practices. The discussion includes a description of the significant educational processes that supported the development of health promoting family practice and an outline of the transformative changes the team members experienced as they evolved their health promoting practices.
3384511	1	a	Empirical data on Japanese American drinking behavior are scarce. The present study was a random sample (N = 295) of households in Los Angeles with Japanese surnames. Japanese Americans born in the United States tended to drink less than those born in Japan. The study also observed significant gender differences in Japanese American drinking behavior which were attributed to ascribed social roles. Other demographic and social determinants of drinking were examined through two logistic regression models. The first model predicted drinking (as opposed to abstaining), while the other distinguished heavy drinkers from those who drank alcohol in more moderate amounts. Potential reference groups (e.g., parents, friends, church groups, etc.) were often significant in predicting whether and how much a Japanese American drank.
15847699	0	a	This debut editorial of Globalization and Health introduces the journal, briefly delineating its goals and objectives and outlines its scope of subject matter. 'Open Access' publishing is expected to become an increasingly important format for peer reviewed academic journals and that Globalization and Health is 'Open Access' is appropriate. The rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold:Firstly: Globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease. The determinants of health - be they a SARS virus or a predilection for fatty foods - have joined us in our global mobility. Driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies, the phenomenon of 'access' is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing.Secondly: Understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings. Health is one such barometer. It is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve.And lastly: In as much as globalization can have an effect on health, it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the AIDS pandemic.A balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health (and health systems) are neither universally good nor bad, but rather context specific. If the dialogue pertaining to globalization is to be directed or biased in any direction, then it must be this: that we consider the poor first.
12281022	1	a	This paper analyzes the migration phenomenon within a framework that treats migration movements as continuous loops, from the country of origin to the destination and back. Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of birth weight on body composition and fat distribution in a group of Spanish adolescents. Current body composition was assessed by both skinfold thickness and dual X-ray absorptiometry in 234 adolescents born at term (140 girls and 94 boys), now aged 13-18 y and living in the city of Zaragoza. Relative fat distribution was estimated using the ratio of the subscapular to triceps skinfolds (S:T). Birth weight and gestational age were assessed by a questionnaire. Birth weight was inversely associated with the S:T ratio (P < 0.05) in boys and directly associated with bone mass (P < 0.01) and fat-free mass (P < 0.05) in girls. This association was independent of factors such as age, Tanner stage, gestational age, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and height. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that impaired fetal growth, measured by birth weight, may be related to central fat distribution in boys and decreased bone and fat-free mass in girls.
3566318	1	a	We followed 183 infants for two years, 31 of whom were breast fed less than three and a half months (median 70 days; short breast feeding group) and a further 31 of whom were exclusively breast fed for more than nine months (long breast feeding group). We assessed heredity for atopy, number of infections, and duration of breast feeding as determinants of atopy. During the first year of life 14 infants has signs of atopy. During the second year parents reported signs of atopy in a further 31. Heredity was the only significant predictor of atopy. Atopy was seen in 33% of infants with a positive heredity and in 16% without family history for atopy. The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13). Duration of breast feeding did not associate with incidence of respiratory infections. Diarrhoea was more common in the short breast feeding group than in the long breast feeding group during the first year of life. We conclude that prolonging exclusive breast feeding from the median of 70 days to nine months did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy and respiratory tract infections.
17955705	0	a	This paper analyses the determinants of self-reported health in Ireland, conditioning self-reported health on a set of socio-economic, labour market and social capital variables. Ireland has the highest self-reported health rate in Europe, a finding backed-up by other studies. Data were derived from the 2002 and 2005 European Social survey. The full 87,915 observations from both rounds were pooled and used to estimate mean self-rated health across Europe. The Irish data were isolated, totalling 2,049 individuals for 2002 and 2,286 individuals for 2005. The 2002 data were used to analyse the determinants of subjective health state, as it had a richer array of social capital variables. The results demonstrate statistically significant effects of income on self-reported health that are robust to different statistical specifications and statistically significant though modest effects of social capital variables such as associational membership and frequency of social meeting and labour market variables such as being on a limited as opposed to permanent contract.
15266192	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of child-, parent- and family-related factors on the use of and need for mental health services by 12 years of age. METHOD: A prospective population-based questionnaire study of 1,287 first-born children was launched in Finland in 1985. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was completed by 1,086 parents when the children were aged 3 years. At the age of 12, the CBCL, the Youth Self-Report, and other potential determinants of service need and use were obtained from 908 parents and 900 children (80% response rate). RESULTS: Of the total sample, 7.2% had used professional services, and 3.3% had needed services without obtaining them. Elevated scores on the age 3 CBCL Total Problems and Externalizing scale predicted independently later service use but not perceived need of services. In cross-sectional data at age 12, parental ratings of the child's problem behavior were associated with both the need for and use of services. Poor social competence and parental distress were independently associated with use of services. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing behavior problems in early childhood and evaluating family stress factors are important in social and health care systems designed for children.
14978603	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary characteristics were studied to gain insights into determinants of total diet quality and diversity in a weighted sample of 460 participants aged 55-74 (53% female) from the 1990 Enqu te qu b coise sur la nutrition (EQN) dataset. METHODS: Dietary data consisted of an interviewer-administered 24-hour recall and food frequency questionnaire, and a self-administered questionnaire on dietary behaviours, attitudes and perceptions. 24-hour recall data were coded into food groups as described in Canada's Food Guide for Healthy Eating. Diet quality was scored using the categorical Dietary Diversity Score (DDS, range 0-4) and continuous Dietary Adequacy Score (DAS, range 0-18). A second nonconsecutive recall (10% of subjects) permitted correction of food group portions for intraindividual variability and subsequent calculation and validation of usual DDS and DAS. Relationships were examined between the scores and independent variables. Forward leastwise logistic regession (DDS) and stepwise multiple regression (DAS) analyses were conducted with independent variables showing significant bivariate relationships. RESULTS: Among men, breakfast consumption and eating commercially-prepared meals were positively associated with usual DDS, but poor social support and supplement use negatively predicted this score. Eating fewer than 3 meals daily, smoking, and dietary supplement use were negative predictors of usual DAS (r2=0.155). Among women, eating commercial foods was a negative predictor of usual DDS, as was preferring overweight to depriving themselves of favourite foods. Reporting that health concerns influenced food choices and disagreeing with the statement that effort is needed to have a nice body were positive determinants of usual DAS in women. On the other hand, eating fewer than 3 meals daily negatively predicted this dietary index (r2 = 0.162). CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in predictors of diet quality suggest the need to target nutrition health promotion to the needs of older men and women to encourage optimal eating habits.
16051408	0	a	Several scholars have put forward the view that the estimates by Rodgers [(1979). Income and inequality as determinants of mortality: An international cross-section analysis. Population Studies, 33 (2), 343-351], Flegg [(1982). Inequality of income, illiteracy and medical care as determinants of infant mortality in underdeveloped countries. Population Studies, 36 (3), 441-458] and Waldmann [(1992). Income distribution and infant mortality. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107 (4), 1283-1302] showing a negative cross-country association between income inequality and population health, cannot be replicated from recent data. In view of the importance of this matter, the present study further examines the issue from the most recent, and probably more accurate, data for the largest cross-country sample used in this line of research. The main conclusion is that the negative cross-country association between income inequality and good health, reported by Rodgers, Flegg, and Waldmann, is replicated very well. The different findings indicated by some scholars may have been due to their samples or the models being unusual. Therefore, the recent skepticism about the existence of such a negative association needs to be reconsidered. Several additional points are also noted. First, income inequality shows significance even after an index of ethnic heterogeneity is included. Second, ethnic heterogeneity itself has a negative association with population health. Third, income inequality retains significance in the presence of a measure of social capital. Fourth, however, the association between the measure of social capital and population health appears weak. Fifth, a simple analysis does not support the view that the positive association between income inequality and infant mortality in less developed countries (LDCs) may just be a reflection of the role of poverty. Finally, there is some support for the proposition that while income may be relatively more important for health in LDCs, the role of income inequality may be stronger in developed economies.
2529668	1	a	"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers."
3765864	1	a	"The purpose of this research is to know more about the factors determining the decision to see a doctor. Especially the influence of characteristics of the delivery system (e.g. differences between urban and rural regions) and characteristics of users (e.g. social class) are investigated. In this article the conceptual frame of the study is described. The model is based on assumptions of the action-decision-theory. It structures the process of decision and action into four phases: the first two, perception and interpretation, are summarized as ""process of attention""; the subsequent ones, coping and evaluation, as ""process of acting"". The model describes the social system (the total of demographic, socio-structural and socio-economic variables) and the memory system (contained within the individual life history) as mediating factors influencing the decision to act."
6723941	1	a	As the number of Canadian women who have had induced abortions increases with each succeeding year, the number at risk--and the actual incidence--of repeat abortion also increases. Some researchers have argued that women who have more than one induced abortion are less well adjusted, others that they are less willing to use contraceptives, perhaps because of anxiety about sexuality. Still others have suggested that repeat abortion is unrelated to the psychology or attitudes of individual women, but rather is an inevitable result of imperfect contraceptives, imperfect contraceptive practice and the availability of legal abortion for the termination of unwanted pregnancies. A group of 580 women seeking abortions were interviewed at the Montreal General Hospital and given a number of psychological tests. About one in five of these women were having repeat abortions. The women having repeat abortions were older, less likely to be married and more tolerant of legal abortion than were women having their first abortions. They also had intercourse more frequently than the first-abortion patients. Women obtaining a repeat abortion were slightly more likely to have been using contraceptives at the time they became pregnant, but they did not differ from first-abortion patients in the types of methods that they used. On no other social or demographic characteristics, measures of psychological adjustment or attitudes about sexuality were there any important differences between the groups. A more complex statistical analysis reveals that the two most important factors differentiating first-abortion and repeat-abortion patients are age and coital frequency--both of which are variables that reflect added exposure to the risk of unintended pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
18430691	0	a	This review examines the impact of Global Health Initiatives (GHIs) on health equity, focusing on low- and middle-income countries. It is a summary of a literature review commissioned by the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. GHIs have emerged during the past decade as a mechanism in development assistance for health. The review focuses on three GHIs, the US President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the World Bank's Multi-country AIDS Programme (MAP) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. All three have leveraged significant amounts of funding for their focal diseases - together these three GHIs provide an estimated two-thirds of external resources going to HIV/AIDS. This paper examines their impact on gender equity. An analysis of these Initiatives finds that they have a significant impact on health equity, including gender equity, through their processes of programme formulation and implementation, and through the activities they fund and implement, including through their impact on health systems and human resources. However, GHIs have so far paid insufficient attention to health inequities. While increasingly acknowledging equity, including gender equity, as a concern, Initiatives have so far failed to adequately translate this into programmes that address drivers of health inequity, including gender inequities. The review highlights the comparative advantage of individual GHIs, which point to an increased need for, and continued difficulties in, harmonisation of activities at country level. On the basis of this comparative analysis, key recommendations are made. They include a call for equity-sensitive targets, the collection of gender-disaggregated data, the use of policy-making processes for empowerment, programmes that explicitly address causes of health inequity and impact assessments of interventions' effect on social inequities.
15793014	0	a	Community-academic partnerships in the training of doctors offer unique learning opportunities of great importance. Such partnerships can induce a paradigm shift such that physicians view community as a teaching resource and partner rather than as a passive recipient of services or solely as a placement site. The authors describe a model of a community-academic partnership in New York City, begun in 1995, in which, for training and service, pediatric residents are integrally involved in a community-based program. Principles adapted from the Community-Campus Partnerships for Health's principles of partnership provide a framework for portraying the essential elements of developing and maintaining the partnership. The authors explain the clashes that may arise between partners and show how the principles of partnership guide partnership members in working and learning within a setting that by its nature entails conflict and inequality. This report is based on the knowledge gained from the structured reflections of both members of this partnership: the residency program at a large academic health center and the community-based social service organization. Such partnerships provide the training ground for the development of physicians who understand the social and cultural determinants of health and constructively use community agencies' input in promoting child health and well-being. Within this framework, community-based organizations are not solely service providers but become educators of physicians-in-training who, with new knowledge gained through the partnership, more effectively contribute to the overall health of the communities they serve.

2641946	1	a	A follow-up study of 58 patients with spinal cord injury was conducted. As measure of function the Barthel index was used. There was correlation between functional capacity and ability of self-care as well as some social determinants. However, no association was found with employment rate or certain other determinants of independent living, such as going on a holiday. We conclude that the severity of the lesion is a fundamental factor in determining the outcome, but factors related to personal and psychosocial variables, not easily measured, also have great influence on the rehabilitation process.
11522812	0	a	OBJECTIVES: This study examined factors associated with unmet need for care among persons aged 18 and older who need help with daily living tasks. The analysis focused on two types of unmet need: not enough (or inadequate) help and no help at all. METHODS: The authors used multinomial logistic regression to examine differences between persons with long-term care needs who (a) had all their needs met; (b) received inadequate help; and (c) received no help at all. Data were from the Adult Followback to the National Health Interview Survey on Disability (NHIS-D) for 1994 and 1995. RESULTS: The determinants of inadequate care versus no care differed with respect to age, gender, level of impairment, and insurance status. Whereas age and gender were important in determining inadequate care, insurance coverage and availability of social support were key factors related to a situation of no care. DISCUSSION: The present study demonstrates that the characteristics of groups reporting inadequate care versus no care, and the factors associated with these situations, are quite different. Nevertheless, the most important demographic risk factors for both types of unmet need mirror demographic groups currently on the increase in the U.S. population.

Data used were from the 1991 Brazilian Demographic Census and comprised 121,060 women aged 15-49 residing in Rio de Janeiro. Two alternative statistical methods were used to calculate the risk of death: the widely used Brass method (an indirect estimate which assesses population risks) and a case-control study (which assesses individual risks). The study also focused on the importance of indicators of human and social capital, the lack of which may explain the higher risk of death among children and adolescents. Lack of education was found to be a major determinant of mortality at young ages. Residence in a favela (shantytown), families in which mothers were the head of the family, and a lower median level of income were found to be significant determinants of mortality among vulnerable populations in Brazil. However, religion was not found to be as important a predictor of high mortality.
11731714	0	a	INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that social determinants not directly involved in the disease process may be implicated in the timing of dementia diagnosis. This study explores the relationship between a patient's living situation and the severity of dementia at diagnosis. METHODS: Data were collected from the baseline interviews of 1,325 patients with cognitive decline enrolled in the Consortium for the Investigation of Vascular Impairment of Cognition study. Data collected included: age, sex, living situation and scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), the Functional Rating Scale (FRS), the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). Living situation was grouped as: (1) lives alone, (2) lives with spouse, (3) lives with child, relative or other and (4) lives in a nursing home. A general linear model univariate analysis was used to compare patients by their respective living situations for differences in mean scores on each of the 4 measures of dementia severity. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of both unadjusted data and data adjusted for age, sex and CIRS scores showed significant differences among the groups. Those who lived alone were diagnosed at an earlier stage (mean scores: MMSE 21.4, GDS 3.6, FRS 20.0, DAD 29.8) followed by those who lived with a spouse (mean scores: MMSE 20.5, GDS 3.7, FRS 20.4, DAD 28.0), those who lived with a child or other (mean scores: MMSE 19.3, GDS 3.9, FRS 22.5, DAD 24.9) and finally those who lived in a nursing home (mean scores: MMSE 15.2, GDS 4.8, FRS 27.5, DAD 16.9). CONCLUSION: Living situation is related to the severity of dementia at diagnosis. Primary care providers should have a low threshold for case-finding in older adults who live with family or friends.
10268448	1	a	A national study found similarities in levels of job satisfaction, burnout, and intent to change jobs among child welfare, community mental health, and family service workers, although the determinants varied by field of practice. The data suggest that a universal approach aimed at increasing job satisfaction and reducing burnout is likely to be of minimal value; interventions must be conducted within each setting and must attend to the idiosyncracies of each group.
2746717	1	a	The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.
3232579	1	a	Self-esteem, maternal employment, and work-family plans are examined in relation to sex role orientations of late adolescents. Data are analyzed from questionnaires administered to 387 males and females. It was found that future work-family plans were closely tied to sex role orientations of adolescents of both sexes. However, self-esteem, evaluation of the relative difficulty of male-female sex roles, and projected childlessness were salient to sex role attitudes of females but not of males. Positive evaluations of self were related to non-traditional sex role orientations among females. Maternal employment differentially affected male and female children. Sons of women in high-status occupations were reluctant to get involved in a two-career family with children. Mothers' occupational status had little influence on the plans or sex role attitudes of daughters. The results indicate that future research should investigate whether maternal employment in high-status occupations, while providing a wider range of acceptable models for girls, may serve as a negative model for boys.
18198004	0	a	This paper examines factors that may predispose unmarried and unemployed out-of-school youth to risky sexual behaviour. Data for analysis were derived from the Behaviour Surveillance Survey carried out in Kenya in late 2002. A total of 6129 male and female unmarried and unemployed out-of-school youth in the age range 15-24 years were successfully interviewed. However, for this paper only a sample of 3961 comprising sexually experienced youth in the 12 months preceding the survey was used. Methods of analysis included descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression. Results for males indicate that factors associated with low and high risk were whether they had fathered a child, district of residence and frequency of alcohol use, while current age and age at first sexual debut stood out for those with low risk alone. For females the district of residence and age of partner at sexual debut were the factors that predisposed them to low-risk sexual behaviour, while for high risk the district of residence, current age and ever being pregnant were significant. The results indicate that for these youth, contextual and probably social factors appear to be the main determinants of risky sexual behaviour for both males and females. The findings also support those of other studies that link risky sexual behaviour among youth, especially males, to alcohol consumption. Programmes for intervention therefore need to focus on these aspects. There is also a need for studies that can look at district-specific factors for more focused interventions.
2595827	1	a	With the object of describing how their own health is experienced, the social circumstances and sexual behaviour in anti-HIV-positive homosexual and bisexual men, an anonymous questionnaire to be completed by the recipient was distributed in 1987 in connection with a placebo controlled investigation to assess the value of isoprinosin (Imunovir) in preventing the development of AIDS. 87% participated. Among the total of 85 participants, 78% considered that their health was good, 29% met family members and 75% friends at least once weekly. Fifty patients (65%) felt stressed in their daily lives which was definitely higher than in the normal population. All of the participants had altered their sexual behaviour in a manner which reduced the risk of HIV-transmission but 18 (21%) had had sexual behaviour known to transmit HIV within the past year. This behaviour occurred more frequently in young persons (p = 0.09) and in smokers (p = 0.03). In addition, no connection could be demonstrated between a series of possible determinants for this, which may, however, be due to the limited extent of the material. It is demonstrated that awareness that one is infected with HIV does not eliminate dangerous sexual behaviour in all cases.
16633494	0	a	It is as futile to ask how much of the phenotype of an organism is due to nature and how much to its nurture as it is to determine how much of the area of a rectangle is due to its length and how much to its height. Phenotype and area are joint products. The spectacular success of genomics, unfortunately, threatens to re-awaken belief in genes as the principal determinants of human behavior. This paper develops the thesis that gene expression is modified by environmental inputs and that the impact of the environment on a given organism is modified by its genome. Genes set the boundaries of the possible; environments parse out the actual.
7376236	1	a	Survey data from women in pregnancy risk in Venezuela and Kenya are used to examine the determinants of contraceptive intention, use, and the intention/use consistency. The five ranking determinants of contraceptive use are: intention to contracept, social support, accessibility, conjugal communication, and desire for additional children. All five determinants have direct and additive effects on contraception, but their relative impacts vary significantly between the two cultures. Contraceptive intention and use are highly consistent, while level of consistency varies significantly between the two samples and within each by various combinations of ranking variables and by parity. Major research and policy implications of the results are reviewed.
7155014	1	a	"Schizophrenia is a human behavioral variant with a 1% phenotypic population frequency. As the major ""mental illness"" affecting human beings, it has defied all previous attempts to explain, predict or prevent its devastating clinical manifestations. In addition to unidentified nongenetic determinants, schizophrenia has genetic determinants in the absence of known specific neuropathological or biochemical correlates found in other entities conceptualized as genetic diseases. The fitness of schizophrenics is 0.7 of nonschizophrenics, and a 1% phenotypic population frequency is difficult to explain by mutation rate alone. An ethological theory of schizophrenia has been developed in which the genetic determinant is the nocturnal character of a postulated polymorphic trait termed when active. The nongenetic determinant is simply a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light. According to the author's theory, a schizophrenic individual could be processing information while awake and exposed to light with a brain that is processing information as though he were asleep. The empirical data from which the theory is constructed are presented. THe theory is capable of explaining clinical schizophrenia within an ethological paradigm and makes several predictions, the most significant of which is that the absence of a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light should ameliorate the major symptoms of clinical schizophrenia in individuals who possess its genetic determinant."
11048582	0	a	Aiming to analyze the mild to moderate growth retardation associate factors in children at school age, a case control study was conducted with 153 pairs of seven and eight years old children from public schools of the outskirts of the city. The cases were defined as children with a height for age(H/A) between -1 and -2 Z score, according to NCHS/WHO standards, and matched with a H/A +/- 0.5 Z-score children of same age, gender, school, classroom and class time, as controls. The height was measured at school according to WHO rules by trained professionals, and household visits were carried out to obtain environmental and socio-economic data. Initially the data was analyzed by the univariate conditional method and then, the statistically significant variables were included in a model of multivariate logistic regression analysis. As a result, the risk factors remaining at the end of the multivariate analyses, by Odds Ratio and it's 95% Confidence Interval were respectively:--mother's height: for each decrease of one standard deviation the OR increased 1.84(CI: 1.35 to 2.49); inadequate feeding pattern: OR = 2.12; CI: 1.17 to 3.83, very low socio-economic level: OR = 9.2; CI: 3.35 to 25.13, low birth weight: OR = 2.59; CI: 1.44 to 4.63 and smoking during pregnancy: OR = 1.75; CI: 0.98 to 3.12. These results highlight the environment as a determinant factor for growth performance during the first years of the child's life. Despite this, the significant OR for Mother's height allows the assumption that besides the environment, the parent's height has to be considered as one of the determinants of height deficit, even for the low socioeconomic level.
2772105	1	a	Various epidemiologic studies have found that high scores on the Cook and Medley Hostility (Ho) scale are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), severity of atherosclerosis, and all-cause mortality. One plausible biological mechanism suspected of contributing to increased risk of CHD is sympathetic nervous system-mediated hyperresponsivity to environmental stressors. The present study evaluated cardiovascular reactivity among young men with high versus low Ho scores during performance of an anagram task with or without harassment. Compared to performing the task alone, harassment led to increased cardiovascular arousal that was more pronounced for the high Ho subjects than the low Ho subjects. Moreover, harassment produced increases in self-rated anger, irritation, and tension, but it was only among those subjects with high Ho scores that increased anger and irritation were associated with enhanced cardiovascular arousal. While suggesting a role for anger- and irritation-induced cardiovascular arousal in pathogenesis of CHD, these findings indicate that situation characteristics mediate the relationship between Ho scores and cardiovascular reactivity, and that there may be a differential biological link between anger/irritation and cardiovascular responses in men with high and low Ho scores.
12281022	1	a	This paper analyzes the migration phenomenon within a framework that treats migration movements as continuous loops, from the country of origin to the destination and back. Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications.
14695364	0	a	Utilization of health services is a complex behavioral phenomenon. Empirical studies of preventive and curative services have often found that use of health services is related to the availability, quality and cost of services, as well as to social structure, health beliefs and personal characteristics of the users. In this paper an attempt is made to examine the factors associated with the use of maternal health care services in Bangladesh on the basis of data from a survey of maternal morbidity in Bangladesh, conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Research for Promotion of Essential and Reproductive Health and Technologies (BIRPERHT). The results from both the bivariate and multivariate analyses confirmed the importance of mother's education in explaining the utilization of health care services. Female education retains a net effect on maternal health service use, independent of other women's background characteristics, household's socioeconomic status and access to healthcare services. The strong influence of mother's education on the utilization of health care services is consistent with findings from other studies. Women whose husbands are involved in business/services also positively influenced the utilization of modern health care services. However, the study results are inconclusive with respect to the influence of other predisposing and enabling factors, such as women's age, number of previous pregnancies and access to health facilities. Multivariate logistic regression estimates do not show any significant impact of these factors on the use of maternal health care. The influence of severity of disease condition in explaining the utilization of maternal health care appears to be significant. Multivariate analysis indicate that women having had a life-threatening condition are little over two times more likely to seek care from a doctor or nurse to treat their maternal morbidities.
6523992	1	a	"A comparison between rather short-lived (n = 60) and rather long-lived (n = 88) participants of the initial sample of the Bonn longitudinal study on aging (BOLSA) yielded evidence - with regard to differences in the central tendencies of these two groups - for a variety of determinants of longevity in old age. The statistical analyses included eight constructs or clusters of variables, respectively, that were either empirically or theoretically based and were supposed to have predictive power (intelligence, health status, satisfaction, personality, family involvement, socioeconomic/ecological aspects, coping techniques/dominant themes of life, general social participation). Within each ""cluster"", it could be referred to several different aspects. Besides defining general characteristics of longevious people, the purpose of the study was to look for differentiating aspects. Thus, a host of evidence was yielded for gender- and cohort-linked differences in the structure and relevance of the included central clusters with regard to ""prediction"" of advanced longevity in old age."
3714667	1	a	Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in different socioeconomic and educational groups in Finland. The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers.
10301136	1	a	The mid-1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe--and other parts of the world--a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches.
12296978	0	a	Little attention has been given to the dietary patterns of new immigrant women in Canada. Research suggests that before migration, many immigrants, especially those from non-Western countries, consume a healthy diet, but this changes on migration. This paper presents information from a recently completed literature review conducted for the Women's Health Council of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. The paper includes a review of the major determinants of food choice and health promotion strategies appropriate to new immigrant women. Our findings suggest that nutrition intervention for new immigrant women must consider the social context of these women's lives, address cultural, linguistic, economic and informational barriers and consider how these change over time. Recommendations are also made on how to best promote healthy eating in this group.
2489983	1	a	The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods.
7031748	1	a	Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes.
15603114	0	a	Occupational violence is a worldwide, multifaceted problem affecting all industries, including healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the experiences of 158 allied health professionals, 135 doctors, and 1229 nurses working in a rural area in eastern Australia. Response rates were 72 percent for allied health professionals and 62 percent for general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. Proportionately more nurses experienced occupational violence than did allied health providers and GPs. During the past 12 months (August 2001 to July 2002), 68 percent of nurses, compared with 47 percent of allied health providers and 48 percent of GPs, reported violence. All three professional groups indicated that the most distressing occupational violence was perpetrated by patients, followed by patients' relatives. The most frequent form of occupational violence was verbal abuse, followed by threatening behavior, physical violence, and obscene behavior. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of violence was found among the different allied health professional disciplines or fields of nursing. Health services management strategies addressing occupational violence need to be comprehensive and multidisciplinary in scope. Strategies to minimize violence need to focus on resource allocation, cultural change, and perseverance. Systems to monitor violence are a priority. Further research into the determinants of this pattern of violence is required.
6229879	1	a	A survey of 472 chronically ill and disabled Norwegian adults with four different main diagnoses (asthma/allergy, hemophilia, osteogenesis imperfecta and rheumatic disease) was carried out during a period of 3 years. The purpose was to analyse the factors influencing their use of available Social Insurance and Welfare services. The participants were interviewed and their medical records studied. Compared to the total population their level of education was lower and fewer were active in the work force. Available social insurance benefits had been obtained by almost half of the patients with hemophilia and osteogenesis imperfecta, but very few with asthma/allergy and rheumatic disease. Patients with high family income and/or high educational level had received relatively more social insurance benefits than others. Men had obtained more benefits than women and young patients more than the older ones. The need for practical welfare services was high, particularly in families where a parent or daughter looked after the patient, where the patient had several additional diagnoses, and among the female patients. There was a higher unmet need for welfare services among patients suffering from asthma/allergy and rheumatic diseases than among those with hemophilia and osteogenesis imperfecta. There were marked regional differences in the granting of both social insurance and welfare services.
12811671	0	a	"OBJECTIVE: To assess age- and nationality-specific trends in abortion rates over the last decade, and to describe women's characteristics, identifying risk factors for repeated abortion. METHODS: From 1990-1999, the Health Department of Canton Vaud (Switzerland) received 13'857 abortion requests from residents aged 14-49. Population data were obtained to compute rates. RESULTS: Both the number of abortions (1400 annually) as well as their rate (8.9 per thousand women [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.3-10.5]) were stable over the decade in question. The rate of abortion for foreign women, especially from ex-Yugoslavia and Africa, was twice that for Swiss women. Half of the requests came from single women, 43% had a low education level, and half were childless. The main reason for requesting termination of pregnancy was psychosocial (93%). The mean gestational age was 7.7 weeks (SD +/- 2.3), but 96% of requests were submitted before 12 weeks. Sixty-three percent of women reported that they had used no contraception, 36% the condom and 17% the pill. Among requests, the adjusted risk of repeated abortion (22% of abortion candidates) was greater among divorced/separated/widowed women (odds ratio [OR] 1.9 [95% CI 1.5-2.4]), unemployed women (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.5-2.1]), and those who had not attended university (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.1-2.2]). CONCLUSIONS: Although Swiss law only permitted abortion under strict conditions, this procedure was widely available in Vaud, which nevertheless has one of the lowest rates worldwide. Efforts must be intensified to ensure universal access to family planning services, especially for foreign women and adolescents. Professionals should also target ""repeaters"" to provide personalised counselling."
7264477	1	a	"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered."

4049019	1	a	This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
19027442	0	a	OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to examine the need for psychosocial support in a consecutive sample of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). Out of an initial sample of 250 patients, 239 patients could be assessed at the beginning of their RT. Two hundred eight patients were reassessed at the end of RT 4-8 weeks later. METHODS: Measures comprised the Hornheide Screening Instrument, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, the Resilience Scale, and the Short Form 12 as a measure of health-related quality of life (QoL). Medical and radiological data were continuously registered. RESULTS: Within the sample, the need for psychosocial support as reflected in the screening instrument was high (>70%). Patients with the need for psychosocial support revealed significantly higher fatigue scores than patients who where not identified as needing psychosocial support. Furthermore, a negative correlation of the need for psychosocial support and QoL as well as resilience could be observed. QoL turned out to be the strongest predictor for the need of psychosocial support. CONCLUSION: The study confirmed that the need for psychosocial support is an important aspect in the treatment of cancer patients undergoing RT, which appeared to be powerfully predicted by the patients' health-related QoL. Fatigue turned out to be an important illness- and treatment-related factor that affects QoL. Psychological interventions for cancer patients should explicitly focus on decreasing patients' fatigue and increasing their resilience, thus improving their QoL.
11811637	0	a	Using a longitudinal field design, this study tested the dynamics of an integrative model of social identity theory (SIT) and relative deprivation theory (RDT) with regard to relations between perceived socio-structural characteristics, perceived in-group identification, perceived fraternal deprivation (i.e., resentment) and identity-management-strategy preference. Trait-state analyses revealed that the dynamic relationship among constructs in the model can best be explained in terms of trait-dependent variation rather than sequentially ordered processing. The trait components of the variables replicate previous findings concerning SIT and RDT. However. stable functional relations between variables and their traitlike character contradict the notion that their underlying processes are linear and sequential. Rather, variables and their relations can be regarded as the product of parallel processes. The authors discuss the results as a challenge to core assumptions of SIT.
14674182	0	a	Given the increasing incidence of chronic diseases across the world, the search for more effective strategies to prevent and manage them is essential. The use of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) has assisted healthcare teams to demonstrate effective, relevant solutions to this growing challenge. However, the current CCM is geared to clinically oriented systems, and is difficult to use for prevention and health promotion practitioners. To better integrate aspects of prevention and health promotion into the CCM, an enhanced version called the Expanded Chronic Care Model is introduced. This new model includes elements of the population health promotion field so that broadly based prevention efforts, recognition of the social determinants of health, and enhanced community participation can also be part of the work of health system teams as they work with chronic disease issues.
4095592	1	a	Theoretical pathology' is defined as the conceptual foundation of medicine. Research in this area is concerned with the analysis of explicit and implicit patterns of thought dominating research and practice. Using the example of the stress concept, it is suggested that it is a 'key word' with denotative and connotative meanings accessible to professional and laymen, contributing to explore the 'gray zone' between 'health' and 'disease' by linking psychological, social and biological determinants of 'well-being' and 'discomfort'. Examples of current research illustrate possible expansions of medical theorization.
16448303	0	a	This study investigated the association between 2 distinct personal coping resources (mastery and sense of coherence) and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. During follow-up (up to 6 years), 994 deaths were recorded among 20,323 participants, ages 41 to 80 years, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer Study in the United Kingdom. A strong sense of mastery was associated with lower rates of mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, after adjusting for age, sex, and prevalent chronic physical disease. The association with all-cause mortality was observed for both men and women and remained following further adjustment for cigarette smoking, social class, hostility, neuroticism, and extroversion. Analysis of the joint association between mastery and sense of coherence revealed both personal coping dispositions to be independently associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality. In addition, these data suggested that the association for mastery was specific to cardiovascular mortality, whereas the association for sense of coherence was specific to cancer mortality. These results may aid future study of coping resources as determinants of persistent well-being.
7282978	1	a	The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology.
15112009	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To determine factors predictive of the score on the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EQ-5D questionnaire. METHODS: The responses of 1159 residents of a socially and ethnically diverse suburb of Cape Town, South Africa, to the EQ-5D questionnaire were analysed using forward stepwise multiple regression. The variables entered included ethnic group, religious affiliation (Christian or Muslim), income level, unemployment, recent illness or disability and each level of the five EQ-5D domains. FINDINGS: The model developed accounted for an adjusted r(2) of 0.234 and included 11 variables. In addition to the EQ-5D domains, the presence of a disability, an income of less than 420 US dollars per month, unemployment and age in years were significant predictors of VAS score. CONCLUSION: The substantial contribution of health state to the VAS indicates that it is a valid measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across population groups. However, the subjects with lower social status reported a worse HRQoL than their health state alone warranted and this variable might need to be taken into account if the VAS is to be used to compare health states across populations. This paper provides empirical evidence of how HRQoL is perceived by different socioeconomic, cultural, ethnic and religious communities within a developing country.
19040699	0	a	Understanding patient dissatisfaction is essential as it provides information on how to improve the relationship between healthcare users and medical professionals. The aim of this paper is to determine how Polish patients verbally express negative opinions of their healthcare services, and to compare the patterns of opinion-giving behaviour between patients in Poland and Western Europe. A qualitative approach employing in-depth interviews was used. Nine primary healthcare centres were chosen in various regions of Poland, taking into account both type of practice, i.e. small and large, and location of residence, i.e. urban (small and large towns) and rural. In every centre, interviews were performed with four patients coming consecutively to their family physician. Thirty-six patients aged 20-78 years were interviewed. Their views could be categorised into eight reasons for avoiding expressing negative opinions: unpleasant emotions induced by giving a negative evaluation; avoiding offending healthcare providers; fear that their utterances could have a negative effect on their further medical care; fear of giving a hasty evaluation based on their own inexpert medical knowledge; determinants from recent Polish history; prestige of the medical profession; entrusting the most important aspect of life, i.e. health, to a doctor; and lack of faith that their opinions could cause change for the better. The respondents used certain rhetorical tricks to soften their criticisms. Patients face cultural barriers to expressing dissatisfaction about their health care. In the Polish context, these are the high social status of the physician and the low position of the patient. In their spontaneous utterances, the respondents gave detailed suggestions for raising the level of patient satisfaction with health care.
3788206	1	a	The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.
12147165	0	a	In recent years public health research has increasingly focused upon exploring the social determinants of health. This interest has partly arisen through an acknowledgement of the limitations of educational preventive approaches in improving population health and reducing health inequalities. Many health education interventions have been influenced by health behaviour research based upon psychological theories and models. These theories focus at an individual level and seek to explore cognitive and affective processes determining behaviour and lifestyle. Current psychological theories have only a limited value in the development of public health action on altering the underlying social determinants of health. New theoretical approaches have however, emerged which explore the relationship between the social environment and health. This paper aims to review and highlight the potential value to oral health promotion of three important public health theoretical approaches: life course analysis, salutogenic model and social capital. It is important that an informed debate takes place over the theoretical basis of oral health promotion. As the field of oral health promotion develops it is essential that it is guided by contemporary and appropriate theoretical frameworks to ensure that more effective action is implemented in the future.
12862185	0	a	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Outcome in patients hospitalized for acute stroke varies considerably between populations. Within the framework of the GAIN International trial, a large multicenter trial of a neuroprotective agent (gavestinel, glycine antagonist), stroke outcome in relation to health care resource use has been compared in a large number of countries, allowing for differences in case mix. METHODS: This substudy includes 1,422 patients in 19 countries grouped into 10 regions. Data on prognostic variables on admission to hospital, resource use, and outcome were analyzed by regression models. RESULTS: All results were adjusted for differences in prognostic factors on admission (NIH Stroke Scale, age, comorbidity). There were threefold variations in the average number of days in hospital/institutional care (from 20 to 60 days). The proportion of patients who met with professional rehabilitation staff also varied greatly. Three-month case fatality ranged from 11% to 28%, and mean Barthel ADL score at three months varied between 64 and 73. There was no relationship between health care resource use and outcome in terms of survival and ADL function at three months. The proportion of patients living at home at three months did not show any relationship to ADL function across countries. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide variations in health care resource use between countries, unexplained by differences in case mix. Across countries, there is no obvious relationship between resource use and clinical outcome after stroke. Differences in health care traditions (treatment pathways) and social context seem to be major determinants of resource use. In making comparisons between countries, great care should be exercised in using outcome variables as indicators of quality of stroke care.
19034049	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variability and determinants of menopause age in two European cohort studies, the European Respiratory Health Survey and the Swiss Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults Cohort. METHODS: Age at menopause was estimated in 5,288 women, aged 30 to 60 years, randomly selected in nine European countries between 1998 and 2002. Determinants of natural and surgically induced menopause were investigated by Cox regression and heterogeneity by meta-analysis. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were assessed in a subsample. RESULTS: A quarter of the women were postmenopausal by age 50.8 years. Median age of natural menopause was 54 years. Hormone levels were within expected ranges for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Surgically induced menopause was highly prevalent (22%-47%), associated with earlier timing of menopause. Determinants of earlier menopause were current smoking (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.27-1.98), body mass index greater than 30 kg/m (HR, 1.32; 95%, CI, 1.02-1.70), and low physical activity (HR, 1.37; 95%, CI, 1.12-1.67). The determinant for later menopause was multiparity (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89). Predictors were similar for naturally and surgically induced menopause. Oral contraceptive use yielded heterogeneous effects on timing of menopause. Later birth was associated with later menopause (HR, 0.934; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96). This evidence of a secular trend is heterogeneous across countries. CONCLUSIONS: Age at menopause varies across Europe, shifting toward higher ages. This secular trend seems paradoxical because several adult determinants, that is, overweight, smoking, sedentarity, and nulliparity, associated with early menopause are on the rise in Europe. The heterogeneity of the secular trend suggests additional country-specific factors not included in the study, such as improved childhood nutrition and health, that have an influence on reproductive aging.
3435040	1	a	A cohort of 1163 pregnant women in two small towns in South Wales, UK, was identified and followed until the children born to them were five years of age. Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers. There effects decreased with age but there were still residual effects at age five years.
19766946	0	a	PURPOSE: To empirically quantify the role of peer social networks in explaining smoking behavior among adolescents. We follow adolescents over time to examine whether the role of adolescent peers persists in affecting individual behaviors as adolescents transition into adulthood. METHODS: Using longitudinal data of a nationally representative sample of adolescents we use a multivariate structural model with school-level fixed effects to account for the problems of contextual effects, correlated effects, and peer selections to purge the potential biases from the estimates of peer influence. Our peer group measures are drawn not only from the nomination of close friends but also from classmates. Smoking prevalence among the peer groups were constructed using the peers' own reports of their cigarette consumption. RESULTS: Controlling for parent level characteristics and other demographic parameters, we find that a 10% increase in the proportion of classmates who smoke will increase the likelihood of smoking by more than 3%. Also, an increase in smoking rates among an individual's close friends by 10% will increase the likelihood of smoking by 5%. We find evidence to show that the influence of close friends from adolescence years continue to have an impact on smoking propensities even when a transition into adulthood is made. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the literature reporting that peer effects are important determinants of smoking even after controlling for potential biases in the data and that these effects persist into adulthood. Effective policy aimed at reducing smoking rates among adolescents would consider these long-lasting peer effects.
7143281	1	a	Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae. Aspects of coping problems, primarily the disease-related, but also those of intra- and inter-personal nature are discussed.
2746717	1	a	The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.
3762472	1	a	In 1983-1984, 4578 Perth primary and secondary schoolchildren were studied. The selected sample was broadly representative of the ethnic groups that make up the Perth population and of the different social ranks within that population. The age, sex, weight, height, country of birth of the child and the parents, and occupation of the father were recorded for each subject. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI) increased with age. Age and sex were the most important determinants of body size. However, children of lower social rank and those with a southern European background were over-represented among the overweight children (greater than the 90th centile for BMI), particularly in adolescence. Children with an Asian background who were 11 years of age and younger were over-represented among the underweight children (less than or equal to the 10th centile for BMI). Results from this study indicate a continuing, though small (1.5 cm to 1.6 cm), secular increase in height over the past 13 to 14 years.
10955383	0	a	Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is characterized by obesity, nocturnal breathing abnormalities, arterial hypertension, and an increased number of cardiovascular events. Sympathetic activity is increased during nocturnal apneic episodes, which may mediate the cardiovascular complications of sleep apnea. We studied 15 male subjects with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and associated hypertension, 54 subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension, and 25 healthy normotensive men. Cardiovascular autonomic control was assessed using frequency domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) during a controlled breathing test and during orthostatic maneuver. Compared with normotensive and hypertensive groups, total power and low- and high-frequency components of HRV during controlled breathing were significantly (analysis of variance, p<0.0001) lower in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. During the orthostatic maneuver, the change in total power of HRV was different between the 3 groups (analysis of variance, p = 0.004). The total power of HRV tended to increase in the normotensive (4.11+/-12.29 ms2) and in hypertensive (2.31+/-12.65 ms2) groups, but decreased (1.13+/-1.23 ms2) in the hypertensive group with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. According to multivariate regression analysis, age and sleep apnea were the major independent determinants of HRV. This study found that an abnormal response to autonomic nervous tests characterizes hypertension in overweight subjects with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This could be due to autonomic withdrawal or supersaturation of the end-organ receptors by excessive and prolonged sympathetic stimulation. Our results also show the reduced response of orthostatic maneuver and controlled breathing in the hypertensive group compared with the normotensive group.
6634993	1	a	Previous experimentation led to a suggestion that pituitary-mediated metabolites present in female urine are important determinants of stimulus potency in eliciting 70 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations from adult male mice (Mus musculus). In the present experiment this hypothesis was reexamined, taking into account the prior experience of the male test subjects. Male mice were given social experience with either hypophysectomized females or intact, normal females and were then monitored for ultrasonic vocalizations to chemosensory stimuli from both. Results indicated that males (1) will emit ultrasonic vocalizations to urine from hypophysectomized females and (2) tend to preferentially emit ultrasound to stimuli from the type of female previously encountered during the social experience regimen. It is proposed that the previously reported lack of ultrasound emission by males to chemosignals from hypophysectomized females can be accounted for via straightforward associative learning mechanisms.
11728789	0	a	Excessive alcohol consumption and related problems are common among clients in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), yet relatively little is known about the psychological and social determinants of alcohol-related attitudes and behaviors during treatment. This study reports on the prevalence of alcohol dependence, patterns of alcohol consumption and preliminary findings about clients' beliefs that they will change their drinking behavior in the future. Data were gathered from personal interviews with 66 clients attending a MMT program in South London (some 80.5% of the eligible caseload). Forty-one percent of the overall sample met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence in the past 12 months. Among clients who reported drinking in the past month (n = 50), 54% were classified as dependent, and these clients reported consuming an average of 23.5 UK standard units of absolute alcohol (188g/6.58 ounces) on a typical drinking day in the past month. Exploratory analyses suggested that expectations to change drinking behavior were predicted by subjective norms (social pressures), perceived functions of alcohol use, past drinking levels and current dose of methadone. Clinicians engaged in alcohol problems assessment and counseling during MMT could usefully examine these influences to strengthen treatment provision.
6676332	1	a	A review of the literature indicates that until recently little attention has been paid to the effects of the environment on well-being among the aged. This study analyzes data relevant to both the individual and his or her environment from a large (N = 2265) national sample of low- and middle-income elderly. A recursive causal model is presented; the results indicate that perceived health and housing satisfaction contribute the most to well-being among the elderly. In addition, for men and women home ownership was not found to affect well-being positively. For men who owned their own homes lower scores on well-being were reported. The findings also indicate that while the quantity of neighbor interaction benefits the well-being of men, women benefit more from the positive sentiments of sociability in the neighborhood. This study emphasizes the importance of environmental satisfaction and neighborhood sociability as key determinants of well-being in later life.
12280179	1	a	"""Distinctive types of mobility are identified for the [U.S.] elderly, many of whom also move for traditional reasons. Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves."""
16000340	0	a	BACKGROUND: The new public health rejects old individualist attempts at improving health and embraces community-based approaches in reducing health inequalities. Primary Care Trusts in England face the challenge of converting community participation in health into reality. This study explores differences in perception of participation between lay and professional stakeholders of a community health project for a South Asian population in Greater Manchester. METHODS: In-depth interviews and focus groups were used to explore the views of professional and lay stakeholders. All data were audio-taped, transcribed and analysed for emerging themes using a qualitative framework. RESULTS: Professionals talked of working in partnership with the community but lay stakeholders did not feel that they had control over the project. There were problems in engaging the community and local health professionals in the project. Lack of cultural awareness hampered participation in the project. There was agreement that the project improved the self-confidence of participants and created a more informed population. However, there was little support for claims of improvements in social cohesion and changes in lifestyle directly as a result of the project. CONCLUSION: Converting the rhetoric of community participation in health into reality is a greater challenge than was envisaged by policy makers. Marginalized communities may not be willing participants and issues of language and cultural sensitivity are important. Project outcomes need to be agreed to ensure projects are evaluated appropriately. Projects with South Asian communities should not be seen to be dealing with all 'ethnic health' issues without addressing changes in statutory organizations and other wider social determinants of health.
16443184	0	a	OBJECTIVES: To implement and evaluate the effectiveness of scenario-based learning as a method for teaching systems-based practice to pediatric residents. METHODS: Twelve pediatric residents at the University of Florida/Jacksonville participated in an active learning scenario experience during their 1-month community pediatrics block rotation from January 2003 to April 2004. A scenario, developed in partnership with community-based organizations, required the residents to assume the role of a parent faced with multiproblem life situations requiring skills in prioritizing problems and identifying and accessing community resources to address them. Residents documented their assessment of the experience as they went through it by making entries into a learning portfolio and at the end of the experience through written evaluations and exit interviews. A case study design was used to assess resident-perceived impact of this experience. Qualitative methods were used to analyze data from resident portfolio entries, resident written evaluation surveys, and resident exit interviews. RESULTS: Five themes, some of which reflect competencies in systems-based practice, emerged from the data: development of empathy and compassion, increased understanding of the barriers facing patients and families, increased appreciation of social determinants of health, self-perceived increased ability to serve patients, and advantages of active learning. CONCLUSIONS: Active learning experiences that simulate patient situations can be incorporated into community pediatrics training for residents, increasing perceived competence in systems-based practice.
18372874	0	a	Scotland has recently embarked on a new phase of policy and infrastructure development for improving population health and reducing health inequalities that broadly conforms to the Ottawa Charter and WHO's strategic framework for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. The new phase is characterised by an integrated, cross-government approach to improving health with strengthened political and Scottish Executive leadership and investment since devolution. A comprehensive policy framework for improving young people's health and reducing inequalities has been developed across education, health, environment and social justice. It builds on an earlier phase of relative stability and continuity in the health promotion infrastructure with policy focused on CVD and cancer prevention and tackling the behavioural risk factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity) as well as sexual health and mental health and wellbeing. These national strategies are currently being implemented across Scotland. They combine promotion, prevention, treatment and protection goals and target both population-level and high-risk groups. Crosscutting government objectives and headline targets for addressing poverty, disadvantage and health inequalities now supplement the NHS health improvement targets on smoking, alcohol, physical activity, teenage pregnancy and child immunization. Within the health service, prevention efforts are largely concerned with primary care development (anticipatory care) and health system reform to maximize their impact on reducing health inequalities. Efforts to tackle the social determinants of health and reduce inequalities in health outcomes are beginning to be connected and mainstreamed across local government with Community Planning Partnerships as the main vehicle. National level mechanisms for integrated funding, planning and performance reporting to deliver shared priority outcomes have yet to be developed. The development of health improvement strategies has been founded upon a rich source of population health data to monitor changes and improvements, epidemiological studies and evaluation work. The key issues have been to find ways of intervening to accelerate the rate of improvement and to stem the growing health inequalities. A further challenge is to ensure that the lessons from reviews and evaluations of past programmes and strategies are not lost, but help to guide improvements in the complex delivery system and to inform future policy direction. Within the health service, prevention efforts are largely concerned with primary care development and health system reform. Efforts to reduce inequalities in health outcomes are beginning to be connected and mainstreamed across local government.
15681628	0	a	This study attempted to evaluate the psychosocial, clinical, and radiological predictors of poststroke depression (PSD) in Chinese patients. One hundred eighty-nine patients participated in the study. Three months after the index stroke, a psychiatrist administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV to all of the patients and made a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. In addition, a host of demographic, clinical, and radiological variables were examined. Thirty-one (16.4%) of the patients had a diagnosis of PSD that included major depression (n=11, 5.8%,), minor depression (n=16, 8.5%), or dysthymia (n=4, 2.1%). Univariate analysis revealed that PSD was associated with female gender, a lower level of education, a lower Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS) score, subcortical infarcts, and lesions in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory, and the Modified Life Event Scale (MLES) score was borderline for statistical significance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that female gender, a high MLES score, and subcortical and ACA lesions were independent risk factors for PSD and that a high LSNS score was a protective factor.
11048582	0	a	Aiming to analyze the mild to moderate growth retardation associate factors in children at school age, a case control study was conducted with 153 pairs of seven and eight years old children from public schools of the outskirts of the city. The cases were defined as children with a height for age(H/A) between -1 and -2 Z score, according to NCHS/WHO standards, and matched with a H/A +/- 0.5 Z-score children of same age, gender, school, classroom and class time, as controls. The height was measured at school according to WHO rules by trained professionals, and household visits were carried out to obtain environmental and socio-economic data. Initially the data was analyzed by the univariate conditional method and then, the statistically significant variables were included in a model of multivariate logistic regression analysis. As a result, the risk factors remaining at the end of the multivariate analyses, by Odds Ratio and it's 95% Confidence Interval were respectively:--mother's height: for each decrease of one standard deviation the OR increased 1.84(CI: 1.35 to 2.49); inadequate feeding pattern: OR = 2.12; CI: 1.17 to 3.83, very low socio-economic level: OR = 9.2; CI: 3.35 to 25.13, low birth weight: OR = 2.59; CI: 1.44 to 4.63 and smoking during pregnancy: OR = 1.75; CI: 0.98 to 3.12. These results highlight the environment as a determinant factor for growth performance during the first years of the child's life. Despite this, the significant OR for Mother's height allows the assumption that besides the environment, the parent's height has to be considered as one of the determinants of height deficit, even for the low socioeconomic level.
3182366	1	a	A population of 54 high-school-aged kibbutz youth in Israel were studied to assess their smoking habits. Twenty (37%) were smokers. Among the smokers, 15 (75%) smoked daily, with four smoking as many as 10-20 cigarettes per day. Nearly half of the group believed smoking affected their health and were interested in stopping their use of cigarettes. Smokers when compared to nonsmokers had more positive peer relations (chi 2 = 9.308; p less than 0.01), less positive relations with parents (chi 2 = 8.293; p less than 0.01), more boredom with kibbutz life (chi 2 = 3.468; p less than 0.10), and less involvement with a hobby, sport, or reading (chi 2 = 3.133, p less than 0.10). Parents' smoking habits, marital status of the parents, students' self-evaluation of their academic performance, and youths' age and sex did not differentiate smokers from nonsmokers.
12556926	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To compare functional, emotional, and academic status of adolescents who had been extremely low birth weight (ELBW) with those who were full term. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six adolescents who were born in 1983 to 1984 at less than 801 g birth weight were compared with 26 adolescents born at term. Adolescent-perceived status was assessed using the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-SR) and the Self-Perception Profile. Parents' perceptions were assessed using BASC Parent Report, Family Impact Questionnaire, and Functional Status Measure. Health status was obtained through written requests to primary care providers and parent interviews. Academic and attendance information was obtained through school records. RESULTS: Compared to the term adolescents, the ELBW group had significantly lower function related to health status, increased need for special education, and tended to score lower on academic performance measures. However, ELBW adolescents' perceptions regarding their scholastic, athletic, or social competencies did not differ from the term group or national normative data. Parents of ELBWs reported lower adaptive skills, but no other behavioral differences from the term group. CONCLUSION: ELBW survivors and their parents perceived outcome at adolescence positively in spite of evident limitations. Mechanisms that ELBW families use to cope may be important determinants for successful, long-term outcome.
3223165	1	a	"Multi-dimensional investigation in the peculiarities, clinical course and possible mechanisms of neurotic disorders was performed in 115 patients. In order to study the further course of neurotic disorders and their determinants, as well as the issues of social rehabilitation and psychoprophylactic interferences, 56 patients were studied again after 6 to 8 years. For each of the symptom complexes investigated, the course had distinct features determined primarily by adaptation-compensatory capabilities of personality, and the ""system of psychological defense"". Most unfavorable was the course of hysterical disorders. Therapeutic policy in these patients should be grounded upon the psychotherapeutic measures aimed at finding the ways that would be psychologically adequate for changing the patients' attitudes and restoring their adaptation."
6597061	1	a	The aim of the present study was to suggest a causal model of dental caries and to discuss some quantitative interpretations of this model. Three age groups of children (4, 8 and 13 yr) from three different areas in Sweden were included. The caries status of the children was examined. A 7-day record (4-and 8-yr-olds) and a dietary history (13-yr-olds) were used to estimate food intake. Sociodemographic data and data of caries preventive measures were obtained from parents/children. A causal model of dental caries is suggested and some quantitative interpretations are made by means of path analyses. Hypothetical examples of results of changes in caries determinants are given.
4034814	1	a	"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration."
2928145	1	a	Reward allocation in selected American universities was investigated using tenure receipt as the most valuable faculty reward. Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review.
6143404	1	a	This paper uses a national probability sample to examine major correlates of drug use among American adults. Demographic correlates of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana, tranquilizer, sleeping pill and stimulant use are explained in terms of a self medication or coping perspective of drug use. Two analysis procedures are used. In the first, respondents were asked to list strategies they use when they have problems. These responses are 'broken down' by drug use categories or 'taking pills'. In the second procedure, attempts are made to interpret the correlations between age, sex, marital status, education and drug use by introducing variables which measure how respondents were experiencing fundamental aspects of their lives (role stress items) and mental health variables. A substantial portion of the variance in drug use that is explained by demographic variables appears to operate through social role and mental health variables, that is, these latter variables interpret the demographic/drug use relationships in a way that is consistent with a coping perspective. The authors conclude that these data and this analysis provided cautious support for a coping perspective.
15132249	0	a	This article addresses newly emerging concepts regarding the examination of outcomes in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Three important factors have prompted a change toward a broader approach to outcome measurement: (1) the recent endorsement of the World Health Organization classification scheme of functioning, disability, and health; (2) recognition of the importance of the role of child and environmental factors in modifying outcome; and (3) appreciation of the challenges faced at key transitions during development. Comparison of the literature on outcomes in children with CP published in 2002 with studies published 10 years earlier demonstrates an increased number of studies and a wider range of outcome measures used to characterize the functioning of these children. A better understanding of the extent and nature of the outcomes and their determinants is critical to guide clinical decision making and program planning to maximize community integration, social participation, and overall well-being of the child and family.
6285155	1	a	In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients.
12783770	0	a	CONTEXT: Gender discrimination and son preference are key demographic features of South Asia and are well documented for India. However, gender bias and sex preference in Nepal have received little attention. METHODS: 1996 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data on ever-married women aged 15-49 who did not desire any more children were used to investigate levels of gender bias and sex preference. The level of contraceptive use and the total fertility rate in the absence of sex preference were estimated, and logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between socioeconomic and demographic variables and stopping childbearing after the birth of a son. RESULTS: Commonly used indicators of gender bias, such as sex ratio at birth and sex-specific immunization rates, do not suggest a high level of gender discrimination in Nepal. However, sex preference decreases contraceptive use by 24% and increases the total fertility rate by more than 6%. Women's contraceptive use, exposure to the media, parity, last birth interval, educational level and religion are linked to stopping childbearing after the birth of a boy, as is the ethnic makeup of the local area. CONCLUSIONS: The level of sex preference in Nepal is substantial. Sex preference is an important barrier to the increase of contraceptive use and decline of fertility in the country; its impact will be greater as desired family size declines.
3933036	1	a	The hypothesis was examined that the interaction of ethanol with the conditions under which it is administered may determine whether either preference or aversion for the drug develops. In Experiment 1, eight groups of food-deprived rats received injections of ethanol (175-1,400 mg/kg) in one environment and were later offered a choice between that environment and a different one previously associated with saline injections. Another eight groups were treated identically, except that food was available in both the saline and ethanol-paired environments. The groups given the drug without food showed no preference or aversion at low doses (175-700 mg/kg), but showed aversion at higher doses (1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg). When food was available, there was an increased preference for the environment paired with the 500 mg/kg dose and reduced aversion at the 1,000 and 1,400 mg/kg doses. In Experiment 2, placing two rats together increased each rat's preference for the environment associated with the other animal. However, rats pretreated with 500 mg/kg ethanol before being placed together showed a reduced preference for the environment associated with the drug and the other animal. Controls never paired with another rat showed no preference or aversion at the same ethanol dose. Thus, ethanol may interact with conditions such as the presence of food or another animal to determine final effects that are unique to those conditions.
17077436	0	a	BACKGROUND: Despite considerable research investigating the relationship between a long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and outcomes, there has been much less considering predictors of a long DUP. AIMS: To investigate the clinical and social determinants of DUP in a large sample of patients with a first episode of psychosis. METHOD: All patients with a first episode of psychosis who made contact with psychiatric services over a 2-year period and were living in defined catchment areas in London and Nottingham, UK were included in the AESOP study. Data relating to clinical and social variables and to DUP were collected from patients, relatives and case notes. RESULTS: An insidious mode of onset was associated with a substantially longer DUP compared with an acute onset, independent of other factors. Unemployment had a similar, if less strong, effect. Conversely, family involvement in help-seeking was independently associated with a shorter duration. There was weak evidence that durations were longer in London than in Nottingham. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that DUP is influenced both by aspects of the early clinical course and by the social context.
3530546	1	a	The present paper reviews the epidemiologic patterns of blood pressure in children by demographic variables such as age, race, sex, education and social class. Other possible determinants for high blood pressure in both adults and children are also discussed, including obesity and salt intake. Special attention is given to the phenomenon of tracking and to genetic influences in blood pressure, the latter discussed in the context of the strengths and limitations of twin and familial aggregation studies.
3964428	1	a	Male and female juvenile rats were individually exposed to nonplayful juvenile social stimuli in a novel test of play-soliciting behavior to examine hormonal and experiential determinants of sex differences. In Experiment 1, neonatally androgenized females engaged in play soliciting at a level equal to that of male controls and greater than that of nonandrogenized female controls. In Experiment 2, males and females were reared in unisexual and bisexual groups in order to compare long-term sex-related social experience effects on juvenile play soliciting. Males exposed only to other young males engaged in greater play soliciting than males exposed to both sexes; females, in contrast, were unaffected by sex of cagemates. Within rearing conditions, however, males engaged in greater play soliciting than females. The combined results suggest that perinatal gonadal androgen exposure effects on social play are prepotent and contribute essentially to sex differences in the initiation of social play behavior.
6481664	1	a	Psychosocial outcome in terms of mental state, health preoccupation, leisure activity, avoidance behaviour, sexual activity and attitude towards life and the future one year after a myocardial infarction (MI) was studied in 177 consecutive male, able-bodied patients below 61 yr of age with a first MI. Questionnaires and a brief interview covered the psychological and social data while the somatic variables were recorded in a standardized medical examination. Emotional distress, self-reported symptoms, avoidance behaviour, overprotection, pessimism and a diminished sexual activity were frequent, indicating a poor adaptation. These disturbances were apparent two months after the MI and remained stable. Psychological factors were stronger determinants of maladjustment than smoking, angina pectoris and recorded somatic illness. Neither severity of the infarction nor social and demographic factors determined maladjustment. Intervention must take place early and be directed to psychological factors as well as to the cardiac condition.

6223881	1	a	Social and psychological determinants of the time taken to return to work were investigated in a sample of male manual workers referred to an accident clinic with mostly minor industrial injuries. Patients who showed a rapid recovery relative to the severity of their injuries were more often married, had greater job satisfaction, were less likely to be receiving an income supplement from their employers, and blamed themselves more for their accidents. The findings also indicated that a poor recovery rate could be expected when the accident was due to some environmental fault or failure, and the implications for studies of compensation are discussed.
12048146	0	a	Neurocognitive deficits are believed to be important predictors of functional outcome in chronic psychotic disorders, but few supporting studies have utilized prospective designs and adequate control. The aim of this study was to estimate the relative influence of symptoms and neurocognitive deficits on the development of social behavior skills in a cohort of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder recovering from acute symptom exacerbations. Forty-six individuals were recruited upon discharge from an inpatient unit and completed assessments of symptoms, neurocognitive function, and social behavior at 3-month intervals for 1 year. Correlational analyses and random regression models were used to model social behavioral capacities longitudinally. Social behavior improved modestly (10% improvements in ratings) over the follow-up period for the group as a whole. Disorganized and negative symptoms, as well as neurocognitive deficits in short-term and working memory predicted changes in social behavior over time. Individuals with better working memory function showed significantly greater abilities to recover social behavior skills, whereas those with working memory deficits showed no functional improvement over time. Both symptoms and neurocognitive deficits are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia. It is proposed that clinicians should consider neurocognitive thresholds for treatment response when developing rehabilitation plans.
6393872	1	a	Research in mental retardation in the GDR has been influenced primarily by the brain damage--development theory, which assumes biological as well as social determinants in human development. The theory was based on the results of brain damage (encephalopathy) research, which distinguishes between primary and secondary symptoms of mental retardation. The importance of social factors such as family conditions for development was demonstrated in a variety of studies, including research with adopted children. Positive results have been achieved with early education programming for developmentally disabled children, as well as with medical treatment for some genetically induced metabolic disorders. Results from longitudinal studies suggest that intelligence continues to develop in educable mentally retarded adolescents. New diagnostic methods have been developed; test of motor skills, visuomotor coordination, and a developmental test for young infants. Further developments of traditional school entrance diagnosis for special education classes is reported. Several studies show that there has been some success in the vocational and social integration of mentally retarded persons in the GDR.
3435040	1	a	A cohort of 1163 pregnant women in two small towns in South Wales, UK, was identified and followed until the children born to them were five years of age. Growth in these children is described and a number of determinants identified. Social-class differences were very small at birth but differences in height became clear by the age of two years and in head circumference before this. In height the differences were largely accounted for by greater growth in social class I, but there was a gradient in head circumference throughout all the social classes. The social class effects gradually increased as the children became older. Parity of the mothers had a small effect on size at birth but age of the mother had no effect once parity was allowed for. Data on illnesses in the children were collected but no effect on growth could be detected. By far the most important determinant of growth which could be controlled is maternal smoking. About 40% of the women smoked, about 17% heavily (15 or more cigarettes per day) and the prevalence of smoking altered little during pregnancy. There was a graded effect of smoking on growth up to a 9% deficit in birth-weight, a 2% deficit in length at birth and a 1.5% deficit in head circumference in the babies born to the mothers who smoked most heavily (25 or more cigarettes per day) compared with non-smokers. There effects decreased with age but there were still residual effects at age five years.
3237851	1	a	The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
28466762	1	a	Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces.
15613826	0	a	PURPOSE: A structural equation model was analysed to explore the determinants of health behaviors of university students in Korea. METHOD: Nine hundred sixty nine university students were selected by random cluster sampling from five universities located in the central area of Korea. DATA COLLECTION: The data was collected by questionnaires about demographic characteristics, stressful life events, perceived social support, perceived health status and health behaviors. RESULTS: 1. Gender showed indirect effect on health behaviors. 2. Living together with(out) family had a direct effect on health behaviors: students living with family showed more positive health behaviors. 3. Stressful life events had an indirect effect on health behaviors via perceived health status; a higher score of stressful life events was the predictor for negative health behaviors. 4. A higher score of perceived health status predicted positive health behaviors. RECOMMENDATION: Each university should be encouraged to develop a health behavior control program and health promotion program for their own university students. It would be more effective to develop health programs separately according to the demographic or social characteristics of the students. It is also necessary for the Ministry of Education to reform the School Health Act and school health policy to strengthen a health promotion program for university students. In conclusion, following studies should identify and promote the validity and reliability of perceived health status and health behaviors measurements.
16344633	0	a	Is health promotion a White middle-class phenomenon that people from other cultures and classes do not regard as important? When implementing health-promotion initiatives, are healthcare providers making assumptions that are not valid for other cultural or socioeconomic groups? How do people of various cultures and classes perceive health and health promotion? To explore these questions, this article reviews some of the relevant literature on culture and class in relation to health promotion, exploring issues foundational to the effectiveness of health-promotion programs and pertinent to delivering health-promotion interventions to ethnic, racial, and cultural minorities and poor populations. Health promoters are encouraged to consider the social determinants of their patients' health and tailor programs on the basis of their patients' motivations and resources.
10287174	1	a	"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
16529597	0	a	The older population is the single largest demographic group at disproportionate risk of inadequate diet and malnutrition. Ageing is associated with a decline in a number of physiological functions that can impact nutritional status, including reduced lean body mass and a resultant decrease in basal metabolic rate, decreased gastric secretion of digestive juices and changes in the oral cavity, sensory function deficits, changes in fluid and electrolyte regulation and chronic illness. Medication, hospitalization and other social determinants also can contribute to nutritional inadequacy. The nutritional status of older people is an important determinant of quality of life, morbidity and mortality. This review critically examines the factors that contribute to the development of poor nutritional status in older people and considers the consequences of malnutrition.
17266167	0	a	A major characteristic of teenage smoking is the ability to 'bum' cigarettes from peers. To date, research into the determinants of teenage smoking has largely ignored the effects of this social market on the smoking decisions of teenagers. In this paper, we estimate the demand for cigarettes using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey which distinguishes teens who primarily buy cigarettes from those who primarily borrow cigarettes. Our results demonstrate the ways in which higher cigarette prices and restrictions on smoking influence not only a teen's decision to smoke and the quantity of cigarettes smoked, but also the manner in which cigarettes are acquired. We show that current cigarette regulations are ineffective in reaching the group of light smokers who primarily obtain cigarettes through the social market, thus indicating that alternative measures should be explored in an effort to reduce the number of smokers in the future.
17450311	0	a	Individual and family factors have been hypothesized to influence adolescent sexual behavior, but the extent to which this is true for adolescents in Jamaica as a whole and for those in rural areas in particular, has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to identify individual and family factors associated with initiation of sexual activity before the age of 16 among rural adolescents in Jamaica. We analyzed data for 469 sexually experienced adolescents attending public high schools in the rural parish of Hanover. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict independent influences of these factors. The mean age at sexual debut was 11 years for boys and 15 years for girls. Early adolescent sexual activity was associated with liberal attitudes about negative sexual outcomes (OR = 1.96, 95%CI = 1.34-2.87) and first sexual partner not being a steady boyfriend or girlfriend (OR = 4.19, 95%CI = 1.62-10.84). Female gender (OR = 0.16, 95%CI = 0.07-0.36) and older age at time of survey were protective (OR = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.32-0.52). Girls who were early starters were more likely to have been initiated by partners who were not steady boyfriends. They also reported liberal attitude towards negative sexual outcomes. Boys were mainly influenced by liberal attitude towards negative sexual outcomes. Being older was protective for both genders. Considering the high rates of HIV and adolescent pregnancy in this population, reproductive health programs that attempt to delay age at first sex should begin early in primary school before adolescents become sexually active.
2707901	1	a	This study examines factors which contribute to elderly abuse and neglect by caregivers in a domestic setting. Methodological and conceptual variations and problems in previous studies have led to considerable confusion as to the determinants of this important social problem. A more rigorous research design was used in this study than has been previously employed. Fifty-nine abused elders from a model project site for the study of elderly abuse were compared with forty-nine non-abused clients from a home care program in the same agency. Using a research instrument designed by the authors, data related to the following aspects of the lives of the elders and their caregivers were collected: psychological status, stressful life events, social networks, mutual dependency, and the nature of their relationships. The study indicates that members of abusive families are more likely to have emotional problems which contribute to interpersonal difficulties. Abused elders are not more dependent on caregivers for many of their daily needs. However, the abused elderly and their caregivers have become increasingly interdependent prior to the onset of abuse because of the loss of other family members, increased social isolation, and the increased financial dependency of the perpetrator on the elderly person.
29357164	1	a	This study introduces a new approach to identify determinants of competitive success in small mammals. An experimental population of Clethrionomys rufocanus consisting of laboratory-raised individuals with known origin and life history was introduced to a realistic competitive situation in the field. Successful females could be distinguished from nonsuccessful females on the basis of four individual attributes measured 25 d after they were released on the study plot, whereas males could not. The most consistent determinant of competitive success seemed to be the sex ratio of the litters in which females were born. Successful females originated from litters with a strongly female-biased sex ratio. These results are considered in the light of recent research on the consequences of prenatal conditions on female social behavior.
7155014	1	a	"Schizophrenia is a human behavioral variant with a 1% phenotypic population frequency. As the major ""mental illness"" affecting human beings, it has defied all previous attempts to explain, predict or prevent its devastating clinical manifestations. In addition to unidentified nongenetic determinants, schizophrenia has genetic determinants in the absence of known specific neuropathological or biochemical correlates found in other entities conceptualized as genetic diseases. The fitness of schizophrenics is 0.7 of nonschizophrenics, and a 1% phenotypic population frequency is difficult to explain by mutation rate alone. An ethological theory of schizophrenia has been developed in which the genetic determinant is the nocturnal character of a postulated polymorphic trait termed when active. The nongenetic determinant is simply a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light. According to the author's theory, a schizophrenic individual could be processing information while awake and exposed to light with a brain that is processing information as though he were asleep. The empirical data from which the theory is constructed are presented. THe theory is capable of explaining clinical schizophrenia within an ethological paradigm and makes several predictions, the most significant of which is that the absence of a sufficient intensity of specific frequencies of environmental light should ameliorate the major symptoms of clinical schizophrenia in individuals who possess its genetic determinant."
6656327	1	a	Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension.
17374601	0	a	OBJECTIVES: To determine factors that independently predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 1 and 3 years after stroke. METHODS: Subjects numbering 397, from a population-based register of first-ever strokes were assessed for HRQOL using the Short Form 36 (SF36) 1 year after stroke. Physical (PHSS) and mental health (MHSS) summary scores were derived from the eight domains of HRQOL in the SF36. Multivariate stepwise regression analyses were conducted to determine independent predictors of these scores; beta coefficients with 95% CI were obtained.beta coefficient is the difference between average value of the variable (e.g. male) and average value under consideration (e.g. female). Demographic and stroke risk factors, neurological impairments and cognitive impairment (MMSE <24) were included in the models. Similar analyses were undertaken on 150 subjects 3 years post-stroke. RESULTS: A year after stroke, independent predictors of the worst PHSS were of females (beta coefficient -3.3: 95% CI -5.7 to -0.8), manual workers (-3.2: -5.9 to -0.4), diabetes (-4.2: -7.7 to -0.8), right hemispheric lesions (-4.9: -8.7 to -1.2), urinary incontinence (-7.8: -11.6 to -4.1) and cognitive impairment (-2.7: -5.5 to -0.1); the worst MHSS were associated with being Asian (-11.8: -20.6 to -3.0), ischaemic heart disease (-2.7: -5.4 to -0.03), cognitive impairment (-3.04: -5.8 to -0.3). Subjects aged 65-75 years (5.4: 2.5 to -8.4) had better MHSS than those <65 years. Three years post-stroke, independent predictors of worse PHSS were hypertension (-8.7: -13.5 to -3.9), urinary incontinence (-8.1: -15 to -1.1) and cognitive impairment (-8.3: -13.2 to -3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of HRQOL vary both over time after stroke and whether physical or psychosocial aspects of HRQOL are being considered. This study provides valuable information on factors predicting long-term HRQOL, which can be taken into consideration in audits of clinical practice or in future interventional studies aiming to improve HRQOL after stroke.
3906055	1	a	The premenstrual syndrome is discussed in relation to prevalence, symptomatology, severity, and time course. Methodologic problems common to the study of the menstrual cycle are presented. The research on psychologic and physiologic etiologies is reviewed, and results of studies on various treatment modes are discussed. Newer theories suggesting a combined psychophysiologic etiology and concomitant nonpharmaceutical treatment modes encompassing self-care and stress management skills are included.
11035460	0	a	The paper aims to improve our understanding about the prevalence and determinants of child abuse in rural Bangladesh. Data from the 1995 sample survey of 4643 children aged 10-15 y in 150 villages were used. Findings revealed that 21% of the children were in the labour force although the Bangladeshi laws prohibited child labour. The prevalence of child abuse and exploitation was widespread in Bangladeshi villages as 2.3% of all children were physically abused, 2% were financially exploited, 1.7% were forced to involve in inappropriate activities, and 3% were forced to work for long hours. The prevalence of physical assault was much higher among younger children although the probability of other types of abuse was higher among older children. Boys were more exposed than girls to abuse of any kind. Poverty was also significantly associated with child abuse. Multivariate analysis suggested that the out-of-school children and the children of illiterate, landless and unskilled labourers were more likely to be abused than others when age and sex of children were controlled. The paper concludes that raising public awareness against child abuse and promoting preventive measures should be adopted to reduce child abuse in Bangladesh.
12511400	0	a	A joint urban planning and public health perspective is articulated here for use, in health impact assessment. Absent a blueprint for a coherent and supportive structure on which to test our thinking, we are bound to fall flat. Such a perspective is made necessary by the sheer number of people living in cities throughout the world, the need for explicit attention to land use and transportation systems as determinants of population health, and the dearth of useful indicators of the built environment for monitoring progress. If explicit attention is not paid to the overarching goals of equality and democracy, they have little if any chance of being realized in projects, programs, and policies that shape the built environment and therefore the public's health.
18390845	0	a	Schools are overloaded with health promotion programs that, altogether, focus on a broad array of behavioral domains, including substance abuse, sexuality and nutrition. Although the specific content of programs varies according to the domain focus, programs usually address similar concepts: knowledge, attitudinal beliefs, social influences and skills. This apparent conceptual overlap between behaviors and programs provides opportunities for a transfer-oriented approach which will stimulate students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in one domain (e.g. skills for resisting tobacco use) to other domains (e.g. alcohol, sex). A requirement for such an approach is that behaviors share at least some determinants. This review addresses this issue by examining similarities between domain-specific determinants of smoking, drinking, safe sex and healthy nutrition among adolescents. Recent empirical studies and reviews were examined. The results show that the following determinants are relevant to all four behaviors: beliefs about immediate gratification and social advantages, peer norms, peer and parental modeling and refusal self-efficacy. Several other determinants have been found to relate to at least two behaviors, e.g. health risk beliefs and parental norms. These results can be used for the development of a transfer-oriented school health promotion curriculum.
3237851	1	a	The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days.

These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
6139036	1	a	A community sample of older adults was investigated to test some of the current hypothesis about the etiology of depression in the elderly. Multiple regression analysis showed that cognitive disturbances (memory, concentration), previous depressive episodes, and somatic health problems accounted for most of the etiological variance. Other variables, like stressful life events, financial problems, social isolation, alcohol use, age, sex, and previous somatic illnesses are significant but their numerical values are very small. Etiological insignificant were the variables: physical activities, competency in daily living, and support by ones own children.
2892348	1	a	The activity of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) and its determinants were studied in 17 patients with myotonic dystrophy. The gamma-GT activity was elevated in 11 patients and its mean value was five-fold higher than in healthy controls. The increase in gamma-GT could not be explained by factors generally known to result in a misleading elevation of gamma-GT. Most patients with elevated gamma-GT also had one or more other pathological laboratory tests related to hepatic function but none had a clinically significant liver disease. Serum gamma-GT activity was not related to the disability caused by dystrophy or to the level of serum creatine kinase suggesting that the elevation of serum gamma-GT is not an indication of a general cell membrane dysfunction. It is concluded that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity in patients with myotonic dystrophy is due to a real but mild liver involvement, which should be taken into account in the examination of these patients who often complain of gastrointestinal symptoms.
19545045	0	a	The purpose of this review of the literature is to present factors possibly affecting the spread of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa over the next 20 years. Malaria is a vector-borne disease that depends on environmental and human constraints. The main environmental limitations involve susceptibility of the vector (mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus) and parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) to climate. Malaria is a stable, endemic disease over most of the African continent. Climatic change can only affect a few regions on the fringes of stable zones (e.g. altitude areas or Sahel) where malaria is an unstable, epidemic disease. Higher temperatures could induce a decrease of malaria transmission in regions of the Sahel or an increase in the highlands. The extent of these overall trends will depend on the unpredictable occurrence of major meteorological phenomenon as well as on human activities affecting the environment that could lead to dramatic but limited outbreaks in some locations. The most influential human factors could be runaway demographic growth and urban development. Estimations based on modeling studies indicate that urbanization will lead to a 53.5% drop in exposure to malaria by 2030. However this reduction could be less than expected because of adaptation of Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis, the main vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, to the urban environment as well as increasing vector resistance to insecticides. Another unforeseeable factor that could induce unexpected malaria epidemics is mass migration due to war or famine. Finally immunosuppressive illnesses (e.g. HIV and malnutrition) could alter individual susceptibility to malaria. Social constraints also include human activities that modify land use. In this regard land use (e.g. forest clearance and irrigation) is known to influence the burden of malaria that is itself dependent on local determinants of transmission. Overall the most important social constraint for the population will be access to malarial prevention and implementation action to control this scourge.
3585703	1	a	This study examined personal and contextual predictors of active and avoidance coping strategies in a community sample of over 400 adults and in a sample of over 400 persons entering psychiatric treatment for unipolar depression. Sociodemographic factors of education and income (except for active-cognitive coping), personality dispositions of self-confidence and an easy-going manner, and contextual factors of negative life events and family support each made a significant incremental contribution to predicting active and avoidance coping. Among both healthy adults and patients, active and avoidance coping were positively associated with negative life events. Individuals who had more personal and environmental resources were more likely to rely on active coping and less likely to use avoidance coping. Moreover, for both groups, most of the predictors continued to show significant relations with active and avoidance coping strategies even after the stable component in coping was controlled in a longitudinal design. A comprehensive framework to understand the determinants of coping can be of practical value in suggesting points for therapeutic interventions aimed at fostering more adaptive coping efforts.
19418020	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Based on the theoretical and empirical approach of Pierre Bourdieu, a multivariate non-linear method is introduced as an alternative way to analyse the complex relationships between social determinants and health. METHODS: The analysis is based on face-to-face interviews with 695 randomly selected respondents aged 30 to 59. Variables regarding socio-economic status, life circumstances, lifestyles, health-related behaviour and health were chosen for the analysis. In order to determine whether the respondents can be differentiated and described based on these variables, a non-linear canonical correlation analysis (OVERALS) was performed. RESULTS: The results can be described on three dimensions; Eigenvalues add up to the fit of 1.444, which can be interpreted as approximately 50 % of explained variance. The three-dimensional space illustrates correspondences between variables and provides a framework for interpretation based on latent dimensions, which can be described by age, education, income and gender. CONCLUSION: Using non-linear canonical correlation analysis, health characteristics can be analysed in conjunction with socio-economic conditions and lifestyles. Based on Bourdieus theoretical approach, the complex correlations between these variables can be more substantially interpreted and presented.
7112177	1	a	Abortion rates in the United States have risen annually since the 1973 Supreme Court decision. The regions with the greatest rate increases are the Southern and Plains states; the lowest rate increases were in regions which had high abortion rates soon after abortion was legalized. While spatial contiguity appears to influence abortion rates, that is, states with high rates of abortion are clustered spatially, social and political influence are also evident. Ratification of the equal rights amendment, the seeking of abortion outside the state of residence, and the degree of urbanization within a state are variables which influenced U.S. abortion rates between 1973 and 1977.
16451892	0	a	Students' beliefs and attitudes towards the medical profession have been studied in relation to career choices, but most research has been restricted to either predetermined aspects or to a limited number of specialties. This study aimed at getting unprompted insight in the students' perceptions of their future profession in dimensions that may be determinants of study success and career choice. Undergraduate and graduated medical students were interviewed and asked to characterize the medical profession in general and four contrasting specialties in particular. Grounded Theory methodology was used to analyse the data. Participants were medical students at the start of their training (n = 16), during clerkships (n = 10) and after graduation (n = 37). Beginning students perceive the medical profession in limited dimensions: the activities of a physician, their relationship to patients and the physician's knowledge, skills and personality. They do not see many differences between specialties, in contrast with students with clinical experience and graduate students. Undergraduate students' perception is focussed more on social aspects of the profession compared to graduates.
3729384	1	a	This study evaluated methods for empirically identifying environmental determinants of aggressive and disruptive behavior in three developmentally delayed children. A variety of sessions conducted on an inpatient treatment unit were designed to stimulate contingencies maintaining aggression and disruption in the subjects' natural environments. The basic analog conditions included: instructional demands, contingent social disapproval, and structured play. In addition, variations of the three basic conditions were developed based on informal observation and parental reports of naturally occurring contingencies. Results showed considerable variability both between and within subjects. However, for each subject a specific analog condition was shown to produce relatively higher rates of aberrant behavior. Subsequently, behavioral treatments based on assessment results were successfully implemented with two of the subjects. Results are discussed in terms of the importance and practical limitations of conducting systematic assessment of aberrant repertoires in developmentally delayed clients.
6382590	1	a	This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.
15353189	0	a	The role of lifestyle in mediating the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and health has been discussed extensively in the epidemiological and economic literatures. Previous analyses have not considered a formal framework incorporating unobservable heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a simple economic model in which health is determined (partially) by lifestyle, which depends on preferences, budget and time constraints and unobservable characteristics. We estimate a recursive empirical specification consisting of a health production function and reduced forms for the lifestyle equations using Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) for a multivariate probit (MVP) model with discrete indicators of lifestyle choices and self-assessed health (SAH) on British panel data from the 1984 and 1991 Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS). We find that sleeping well, exercising, and not smoking in 1984 have dramatic positive effects on the probability of reporting excellent or good SAH in 1991, and that these effects are much larger having accounted for endogeneity. The failure of epidemiological analyses to account for unobserved heterogeneity can explain their low estimates of the relevance of lifestyle in the socio-economic status-health relationship. Indicators for prudent alcohol consumption and eating breakfast in 1984 are not found to be statistically significant determinants of SAH in 1991.
15704819	0	a	Changes in conduct problems from middle school through early adulthood were examined in a sample of 1191 African American and White males and females. Predictors were selected from a number of ecological contexts to examine the relative contribution of family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors to conduct problems during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grade and across transitions in middle school, into high school, and into young adulthood. Almost all contexts made a unique contribution to conduct problems except for the neighborhood setting. The variables that had the most regular influences during each of these periods were Family Consistent Control, Family Discipline Harshness, and Negative Peers. Positive family and positive peer variables had less consistent relations to outcomes. School variables were more influential in middle school than later. Few gender or race differences were found in the patterning of predictors across time. Studies using only one or two settings as predictors of conduct problems, may provide a misleading picture of their impact by excluding other contextual influences.
6365517	1	a	"The article considers the answers given by different schools of thought to the fundamental questions about the degree of autonomy of medicine and the kind of articulation between medicine and society as a whole and in its ""parts."" The answers vary with the thinking in the different social sciences and the philosophic schools associated with them. The author divides his presentation in two broad chapters: The first covers schools of thought in the health field, and attempts to delineate the philosophical foundations underlying the principal current schools of thought in this field, without attempting a history of the philosophical schools or analyzing each of them in detail. Thus, two idealist currents are studied which have exerted great influence in the health field--neopositivism and neo-Kantianism--and marxism as the materialist school, which recognizes the primary of matter, nature, and objective reality, and views consciousness as a property of matter. The second chapter considers the theoretical contest now going on among the schools of thought discussed in the first chapter, which try to explain the relationship between medicine and the social structure; the effectiveness of medical action, and the social determinants of disease. Prior to the seventies, the author says, the dominant view of the autonomy of medicine, its effectiveness, the potential for social change of the medical institutions, and the benefits to health of economic development, was endorsed by the predominance of positivism among these schools of medical thought. The view that medicine was broadly autonomous and at the same level with other subsystems such as the economic, the political and the educational subsystems, assumed the possibility of changing society by an effort begun through any of these ""sectors."" The enormous growth of productive forces that took place in the developed capitalist countries during the fifties, and even more during the sixties, collided at the end of the latter decade with the existing social production relations, which checked the progress of the production forces and generated a series of challenges in civil society to the aims of economic development and the achievements of science in relation to the inequality of the distribution of wealth. In the health sector, this was a time of criticism of the positivist view and of pointing out the negative effects of medicalization, highlighting the ideological and self-perpetuating character of medical institutions, and proposals for the demedicalization of society.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
7380104	1	a	The effects of social isolation on the behavior of juvenile domestic cats were assessed by rearing 4 male and 4 female infant kittens in each of the following rearing conditions: (1) mother-littermate; (2) mother-only; (3) brooder-littermate; and (4) brooder-only. They were then tested twice a week individually and twice a week socially from 2 to 6 1/2 months of age in a playroom, utilizing multiple categories of behavior. The mother-only-reared juveniles were hyperactive in both object play (when tested individually) and social play. The brooder-only-reared kittens displayed enhanced socially directed behavior and were generally hypergregarious, whereas the brooder-littermate-reared kittens displayed retarded social behavior. Observations indicated that littermate-deprived kittens did not learn social communication skills and that some prolonged separation effects existed for littermate-reared kittens. The results suggest that the determinants of social play are more complex than the determinants of object play.
16676729	0	a	The Authors analyse and discuss the contents of some recent international meetings devoted to Public Health, namely the 10th Congress of the WFPHA, the 12th British annual Forum of Public Health and the 12th Conference of the EUPHA. Their efforts to evaluate health services comes off enriched with new scenarios of integration and convergence. Objectives of global interest in the world cannot be faced by individual countries alone: on the contrary, the whole scientific community of public health operators must be involved. The cultural, social and economic development is the unavoidable condition to increase the health level of the populations. No health organization with the characteristics of excellence can exist without a comparable, balanced development regarding the society and its economy. With such considerations in mind, the European Commission in 1997 has began to develop the Health Monitoring Programme, with the aim to build a system for monitoring health in the UE. Within this Programme, the Study ECHI 1 (European Community Health Indicators 1) has been published, which includes 4 large groups of indicators (demographic and socioeconomic indicators, health indicators, determinants of health/disease indicators, health services indicators); such a study was performed with the cooperation of OCSE and WHO/Euro researchers. The following ECHI 2 research did not change the supporting philosophy of ECHI 1. We are trying to evaluate whether the intervention of health operators and health structures could influence - increasing or decreasing - the phenomena described and measured by the indicators, inviting the readers to start a debate with us.

11784904	0	a	A population-based case-control study was carried out to identify determinant factors for post-neonatal infant deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition in Greater Metropolitan Belo Horizonte, Southeast Brazil. From May 1, 1991, to April 30, 1992, 511 post-neonatal deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition were selected after investigation of medical records to validate cause of death. Of this total, 396 deaths were compared to a neighborhood control group, matched for age. The study was carried out in a low-income area with a high proportion of families living in shantytowns. The article discusses the methodology and selected socioeconomic factors. Logistic regression analysis indicated that number of household appliances, mother's and father's education, and mother's marital and work status were significantly associated with risk of infant death, i.e., they were determinants of infant deaths due to avoidable causes.
6106945	1	a	Given the poor quantity and quality of medical care in most villages in the developing countries, the economic determinants of village health are the supply of labour, the cash flow associated with that labour and the availability of land. The paper examines these in the three classical 'time periods', arguing that inability to meet labour peaks is of great significance in explaining seasonal shortage of food and chronic shortage of cash. It also explains community indifference to upkeep of social overhead capital. Substitution of capital goods for labour is socially differentiated, not least by labour availability, and leads inevitably to a regressive distribution of land and the creation or enlargement of a class of landless labourers. Under certain limited conditions this class may enjoy a rising real income with associated health-promotive expenditures. The more normal case, however, is extreme poverty, whether rural or urban, with all that that implies for the undermining of health. Land reform therefore becomes a necessary precondition of health promotion.
19142245	0	a	Taking a clinical case illustrative of current practice as a starting point, the authors examine the terms of such practice. They point out the social and cultural factors as determinants of the new manifestations of suffering. Changes in clinical practice, techniques and the relation between disciplines are reviewed, focusing particularly on the interface between Psychoanalysis and Neurological Sciences, as well as other schools of psychotherapy. They highlight the theoretic elements provided by Psychoanalysis that remain valid in the field of Mental Health and are used by non-specialized professionals, as a testimony of the way in which psychoanalysis has impregnated our culture.
4031402	1	a	The study replicates and extends recent work on personality determinants of adjustment. Personality traits and adjustment criteria were selected for relevance to one type of real-life setting (public housing for the elderly that includes a senior center). Personality traits were measured by observer ratings; criteria, by self-report of respondents and perceptions of them by other residents and staff. In concurrent and longitudinal analyses controlling effects of competence and social status, personality traits accounted for significant and meaningful variance in all criteria, and the salience of particular traits varied across criteria. The results are consistent with earlier studies regarding the importance of extraversion and neuroticism to subjective well-being and suggest that they are relevant also to adjustment as perceived by others. The additional traits of congeniality, culture, and nosiness/gossip were related to both inner and outer adjustment measures in the type of situations studied.
25195529	1	a	With the increasing interest in comparative studies of the elderly, China has become the focus of research attention. This society, which has been inaccessible to most Western researchers, offers a special site for studies of aging because of its sheer size as a world power, its relationship to Third World countries, and its population problem-a growing segment of elderly people. Available data from a variety of social science sources are utilized to compare how the sociocultural context of China and the United States impact differentially upon the older population in each society. Three major determinants specify the theoretical context: economic development (the level of production an economic system achieves); traditional cultural patterns (norms, roles, relationships); and the social control mechanisms (regulatory processes based upon the legal and sanctioning systems). These determinants provide a theoretical orientation for analyzing the outcome variables involved in the behavior and adaptation of the old. In American society, cultural norms and values are advantageous for active older persons in good health, particularly those with a favorable economic situation. In contemporary Chinese society, which blends traditional customs with the values of a revolutionary and changing society, there are advantages for the frail elderly.
17915325	0	a	"The Observation Scale for Aggressive Behavior (OSAB) has been developed to evaluate inpatient treatment programs designed to reduce aggressive behavior in Dutch forensic psychiatric patients with an antisocial personality disorder, who are ""placed at the disposal of the government"". The scale should have the sensitivity to measure changes in the possible determinants of aggressive behavior, such as limited control of displayed negative emotions (irritation, anger or rage) and a general deficiency of social skills. In developing the OSAB 40 items were selected from a pool of 82 and distributed among the following a priori scales: Irritation/anger, Anxiety/gloominess, Aggressive behavior, Antecedent (to aggressive behavior), Sanction (for aggressive behavior) and Social behavior. The internal consistency of these subscales was good, the inter-rater reliability was moderate to good, and the test-retest reliability over a two to three week period was moderate to good. The correlation between the subscales Irritation/anger, Anxiety/gloominess, Aggressive behavior, Antecedent, Sanction was substantial and significant, but the anticipated negative correlation between these subscales and the Social behavior subscale could not be shown. Relationships between the corresponding subscales of the OSAB and the FIOS, used to calculate concurrent validity, yielded relatively high correlations. The validity of the various OSAB subscales could be further supported by significant correlations with the PCL-R and by significant but weak correlations with corresponding subscales of the self-report questionnaires. The Observation Scale for Aggressive Behavior (OSAB) seems to measure aggressive behavior in Dutch forensic psychiatric inpatients with an antisocial personality disorder reliably and validly. Contrary to expectations, a negative relationship was not found between aggressive and social behavior in either the OSAB or FIOS, which were used for calculating concurrent validity."
16533108	0	a	"This article reviews the historical development of population health indicators. We have long known that environmental, socioeconomic, early life conditions, individual actions, and medical care all interact to affect health. Present quantitative reporting on the impact of these factors on population health grew out of Bills of Mortality published in the 1500s. Since then, regular censuses, civil registration of vital statistics, and international classification systems have improved data quality and comparability. Regular national health interview surveys and application of administrative data contributed information on morbidity, health services use, and some social determinants of health. More recently, traditional health databases and datasets on ""nonhealth"" sector determinants have been linked. Statistical methods for map-making, risk adjustment, multilevel analysis, calculating population-attributable risks, and summary measures of population health have further helped to integrate information. Reports on the health of populations remain largely confined to focused areas. This paper suggests a conceptual framework for using indicators to report on all the domains of population health. Future ethical development of indicators will incorporate principles of justice, transparency, and effectiveness."
14962415	0	a	PURPOSE: To investigate the determinants of participation in daily activities in people with impaired vision using the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) instrument. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We recruited 319 participants with no vision rehabilitation history, distance visual acuity (VA) <6/12 (better eye), the ability to converse in English, and 18 years or older. Participants completed the 32-item IVI questionnaire and provided demographic, personal, cultural, and environmental details on vision-related functioning. Visual acuity data were either abstracted from the participants' files or assessed by qualified personnel. Participants also completed the SF-12 to evaluate physical (PCS-12) and mental health (MCS-12). RESULTS: The areas of greatest restriction of participation were associated with reading, outdoor mobility, participation in leisure activities, and shopping. In stepwise linear regression presenting VA, the PCS-12 and MCS-12 explained the variance in leisure and work (60 participants or 19%), consumer and social interaction (92 participants or 30%), household and personal care (76 participants or 24%), mobility (92 participants or 30%), emotional reaction to visual loss and (106 participants or 33%), and total IVI score (114 participants or 36%). Having age-related macular degeneration contributed marginally to the IVI domains and total score (P <.05-.01), except for the emotional domain. Belonging to a social group explained 3% and 2% of the variance in the consumer and social interaction and emotional domains, respectively (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: Distance VA and physical and mental health explained more than a third of the variance of the total score, suggesting that an intervention aimed at improving quality of life may include strategies to improve not only vision-related rehabilitation but also mental and physical health.

History of this cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach to management of occupational, lifestyle, environmental and social health determinants is outlined. Health policy requirements and performance indicators are provided to facilitate GP HESME implementation at the enterprise and local levels. The role of local authorities and networking of enterprises, representing various sectors is highlighted.
15464009	0	a	The increase of physical stature in the developed countries and their socio-economic correlates has been well documented for nearly two centuries. In this study, the secular changes in height, weight and the BMI of Hungarian university students and conscripts are analyzed for the years 1933-1998. During the first half of this period these body measurements changed little, while in the second half the rates of change accelerated rapidly: height increased by 1.7 cm among males and 1.8 cm among female university students per decade, and 1.8 cm among male conscripts. Differences were found according to the place of birth and residence as well as parental occupation and educational level.
16687381	0	a	Understanding and enhancing adherence to HIV medications has been identified as a major challenge. The purpose of this study was to explore patterns and determinants of non-adherence among individuals receiving HIV care in a medical clinic. Seven focus groups were conducted with 42 HIV+ patients, and verbatim transcripts of focus group sessions were analyzed through a combination of ethnographic and content analysis. Of the participants currently on combination therapy, 68% reported at least one recent instance of non-adherence. The most commonly cited reasons for non-adherent behavior were grouped into four categories: (1) problems with side effects; (2) conflicts with daily life activities; (3) feelings of aversion toward the medications themselves; and (4) deliberate alterations to the prescribed regimen. Findings based on structured analysis of patient responses in each category differ from past research which defines adherence as a treatment problem and emphasizes logistical characteristics of the treatment regimen itself and patients' ability or willingness to follow specific instructions. In contrast, our focus group data suggest an alternative frame for understanding barriers to adherence which focuses on: (1) the meaning that adherence/pill-taking behavior has for individuals experiencing chronic illness; and (2) the impact that this behavior has on their identity. Because adherence behavior is integral to patients' experience of their disease, non-adherence is no longer a treatment problem, but is an illness problem. Framing adherence as an illness problem rather than a treatment problem is a critical shift that can be applied to the creation of assessments and interventions designed to support patient adherence; this article ends with a series of specific recommendations for programs, policy, and research.
7202850	1	a	Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children.
16299386	0	a	Myxococcus xanthus has two different mechanisms of motility, adventurous (A) motility, which permits individual cells to glide over solid surfaces, and social (S) motility, which permits groups of cells to glide. To identify the genes involved in S-gliding motility, we mutagenized a delta aglU (A-) strain with the defective transposon, magellan-4, and screened for S- mutants that form nonmotile colonies. Sequence analysis of the sites of the magellan-4 insertions in these mutants and the alignment of these sites with the M. xanthus genome sequence show that two-thirds of these insertions lie within 27 of the 37 nonessential genes known to be required for social motility, including those necessary for the biogenesis of type IV pili, exopolysaccharide, and lipopolysaccharide. The remaining insertions also identify 31 new, nonessential genes predicted to encode both structural and regulatory determinants of S motility. These include three tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, several regulators of transcription that may control the expression of genes involved in pilus extension and retraction, and additional enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism. Three insertions that abolish S motility lie within genes predicted to encode glycolytic enzymes, suggesting that the signal for pilus retraction may be a simple product of exopolysaccharide catabolism.
2943159	1	a	The maladaptive behavior of 474 persons from a residential facility for mentally retarded individuals was investigated. Eleven independent variables pertaining to demographic and environmental characteristics were initially related to the frequency and topography of residents' maladaptive behavior. Multiple regression analysis revealed that maladaptive behaviors were related to sex, social age, chronological age, resident's time spent on outside activities, number of residents per direct-care staff member, presence of sensory handicaps, and ambulation. Results were related to existing literature and discussed in terms of their use for intervention efforts and differential assignment of resources.
12315389	1	a	"The effect of previous geographic mobility on the length of an unemployed person's job search in the United States is examined. ""This study proposed that knowledge of regional wage differentials and other market conditions give a worker with prior geographic mobility experience a better stock of information than one who has worked all of his or her work life in the same geographical location. It is proposed that this superior stock of information has a significant impact on the amount of time it takes an unemployed worker to locate and accept a job."" Data are from the 1981 Panel Study of Income Dynamics."
2783626	1	a	The knowledge and concerns regarding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and their relationship to certain behaviors among adolescents with hemophilia, a pediatric risk group with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positivity rate as high as 70% to 90%, are described. Information was obtained from 26 patients, 13 to 19 years of age, through the use of a confidential self-administered questionnaire and a semistructured interview. In general, subjects demonstrated a high level of factual knowledge regarding the cause, natural history, transmission, and prevention of AIDS. Despite this, participants frequently behaved in ways that were potentially harmful to themselves and others. Specifically, although aware of the importance of using condoms, sexually active adolescents with hemophilia were not practicing safe sex. Restriction in the use of heat-treated clotting factor because of concerns about AIDS was also frequently reported. Professionals providing AIDS education and counseling for these individuals need to be cognizant of the concerns and social skills of this population; they should focus not only on factual information but also on the social and situational pressures confronting these teenagers, which may be more immediate determinants of their behavior and well-being. As AIDS continues to spread into the general population, these findings have relevance to AIDS education and health policy efforts aimed at all adolescents.
6495362	1	a	In Sri Lanka in 1975, the majority Sinhalese had a much higher use of contraception than either the Sri Lanka Tamils or the Moors. This study uses a national sample of women of childbearing age gathered by the Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey in 1975 to assess four possible reasons for differential contraceptive use: (1) differences in socioeconomic position; (2) cultural differences; (3) minority status; and (4) differential access to family planning services. The first three explanations focus on differences in the demand for contraception while the fourth explanation focuses on differences in the availability of contraceptives. The socioeconomic, cultural, and minority status hypotheses fail to explain the higher contraceptive use among the Sinhalese. The evidence is consistent with the idea that ethnic differences in contraceptive use were largely caused by differential access to family planning services.
18703376	0	a	The population health perspective recognizes a broad range of characteristics that are thought to be important determinants of health. In Canada, 12 such determinants of health are recognized, which range from lifestyle practices and the use of health care services to social and physical environments. While the list of social determinants is quite exhaustive, few studies have examined the relative importance of these determinants. The intent of this paper is to examine the relative importance of a range of social determinants of health in predicting four health outcomes of interest using data from a neighbourhood-level cross-sectional health survey conducted in Hamilton, Ontario. The results show that key social determinants of health vary by health outcome. The significance of the findings is discussed in terms of policy relevance and future research.
12102133	0	a	Experimental analysis procedures have been shown to be effective means for identifying the environmental determinants of problem behaviors. A potential limitation of these procedures is that it is necessary to produce and document patterns in the occurrence of the problem behavior during the assessment. In the case of severe behavior disorders, this may place the participant or therapist at such risk as to preclude the analysis. The current study arranged experimental analysis contingencies for precursor behaviors that had been observed to reliably precede the occurrence of problem behaviors targeted for reduction. For each of the 4 participants, it was possible to infer the maintaining variables for problem behaviors based on the outcomes of precursor analysis. These results suggest that the current procedures represent a promising alternative method for reducing risk during functional analysis of problem behaviors.
2558204	1	a	To identify factors associated with the decision to consult with dyspepsia, patients with dyspepsia were identified from a postal survey in the community. A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.
16174346	0	a	Some propositions on male and female sexual orientation will be considered. Some of these are established; others are more speculative. The aim is to offer some notes towards a coherent, comprehensive theory of sexual orientation. 1. The distinction between butch and femme lesbians seems real rather than a social construct. 2. High levels of prenatal steroid hormones seem to be causally associated with the sexual orientation of butch lesbians. However it is not established whether the causal process operates prenatally or postnatally (or both). This is so because prenatal hormone levels are thought to correlate positively with postnatal hormone levels. And high postnatal hormone levels may facilitate homosexual behaviour as a consequence of sensation-seeking. 3. Male bisexuals also are interpreted to have been exposed to high prenatal testosterone levels. But (for reasons similar to those outlined above in regard to butch lesbians) it is unclear whether these have a direct prenatal effect on the brain or whether they are precursors of high postnatal testosterone levels, which are associated with male bisexual orientation by promoting sensation-seeking behaviour. 4. Postnatal learning processes seem to be causally involved in the sexual orientation of some femme lesbians and some exclusive male homosexuals. 5. Some homosexual men have genes that predispose to their sexual orientation. 6. The same may apply to some lesbians, but such genes have not, as far as I know, been identified. 7. People (of both sexes) who engage in same-sex sexual behaviour may be classified simultaneously in two ways, viz (1) 'active' vs 'passive' and (2) those who do and those who do not engage (or consider engaging) in sex with members of the opposite sex. Ex hypothesi, some of the 'active' ones initiate some of the 'passive' ones. The active ones are driven more by hormones and the passive ones by psychosocial factors. The active males contain a substantial proportion of self-identified bisexuals; and the active females a substantial proportion of self-identified butches. 8. These two active categories (butch lesbians and male bisexuals) share a number of endocrinological, psychological, morphological and behavioural features vis-a-vis their exclusively homosexual and heterosexual peers. Methods of testing some of these ideas are presented.
7100991	1	a	Five hypothesis regarding the social psychological determinants of patient satisfaction were tested among patients attending the primary care clinics of a university medical center in Manhatten. The social psychological variables operationalized here were expectations, values, entitlement and perceived occurrences; the three dimensions of satisfaction studied were doctor conduct, convenience and general satisfaction. The social psychological variables together were found to explain only a small proportion of the variance in satisfaction, although their contribution varied with the dimension of satisfaction. Expectations consistantly explained most of the variance in satisfaction ratings; particularly noteworthy was the direct effect of prior expectations of the doctor's conduct on subsequent satisfaction with that dimension of the care received. Values had little independent effect on satisfaction, and the combination of values and expectations (their interaction) was unrelated to satisfaction. Feelings of entitlement were also unrelated to satisfaction ratings. There was some support for the discrepancy model, which holds that the greater the discrepancy between perceived occurrences and prior expectations the less the satisfaction. The importance of carrying out further methodological studies aimed at developing reliable measures of these constructs is stressed.
6667732	1	a	An analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) finds that 82 percent of sexually active teenage mothers were using contraceptives in the year following the birth of their first child; the majority of those who practiced contraception used the pill. The proportion of black teenagers using no method of birth control was higher than that for white teenagers, and it increased over the course of the year. Rates of nonuse were particularly high among black women younger than 18, only 68 percent of whom practiced contraception (compared with 85 percent of whites the same age). Examination of the data by marital status shows that women who married while they were pregnant were the most likely to practice contraception in the year following their first birth, while those who were single at the time of first birth were the least likely to do so (89 versus 74 percent). Blacks constituted the majority of women who were not married at the time of first birth, and of all marital subgroups, single blacks had the highest rate of nonuse (29 percent). The probability of a pregnancy during the year following a first birth for all teenage mothers was 17 percent. Pregnancy rates among women with incomes less than 150 percent of poverty level were nearly twice as high as rates among women who had incomes above that level--21 percent vs. 11 percent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
3619612	1	a	A predictive model for employment after spinal cord injury was developed. The study population consisted of 154 spinal cord injured persons who were treated at our hospital between 1973 and 1979, and followed for seven years after injury. Demographic, social, and injury severity data were abstracted from each subject's hospital record. Motivation to work, employment history, and sources of postinjury financial support, were assessed by a vocational rehabilitation counselor. The study population was divided into four groups: persons continuously unemployed after injury, homemakers, students, and those employed at some time during the seven-year follow-up period. Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to develop a predictive model that ultimately included seven variables: gender, motivation to work, whether the patient's last job required ambulation, race, educational level, a functional ability score, and whether the patient had children. The model correctly classified 82% of those persons who were continuously unemployed, 100% of homemakers, 63% of students, and 72% of employed subjects. Overall, 79% of subjects were classified correctly. The most important classification errors were between the unemployed and employed groups. Seventeen percent of employed patients were incorrectly classified as unemployed, and 11% of unemployed patients were incorrectly classified as employed. Although there are other determinants of postinjury vocational status, individual potential can be assessed by means of a comparatively small set of predictor variables.
19436534	0	a	Diseases of modernism, rather than infectious diseases and chronic medical conditions, increasingly cause childhood morbidity and mortality. Thus, the goal of enhancing life outcomes for all children has become imperative. Paediatricans may begin with a renewed interest in social paediatrics - the care of the disadvantaged child in Canada, requiring a focus on all the complex factors that impact families and the community. New paediatricians need the tools to impact both social determinants of health and political policies to support health for all. Such interest is as old as the field of paediatrics (social medicine began with the great pathologist, Virchow, in the 1800s). The new neuroscience of experience-based brain and biological development has caught up with the social epidemiology literature. It is now known from both domains that a child's poor developmental and health outcomes are a product of early and ongoing socioeconomic and psychological experiences. In the era of epigenetics, it is now understood that both nature and nurture control the genome. Future paediatricians need to understand the science of experience-based brain development, and the interventions demonstrated to improve life trajectories. A challenge is to connect the traditional population health approach with traditional primary care responsibilities. New and enhanced collaborative interdisciplinary networks with, for example, public health, primary care, community resources, education and justice systems are required.
2638678	1	a	To identify the individual and household level variables associated with increased risk of mortality, 159 infant and 50 child deaths (cases) and equal number of age matched live infants and children (controls) and their families were studied in a rural area of Haryana. The social, economic, educational and environmental characteristics of the case and control families were similar. Increased risk of infant and child mortality was associated with maternal age less than 20 and more than 30 years, birth order 4th or higher, unclean cord care at the time of child birth, failure of breast feeding during the first 3 months of age, lack of immunizations, and previous infant or child death(s) in the family (Odds ratio greater than 2; P less than 0.05-0.01 by X2 test). An emphasis on the interventions directed at control of the above mentioned variables may prove most helpful in reducing infant and child mortality in a rural area.
16351702	0	a	PURPOSE: To review the current literature about potential determinants of fruit and vegetable intakes and effective intervention strategies to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables among 6-12-year-old children. METHODS: A structured review of literature located in PubMed and Psychinfo electronic literature databases. RESULTS: Of all determinants, the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables and taste preferences were most consistently and most positively related to consumption. There was some evidence that parental fruit and vegetable intakes, knowledge of intake recommendations and skills had a positive association with children's intakes, whereas television viewing, exposure to television advertisement, and having a snack bar at school were associated with lower intakes of fruit and vegetables. Multi-component school-based interventions that combined classroom curriculum, parent and food service components showed the greatest promise for fruit and vegetable promotion among children. School fruit and vegetable subscription programmes, scout-based interventions, and fruit and vegetables education via computer multi-media channels also appear promising. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should improve the availability and accessibility of fruit and vegetables to children, and should aim to improve their taste preferences for them. Such interventions should be of a multi-component nature, school-based or use other social channels and may include multi-media channels.
3407490	1	a	The influence of parental factors on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use has been examined previously, and findings have been contradictory. Previous studies, which found little relationship between parental norms and adolescent sexual activity, have been limited by their failure to recognize developmental differences in the relative weight of parent and peer influences between younger and older teens and by use of selected samples, resulting in a restriction of range. The current study differs in that it utilizes a clustered sample household survey of 329 males and females, aged 14 to 17, and 470 of their parents. Using multiple regression analysis, it was found that parents' reported behavioral norms account for 5% of the variance in whether adolescents have had intercourse, and for 33% of the variance in use of contraception at last intercourse. The study suggests that while parents' normative beliefs have limited effect in the decision to become sexually active, they have considerable impact on later contraceptive use.
6634993	1	a	Previous experimentation led to a suggestion that pituitary-mediated metabolites present in female urine are important determinants of stimulus potency in eliciting 70 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations from adult male mice (Mus musculus). In the present experiment this hypothesis was reexamined, taking into account the prior experience of the male test subjects. Male mice were given social experience with either hypophysectomized females or intact, normal females and were then monitored for ultrasonic vocalizations to chemosensory stimuli from both. Results indicated that males (1) will emit ultrasonic vocalizations to urine from hypophysectomized females and (2) tend to preferentially emit ultrasound to stimuli from the type of female previously encountered during the social experience regimen. It is proposed that the previously reported lack of ultrasound emission by males to chemosignals from hypophysectomized females can be accounted for via straightforward associative learning mechanisms.
6382590	1	a	This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.
7208724	1	a	A population of professional dance (N = 183) and modelling (N = 56) students, who by career choice must focus increased attention and control over their body shapes, was studied. Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. The influence of socio-cultural determinants are discussed within the context of anorexia nervosa as a multidetermined disorder.
16122570	0	a	Recent findings support and add to earlier findings of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Deficits across neurocognitive domains such as attention, working memory, language skills, and executive functioning tend to be moderate, with the most pronounced deficits found in verbal learning and memory. All these neurocognitive domains are related to adaptive and social skills, with executive functions and verbal learning and memory showing more variance across more domains than other neuro-cognitive variables. Negative symptoms and neurocognitive domains, although correlated, are distinct and have differential pathways of change with treatment. General psychopathology symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, may become important treatment targets as strategies are developed for translating cognitive enhancement to real-world functional performance.
11809144	0	a	BACKGROUND: Smoking during pregnancy poses a health risk for the fetus which may later extend to the child and adult, with higher probability of respiratory problems. The aim of this study was the to investigate the correlation between smoking during pregnancy and the neonatal characteristics and sociodemographic determinants of smoking habit during pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study subjects were 419 mothers and their newborns in Barcelona, Spain. Data on smoking habits were collected using a structured questionnaire. We measured cotinine in umbilical cord blood as a biomarker of exposition to tobacco smoke. Concentrations of cotinine were determined using a radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: 29% interviewed mothers declared daily cigarette consumption during the third trimester of pregnancy, while the biomarker test showed that 34% mothers were smoking at the end of pregnancy. Smoking habit during pregnancy, assessed by means of either the questionnaire or the biomarker, correlated negatively with anthropometric parameters (weight, length and head circumference) of the newborn. The smoking habit was not associated with social class and age, although it was lower in primigravid mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other European countries, there is a widespread smoking consumption during pregnancy in Spain, regardless of the social class and maternal age. Reduction of both active smoking and exposition to environmental tobacco smoke represent key elements in the prevention of newborns' morbidity and mortality.
19412483	0	a	A series of 44 consecutive elderly, admitted to a busy general hospital following deliberate self-poisoning, is reviewed for associated medical and psychosocial factors. In all but 3 cases the act involved an overdose of drugs prescribed for the treatment of a chronic medical and/or psychiatric disorder. Women outnumbered men by 2.7 to 1. There was high proportion of chronic psychiatric (80%, mostly depressive) and medical (60%) conditions. Chronic stress from the physical illness, social isolation, or tacit family conflict were common and seemed instrumental in the self-poisoning act. Most attempts were carried out around the weekend and during winter. One man succumbed to complications of the overdose but the rest of the patients recovered. Psychosocial (especially depressive) and medical vulnerability, plus availability of prescribed drugs, were the most important determinants of suicidal behavior among these elderly attempters.
3053480	1	a	"The offense-defense dichotomy undeniably proved to be of heuristic interest in that it allowed relevant distinctions between specific behaviour patterns, to establish correlations between situations in which either ""offensive"" or ""defensive"" patterns are likely to be displayed, and to uncover differential drug effects on those distinct behavior patterns. But for a number of reasons, the author is led to conclude that even though the offense-defense dichotomy indeed helps in many instances to describe and to distinguish, it has rather limited potential really to explain in depth what it distinguishes at a phenomenological level of investigation."
11962684	0	a	Quality of life (QoL) is estimated from patients scores to items related to everyday life, including rest and activity. The rest-activity rhythm reflects endogenous circadian clock function. The relation between the individual rhythm in activity and QoL was investigated in 200 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients wore a wrist actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York. NY) for 3-5 d before chronotherapy, and completed a QoL questionnaire developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (QLQ-C30) plus the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The rest-activity circadian rhythm was characterized by the mean activity level (m), autocorrelation coefficient at 24h (r24), and the dichotomy index (I < O). a ratio between the amount of activity while in and out of bed. The distribution of the rest-activity cycle parameters and that of QoL scores was independent of sex, age, primary tumor, number of metastatic sites, and prior treatment. Both the 24h rhythm indicators were positively correlated with global QoL score as well as physical, emotional, and social functioning. Negative correlations were found between m, r24, or I < O and fatigue, appetite loss, and nausea. The rest-activity circadian rhythm appeared to be an objective indicator of physical welfare and QoL. This analysis suggests that circadian function may be one of the biological determinants of QoL in cancer patients.
7112177	1	a	Abortion rates in the United States have risen annually since the 1973 Supreme Court decision. The regions with the greatest rate increases are the Southern and Plains states; the lowest rate increases were in regions which had high abortion rates soon after abortion was legalized. While spatial contiguity appears to influence abortion rates, that is, states with high rates of abortion are clustered spatially, social and political influence are also evident. Ratification of the equal rights amendment, the seeking of abortion outside the state of residence, and the degree of urbanization within a state are variables which influenced U.S. abortion rates between 1973 and 1977.
7419352	1	a	Most of the 'variance' in human food selection can be attributed to culture and individual experience. It is argued that while rigorous research on biological determinants of food selection is very valuable, we must also invest heavily in more exploratory, social science oriented studies. Only in this way can we approach most of the major determinants of food choice. We must recognize that food selection is multidetermined and context dependent. At this early stage of scientific development in this field, we must be willing to consider tradeoffs between rigor or quantification and promising preliminary and qualitative studies.
11338330	0	a	This study refines and tests an individual client model of service use and contrasts it with a model of service provision based on gateway provider perspectives. Structural equation models demonstrate that provider variables account for more service use variation than client variables. The client model accounts for 24% of the variance in service use, while the provider model accounts for 55% of the variance. Youth self-reported mental health was not positively associated with increased services or with provider perception of youth mental health. The provider model demonstrates the critical role played by provider perceptions, which are influenced more by work environment than by client problems.
3867226	1	a	The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
12637842	0	a	To determine the treatment preferences (, medication, counseling, or both) for victims of recent trauma at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and the determinants of those choices, preferences were elicited from 466 consecutive victims of physical or sexual assault at an urban emergency department as part of the routine clinical evaluation by emergency department social workers. Demographics, assault characteristics, and clinical history were used to predict preference. More than 80% of victims expressed an interest in treatment, with more interested in counseling (76%) than medication (62%). Female gender and assaults of a sexual nature were most highly predictive of preference for medication, whereas female gender, sexual assault, a history of psychiatric treatment, and perceived life threat from the trauma were most predictive of preference for counseling and preference for any treatment. Because treatment preferences were easily obtained from assault victims seeking emergency care, the elicitation of these treatment preferences and the consideration of them in the treatment planning process could facilitate engagement in treatment and overcome the avoidance of treatment by some victims.
3384599	1	a	Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological reasons were studied prospectively for a four month period in an Indian General Hospital. Psychiatric emergencies constituted only 2% of all emergency visits. Most of the patients were new except for 7.4% who were already registered with the outpatient services of the psychiatry department. Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 2:1. Self-referrals constituted 77% of the samples; 21% of patients were brought by police. Two-thirds of the patients were brought owing to the severity of their clinical condition and the rest, one-third, for medico-legal and social reasons. Approximately 80% of the patients sought consultation within one month of the onset of illness episode. First episode of mental illness was within last one year of the emergency room visit in 60% patients. Past history of hospitalization for mental illness was obtained only in 10% of cases. The pattern suggested that there was no misuse of emergency services by psychiatric patients although 20% of the patients presented with social problems only which required social rather than psychiatric intervention.
11565446	0	a	"OBJECTIVES: The negative health effects of cigarette smoking are nowadays well known. An important prerequisite for the implementation of rewarding health promotion campaigns aiming at reducing the tobacco dependency in the general population is the knowledge about smoking prevalences in different social population groups, and specific information about social factors and determinants influencing smoking behaviour. METHODS: In this regard, the Microcensus is a very valuable data source for Germany. Included in the present analysis are persons aged 18 years and older, which are present in the ""Microcensus Public Use File 1995"" and had answered the questions about their smoking behaviour (N = 186,424). The dependent study variable is current cigarette smoking. Independent study variables are sociodemographic factors (age, sex, family status), occupational status, unemployment, socio-economic situation and regional-specific variables (size of community, East vs West Germany). RESULTS: All together, 30.5% of the males and 18.0% of the females were current smokers. Significantly higher smoking rates were observed for persons living in metropolitan areas, persons with low educational achievement and low occupational status, for people being divorced, unemployed, and living on social welfare. In a second step, we analysed the cumulative effect of these social factors for current smoking status. In summary, it was found that the cumulation of social determinants explained a great part of the variance in smoking prevalence. Current smoking was four to six times more prevalent in population groups characterised by several unfavourable social conditions compared to more privilege population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, smoking related prevention activities should be evaluated, among others, regarding their potential to reduce the social polarisation of the smoking epidemic."
10926127	0	a	The aim of this study was to evaluate possible changes in predisposing factors in sexual preventive behaviors that could result from the availability of an efficient new antiretroviral therapy. A total of 136 young adults were randomly assigned a vignette to read describing AIDS as a lethal or chronic disease. After reading the vignette, the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial determinants of intention to use a condom with a new sexual partner. The variables were measured according to Ajzen's (1985, 1988, 1991) theory of planned behavior and Triandis's (1977) theory of interpersonal behavior. The experimental manipulation was more successful when the disease was described as lethal (66 of the 68 subjects) rather than chronic (30 of the 68 subjects). For the 96 participants who correctly identified the expected outcome of the disease presented in the vignette, a significant difference in intention was found between the two experimental situations (p < .05). Regression of intention to use condoms on the psychosocial variables yielded an adjusted R2 of .62. Perceived behavioral control, social norms, personal normative belief and anticipated affective reaction were the significant variables explaining this intention. The results suggest that intention to use condoms with a new sexual partner is likely to be modified by the expected outcome of the disease, that is, whether lethal or chronic. Thus, it is suggested that interventions aimed at young adults take into account the impacts the new antiretroviral treatments are likely to have on preventive behaviors.
3609410	1	a	This paper proposes and carries out a two-stage analysis of the determinants of desired family size, using data gathered from a sample of women in the city of Ilorin, Nigeria. The analysis first focuses on differences between women who report numerical family size desires and those who report nonnumerical desires. Findings suggest that there are important differences between these two groups, but there is little variation in the actual number reported by those expressing numerical desires. Implications of these findings for survey design are discussed. In particular, the practice of forcing numerical responses by instructing interviewers to probe when women report nonnumerical desires is questioned.
18356195	0	a	BACKGROUND: Social class in childhood and in adulthood have been shown to be important determinants of risk factors in later life. Often the childhood information is retrospective and liable to bias. We use data from a family study of two generations of adults to investigate the effects of social class in childhood, adulthood and social mobility on risk factors. METHODS: In 1996, 2338 adult offspring of participants of the 1970s Renfrew/Paisley study took part in a screening examination. They provided information on sociological, behavioural and clinical risk factors, as their parents had done 20 years previously. Social class and father's social class were available, enabling their influence on risk factors to be investigated. RESULTS: Generally risk factors improved for offspring compared with parents, except for Body mass index and obesity, which worsened. Risk factors were less favourable in manual compared with non-manual offspring, and were more closely related to own than father's social class. There was a large amount of upward social mobility involving 35% of sons and 50% of daughters. Risk factors for the upwardly mobile tended to be more favourable than the class they left behind but less favourable than the class they joined. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitants of social mobility may reflect behavioural choices, such as smoking, and adverse factors, which are more difficult to leave behind. The relatively fast changes in social class profile may not be reflected in as quick changes in population health, as the upwardly mobile bring their earlier life adversities with them.
6464823	1	a	A sample of delinquent and nondelinquent male adolescents was assessed with respect to locus of control and intellectual achievement responsibility. Data were also gathered concerning age, family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and school grade. Results were subjected to a multivariate analysis and showed support for a multidimensional model of locus of control. There was no difference in expectancy of control for negative academic events between delinquents and nondelinquents. In general, birth order and delinquency were the two most important determinants of locus of control. Results are discussed in terms of previous literature on locus of control with particular consideration paid to expectations of control.
17391344	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence, severity and persistence of the disability associated with bipolar disorder (BPD). Reliable instruments are needed to support research into the factors associated with disability and treatment response. Contextual factors (e.g., availability of supported employment programs) can affect functionality, posing a challenge to such investigations. We present preliminary findings regarding the validity of the Multidimensional Scale of Independent Functioning (MSIF) in BPD. The MSIF provides discrete ratings of support separate from both role responsibility and performance quality in work, residential and educational environments. These distinctions allow the 'correction' for variability explained by contextual factors that allows the comparison of studies conducted in different environments and time. METHODS: Participants with BPD were administered the MSIF, the Social Adjustment Scale II (SAS-II) and an interview recording objective data regarding work, school and residential activities as part of an ongoing longitudinal study of BPD disability. RESULTS: Construct validity estimated using standardized Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.76 (n = 58). MSIF global ratings were significantly lower (reflecting higher functionality) for subjects engaged in productive activity compared with participants who were not active (t = -3.6, p = 0.001) demonstrating external validity. Inter-rater reliability estimates ranged from 0.86 to 0.99 (n = 49). Significant, high correlations were demonstrated between comparable MSIF and SAS-II global ratings (criterion validity = 0.70-0.79) and low correlations were found between non-comparable ratings (discriminant validity = -0.07 to -0.35) (n = 14). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the MSIF is a valid and reliable instrument optimally designed for studying determinants of disability and treatment response in BPD.

10927844	0	a	Community members, service providers, and elected representatives in two Toronto communities were asked to identify community factors influencing the health of community members. Many of the identified barriers to health related to government policies and actions. Cutbacks in federal transfers to provinces and provincial cutbacks in funding for agencies, reductions in social assistance, ending of new social housing, and other policy changes were seen as negatively impacting the health of the community and its members. These perceptions were remarkably consistent with emerging findings concerning the determinants of health. Implications for public health practice were considered.
18464286	0	a	I study factors associated with prevalence of obesity among immigrants as the length of their stay in the US becomes longer. Using the National Health Interview Surveys for 1990-2004, I create 'synthetic cohorts' of immigrants that allow controlling for two important determinants of obesity: age at arrival and period of arrival in the US. I find that immigrants with a BA degree did not experience any change in obesity as their stay in the US advanced. Obesity among those without a BA degree, however, increased with duration of stay. Similarly, while some ethnic groups experienced increase in obesity with duration, others did not. For those who experienced increase in obesity with duration, the rise was higher during the first five years of residence than later and greater for those who arrived at a relatively young age.
3342135	1	a	Determinants of families' reactions to their relatives' relocation (from a large developmental disability institution that was closing to smaller institutions) were examined. Ninety-four families responded to two surveys sent during closure and one year later asking about (a) reactions to the closure, (b) relative's medical status, (c) involvement with their relative, (d) appraisal of the situation, and (e) social support. Over time, families reported less stress and dissatisfaction with closure. Family reactions during closure were related to the relative's medical status, involvement with their relative, and appraisal of the situation, whereas family reactions one year later were related to appraisal, involvement with their relative, and social support.
3662409	1	a	"The primary purpose for identifying psychosocial risk factors is to prevent disease and disease complications. For 30 years, we have been doing research in this field and have been successful in identifying such risk factors as Type A behavior, social isolation, stressful life events, and various psychological patterns. However, our success in using this information to help prevent disease has been much more limited. One reason for this limited success is that we have focused virtually all of our attention on the study of individuals and almost no attention on the social environment within which people live. There are two major limitations of such a one-to-one approach: it is difficult for people to change their behavior and their life situation and even if some people do change, others enter the ""at risk"" population because no action has been taken to change those forces in society that stimulated the problem in the first place. In discussing the social determinants of disease, it is important that we develop a new approach that permits us to study not only individuals but also the social environment. An example of this approach is provided by researchers who were successful in preventing infectious diseases. The work of these researchers focused not on clinical entities or on individuals but on the environment. This resulted in a disease classification system that included concepts such as air-borne, food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases. We have no such system for the study of non-infectious diseases. Considerable data already are available to help us to think about such a new classification system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
19351401	0	a	BACKGROUND: Cholera remains a serious public health problem in low-income countries despite efforts in the past to promote oral rehydration therapy as major treatment. In 2007, the majority of worldwide cases (94%) and deaths (99%) were reported from Africa. To improve cholera control efforts in addition to maintaining and improving existing water supply, sanitation and hygiene behaviour measures, the World Health Organization has recently started to consider the use of vaccines as an additional public health tool. To assess this new approach in endemic settings, a project was launched in Zanzibar to vaccinate 50,000 individuals living in communities at high risk of cholera with an oral two-dose vaccine (Dukoral). Immunisation programmes in low-income countries have suffered a reduced coverage or were even brought to a halt because of an ignorance of local realities. To ensure the success of vaccination campaigns, implementers have to consider community-held perceptions and behaviours regarding the infectious disease and the vaccine of interest. The main aim of this study is to provide advice to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Zanzibar regarding routine introduction of an oral cholera vaccine from a socioeconomic and behavioural perspective as part of a long-term development for a sustained cholera prevention strategy. METHODS AND DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative methods of health social science research will be applied on four stakeholder levels before and after the mass vaccination campaign. Rapid assessment individual interviews and focus groups will be used to describe cholera- and vaccine-related views of policy makers, health care professionals and community representatives. The cultural epidemiological approach will be employed on the individual household resident level in a repeated cross-sectional design to estimate determinants of anticipated and actual oral cholera vaccine acceptance. DISCUSSION: The study presented here is designed to inform about people's perceptions regarding cholera and about socioeconomic and behavioural factors determining anticipated and actual oral cholera vaccine acceptance in Zanzibar. Its pre- and post-intervention design using a mixed-methods approach on different stakeholder levels in communities at high risk of cholera outbreaks will ensure the collection of locally valid data relevant for public health action and planning.
7246836	1	a	This study examined the records of the North Carolina Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine which social, family, and child characteristics were most influential in the decision to place a child in foster care. These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care.
6849845	1	a	Between 1969 and 1980 1443 patients with vesicovaginal fistulas were operated on in Ahmadu Bello University Hospital in Northern Nigeria. They have been studied in relation to their obstetric, social and environmental background. The preventable nature of the lesion was explored particularly with respect to age, parity and obstructed labour, and to traditional practices including 'gishiri cutting', which alone accounts for 13% of all the fistulas. Vesicovaginal fistulas are still a major cause for concern in many developing countries; measures for prevention include universal education and improved status of women in society as well as improved and accessible medical services.
16257477	0	a	The aging of populations increases the importance of cognitive function as a public health issue. The Whitehall II study is investigating influences on aging processes within social context, with tests in five domains of cognitive function (short-term memory, inductive reasoning, vocabulary, phonemic and semantic fluency). The tests have now been completed three times over a 10-year period, by participants initially aged 40-60 years. In mid-life, socioeconomic differences in cognitive function were large, while APOE genotype had little influence. Higher occupational status was strongly related to lower metabolic syndrome prevalence. This social-biological gradient illustrates that potential confounding of psychosocial, behavioral and biological effects on cognitive decline is an important consideration in etiologic research. Additionally, it highlights the importance for population health of the 'causes of the causes' of cognitive aging. Epidemiology contributes to our understanding of risk and protective factors for cognitive decline by showing the links between the wider determinants of health and biological markers such as glucose intolerance and the metabolic syndrome.
6734859	1	a	Over ninety low-weight infants were born per thousand live births in South Carolina, based on 96,000 birth records from 1975 and 1979. Higher incidence of low birth weight for black infants cannot be explained away as a result of black/white differences in age or education of mothers, prenatal care, parity or length of birth intervals. Though all these factors are important predictors of birth weight, an increasing propensity to have low-weight babies persists among black mothers even after all these factors are controlled.
7397056	1	a	A Paracetamol elimination was measured, using serial saliva samples, in 114 London factory and office workers, 76 Whites and 38 Asian immigrants. 2. Use of social drugs such as alcohol, tobacco and the oral contraceptive varied considerably within the sample, being appreciably greater in White subjects. 3. Paracetamol clearance was 21% slower in Asians than in Whites and half-life 18% longer. The total range of clearance was 1.86--6.78 ml min-1 kg-1. 4. Clearance was slower in women than in men, increased with increasing alcohol intake and cigarett consumption, and was more rapid in those women using the oral contraceptive. The effects of alcohol and the oral contraceptive were also found in White subjects alone. 5 The variables found to correlate independently with paracetamol clearance accounted for only 27% of the total sample variance, however, and are unlikely to be the major determinants of paracetamol elimination in man.
7333334	1	a	This study was designed to obtain information potentially of value in understanding an modifying the impact of the social environment of the perceived quality of like among institutionalized aged persons. It was hypothesized that Person-Environment (P-E) congruence, as assessed by the Environmental Perception, Preference and Importance Scale (EPPIS), would be related to (1) sex integration/segregation makeup of the health related facility (HRF) living units, and (2) quantity of social interaction between staff and residents. Analysis of sex by unit sex-type interaction for 60 residents' Person-Environment (P-E) congruence scores revealed that elderly females on sex-integrated units reported a higher level of P-E congruence than those residing on female-only units; males on sex-integrated units, in contrast, reported a poorer level of P-E congruence than males on sex -segregated units. Furthermore, behavioral observations of staff-resident verbal interactions confirmed the hypothesis that residents living on units with high staff-resident interaction perceived the environments more congruent with their preferences than residents on units low in verbal interaction. The observed relationships between the P-E congruence measure, resident-staff interaction, and unit sex-type were taken as further support for the relevance and value of the EPPIS measure as a tool for assessing and improving the institutional milieu.
2521115	1	a	This research examined elderly people's social network ties and their awareness of services available to them. For this sample of 1,224 persons aged 60 years or older, having nonkin advisers, membership in clubs, or contacts with other community agencies and availability of transportation, education, and moderate-size kin networks predicted service awareness. Lack of available kin, the presence of large kin networks, having kin confidants, and being old, poor, and female, or black inhibited service awareness.
2768294	1	a	A life table analysis is made of the duration of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea in Orissa, India, taking one variable at a time using data from a baseline survey of fertility and mortality (BSFM) conducted on the lines of the World Fertility Survey. Then a multivariate (proportional hazard) analysis showed that socioeconomic factors including residence, caste status and education influence the breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea periods. There was no effect of maternal age on the length of breast-feeding, but mean length of post-partum amenorrhoea varied with age. The durations of breast-feeding and post-partum amenorrhoea are strongly related.
19938924	0	a	Alcohol intoxication is a risk factor for being a perpetrator or victim of sexual coercion. Environmental factors (e.g., misperception of social cues), as well as dispositional factors (e.g., personality, gender), are believed to play an important role in linking alcohol consumption and sexual coercion. Sixty-three participants, chosen on the basis of being high or low on scales of hypermasculinity (men) or hyperfemininity (women), were randomly assigned to either an alcohol or nonalcohol condition. After viewing a video of an ambiguous heterosexual interaction, participants responded to questions assessing their accuracy of recall of cues from the interaction, positive bias in their recall of cues, and expectancies regarding 1) the future sexual behavior of the characters in the video and 2) their own conduct if they were in a similar situation. Alcohol was negatively related to accuracy in recall and positively related to the belief that the characters in the video would engage in sexual intercourse (both volitionally and forced). Gender was also important as women were less accurate in recalling cues and intoxicated women evinced a positive bias for cue recall. Traits of hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity were not robust predictors. Hypermasculine men did, however, endorse a substantially higher likelihood that they would have sexual intercourse if in a similar situation. Findings are placed in the context of potential preventive interventions.
14746119	0	a	The purpose of this study was to examine individual determinants of use of publicly funded home-care nursing and housework assistance by Canadians 18 years and older from 1994 to 1999. Andersen and Newman's Behavioural Model of Health Services Use guided the selection of variables, analyses, and interpretation of the findings. Descriptive, correlation, and multiple logistic regression analyses were completed in each of the first 3 cross-sectional cycles of Statistics Canada's National Population Health Surveys. The determinants of use of housework assistance were older age, female, living alone, lower income, activity restriction, needing help with housework, not hospitalized in the previous year, and having at least 1 chronic condition. The determinants for home nursing tended to be the opposite of those for housework assistance. Between 1994 and 1999, use of housework assistance appeared to decrease and use of nursing services appeared to remain relatively stable. The findings underscore the need to target these 2 discrete subgroups of home-care users and ensure that funding is directed at support services as well as nursing services.
2927118	1	a	This article challenges the commonly held beliefs that there are few if any heavy drinkers among Asian-Americans and that different groups of Asians exhibit similar patterns of drinking. To explore these stereotypes, alcohol consumption patterns were compared in a survey of 298 Chinese, 295 Japanese and 280 Koreans in Los Angeles. Heavy drinking was found in each of the Asian groups. Gender specific logistic regression models were used to illustrate the differences in the drinking patterns of the Asian-American groups and to clarify the determinants of drinking. The greatest proportion of heavy drinking was found among the Japanese and the lowest among the Chinese. Having friends who drank was the only social factor consistently related to Asian drinking behavior.
19944934	0	a	BACKGROUND: Kalihi Valley is a densely populated, low-income community (28,958 residents in approximately 6 square miles) with insufficient sidewalks, bike lanes, and public green space to support regular physical activity for its residents. Kokua Kalihi Valley (KKV), a community health center formed in 1972, sought to improve Kalihi Valley's built environment based on its history of community- and partnership-based preventive health initiatives that have focused on the social determinants of health. INTERVENTION: Kokua Kalihi Valley used a flexible partnership model and a focus on direct community action to develop an unused 100-acre state park (the Kalihi Valley Nature Park) and establish a bicycle repair and recycling program that mobilized thousands of community volunteers, attracted widespread media coverage, and established a number of innovative programs for active living. Kokua Kalihi Valley and its partners also contributed to the successful passage of a city charter amendment to prioritize Honolulu as a bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly city. RESULTS: This initiative was successful in reclaiming a substantial amount of land for active living and in stimulating both public governmental support and widespread private community involvement in programs and activities. LESSONS LEARNED: Projects that engaged community members in activities with tangible accomplishment were shown to be most successful. CONCLUSIONS: This initiative showed that community health centers may be uniquely positioned to provide leadership and assume responsibility for cross-sectoral active-living health projects.
6544459	1	a	The purpose of the present investigation was to study dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status in the adult Danish population. The study group comprised 5151 persons (86.7% of the original sample) who were interviewed in order to determine living conditions. Questions on dental visits and self-assessment of dental health status were included. 61% of the adult Danish population in the age group 20-69 had regular dental visits. Dental visit habits varied according to urbanization, age, sex and social group. Among well off persons 85% had regular dental visits as opposed to only 40% in the disadvantaged social group. Well off persons and persons with regular dental visits more often claimed good dental health than persons in the disadvantaged social group and among the non-regular visitors. In the higher social group 13% reported to have removable dentures in contrast to 51% in the disadvantaged social group. To isolate determinants of dental visits a multiple dummy-regression analysis was performed. Nearly 50% of the variation in dental visit habits was explained by the variables: urbanization, sex, age, perceived dental health status, education, work in exhausting jobs, income, social background and perceived psychological problems. Efforts to bring a greater part of the adult population in Denmark in contact with the dental health service system should consider these findings.
3060449	1	a	Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement.
18633099	0	a	Addressing health disparities has been a national challenge for decades. The National Institutes of Health-sponsored Centers for Population Health and Health Disparities are the first federal initiative to support transdisciplinary multilevel research on the determinants of health disparities. Their novel research approach combines population, clinical, and basic science to elucidate the complex determinants of health disparities. The centers are partnering with community-based, public, and quasi-public organizations to disseminate scientific findings and guide clinical practice in communities. In turn, communities and public health agents are shaping the research. The relationships forged through these complex collaborations increase the likelihood that the centers' scientific findings will be relevant to communities and contribute to reductions in health disparities.
11803806	0	a	As a historical consequence of molecular biology, genomics provides a complete theory of information in the field of biology. Genomics through biotechnologies offers also for the first time in history the possibility to create a new living world. Genomics can be seen as a component of actual culture that is in close connection with the economic strategies with strong political implications especially for health care and environment. This article analyses the historical determinants of genomics culture and questions the sense of the interpretations given to life by genomists. It also underlines their responsibility in elaborating this new kind of knowledge.
18163221	0	a	OBJECTIVES: This study involved a naturalistic, prospective project assessing objective and subjective dimensions of quality of life (QoL) and the range of its putative determinants in first-episode schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventy-four patients, mean age 24.7 years, participated in the study. The patients were assessed 1 month following the first hospitalisation (Time 1), 12 months later (Time 2), and 4-6 years after Time 1 (Time 3). The Social Functioning Scale and World Health Organisation Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) were applied to evaluate objective and subjective QoL, respectively. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was used to examine psychopathological status, and the Global Assessment Scale was applied to evaluate social adjustment prior to hospitalisation. RESULTS: The objective and subjective QoL was relatively low at Time 1. Over time, the objective QoL improved in three domains, decreased in one domain, and remained stable in three domains. The subjective QoL did not change. The most important predictors of both dimensions of QoL were psychopathology and duration of untreated psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Because psychopathology seems to have the greatest impact on the QoL, there is a need to develop community psychosocial treatment to reduce these symptoms and to support patients in the early phase of the disease.
17471524	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To examine health disparities as a function of ethnicity using data from LUpus in MInorities, NAture versus nurture (LUMINA), a longitudinal study of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); to build an explanatory model of how ethnic disparities occur in this setting; and to suggest appropriate interventions. METHODS: LUMINA patients (meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE) ages >/=16 years of African American, Hispanic (from Texas), Hispanic (from Puerto Rico), or Caucasian ethnicity were studied. In addition to examining the basic features of the cohort, we examined, by univariable and multivariable analyses, the factors associated with disease activity, damage accrual, lupus nephritis, and mortality. An empiric model based on the data presented (and the literature reviewed) was derived to explain the disparities observed. RESULTS: There were substantial differences in the socioeconomic/demographic, clinical, and genetic features among patients from the different ethnic groups, with Texan Hispanic and African American patients exhibiting overall a lower socioeconomic status, different genetic associations, more serious disease at a younger age, and worse intermediate and final outcomes than the Caucasian and Puerto Rican Hispanic patients. A model of disease outcome as a function of the disparities observed was created. CONCLUSION: Ethnic disparities occur in SLE. Environmental, socioeconomic/demographic, psychosocial, genetic, and clinical factors play an important role as determinants of the ethnic differences observed. Measures aimed at eliminating these disparities are suggested while further research is conducted to elucidate the basis of these disparities and their changes at the societal level and to eliminate the gap between the rich and the poor.
15927800	0	a	We developed and validated a self-administered questionnaire (Subjective Quality of Life Analysis, S.QUA.L.A.) to measure subjective quality of life. S.QUA.L.A. is a multidimensional instrument. This scale includes 22 domains of life. It covers traditional areas (food, family relation etc)., and more abstract aspects of life (politic, justice, freedom, truth, beauty and art, love). For each domain, patients are asked to evaluate their degree of satisfaction. They have also to indicate how important this domain is for them. We questioned 92 patients with schizophrenia and 357 para-medical students. The research demonstrated reproducibility, high internal consistency reliability, and sensitivity to change. Principal components analysis with varimax rotation was performed. A five-factor solution was selected, showing a great contribution of different dimensions of the self. Determinants of quality of life were identified by using correlations with Lehman's Quality of Life Interview (QOLI), and with measures of psychopathology and social functioning. Satisfaction approach and QOLI showed the same construct. We confirmed the influence of symptoms of depression and anxiety on subjective quality of life assessment, and the poor impact of disease parameters.
3820141	1	a	Thirty one married men, under 65 yr of age, who were admitted to hospital with a suspected myocardial infarction, were interviewed on four occasions over six months. The patients' social and psychological responses during the course of his rehabilitation were elicited using a semistructured interview schedule. Determinants of outcome were assessed using multiple regression analysis. Return to work, exercise, leisure and sexual activity were all strongly influenced by somatic symptoms of chest pain, breathlessness, and tiredness. Lack of depression, not smoking, and support from the family doctor were important contributors to successful rehabilitation. Cardiac damage sustained at the time of admission did not appear to have any consistent influence on outcome. Half of the smokers had not resumed their habit at six months. Fewer men were working at six months than on admission. Somatic symptoms, anxiety and depression were considerable.
3819251	1	a	"Postpartum factors affecting the duration of lactation were identified for 250 women through a telephone survey. The survey examined the behaviors and attitudes of women who had chosen to nurse and who were still nursing at 2 weeks postpartum. Sixty percent of the mothers nursed their infants after delivery. However, by 10 weeks postpartum, only 34% of the babies were still breast fed. By self-report, the most significant factors associated with the maintenance of lactation at 10 weeks were related to perinatal hospital protocol, especially letting the infant suckle soon after birth. Other significant predictors of successful lactation outcome included early milk ""let down,"" little use of supplemental formula, the mother's expectation at parturition of an extended nursing period, her feeling well and being satisfied with her body weight, her previous successful experience with lactation, and her perception that she feeds her infant on demand. Few of the women who had stopped nursing after 2 weeks sought advice on breast feeding from anyone other than the pediatrician. Most coped with their nursing problems themselves. The data reinforce the importance of labor and delivery practices that support early maternal-infant contact. They also suggest the use of infant health indexes and weight and height percentile placement records rather than reliance solely on weight gain as the index of lactation adequacy. Further, they indicate the need for clinical intervention before 2 weeks postpartum."
6644542	1	a	Within- versus across-subjects procedures for predicting behavior from attitudes were contrasted. Each procedure requires a comparison among attitudes in order to generate a prediction; the comparison is either among the same attitudes held by different people (across subjects) or among different attitudes held by the same person (within subject). It was hypothesized that the within-subject model provides a more adequate explanation of behavior from attitudinal constructs and, hence, more accurate prediction of behavior from attitudes than does the across-subjects model. To test this view, a sample of 349 married couples was administered a questionnaire containing measures of three attitudinal components--affect, cognition, and conation--toward each of four contraceptive methods--oral contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, and condoms. Contraceptive behavior was assessed 1 year later. In support of the hypothesis, the within-subject predictions bore a significantly stronger relation to the behavioral criteria than did the across-subjects predictions. This effect was consistent for each of the three components of attitude, for the prediction of behavior and behavioral intention, for male and female respondents, and for a variety of contraceptive behaviors. In addition, both the within- and the across-subjects analyses demonstrated a clear rank ordering in the predictive validity of the three attitudinal components: Conation was a better predictor of behavior than was affect, which, in turn, was better than cognition.
3494378	1	a	"In a quasi-experiment all diabetic children in a defined area were exposed either to an intense clinical treatment or served as a constructed control. The cohort of 146 diabetics was observed prospectively for at least 15 years as to diabetic control, mainly glycosuria, and cross-sectionally examined for microangiopathy on four occasions. Data on family background, social situation, smoking, blood pressure, biochemical status, anthropometry, HLA factors and mortality were also gathered. Throughout the analysis duration was considered and treated as a concomitant variable. Two different strategies have been followed in the analysis, one trying to predict microangiopathy at a fixed and predetermined duration, the other to study determinants of the pattern of microangiopathy occurrence over time. Multiple logistic regression and Cox analysis have been used to fit these strategies. The prevalence of microaneurysms or more advanced stages of retinopathy at 10 years duration was 30 per cent and within 20 years 81 per cent. About 52 per cent had haemorrhages after 20 years. Mild and severe nephropathy after 20 years have been contracted by 50 and 15 per cent respectively. No clear sex differences were seen. Variables significantly explaining retinopathy within 10 years were post-pubertal duration, blood pressure, place of medical supervision and the HLA/DR4 marker. The mean glycosuria was high during puberty irrespective of age at onset. The overall pattern of retinopathy occurrence seemed to be influenced by place of medical supervision, age at onset, blood pressure, family history of ischaemic heart disease and glycemic control. For the progression of retinopathy the role of factors reflecting medical supervision and control of diabetes seemed even greater. Even after accounting for degree of diabetic control the experimental group had a more favourable outcome, suggesting additional quality of care components. Mild nephropathy was less predictable from the above risk factors while previous findings of the important role of elevated blood pressure for severe nephropathy was confirmed. We estimate that half of retinopathy cases were preventable by the ""experimental"" care and conclude the near-normalization of glycaemia under routine conditions favourably influences the development of diabetic retinopathy."
12038742	0	a	The authors describe the use of a stress process model by the East Side Village Health Worker Partnership (ESVHWP), a project of the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center, as a framework for understanding social determinants of health. Specifically, the authors describe the development by the ESVHWP Steering Committee of a context-specific stress process model for east side Detroit residents. The authors examine data from in-depth interviews to illuminate actions taken by community members to reduce stressors or minimize their impact on health. Finally, the authors describe the use of this context-specific stress process model and data gathered regarding actions to address community stressors to inform the development of interventions by the ESVHWP to reduce stressors or strengthen the conditioning factors that reduce the impact of stress on health. On the basis of these results, the authors discuss opportunities and challenges for partnership approaches to addressing social determinants of health in urban communities.
2641946	1	a	A follow-up study of 58 patients with spinal cord injury was conducted. As measure of function the Barthel index was used. There was correlation between functional capacity and ability of self-care as well as some social determinants. However, no association was found with employment rate or certain other determinants of independent living, such as going on a holiday. We conclude that the severity of the lesion is a fundamental factor in determining the outcome, but factors related to personal and psychosocial variables, not easily measured, also have great influence on the rehabilitation process.
16973642	0	a	BACKGROUND: A systematic approach to examining associations among obesity and socio-demographic determinants, psychological problems, and mental disorders in epidemiological samples is missing. METHODS: Within the representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey and its Mental Health Supplement (GHS-MHS), 4181 subjects (age 18-65 years) took part in a physical examination (including measurement of body weight and height) and a standardized psychological interview (M-CIDI). Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)), somatic diseases, socio-economic variables, health-related quality of life (SF-36), and mental disorders (DSM-IV) were assessed. Data were analysed by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence of obesity was 18.5%. There was a strong association between obesity and somatic conditions, as well as to low socio-economic status (SES). No psychosocial disadvantages (e.g. regarding social relationships, impairment due to mental health problems, depressed feelings) for the obese individuals were found. With the exception of a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in obese men (12.5 versus 8.5%, OR = 1.53, CI = 1.06-2.21, disappearing when controlled for number of somatic conditions), obese persons showed no elevated rates of mental disorders. DISCUSSION: Obesity is associated with a low SES and some somatic disadvantages but not with other social or emotional disadvantages that have been often assumed to be very prevalent in that group. From the population-based perspective, obesity per se seems not to be associated with a higher risk for suffering from mental disorders, whereas relations between specific aspects of obesity and specific types of psychopathology still need further study.
14974014	0	a	"BACKGROUND: Depression is the fourth most important disease in the estimation of the burden of disease Murray 1996 and is a common problem with prevalence rates estimated to be as high as 8% in young people. Depression in young people is associated with poor academic performance, social dysfunction, substance abuse, suicide attempts, and completed suicide (NHMRC 1997). This has precipitated the development of programmes aimed at preventing the onset of depression. This review evaluates evidence for the effectiveness of these prevention programmes. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether psychological and/or educational interventions (both universal and targeted) are effective in reducing risk of depressive disorder by reducing depressive symptoms immediately after intervention or by preventing the onset of depressive disorder in children and adolescents over the next one to three years. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (August 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 3 2002), EMBASE (1980 to January Week 2 2003), PsychInfo (1886 to January Week 2 2003) and ERIC (1985 to December 2002) were searched. In addition, conference abstracts, the reference lists of included studies, and other reviews were searched and experts in the field were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Each identified study was assessed for possible inclusion by two independent reviewers based on the methods sections. The determinants for inclusion were that the trial include a psychological and/or educational prevention programme for young people aged 5 to 19 years-old, who did not meet DSM or ICD criteria for depression and/or did not fall into the clinical range on standardised, validated, and reliable rating scales of depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed by two independent reviewers according to a list of pre-determined criteria, which were based on quality ratings devised by Moncrieff and colleagues (Moncrieff 2001). Outcome data was extracted and entered into Revman 4.2. Means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes and number of events for dichotomous outcomes were extracted where available. For trials where the required data were not reported or could not be calculated, further details were requested from first authors. If no further details were provided, the trial was included in the review and described, but not included in the meta-analysis. Results were presented for each type of intervention: targeted or universal interventions; and educational or psychological interventions and if data were provided, by gender. Where possible data were combined in meta-analyses to give a treatment effect across all trials. Sensitivity analysis were conducted on studies rated as ""adequate"" or ""high"" quality, that is with a score over 22, based on the scale by Moncrieff et al (Moncrieff 2001). The presence of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. MAIN RESULTS: Studies were divided into those that compared intervention with an active comparison or placebo (i.e. a control condition that resembles the intervention being investigated but which lacks the elements thought to be active in preventing depression) and those that used a ""wait-list"" or no intervention comparison group. Only two studies fell into the former category and neither showed effectiveness although one study was inadequately powered to show a difference and in the other the ""placebo"" contained active therapeutic elements, reducing the ability to demonstrate a difference from intervention. Psychological interventions were effective compared with non-intervention immediately after the programmes were delivered with a significant reduction in scores on depression rating scales for targeted (standardised mean difference (SMD) of -0.26 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -0.40 to -0.13 ) but not universal interventions (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.48, 0.06), with a significant effect maintained on pooling data (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.36, -0.15). While small effect sizes were reported, these were associated with a significant reduction in depressive episodes. The overall risk difference after intervention translates to ""numbers needed to treat"" (NNT) of 10. The most effective study is the targeted programme by Clarke (Clarke 2001) where the initial effect size of -0.46 is associated with an initial risk difference of -0.22 and NNT 5. There was no evidence of effectiveness for educational interventions. Reports of effectiveness for boys and girls were contradictory. The quality of many studies was poor, and only two studies made allocation concealment explicit. Sensitivity analysis of only high quality studies did not alter the results significantly. The only analysis in which there was significant statistical heterogeneity was the sub-group analysis by gender where there was variability in the response to different programmes for both girls and boys. For the most part funnel plots indicate findings are robust for short term effects with no publication bias evident. There are too few studies to comment on whether there is publication bias for studies reporting long-term (12-36 month) follow-up. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Although there is insufficient evidence to warrant the introduction of depression prevention programmes currently, results to date indicate that further study would be worthwhile. There is a need to compare interventions with a placebo or some sort of active comparison so that study participants do not know whether they are in the intervention group or not, to investigate the impact of booster sessions to see if effectiveness immediately after intervention can be prolonged, ideally for a year or longer, and to consider practical implementation of prevention programmes when choosing target populations. Until now most studies have focussed on psychological interventions. The potential effectiveness of educational interventions has not been fully investigated. Given the gender differences in prevalence, and the change in these that occurs in adolescence with a disproportionate increase in prevalence rates for girls, it is likely that girls and boys will respond differently to interventions. Although differences have been reported in studies in this review the findings are contradictory and a more definitive delineation of gender specific responses to interventions would be helpful."
3434387	1	a	"Previous studies reveal that career guidance is usually based on a mixture of meritocratic criteria (academic ability and achievement) and nonmeritocratic considerations (students' SES and their social labeling by counselors). The present study argues that school counselors in affluent neighborhoods emphasize the meritocratic criteria, while those in poorer neighborhoods tend to focus on the more nonmeritocratic. This hypothesis is examined in a random sample of 210 male, primary school graduates from the 10 state schools of an Israeli town, 125 of whom are from schools in affluent neighborhoods, and 85 from schools in poorer neighborhoods. A path analysis of determinants of guidance to specific high school tracks shows that students' ethnicity and labeling as problematic directly affect guidance by counselors only in the poor neighborhoods. The effect of students' ""problems"" is due to their being labeled as problematic with respect to psychological or physical attributes rather than to behavioral problems at school. The findings are subsequently interpreted as reflecting a patronizing attitude toward lower status students by counselors. Additional studies which may further elaborate the determinants of guidance in poor versus affluent neighborhoods are proposed."
10926127	0	a	The aim of this study was to evaluate possible changes in predisposing factors in sexual preventive behaviors that could result from the availability of an efficient new antiretroviral therapy. A total of 136 young adults were randomly assigned a vignette to read describing AIDS as a lethal or chronic disease. After reading the vignette, the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial determinants of intention to use a condom with a new sexual partner. The variables were measured according to Ajzen's (1985, 1988, 1991) theory of planned behavior and Triandis's (1977) theory of interpersonal behavior. The experimental manipulation was more successful when the disease was described as lethal (66 of the 68 subjects) rather than chronic (30 of the 68 subjects). For the 96 participants who correctly identified the expected outcome of the disease presented in the vignette, a significant difference in intention was found between the two experimental situations (p < .05). Regression of intention to use condoms on the psychosocial variables yielded an adjusted R2 of .62. Perceived behavioral control, social norms, personal normative belief and anticipated affective reaction were the significant variables explaining this intention. The results suggest that intention to use condoms with a new sexual partner is likely to be modified by the expected outcome of the disease, that is, whether lethal or chronic. Thus, it is suggested that interventions aimed at young adults take into account the impacts the new antiretroviral treatments are likely to have on preventive behaviors.
12949333	0	a	The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is comprehensive in scope and establishes the capacity, structure, and function for the MCHB to continually improve the health and well-being of pregnant women and children. The MCHB works in partnership with states and has broad authority to improve access to care and ensure the provision of quality preventive and primary care services. Specific provisions of legislation establish the framework for accomplishing this mission. With the increasing recognition of the social, economic, and environmental determinants of child health and the inequities that exist in access and quality of care for children, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) has set the following 3 goals for year 2003: 1) To eliminate disparities in health status outcomes through the removal of economic, social, and cultural barriers to receiving comprehensive, timely, and appropriate health care; 2) To ensure the highest quality of care through the development of practice guidance and data monitoring and evaluation tools; the use of evidence-based research; and the availability of a well-trained, culturally diverse workforce; and 3) To facilitate access to care through the development and improvement of the maternal and child health infrastructure and systems of care to enhance the provision of necessary, coordinated, quality health care. Priority MCHB strategies to accomplish these goals include improving and expanding 1) the cultural competence of providers (in particular to decrease sudden infant death syndrome [SIDS] among minorities), 2) emergency medical services for children, 3) health and safety in child care, 4) quality of primary pediatric care, and 5) the providing of every child with a medical home.
19121600	0	a	This article examines the role of environmental and individual factors in the social epidemiology of chikungunya disease on the island of Mayotte (South-western Indian Ocean). In an epidemic setting, an interdisciplinary study combining interviews, observations, and serological tests was conducted to: (1) estimate the frequency and social distribution of chikungunya disease and (2) identify its principal cognitive, behavioral, and environmental determinants within a stratified random sample of the Mayotte population (n=888). Semi-parametric tests and multiple correspondence analyses were used to describe the statistical relationships between the different classes of variables examined in this study and the presence of antibodies attributable to chikungunya. These analyses highlighted differences between two main types of populations: one more autochthonous, more urban and better educated population, which shared 'legitimate' representations of the disease-from a biomedical viewpoint; and the other more migrant, more suburban, and more deprived, which is characterized by folk theories of chikungunya virus infection. Moreover, a series of logistic regression models revealed that social disparities in the distribution of virus infection were primarily structured by the housing conditions and cognitive representations of the disease held by the participants. These results suggest that environmental and individual factors are equally crucial in epidemic settings, and that they could explain, to a considerable extent, the social differences observed in morbidity associated with recent emerging infectious diseases in tropical countries.
11673127	0	a	The objectives of this study were to to identify maternal characteristics associated with traditional food consumption and to examine food items associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury body burden in pregnant Inuit women from Northern Quebec. We interviewed women from three communities at mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 11 months postpartum. We measured PCBs, Hg, and selenium in maternal blood; Hg was also measured in maternal hair. The women reported eating significant amounts of fish, beluga muktuk/fat, seal meat, and seal fat. Although consumption of fish and seal was associated with lower socioeconomic status, consumption of beluga whale was uniform across strata. Fish and seal meat consumption was associated with increased Hg concentrations in hair. Traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden, which is more a function of lifetime consumption. This study corroborated previous findings relating marine mammal and fish consumption to increased Hg and selenium body burden. Despite widespread knowledge regarding the presence of these contaminants in traditional foods, a large proportion of Inuit women increased their consumption of these foods during pregnancy, primarily because of pregnancy-related changes in food preferences and the belief that these foods are beneficial during pregnancy.
6223881	1	a	Social and psychological determinants of the time taken to return to work were investigated in a sample of male manual workers referred to an accident clinic with mostly minor industrial injuries. Patients who showed a rapid recovery relative to the severity of their injuries were more often married, had greater job satisfaction, were less likely to be receiving an income supplement from their employers, and blamed themselves more for their accidents. The findings also indicated that a poor recovery rate could be expected when the accident was due to some environmental fault or failure, and the implications for studies of compensation are discussed.
15259048	0	a	We estimate the determinants of utilisation of physician and hospital services in Belgium using a one- and two-part panel count data model, and a one- and two-part pooled count data model. We conclude that the two-part panel count data model is most appropriate as it controls for unobserved heterogeneity and allows for a two-part decision-making process. The estimates of the determinants of utilisation of health care are then used to calculate indices of horizontal inequity. We find that inequity for general practitioner and hospital services is stable across time and in favour of low-income individuals, in the sense that, overall, they consume more than one would expect on the basis of their need, albeit the indices for hospital care are not significant. Horizontal equity applies to specialist care in all years, but from 1999 onwards, some evidence (although not statistically significant) of pro-rich inequity is found.
16679219	0	a	BACKGROUND AND AIM: To determine the influence of the family risk factors (parental weight, socioeconomic status and cultural level) on the distribution of overweight or obesity in prepubertal children and the dynamics of their weight gain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred forty-one children (183 boys) attending the second grade of primary school (age 7.4+/-0.5 years) were enrolled in a longitudinal study in Southern Italy. Overweight and obesity status were defined by a body mass index (BMI) above the percentile having respectively the value of 25 and 30 kg/m(2) at 18 years, according to national reference data; overweight extent was expressed as BMI standard deviation score (BMI-SDS). Information about BMI and socioeconomic conditions (occupation and educational level) of parents were collected. Distribution of overweight and obese schoolchildren and variations of BMI-SDS were evaluated over a 3-year period; relationships with family risk factors were also sought. The distribution of overweight/obese children at baseline was high (40%). Tracking rates of overweight and obesity were 73% and 80%, respectively. The higher the BMI-SDS at 7 years, the higher the BMI-SDS at 10 years (r 0.86, P=0.0001). The highest BMI value and the highest distribution of overweight/obese children were observed in subjects with the highest amount of family risk factors. Children exhibiting accelerated weight gain (delta BM I>1/year) showed higher male/female ratio, higher baseline BMI values, higher maternal BMI values, lower maternal educational level and a dramatic increase in the percentage of overweight/obese children than children with normal weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Children who are overweight/obese at 7 years tend to maintain this condition during prepubertal age. Paediatricians should be alerted when dealing with a child showing a BMI increase above than 1U/year during primary school. Targeted intervention should be directed at young children with overweight parents and low socio-cultural level.
16902386	0	a	BACKGROUND: With the widespread dissemination of the Internet throughout the world of health, it would be relevant to report on current knowledge about health information search on the Internet from the consumers' standpoint. METHODS: We conducted a bibliographical research over the past five years and distinguished between international and French studies. RESULTS: For a long time, the (mostly US) studies have been merely descriptive. The studies highlight that the factors associated with health searches on the Internet are similar to the factors underlying the digital divide. Consumer searches are deemed efficient although search skills are comparatively below standard. Attempts are underway to set up tools, circulate them widely, and ensure better quality information on the Internet. However, comprehension and literacy are still issues in some social groups. Regarding the impact on consumer health per se, a (positive) effect of the Internet seems to emerge but research should be continued. CONCLUSION: Many of the behaviors, uses or limits addressed in this paper pertain to any information search on the Internet but other problems or differences also occur in the specific area of health. Longitudinal investigations are needed, specifically to gain deeper insight into the impacts we have addressed, while rolling out a comprehensive approach to the temporal evolution of user practices and experiences. Specifically, the central issue is still to determine how (and for whom) the Internet alters information search behaviors and, in fine, to what extent this affects health behaviors and the recourse to healthcare.
19852186	0	a	Most sociological theories consider murder an outcome of the differential distribution of individual, neighborhood, or social characteristics. And while such studies explain variation in aggregate homicide rates, they do not explain the social order of murder, that is, who kills whom, when, where, and for what reason. This article argues that gang murder is best understood not by searching for its individual determinants but by examining the social networks of action and reaction that create it. In short, the social structure of gang murder is defined by the manner in which social networks are constructed and by people's placement in them. The author uses a network approach and incident-level homicide records to recreate and analyze the structure of gang murders in Chicago. Findings demonstrate that individual murders between gangs create an institutionalized network of group conflict, net of any individual's participation or motive. Within this network, murders spread through an epidemic-like process of social contagion as gangs evaluate the highly visible actions of others in their local networks and negotiate dominance considerations that arise during violent incidents.
6695831	1	a	The association between duration of breast-feeding and nutritional status was studied in a population-based sample of 802 children aged 12 to 35.9 months in Southern Brazil during 1982. The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis. These results are also consistent with a controlled trial on supplementary feeding in the Sudan.
12023313	0	a	Tuberous sclerosis is one of the few established medical causes of autism spectrum disorder and is a unique neurogenetic model for testing theories about the brain basis of the syndrome. We conducted a retrospective case study of the neuro-epileptic risk factors predisposing to autism spectrum disorder in individuals with tuberous sclerosis to test current neurobiological theories of autism spectrum disorder. We found that an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was associated with the presence of cortical tubers in the temporal but not other lobes of the brain. Indeed, the presence of tubers in the temporal lobes appeared to be a necessary but not sufficient risk factor for the development of an autism spectrum disorder. However, contrary to the predictions of some theories, the location of tubers in specific regions of the temporal lobe, such as the superior temporal gyrus or the right temporal lobe, did not determine which individuals with temporal lobe tubers developed an autism spectrum disorder. Instead, outcome was associated with various indices of epileptic activity including evidence of temporal lobe epileptiform discharges on EEG, the age to onset of seizures in the first 3 years of life and a history of infantile spasms. The results indicated that individuals with tuberous sclerosis are at very high risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder when temporal lobe tubers are present and associated with temporal lobe epileptiform discharges and early-onset, persistent spasm-like seizures. These risk markers constitute useful clinical indicators of prognosis, but further research is required to identify the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for their association with outcome. Most especially, it will be important to test whether, as the findings suggest, there is a critical early stage of brain maturation during which temporal lobe epilepsy perturbs the development of brain systems that underpin 'social intelligence' and possibly other cognitive skills, thereby inducing an autism spectrum disorder.
12265071	1	a	"""This study is an attempt to investigate the economic determinants of international immigration and remigration into and out of the Federal Republic of Germany. Moreover, employment policy measures with respect to foreign workers are described and their impact on the inflow and outflow of guest workers [is] analyzed."" The author notes that the ability of the government to influence migration flows through legislation is limited because of the free movement of labor within the Common Market countries. It is suggested that in-migration of foreign labor slows wage increases for the native worker, may retard rationalization, and increases the social costs of unemployment, particularly during periods of recession."
11580765	0	a	"PURPOSE: Part of our research intended to explain ""Quality of Life"" (QoL) differences between people with epilepsy. To this end, a series of already existing generic and disease-specific health status measures were used. In this study, they were considered as determinants of people's QoL, whereas QoL itself was conceived as a general ""value judgment"" about one's life. METHODS: From the records of four outpatient clinics, 210 persons with epilepsy were randomly selected. During their visit to the outpatient clinic, they completed a questionnaire assessing, among other things, health perceptions and social and psychological functioning. Additional information about their medical and psychosocial status was gathered from the patient files. Data were analysed by using a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: In decreasing order of importance, ""psychological distress,"" ""loneliness,"" ""adjustment and coping,"" and ""stigma perception"" appeared to contribute most significantly to the outcome QoL as judged by the patients themselves, regardless of their physical status. In the final model, none of the clinical variables (onset, seizure frequency, side effects of antiepileptic drugs) contributed significantly anymore to the patients' ""quality-of-life judgement."" Apparently the effect of other variables such as seizure frequency and health perceptions, medication and side effects, life fulfillment, self-esteem, and mastery is mediated by these variables. CONCLUSIONS: Because all of the variance in QoL of the patients was explained by the psychosocial variables included in this study, health professionals should be aware of the significance of the psychosocial functioning of the patients and the role it plays in the achievement of a good QoL. Both informal and professional support may be an adjunct to conventional treatment. In future research, this issue should be given high priority."
3987971	1	a	In a series of four experiments, social and experiential factors that influence the development of motor activity in rat pups were examined. Motor activity was monitored from postnatal Days 13 to 21 as photocell interruptions in figure-eight mazes and comparisons were made between pups maintained in a nest box containing a dam and siblings and allowed access to the maze for 23 hr/day, pups tested daily for 1 hr/day vs pups tested only on postnatal Days 15, 18, or 21, pups tested daily for either 5 min, 30 min, or 1 hr/day, and pups tested daily for 30 min/day either singly in a maze, paired with a littermate, or paired with an anesthetized pup of the same age. A monotonic increase in activity was seen for nest-box testing, minimal developmental change was seen for pups tested on only a single day or for pups tested with an anesthetized pup, whereas all other groups showed an inverted U-shaped profile of activity which was influenced by the duration of testing and/or the presence of a littermate. These data emphasize the relevance of environmental factors as determinants of preweaning behavior.
3685922	1	a	The study was based on 471 males, aged 19 to 20 years, who started their compulsory military service in three military bases in Southwest, Southeast and Northern Finland in February 1982. Of these subjects 48% smoked regularly and had smoked in the past three weeks. The correlation between the reported number of cigarettes smoked a day and serum thiocyanate was 0.60. Seventy-four per cent of the subjects whose best friend smoked, were current smokers compared with 24% of the others. Proportion of smokers was higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Among the 14 explanatory variables in the multivariate logistic analysis, family members' and friends' smoking, the place of residence, strenuousness of leisure-time physical activities, number of friends, rebelliousness, intelligence test score, and general pessimism were most strongly associated with the likelihood of being a current smoker. The model explained 87% of the smoking variance.
2699193	1	a	A developmental approach to the study of feeding is proposed that considers social complexity and its biological mediation as core determinants of later ingestive patterns. Evidence is presented for opioid-mediated influences of milk and its major constituents and for nonopioid-mediated channels for contact comfort. Consideration of these factors might help us better understand some of the determinants of human feeding disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa.
10755056	0	a	BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QOL) has gained importance as a global measure of social and clinical outcome in schizophrenia. AIMS: To identify the clinical correlates of QOL at the time of first presentation with schizophrenia. METHOD: Over two years, consecutive first-episode psychosis patients presenting to a catchment area psychiatric service underwent validated clinical assessments of premorbid adjustment, illness duration, symptoms and QOL. RESULTS: At presentation, subjects already had a diminished QOL. Although independent of gender and age at onset of psychosis, QOL was influenced by premorbid adjustment, duration of untreated psychosis and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the duration of untreated psychosis may have a beneficial effect on the subsequent QOL of patients presenting with schizophrenia. First-episode patients with a protracted duration of untreated psychosis or impaired premorbid adjustment may warrant specific treatment interventions to prevent the development of secondary handicaps.
3714667	1	a	Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in different socioeconomic and educational groups in Finland. The series constituted all patients with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver (primary only), gallbladder, and pancreas recorded in the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1975 (8,802 cases). Data on socioeconomic status and education were obtained from the records of the national census of December 31, 1970. Cancers of the colon and rectum were associated with high socioeconomic status and higher levels of education, cancers of the esophagus and stomach with lower classes. These associations are most likely to be mediated by dietary habits. No clear-cut association was found for other cancers.
2925863	1	a	Social support, family functioning, self-perceptions of appearance, school, behavior, athletics, and social competence, as well as daily hassles/microstressors, were investigated as determinants of general self-esteem in 41 children with congenital/acquired limb deficiencies. Classmate, parent, teacher, and friend social support all were significant predictors of self-esteem. Family conflict and organization were also significantly associated with self-esteem, as were microstressors. The overall model of significant predictor variables accounted for 66% of the variance in general self-esteem. General self-esteem also was significantly predictive of depressive symptomatology. The findings suggest a number of factors which are potentially modifiable and which might enhance general self-esteem in children with visible physical handicaps.
17761378	0	a	Obesity in the United States has been linked to individual income and education. Less is known about its geographic distribution. The goal of this study was to determine whether obesity rates in King County, Washington State, at the ZIP code scale were associated with area-based measures of socioeconomic status and wealth. Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed. At the ZIP code scale, crude obesity rates varied six-fold. In a model adjusting for covariates and spatial dependence, property values were the strongest predictor of the area-based smoothed obesity prevalence. Geocoding of health data provides new insights into the nature of social determinants of health. Disparities in obesity rates by ZIP code area were greater than disparities associated with individual income or race/ethnicity.
15230050	0	a	Atherosclerosis is a common disease in parrots. The disease is found in all common parrot species, but especially in African Grey parrots and Amazons. It is a disease of older birds that is seen in both males and females. The most common sign is sudden death, but clinical symptoms that can be found include dyspnea, lethargy and nervous signs, such as paresis and collapses. Because the clinical signs are seldomly seen, it is difficult to diagnose atherosclerosis and therefore it is mostly an unexpected finding at necropsy. Age and species are determinants of atherosclerosis in parrots. Suggested risk factors include an elevated plasma cholesterol level, diet composition, social stress and inactivity, but research is needed to confirm this.
16690175	0	a	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) even among children. The purpose of this study is to investigate for the first time the distribution and determinants of total serum homocysteine (tHcy) levels in healthy Greek children. METHODS: tHcy, folate, B12 were measured in 524 children (275 boys and 249 girls) aged 6-15 years old from different socioeconomic status in Northern Greece. RESULTS: The geometric mean tHcy level for boys and girls was 7.8 (3.4-24.2) and 7.5 (3.9-29.0) micromol/L, respectively. Eighty one (15.4%) children had homocysteine levels above the upper reference limits (>10 micromol/L). The geometric mean serum tHcy level was significantly (P<0.001) increasing with age; 6.4 (3.4-11.2) micromol/L was found in the age group of 6-9 yr (group1), 7.2(4.1-22.1) micromol/L in the one of 10-12 yr (group 2) and 8.5 (3.9-29.0) micromol/L in the one of 13-15 yr (group 3). Serum folate levels were found to be statistically significant (P<0.001) between age group 1 and age group 3 [11.8 (4.66-20.00) vs. 7.5 (0.99-20.00)ng/mL) and between age group 2 and 3 [10.0 (1.82-20.0) vs. 7.5 (0.99-20.00)ng/mL]. Vitamin B12 levels were significantly (P<0.001) different in the three age groups [1048 (117-2000), 805 (296-2000), 700 (214-2000)pg/mL] respectively. Age, BMI, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were positively correlated with tHcy, whereas serum folate and vitamin B12 were negatively correlated. No association was found between tHcy levels and parental education status. In multiple linear regression analysis only age (Beta: 0.248, 95%, CI: (0.159-0.361), P<0.05) and folate (Beta: 0.347, 95%, CI: [(-0.206)-(-0.118)], P<0.05) were found significantly and independently associated with tHcy. CONCLUSIONS: tHcy levels were increasing with age and boys were found to have slightly higher levels than girls. Age and folate levels were the most significantly and independently determinants associated with tHcy. Children with tHcy levels above the upper reference limits (>10 micromol/L) were found to be correlated with BMI, WC, SBP, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels. These children should be encouraged to include high folate food items in their diet and where necessary folate supplements should be recommended. In addition, more prospective studies are necessary in order to evaluate the relationship of tHcy and CVD risk factors in children of our region.
3701583	1	a	Seventy-eight students enrolled in summer-session college courses were randomly assigned to serve either as counselors or as clients for a 20-min, role-played peer counseling session. All of the subjects completed a battery of standardized personality measures. Each counselor interacted with two clients. Prior to the sessions, the counselor was led to believe that one of the clients was especially introverted and that the other client was especially extraverted. Dependent measures were based on clients' change scores on a mood adjective rating scale administered before and after the peer counseling sessions. Analyses showed that counselors who were more successful at biasing their clients in the direction of their expectancies (a) scored higher on measures of Dogmatism, Nurturance, and Social Recognition, (b) scored lower on Impulsivity, and (c) were more likely to be women. Clients who were more susceptible to counselor bias scored higher on the Self-Monitoring Scale, the Self-Monitoring Other-Directedness subscale, and Social Recognition. These results are discussed in light of previous research and their implications for research on interpersonal expectancy effects.
12707496	0	a	The evidence-based approach has become the mantra of health care and service delivery. But just what it means, whether it is feasible, how to build it and the outcome of its use are not well understood. The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of an evidence-based approach to the prevention of oral disease, to examine the assessment of clinical trial evidence, to examine emerging approaches to assessing population-wide interventions and oral health promotion, and to illustrate some principles and issues through examples from preventive dentistry. The evidence-based approach to prevention is presented using an evidence loop, which emphasizes that the evidence-base should begin with an understanding to the burden of oral disease and its determinants, rather than a consideration of the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions in clinical dental research. A systematic review of evidence from clinical dental research is compiled and assessed, after which the intervention is decided upon and implemented. The evidence loop is completed by the monitoring of outcomes and reassessment of the intervention process. Attention is also given to steps in assessing non-randomized population-wide interventions and evidence on oral health promotion based on expert opinion. The requirement for evidence creates a substantial challenge which can only be met by increased research activity, improved quality of information and the appropriate application of the outcomes of research to policy making for the prevention of oral disease.
2508814	1	a	OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that influence blood pressure in children. DESIGN: Cross sectional study of children aged 5.0-7.0 years who had blood pressure measurements and for whom parental questionnaires were completed. SETTING: School based survey. SUBJECTS: 3591 Children aged 5.0-7.5 years selected by stratified random sampling of primary schools in nine British towns (response rate 72%); 3591 were examined and their parental questionnaires were completed. Data were complete for birth rank in 3559, maternal age in 3542, maternal history of hypertension in 3524, and paternal history in 2633. RESULTS: Birth weight was inversely related to mean systolic blood pressure but only when standardised for current weight (weight standardised regression coefficient -1.83 mm Hg/kg (95% confidence interval -1.31 to -2.35). Mean diastolic pressure was similarly related to birth weight. Maternal age, birth rank, and a parental history of hypertension were all related to blood pressure. After standardisation for current weight a 10 year increase in maternal age was associated with a 1.0 mm Hg (0.4 to 1.6) rise in systolic pressure; first born children had systolic blood pressure on average 2.53 mm Hg (0.81 to 4.25) higher than those whose birth rank was greater than or equal to 4; and a maternal history of hypertension was associated with a systolic pressure on average 0.96 mm Hg (0.41 to 1.51) higher than in those with no such history. The effects described were largely independent of one another and of age and social class. The relation for birth rank was, however, closely related to that for family size. CONCLUSIONS: Influences acting in early life may be important determinants of blood pressure in the first decade. The relation between birth weight and blood pressure may reflect the rate of weight gain in infancy. The reasons for the relation with birth rank and maternal age are unknown; if confirmed they imply that delayed motherhood and smaller family size may be associated with higher blood pressure in offspring.

The main source of the data was a questionnaire filled by the children and their parents about the use of urine and blood glucose tests during the 8 weeks before the camp and a questionnaire filled in by the Aide aux Jeunes Diabetiques (AJD) doctors about the practical knowledge of the management of the disease. The children were divided into 2 groups according to the level of their practical knowledge, ""good"" (n = 153) and ""less good"" (n = 272). In the whole group, the mean number of urine tests per day was 2.8, 75% of the children performing 3 tests per day and 4.3% not doing any urine tests. The number of blood tests is more variable; from 0 to 28 per week, with a mean of 5.6. In the group having ""good"" practical knowledge, the blood glucose tests were done 6 times per week, in connection with the number of hypoglycemia at home (p less than 0.01), the number of daily insulin injections (p less than 0.01) and the number of insulin supplements (p less than 0.05); there was a partial substitution between blood and urine tests. In the group having ""less good"" practical knowledge, the number of blood tests was 4 per week; it was not statistically different, but it was performed in the absence of detectable reasons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
10741579	0	a	To identify the determinants of self-medication and antibiotics abuse by parents treating their children aged between 2 and 18 over the previous year, an investigation was conducted in Hefei City, China in April, 1995. A total of 1596 students from a kindergarten, a primary school and a high school were included in the study, and 1459 completed questionnaires were collected (the response rate: 91.4%). The results showed the rate of parental self-medication for their children in the sample was 59.4%. It increased with children's age; about 51% of children had received parental self-medication on six or more occasions during the 1-year period and 32.8% on four to five occasions; there were associations between parental self-prescribers and sources of medicine and severity of disease. The rate of antibiotics abuse was 35.7%. Logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant associations between self-medication and payment of the mother's medical fees by employers, severity of diseases as well as the mother's educational level.
22692441	0	a	University students may encounter personal, family, social, and financial stresses while trying to cope with their academic challenges. Such constraints could affect their eating behavior and health status which, in turn may have negative effects on their studies. In light of little information in Malaysia on this subject, this study was undertaken on a sample of 180 students pursuing different academic programs in a Malaysian university. The study objectives were to determine the students' eating behavior including body weight control and the extent of fear of being fat, their social self concept that reflects the five selves namely, the psychological self, the social self, the sexual self, the family self and the physical self. Eating behavior and social self concept were determined based on various methods previously validated in studies on young adults in Asia and Australia. This article focuses on gender comparisons for these determinants. The results showed that psychological and emotional factors have a significant bearing on the eating behavior of university students. Uninhibited eating behavior of both the males and females showed significant and negative correlations with feelings pertaining to personal worth, the physical self, and their relationships with peers and families. Gender differences were manifested for some determinants. The females showed more restrained eating behavior than the males; the females have a significantly higher score for family relationship, which appears to be a significant factor on male students' eating behavior. Future studies on a larger sample size may help to unravel the extent to which psychological factors influence eating behavior of students, and the underlying psychosocial basis for some of the gender differences reported in this study.
10962782	0	a	BACKGROUND: Lifestyle advice from general practitioners (GPs) has been shown to have a positive effect on population health. In practice, GPs provide lifestyle advice to a minority of their patients only, those who are high risk or already have symptoms. AIM: To look in depth at GPs' attitudes towards adopting a population approach to lifestyle advice and to use these results to identify ways of maximising the potential of GPs to affect population health. METHOD: Thirty-six GPs, purposively sampled by identifying characteristics likely to affect their health promotion activity, participated in a focus group study. Data from the focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analysed using standard methods. RESULTS: The main themes that emerged suggested that GPs do not take a population approach to lifestyle advice because they prefer a high risk approach and doubt their ability to be effective in a population approach. GPs believed that social, cultural, and environmental factors were the most important determinants of population health. Furthermore, they were concerned about the detrimental effects on the doctor-patient relationship of providing lifestyle advice to all patients. GPs believed that a multi-agency, centrally co-ordinated approach was the preferred way to improve population health and that their role should be limited to secondary prevention. CONCLUSION: Large amounts of resources would be necessary to convince GPs to adopt a population approach to lifestyle advice. Measures to tackle the social and environmental determinants of health may be a more effective and efficient means of improving the nation's health.
10990337	0	a	This cross-sectional study analyses determinants of condom-use behaviour among patients attending dedicated STD clinics in South Africa. A structured interviewer-administered survey was conducted among 1473 patients. Patients' beliefs and attitudes towards condom use in general, as well as their personal condom-use behaviour were measured. Their perceptions, regarding the social influence of their partners and friends on their condom use, and of their self-efficacy in using condoms, while infected with an STD were also measured. Condom use, as a dependent variable, was examined and patients were placed in a pre-contemplation stage if they had never used a condom, contemplation if they had seriously thought of using a condom, some action stage if they sometimes used a condom and regular action stage if they used a condom every time. The relationships between the stages of change, as dependent variables, and the independent variables were investigated for both those patients with steady partners and those with outside partners. This was performed by stepwise multiple regression analyses. The variables that significantly explained stages of change were similar for patients with steady partners and those with outside partners. In both partner groups communication was the variable most strongly associated with the use of condoms. General self-efficacy in condom use, self-efficacy in condom use with a partner and attitudes towards the use of condoms played a role in determining patients' different stages of change.
16539970	0	a	The main aim of screening is to identify people with an increased probability to benefit from preventive interventions, generally from secondary prevention but also from primary prevention activities. The goal is to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment in order to modify positively the prognosis (the former case), or to recognize people exposed to risk factors which increase the incidence rate of disease, and then to prevent the disease (the latter case). Good intentions are not enough to achieve good results in terms of effectiveness, safety, efficiency or equity. It is necessary to have a systematic assessment of the consequences of screening, particularly on the impact on peoples health and on the health services. Due to the diversity of types of screenings that are done, it is very difficult to estimate the net impact caused by their implementation. Moreover, the changes in the health of a population depend on many factors other than health service interventions. Thus, it is very important to determine the effectiveness and safety of the screening methods that are most frequently applied. Unfortunately, assessment of the benefits and the harm potentially caused by preventive interventions has not been done often. In Spain only a few partial assessments have been published, and they focus on the activities and the processes themselves rather than the final outcomes. Given that screening activities are carried out in health care services, and that the populations screened are mostly healthy people, the ethical issues have great importance when health policies are designed and implemented. Thus, it is recommended that screenings activities be analyzed applying the ethical principles of autonomy, benefit, safety and justice. If any screening program cannot reasonably satisfy these principles then they should be removed from the list of public health activities that are financed by public resources. In the same sense, all screening procedures offered to the population must be subjected to a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness, safety, efficiency and equity in terms of how the procedure would be applied. Lastly, to achieve an effective implementation of the principle of autonomy as well the desired goal of empowering the population to exercise some control over their determinants of health, it is recommended to explore new ways of achieving active citizen participation to establish preventive priorities and to assess the impact of screening interventions.
14999160	0	a	Women's mental health during pregnancy has important implications not only for the well-being of the mother, but also for the development, health, and well-being of her unborn child. A growing body of empirical evidence from population-based studies suggests that two indicators of women's mental health during pregnancy--psychosocial stress and social support--may exert a significant influence on fetal development and infant birth outcomes, such as birth weight and length of gestation, even after controlling for the effects of established sociodemographic, obstetric, and behavioral risk factors. This paper describes the role of three major biological systems involved in the physiology of pregnancy and stress physiology: neuroendocrine, immune/inflammatory, and cardiovascular systems. These systems have been hypothesized to mediate the effects of maternal mental health on fetal developmental and health outcomes, and a central role has been proposed for placental corticotropin-releasing hormone in this process. However, not all women reporting high prenatal stress and/or low social support proceed to develop adverse birth outcomes, raising the question of the determinants of susceptibility/vulnerability in the context of high stress and/or low social support. In this context, the role of race/ethnicity and genetic predisposition are discussed as two promising avenues of further investigation.
18788702	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between the knowledge, social support, self-efficacy, appropriate environment, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits of physical activity and levels of physical activity. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional survey with multi-stage sampling was performed in a sample of 642 midlife women aged 40-59 years from Kalasin Province between June and July 2006. Physical activity was measured by interviewing and classified as active and inactive according to the national guidelines. They were also interviewed for general characteristics, factors of interest, and problems and needs for promoting physical activity. RESULTS: Forty seven percent of active physical activity was found in the midlife women. The women with moderate level of physical activity knowledge were more likely to be active than those with a low level of the knowledge (aOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1, 2.6). The women who perceived high benefits of physical activity were more likely to be active than those with the moderate perceiving (aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3, 2.4). CONCLUSION: These findings provided two determinants of the physical activity in rural midlife Thai women for planning the physical activity program.
15582347	0	a	The purpose of this study was to describe changes in physical activity and determinants in youngsters treated for obesity. Self-reported physical activity and determinants were assessed at start, during and after an intervention in 24 obese patients (mean age 13.5+/-2.1 years). Participation in activities of moderate to high intensity increased during treatment, but 6-months after treatment this decreased again to pre-treatment levels. Participation in activities of low intensity and television watching decreased during treatment and increased following treatment. Very little change was found in perceived benefits, barriers or self-efficacy scores. Modelling of siblings decreased after treatment, whereas there was no evolution in modelling of parents. Social support by family members increased during treatment, but decreased following treatment. We can conclude that the intervention was successful in activating obese youngsters to move at the desirable exercise intensity and frequency; however, maintenance of the exercise habit after treatment was not successful.
17908738	0	a	OBJECTIVES: The differences between child self-reports and parent proxy reports of quality of life in a large population of children with cerebral palsy were studied. We examined whether child characteristics, severity of impairment, socioeconomic factors, and parental stress were associated with parent proxy reports being respectively higher or lower than child self-reports of quality of life. METHODS: This study was conducted in 2004-2005 and assessed child quality of life (using the Kidscreen questionnaire, 10 domains, each scored 0-100) through self-reports and parent proxy reports of 500 children aged 8 to 12 years who had cerebral palsy and were living in 7 countries in Europe. RESULTS: The mean child-reported scores of quality of life were significantly higher than the parent proxy reports in 8 domains, significantly lower for the finances domain, and similar for the emotions domain. The average frequency of disagreement (child-parent difference greater than half an SD of child scores) over all domains was 64%, with parents rating their child's quality of life lower than the children themselves in 29% to 57% of child-parent pairs. We found that high levels of stress in parenting negatively influenced parents' perception of their child's quality of life, whereas the main factor explaining parents' ratings of children's quality of life higher than the children themselves is self-reported severe child pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the factors associated with disagreement are different according to the direction of disagreement. In particular, parental well-being and child pain should be taken into account in the interpretation of parent proxy reports, especially when no child self-report of quality of life is available. In the latter cases, it may be advisable to obtain additional proxy reports (from caregivers, teachers, or clinicians) to obtain complementary information on the child's quality of life.
3874140	1	a	Criminal homicide has increased steadily during the past two decades to account today for more than 1 percent of deaths in the United States. After providing background information on the rates and patterns of homicide in the U.S., the author uses the literature to present a twofold discussion of factors affecting the incidence of homicide: those that act as a deterrence to crime, such as punishment, and environmental and biological factors that can interact in a complex way to produce violence and murder. Examples of these latter factors include firearms, drug and alcohol abuse, genetics, race, psychiatric disorders, metabolic states, the economy, geographic region, the media, and political instability.
19750381	0	a	This study analyzes the specific conditions involved in dengue transmission in various areas in Itaipu, a coastal neighborhood in the city of Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, with a focus on socio-environmental determinants and conditioning factors. Four areas were selected with similar dengue incidence rates but different urban planning and socioeconomic patterns. The socio-spatial characteristics of each area were obtained through interviews with key informants and systematic observation. Two distinct factors were identified that may potentially condition the risk of dengue transmission. The first related to the limited water supply and scarce financial resources in a lower-income population. The second was associated with a group having better socioeconomic status, which allowed them to store water in larger tanks. The implementation of a housing infrastructure generated by real estate speculation was a determining factor for the creation of socio-spatial segregation, resulting in different forms of receptiveness and vulnerability to dengue. In this sense, the incomplete and unequal installation of housing infrastructure is a determining factor for the differentiated generation of vector breeding sites and thus for dengue transmission.
18718651	0	a	BACKGROUND: It is currently discussed whether allergic sensitization may start in utero under the influence of the maternal immune system and environmental determinants. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between allergen-specific cord blood (CB) IgE levels, parental sensitization, CB cytokine production, and environmental influences. METHODS: As part of an ongoing multicenter birth cohort study, allergen-specific IgE antibodies against 20 common seasonal, perennial, and food allergens were measured in blood samples from 922 neonates, 922 mothers, and 835 fathers. Supernatants from stimulated CB cells were assessed for the production of IL-5, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TNF-alpha. RESULTS: Allergen-specific IgE antibodies were detectable in 23.9% of newborns. Contamination with maternal serum was excluded by several means of analyses, including the absence of IgA antibodies. Clear correlation between maternal and fetal IgE was found only for hen's egg, cow's milk, and soybean allergen. Fetal IgE correlated negatively with the level of IFN-gamma production, but not with IL-5 and IL-10. CONCLUSION: Allergen-specific IgE antibodies most probably of fetal origin are detectable in CB and correlate with a lowered CB IFN-gamma production.
17469399	0	a	Benchmarking of the performance of states, provinces, or districts in a decentralised health system is important for fostering of accountability, monitoring of progress, identification of determinants of success and failure, and creation of a culture of evidence. The Mexican Ministry of Health has, since 2001, used a benchmarking approach based on the World Health Organization (WHO) concept of effective coverage of an intervention, which is defined as the proportion of potential health gain that could be delivered by the health system to that which is actually delivered. Using data collection systems, including state representative examination surveys, vital registration, and hospital discharge registries, we have monitored the delivery of 14 interventions for 2005-06. Overall effective coverage ranges from 54.0% in Chiapas, a poor state, to 65.1% in the Federal District. Effective coverage for maternal and child health interventions is substantially higher than that for interventions that target other health problems. Effective coverage for the lowest wealth quintile is 52% compared with 61% for the highest quintile. Effective coverage is closely related to public-health spending per head across states; this relation is stronger for interventions that are not related to maternal and child health than those for maternal and child health. Considerable variation also exists in effective coverage at similar amounts of spending. We discuss the implications of these issues for the further development of the Mexican health-information system. Benchmarking of performance by measuring effective coverage encourages decision-makers to focus on quality service provision, not only service availability. The effective coverage calculation is an important device for health-system stewardship. In adopting this approach, other countries should select interventions to be measured on the basis of the criteria of affordability, effect on population health, effect on health inequalities, and capacity to measure the effects of the intervention. The national institutions undertaking this benchmarking must have the mandate, skills, resources, and independence to succeed.
17606277	0	a	OBJECTIVES: This paper presents further analysis of a study aimed at examining the determinants of good health and successful ageing in an area of deprivation. In this paper we report findings from the quantitative data related to two of the original eight research questions: (1) To what extent can health in old age be attributed to psychological/personality variables? and (2) What is the role of religious beliefs and 'spirituality' in healthy ageing? STUDY DESIGN: In-depth interview study in which standardized measures of personality and beliefs were administered, along with measures of beliefs devised for the study. METHODS: One hundred matched pairs of healthy and unhealthy 'agers' were interviewed face-to-face. Healthy ageing was assessed in terms of hospital morbidity and self-reported health. The sample comprised 106 males and 94 females (53 male matched pairs and 47 female matched pairs) ranging in age from 70 to 90 years of age with the majority (n=165) falling into the 71-80 age group and the remaining 35 in the 81-90 age group. All study participants were survivors of the Paisley/Renfrew (MIDSPAN) survey, a longitudinal study commenced in 1972 with continuous recording of morbidity and mortality since. Questionnaires assessing extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, health locus of control, sense of coherence, optimism, and religiosity were filled in by participants during the interviews. RESULTS: Compared to the unhealthy group, the healthy participants were less neurotic, more likely to endorse an internal locus of control belief and less likely to endorse a powerful others locus of control belief, and to report a greater sense of coherence. The unhealthy group scored higher on the religiosity/spirituality measure devised for this study. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are interesting in that, although they cannot address the issue of cause and effect, the very fact that the personality traits measured in this study were linked to health status in old age, further strengthens the argument that in general practice and hospital settings, an understanding of personality aids practitioners in dealing with patients. Finally, with the growing body of evidence that personality traits have a high degree of heritability, the routine gathering of information on personality traits would aid epidemiologists in their understanding of the determinants of healthy and successful ageing.
15840175	0	a	This is an account of the early days of research on social determinants as I experienced them. I describe my time as one of four Fellows in a new training program in Medical Sociology at Yale University and how I came to be the first Sociologist employed in the U.S. Public Health Service. I then became the first Executive Secretary of a new Study Section at NIH dealing with a small number of research grant proposals in the field of Epidemiology. My account deals with some of my experiences in this developing field, culminating with my appointment as the first Sociologist to become a Professor of Epidemiology in a School of Public Health.
11718448	0	a	The main objective of this cohort study was to analyze the influence of social factors on the interval from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis in the 217 patients with digestive tract cancer. From the clinical charts, the following information was extracted: date of the beginning of illness, dates of medical attendance, type and date of diagnostic tests, characteristics of the disease (symptoms, stage), and date of treatment. From personal interviews we gathered the data not present in the clinical chart: sociodemographic data, information about other underlying diseases, and variables related to lifestyle. The time periods considered were from onset of symptoms to initial consultation (S-C); from initial consultation to hospital admission (C-H); and from hospital admission to diagnosis (H-D). The information on hospital admission, diagnosis, and treatment was prospectively gathered, whereas data before hospitalization were assessed retrospectively. For statistical analysis, we used Kruskal-Wallis test and Cox regression. Pain was the only predictor associated with a shorter S-C period. Hemorrhage, number of symptoms, and hospital consultation significantly shortened the interval C-H. Both hemorrhage and pain, and an initial visit at private primary care were the independent predictors that decreased the period H-D. In conclusion, sociodemographic factors did not influence healthcare attendance.
2650741	1	a	Perinatal mortality in Belgium remains high compared with other countries of Western Europe, although a marked decrease was observed during the period from 1956 to 1984. Analysis of the death causes indicates that further progress is feasible. Social inequalities and geographic variation are persisting in spite of the long-established policy of social welfare and free access to health services. Most of the studies on perinatal mortality in Belgium are descriptive and based on data recorded in birth and infant death certificates. In the future, alternative sources of information should be used to analyze more precisely and to understand more clearly the interactions between the different determinants of perinatal mortality and to evaluate the impact of social and health services.
3168446	1	a	In order to disclose differences between users and non-users of oral contraceptives (OC), 620 women aged 15-54 were invited to participate in an in depth interview about sexual, contraceptive, and reproductive life events. Of the 585 women who participated, 459 were consecutive gynecological in- or outpatients, and 126 were selected from visitors in general practice. Data was analysed by multivariate test statistics. After correction for present age and social class, the duration of use of OC (DOC) among women 15-34 years of age correlated negatively to age at menarche and coital debut and positively to number of sexual partners, oral-genital sexual practice, and number of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Among women over 35, DOC was positively associated only to cigarette smoking. No correlation was found to coital frequency (whether earlier, present or during pregnancy or menstruation), number of births and abortions, or to social classification. In epidemiological research on benefits and risks of oral contraceptives, confounding influence of one or more variables is of crucial importance. The present findings point at sexual and life-style habits as potential confounders in the study of OC and associated diseases.
15808930	0	a	Psychosocial stress is a potent activator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. While the physiological mechanisms of HPA axis responses to stress as well as its short and long-term consequences have been extensively examined, less is known why someone elicits an acute neuroendocrine stress response, i.e. what are the psychological processes involved and how are they related to the acute neuroendocrine stress response. To examine this question, a questionnaire to assess anticipatory cognitive appraisal processes was developed and administered to 81 male healthy subjects in a standardized psychosocial stress situation (Trier social stress test). Cortisol stress responses were assessed with repeated measurement of salivary free cortisol. Hierarchical regression analyses show that anticipatory cognitive appraisal, in contrast to general personality factors and retrospective stress appraisal is an important determinant of the cortisol stress response, explaining up to 35% of the variance of the salivary cortisol response. The reported results emphasize the importance of psychological stress processing for the understanding of psychobiological stress responses. Since stress and its biological consequences have been shown to be associated with the onset and the maintenance of somatic illnesses and psychiatric disorders, psychological processes are prime targets for prevention and intervention.
12415928	0	a	OBJECTIVES: To identify the major psychosocial determinants of smoking in adolescents and the school influence on these determinants. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey in 8th grade (age 14.8 years, n = 459) of 14 schools. Logistic regression with smoking as the dependent, and psychosocial indicators as independent variables. Total climate score for each school computed as the sum of scores of five school-related indicators. Linear regression analysis on aggregate data (school level), controlling for gender, ethnicity, and social class. RESULTS: Five out of 15 tested psychosocial indicators were identified as independent protective factors. The prevalence of smoking decreased steeply with an increasing number of protective factors. In the regression analysis on the aggregate level the mean number of protective factors per school and the prevalence of smoking were significantly related to the school climate score (R2 = 0.650, p < 0.001, and R2 = 0.456, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Provided a causal interpretation of the cross-sectional statistical associations is correct, efforts to improve the general climate in schools appear as a promising strategy to enhance individual protective factors. Longitudinal evaluative studies are needed to prove the effectiveness of such a strategy.
15798074	0	a	With the growing problem of childhood obesity, recent research has begun to focus on family and social influences on children's eating patterns. Research has demonstrated that children's eating patterns are strongly influenced by characteristics of both the physical and social environment. With regard to the physical environment, children are more likely to eat foods that are available and easily accessible, and they tend to eat greater quantities when larger portions are provided. Additionally, characteristics of the social environment, including various socioeconomic and sociocultural factors such as parents' education, time constraints, and ethnicity influence the types of foods children eat. Mealtime structure is also an important factor related to children's eating patterns. Mealtime structure includes social and physical characteristics of mealtimes including whether families eat together, TV-viewing during meals, and the source of foods (e.g., restaurants, schools). Parents also play a direct role in children's eating patterns through their behaviors, attitudes, and feeding styles. Interventions aimed at improving children's nutrition need to address the variety of social and physical factors that influence children's eating patterns.
2740928	1	a	This study explored the roles of acculturation, urban-rural provenance and length of residence as determinants of the utilization pattern of first line health services by Moroccan, Turkish and Italian migrants in Belgium. Concurrently, utilization characteristics were recorded in Belgian reference patients. With increasing acculturation the demand for preventive care decreased, vague complaints became more prevalent, the delay before consulting for a curative problem shortened and the prognosis improved. There was no correlation between the occurrence of psychological problems and acculturation but, except for 15-44 year old female migrants, the rate of social problems was negatively associated with this study factor. Migrants with an urban background consulted earlier and presented more frequently vague complaints than migrants from rural provenance. We observed no significant influence of length of residence on utilization characteristics and only a marginal influence on morbidity pattern. Although acculturation seems to be a strong determinant of the migrant's utilization pattern of primary health care services, it does not consistently lead to a decrease of utilization differentials with the Belgian reference population. This may imply that there is a need for public health interventions targeted at ethnic minorities.
24616603	0	a	The development of expertise in sport is the result of successful interaction of biological, psychological, and sociological constraints. This review examines the training and environmental factors that influence the acquisition of sport expertise. Research examining the quality and quantity of training indicate that these two elements are crucial predictors of attainment. In addition, the possession of resources such as parental support and adequate coaching are essential. Social factors such as cultural influences and the relative age effect are also considered as determinants of sport expertise. Although it is evident that environmental factors are essential to the acquisition of high levels of sport development, further research is clearly required.
15503071	0	a	Personal resources represent important determinants of life-long development. Since the use of the resources is a decisive factor, the perception of resources and changes in them is presumably crucial for the developmental success. In the present study, we investigated whether the perception of resources (i. e., cognition, health, social network) differs between young and old individuals, whether the resource perception is related to well-being and whether these relations are identical among young and old adults. Young and old individuals did not differ with respect to subjective resource status and resource importance; however, the young experienced more gains and the old reported more losses. Resource status explained the highest proportion of variance in well-being in both age groups. Resource loss was of relevance to well-being only in the young, but not in the old group. Thus, the significance of resource loss seems to vary across the life span, which puts the notion of a universal role of resource loss into question. For future studies, domain-specific analyses and the investigation of protective mechanism are proposed.
12281170	1	a	"""The determinants of complete family size and offspring survival were assessed by means of family reconstitution data from 19th and 20th century rural [populations] of Northwest Spain. The reproductive performances of families were submitted to a stepwise regression analysis in which the number of children born alive and those surviving to reproductive age per family were taken as dependent variables, while 13 other variables were defined as independent. Infant mortality appears to explain most fertility variation; an earlier marital age and at first maternity leads to an increased family size. Survival seems to be the result of the apposite interaction of both fertility and mortality in early childhood."""
16481310	0	a	Research on the social determinants of health has demonstrated robust correlations between several social factors, health status, and life expectancy. Some of these factors could be modified through policy intervention. National-level public policies explicitly based on population health research are in various stages of development in many Western countries, but in spite of evident need, seemingly not at all in the United States. Because research shows such a strong association between education and good health, we offer evidence to show that at least two pressing problems in American society, namely the uneven distribution of educational attainment and health disparities linked to socioeconomic position, may be ameliorated through policy initiatives that link quality early childhood care, child development programs, and parental training in a seamless continuum with strengthened K-12 education.
14686137	0	a	Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient.
7246836	1	a	This study examined the records of the North Carolina Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine which social, family, and child characteristics were most influential in the decision to place a child in foster care. These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care.
12314548	1	a	"""Theories of trade and migration explain the distribution of individuals among regions based on private good productivities. The theory of local public goods (LPG's) uses collective good consumption economies to explain the size and composition of communities. This essay combines the two theories, to explore regional population heterogeneity and stability. Assuming that individuals must consume and produce in the same jurisdiction, the paper examines the nature of efficient allocations, the tensions between the private and public incentives, the nature of the equilibrium (if any) which migration among jurisdictions will generate, and how such equilibrium will depend on tax rules for sharing the costs of the LPG."""
7143281	1	a	Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae. Aspects of coping problems, primarily the disease-related, but also those of intra- and inter-personal nature are discussed.
6520656	1	a	Smoking during pregnancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including fetal and neonatal death. These consequences are tragic in many ways, but perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they are preventable if the smoker ceases to smoke during pregnancy. Although in some instances the so-called constitutional hypothesis is difficult to disprove, the available evidence seems more than convincing that it is smoking itself, and not the smoker's unique constitution, that is responsible. Cessation from smoking is clearly advisable at any time, but more so during pregnancy when every cigarette affects both the smoker and her unborn child.
20059894	0	a	In this phase of rapid demographic change and low birth rate , coupled with an increasing life expectancy , the challenge for the future consists of being able to age in good health . European policies should therefore be aimed at promoting healthiness in the elderly and, although some CEE countries have introduced various projects and schemes, the majority are of a national or local nature and do not take into account the European context. The healthPROelderly project, on the other hand , is aimed at collecting information in the countries who participate in the project to pinpoint the best schemes for promoting healthiness in the elderly. This study focuses on the models that have a sustainable approach as far as socio-economical, environmental and lifestyle aspects are concerned. The specific aim of the project is to identify the criteria that have the highest impact on health schemes for the elderly and to establish relative guidelines at local, national and European level.
12339589	1	a	"""This article surveys significant changes in fertility and nuptiality in Central and Western Europe since the middle of the 19th century. In this context the secular decline in birth rates is understood as a consequence of changes in the social structure as well as of diffusion of social norms."" It is noted that for the period after 1920, and especially after 1950, no ""determinants"" exist that can completely explain fluctuations in marriages and births. ""Hence, the central thesis of this article is the following: There is no stable pattern of family formation in a modern industrial society and the number of children is not directly linked to mortality conditions or economic constraints. Subsequently, the article develops several hypotheses concerning the significance of marriage and parenting in the late 20th century, and points out that ups and downs in marriages, divorces, and births may be seen in analogy to other fashion-like processes (such as consumer behavior or social behavior).""

14964928	0	a	"PURPOSE: This article discusses a research study that explored how rural people in Saskatchewan, Canada, respond to stressful events and adversity, without outside interventions. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 individuals who were living or had lived on a farm in Saskatchewan. The participants' definitions of resiliency, their experiences with resiliency or lack of resiliency, and what they identified as the barriers to and enhancers of resiliency in their lives were discussed. FINDINGS: Resiliency was defined as a process and interactive model that included ""bouncing back"" from adversity, coping, and acquiring skills, such as problem solving and learning. Resiliency was dynamic, temporal, and relational and was both proactive and reactive. There were both internal and external barriers to and enhancers of resiliency. Barriers to resiliency included fear, isolation, and depopulation, whereas enhancers included resources, support, and control. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional resiliency models are not sufficient for understanding resiliency. It is clear that social, political, and economic factors play an important role in the resiliency and health of people who live in rural areas. A conceptualization of resiliency must be embedded in a social context and include community factors. Recommendations for enhancing resiliency, such as sustaining rural life, supporting families, and providing services, are also discussed."
16981446	0	a	Agriculture is one of the most hazardous occupational sectors, with a high prevalence of occupational injuries and work-related health problems. Most of these problems are caused by the interplay of human behavior and ergonomic factors and are thus preventable. Interventions to prevent occupational injuries and diseases among agricultural workers should aim to change risk behaviors and conditions by addressing specific behavioral determinants. To identify these factors, social cognitive models can be use that explain and predict health-related behavior. This study reviews the literature on the application of social cognitive models for the prevention of occupational injuries and diseases among agricultural workers. Studies are reviewed that apply the Health Belief Model, Theory of ReasonedAction, Theory of Planned Behavior, Transtheoretical Model of Change, or their subcomponents, to predict or change preventive behavior. Only a limited number of studies were found describing interventions that make use of these models, and those that do are often poorly documented with regard to the effect sizes and the explanatory or predictive value. It is concluded that the application of social cognitive models could significantly contribute to the effectiveness of preventive interventions in agriculture.
18815713	0	a	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantify socioeconomic inequalities in low-back pain, neck-shoulder pain, and arm pain in the general working population in Oslo and to examine the impact of job characteristics on these inequalities. METHODS: All economically active 30-, 40-, and 45-year-old persons who attended the Oslo health study in 2000-2001 and answered questions on physical job demands, job autonomy, and musculoskeletal pain were included (N=7293). Occupational class was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The lower occupational classes were compared with higher grade professionals, and prevalences, prevalence ratios, prevalence differences, and population attributable fractions were calculated. RESULTS: There were marked, stepwise socioeconomic gradients for musculoskeletal pain, steeper for the men than for the women. The relative differences (prevalence ratios) were larger for low-back pain and arm pain than for neck-shoulder pain. The absolute differences (prevalence differences) were the largest for low-back pain. Physical job demands explained a substantial proportion of the absolute occupational class inequalities in low-back pain, while job autonomy was more important in explaining the inequalities in neck-shoulder pain and arm pain. The estimated population attributable fractions supported the impact of job characteristics at the working population level, especially for low-back pain. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, physical job demands and job autonomy explained a substantial proportion of occupational class inequalities in self-reported musculoskeletal pain in the working population in Oslo. This finding indicates that the workplace may be an important arena for preventive efforts to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in musculoskeletal pain.
19068150	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Amidst a hunger-obesity paradox, the purpose of the present study was to examine the grocery shopping behaviour and food stamp usage of low-income women with children to identify factors influencing their food choices on a limited budget. DESIGN: Focus groups, which included questions based on Social Cognitive Theory constructs, examined food choice in the context of personal, behavioural and environmental factors. A quantitative grocery shopping activity required participants to prioritize food purchases from a 177-item list on a budget of $US 50 for a one-week period, an amount chosen based on the average household food stamp allotment in 2005. SUBJECTS: Ninety-two low-income women, with at least one child aged 9-13 years in their household, residing in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 37 years, and 76% were overweight or obese (BMI> or =25.0 kg/m2). Key findings suggest that their food choices and grocery shopping behaviour were shaped by not only individual and family preferences, but also their economic and environmental situation. Transportation and store accessibility were major determinants of shopping frequency, and they used various strategies to make their food dollars stretch (e.g. shopping based on prices, in-store specials). Generally, meat was the most important food group for purchase and consumption, according to both the qualitative and quantitative data. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve food budgeting skills, increase nutrition knowledge, and develop meal preparation strategies involving less meat and more fruits and vegetables, could be valuable in helping low-income families nutritionally make the best use of their food dollars.
3992612	1	a	This article begins with a discussion of the motivation for fertility reduction and related population policies. Next, it identifies the two major approaches to evaluating these policies in the population ethics literature: the individualistic approach and the international approach. Each approach is then characterized according to the kinds of policies evaluated, the ethical principles that are most prominent, and the major conclusions drawn. Major empirical gaps in the population ethics literature are identified, and pertinent social science issues concerning the effectiveness of family planning programs, the socioeconomic determinants of fertility, and the interpersonal or community determinants of fertility are discussed. Finally, these issues are linked with the United Nations World Population Plan of Action to identify ethical questions that warrant detailed scrutiny.
17558245	0	a	PURPOSE: This study explored the influence of social support on a prognostic indicator among cardiac patients, exercise tolerance. The relationship of sociodemographic factors to social support was examined, as well as the role of social support as a potential mediator between sociodemographic factors and exercise tolerance. METHODS: Archival data were collected from a sample of 254 men referred to cardiac rehabilitation. An exercise tolerance test was completed upon entry into cardiac rehabilitation, after 14 weeks, and after 9 months. RESULTS: Sociodemographic factors and social support reported upon entry into the cardiac rehabilitation program were related to initial and post-cardiac rehabilitation exercise tolerance, after controlling for admitting diagnoses, medical history, smoking, and perceived severity of illness. Overall, 28% of the variance in exercise tolerance was explained at baseline, 19% at 14 weeks, and 20% at 9 months. Specifically, older individuals had poorer exercise tolerance, whereas those with more income had better exercise tolerance. Social support was positively related to exercise tolerance at all 3 times. Older men reported less social support than younger men did, and those with more income reported more social support. However, social support did not mediate the relationship between sociodemographic factors and exercise tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the potential use of broad social factors in examining the determinants of prognostic factors for heart patients.
12280179	1	a	"""Distinctive types of mobility are identified for the [U.S.] elderly, many of whom also move for traditional reasons. Using a longitudinal data set from adult residents in Rhode Island, univariate, chi square, and logit analyses indicate associations between sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly and their mobility behavior. Mobility for assistance reasons is associated with older age, unmarried status, higher previous mobility, and renter status. Mobility in preparation for aging (e.g., to an elderly complex) is more likely for unmarried, previously mobile residents. Out-of-state mobility to amenity destinations is not limited to the elderly, but younger, married, more affluent elderly were more likely to make such moves."""
15797980	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36.
18280480	0	a	AIM: The aim of this study is to explore whether the work organisation of diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs) differs significantly from nurses working in hospital and nursing home and if so, does this difference result in positive or negative consequences regarding work and health. BACKGROUND: In traditional health care settings, nurses exhibit a high level of environmental uncertainty and low decision-making authority, which has a negative effect on psychological reactions towards work. In professional nursing, specialisation, e.g. diabetic nursing, is a current trend in many countries. Therefore, insight into the determinants of the work situation of nursing specialists is becoming increasingly relevant. METHODS: Comparisons were made between 3 different samples: 1204 nurses employed by 15 hospitals, 1058 nurses employed by 14 nursing homes, and 350 diabetes nurses working in other health care settings throughout the Netherlands. Data concerning organisation, work aspects, and psychological reactions were measured via questionnaires. Variances between the groups were analysed with ANCOVA, besides hierarchical multiple regression analysis was applied. FINDINGS: Environmental uncertainty scored lower amongst diabetes nurses when compared to nurses working in the other two types of health care settings. Social support and role conflict scored low for diabetes nursing specialists who simultaneously perceived autonomy and role ambiguity highest. Diabetes nursing specialists also scored highest on intrinsic work motivation and job satisfaction and lowest for psychosomatic health. CONCLUSION: Except for social support and role ambiguity, diabetic nurses rate their [work] organisation, [work] aspects and psychological [work] reactions more positively than nurses employed in other health care settings.
7112177	1	a	Abortion rates in the United States have risen annually since the 1973 Supreme Court decision. The regions with the greatest rate increases are the Southern and Plains states; the lowest rate increases were in regions which had high abortion rates soon after abortion was legalized. While spatial contiguity appears to influence abortion rates, that is, states with high rates of abortion are clustered spatially, social and political influence are also evident. Ratification of the equal rights amendment, the seeking of abortion outside the state of residence, and the degree of urbanization within a state are variables which influenced U.S. abortion rates between 1973 and 1977.
7057020	1	a	This article is concerned with two factors affecting the health status of the people of Lesotho: (1) the nation's function as a reserve labor economy (that is, the primary source of income for about half the country's male labor force is employment in South Africa); and (2) the health care system (its size, composition, accessibility, and efficiency). Although such apparently diverse factors usually are analyzed independently, they might be combined to provide a more complete understanding of the determinants of health and disease. The paper reaches the conclusion that any substantive solutions to the problems of Lesotho will be found primarily in the wider southern Africa setting, and not within the context of small, dependent national states. At the same time, these small, dependent national states must make development decisions considering existing geopolitical realities. Foresightful decision making on these issues could both contribute immediately to the health of the people of Lesotho, and also increase in longer-term possibilities for a better life for all the people of southern Africa.
3989430	1	a	The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats.
3060449	1	a	Estimates of hospital-to-nursing home placement delays have always been varied, and given Medicare's new Prospective Payment System (PPS) based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), they are likely to have changed again. Theory and previous research suggest that four patient characteristics are the main causes of delays: Medicaid as the patient's nursing home payer source; need for heavy care due to major physical or mental problems; admission to the hospital from a nursing home; and lack of social support. A pilot study of all 1,016 elderly awaiting nursing home placement in two admission cohorts (pre- and post-PPS) from the three largest hospitals in the county surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina--where nursing home beds are in short supply--indicates that other factors are more important. While most placements were delayed, delays were short. Multiple regression results show that Medicaid patients' delays were only about a day longer than those of private-pay patients. Of the many heavy-care conditions studied, only three were associated with delay. Patients without social support and patients admitted from a nursing home, discharged to a hospital-affiliated facility, or placed after PPS had shorter delays. Long delays were found among patients who had applied for Medicaid coverage but had not yet been certified as financially eligible. Nonwhites and males were also delayed. These findings, if replicated in other areas with perceived nursing home bed shortages, appear to have important implications not only for the usefulness of nursing home case-mix reimbursement and subacute levels of nursing home care, but for nursing home bed-need estimates, too, as well as for Medicaid eligibility determination practices and civil rights law enforcement.
2797981	1	a	Height and weight data from the Mexican-American portion of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) are shown for children of ages 2 to 17 years and compared with data for non-Hispanic white children from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference curves. Differences in stature between the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the reference populations were minor prior to adolescence and could be entirely attributed to the greater poverty of Mexican-Americans. However, differences increased during adolescence (ie, median stature was less than the 25th percentile of the NCHS reference population at 17 years of age) and, in contrast with earlier ages, were independent of poverty. Similar growth patterns were observed in samples of upper-class subjects from Mexico and Guatemala. Nonetheless, the extent to which the short stature of Mexican-American adolescents is genetic is unclear because there is an apparent time trend toward greater stature in the Mexican-American population. In conclusion, the NCHS reference curves are appropriate growth standards for preadolescent Mexican-American children. Whether they are valid for Mexican-American adolescents remains unclear.
11851959	0	a	Despite growing public resistance to the practice of female genital cutting (FGC), documentation of its prevalence, social correlates or trends in practice are extremely limited, and most available data are based on self-reporting. In three antenatal and three family planning clinics in South-west Nigeria we studied the prevalence, social determinants, and validity of self-reporting for FGC among 1709 women. Women were interviewed on social and demographic history, and whether or not they had undergone FGC. Interviews were followed by clinical examination to affirm the occurrence and extent of circumcision. In total, 45.9% had undergone some form of cutting. Based on WHO classifications by type, 32.6% had Type I cuts, 11.5% Type II, and 1.9% Type III or IV. Self-reported FGC status was valid in 79% of women; 14% were unsure of their status, and 7% reported their status incorrectly. Women are more likely to be unsure of their status if they were not cut, or come from social groups with a lower prevalence of cutting. Ethnicity was the most significant social predictor of FGC, followed by age, religious affiliation and education. Prevalence of FGC was highest among the Bini and Urhobo, among those with the least education, and particularly high among adherents to Pentecostal churches; this was independent of related social factors. There is evidence of a steady and steep secular decline in the prevalence of FGC in this region over the past 25 years, with age-specific prevalence rates of 75.4% among women aged 45-49 years, 48.6% among 30-34-year olds, and 14.5% among girls aged 15-19. Despite wide disparities in FGC prevalence across ethnic, religious and educational groups, the secular decline is evident among all social subgroups.
11971047	0	a	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the quality of life in patients with cervical dystonia, although pain and depression are relatively common. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that an individual's ability to cope with the disease will modify the association of intrinsic, extrinsic, and disease related factors with quality of life. METHODS: Patients with cervical dystonia diagnosed by a movement disorder specialist were recruited from seven European countries. Data on quality of life (SF-36), measures of coping, and intrinsic, extrinsic, and disease related factors were collected by a self completed postal questionnaire. RESULTS: 289 patients (101 men and 188 women), mean age 55 years, completed the questionnaire. Both physical and mental quality of life scores were predicted by self esteem and self deprecation, educational level, employment status, social support, response to botulinum toxin, disease severity, social participation, stigma, acceptance of illness, anxiety, and depression. In multivariable analyses, the strongest predictors were anxiety and depression. Severe depression was associated with a 19.1 point decrement in the physical summary score (95% confidence interval, -31.7 to -6.6; p = 0.003); however, disease duration and severity remained predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Care for patients with cervical dystonia must not only focus on reducing the severity of the dystonia but also on the psychological wellbeing of the patient. Interventions aimed at treating depression or anxiety, especially of a cognitive nature, may have a large impact on improving quality of life.
7239734	1	a	Recent studies of job satisfaction, working conditions, and changes in the content of work indicate that problems of low productivity and dissatisfaction may be related to changes in the organization of work which have reduced the amount of autonomy and control which workers have over the labor process. At the same time, elements in the labor movement, which has traditionally focused almost exclusively on obtaining higher wages and greater benefits for union members, now seem to be directing their attention to issues of workplace democracy and worker control over the production process and company policies. The research reported here investigates the determinants of worker autonomy and of workers' desire for increased worker control over the workplace. This article describes what are viewed as the main hypotheses suggested by earlier research and reports the findings and new hypotheses derived from a preliminary analysis of data from the ISR National 1977 Quality of Employment Survey and pilot in-depth interviews with sixteen Baltimore workers.
7424897	1	a	The major epidemiologic characteristics of hepatitis A virus (NAV) infections in Greece were studied in a sample of 877 Air Force recruits, 19-25 years old coming from every geographic region of Greece. Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) were detected by solid phase radioimmunoassay in 83.8% of the recruits. Antibody frequency varied significantly in the various geographic regions of Greece and was inversely related to the size of the community. It was further shown that the prevalence of HAV infection was highly related to the recruit's social class and years of education as well as number of siblings and number of persons per room. These findings in accordance with previous reported data show that hepatitis A is hyperendemic and should be regarded as a childhood infection in Greece. Prevailing socioeconomic, hygienic living and housing conditions should be considered as the main epidemiologic determinants of HAV infections.
12880519	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Despite the vast scientific literature on the social determinants of health, there is still a debate on the extent to which this relationship remains in old age. The objective of this study was to examine the association between socioeconomic circumstances and health among older adults in a small town in Brazil. METHODS: The study was carried out in Bambui, a town of around 15 000 inhabitants that is located in the state of Minas Gerais, which is in southeastern Brazil. From 1 177 residents aged 65 years or older, 1 074 of them (91.2%) were interviewed and 997 (84.7%) were examined (physical measurements and blood tests). Those in the lowest third of the distribution of total household monthly income, with an income of less than US$ 240 per month, were compared with those who had an income above that level. RESULTS: Lower family income was independently associated with: (1) some lifestyle risk factors (less consumption of fresh fruits or vegetables and less frequent exercise during leisure time in the preceding 30 days), (2) several indicators of worse health status (General Health Questionnaire score, self-rated health, self-rated visual acuity, level of difficulty in walking 300 meters, inability to perform routine activities because of a health problem in the preceding 2 weeks, and seropositivity for Trypanosoma cruzi), (3) a higher number of nonprescribed medications used in the preceding 3 months, and (4) a higher number of hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months. Obesity was more frequent in the higher-income group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not confirm observations in some developed countries of a lack of association between socioeconomic status and health among the aged. Our results showed that a small difference in monthly family income was sufficiently sensitive to identify elderly persons in worse health, even within a community that appears to be uniformly poor.
16228697	0	a	The aim of this was to examine rates and determinants of depressive symptomatology in the immediate postpartum period among Hispanic women in the United States. A total of 3952 Hispanic women who had delivered infants (parturients) were interviewed in postpartum wards in Miami, New York City and San Francisco. Symptoms of depression were regressed onto a series of social, psychological, and socioeconomic variables. Results showed that 42.6% of participants were probable cases of depression (CES-D > or = 16). Depression was negatively associated with perceived level of social support (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53-0.67) and health insurance coverage (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.95), but not with the degree of acculturation or immigration status. It was found that depressive symptoms are common among Hispanic parturients. Pregnant Hispanic women should be carefully monitored for signs of depression and appropriate preventive measures are needed.

28564267	1	a	We have presented a formal model for the quantitative analysis of phylogenetic and specific effects on the distribution of trait values among species. Total trait values are divided into phylogenetic values, inherited from an ancestral species, and specific values, the result of independent evolution. This allows a quantitative assessment of the strength of the phylogenetic inertia, or burden, displayed by a character in a lineage, so that questions concerning the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints in evolution can be answered. The separation of phylogenetic from specific effects proposed here also allows phylogenetic factors to be explicitly included in cross-species comparative analyses of adaptation. This solves a long-standing problem in evolutionary comparative studies. Only species' specific values can provide information concerning the independent evolution of characters in a set of related species. Therefore, only correlations among specific values for traits may be used as evidence for adaptation in cross-species comparative analyses. The phylogenetic autocorrelation model was applied to a comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight among 44 primate species. In addition to sexual dimorphism in weight, mating system, habitat, diet, and size (weight itself) were included in the analysis. All of the traits, except diet, were substantially influenced by phylogenetic inertia. The comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight indicates that 50% of the variation among primate species is due to phylogeny. Size, or scaling, could account for a total of 36% of the variance, making it almost as important as phylogeny in determining the level of dimorphism displayed by a species. Habitat, mating system, and diet follow, accounting for minor amounts of variation. Thus, in attempting to explain why a particular modern primate species is very dimorphic compared to other primates, we would say first because its ancestor was more dimorphic than average, second because it is a relatively large species, and third because it is terrestrial, polygynous, and folivorous.
6706795	1	a	A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed. Smoking, use of drugs, sexual behavior, and drinking of alcoholic beverages at the age of 16 years was related to dropout from secondary school during the 2-year study period. The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed.
3701582	1	a	Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors.
7031748	1	a	Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expression. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppression of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotosexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiencies, or hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes.
19272301	0	a	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study is to identify predictors of current cigarette smoking in adolescents within the school, home, and broader social environment. METHOD: A two stage cluster sample design was used to select a representative sample of students from all middle and high schools in Cyprus in 2005-2006. Standardized Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) methodology was employed in administering the questionnaires and processing the results. Analyses were conducted using logistic regression with the outcome variable being current smoking. RESULTS: After adjusting for the effect of other predictors in the model, the strongest predictor of adolescent smoking was smoking peers. Having parents and grandparents that smoke, concerns about weight, access to pocket money, ease of buying cigarettes, owning an item with a cigarette logo on it, the belief that smokers are less attractive, and the false consensus effect all remain statistically significant predictors. CONCLUSION: In designing smoking prevention programs, factors pertaining to the school, social and familial circle of adolescents as well as misconceptions on the link between smoking and physical appearance need to be considered. Such programs can act as empowering tools to complement legal measures which need to be firmly enforced and constantly revised to be effective.
18484442	0	a	While imposing research has been conducted with respect to the biological determinants of painful menstruation, little is known about the psychosocial factors, including work-related stress that might influence menstrual pain. We conducted a study in which we aimed to determine besides the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea whether menstrual pain was associated with job control, co-worker social support, job security and dissatisfaction with the job. Data of 2772 working women aged 18-55 years, participants in the Hungarostudy 2002 nation-wide representative survey was analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between work stress factors and menstrual pain. Altogether 15.5% of women reported to experience menstrual pain that limits their daily activity. Low job control, low co-worker social support and low job security were found to be associated with a higher risk for menstrual pain even after controlling for the effect of age, educational attainment, parity status, smoking, body-mass index and treatment for gynecological problems. Job dissatisfaction was also related to dysmenorrhoea, albeit not significantly. The relationship between work-related psychosocial factors and painful menstruation deserves further investigation in order to determine the possible pathways of this association.
7202850	1	a	Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children.
19055806	0	a	BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the development, implementation and evaluation processes of physical activity promotion programmes among older adults. More integrative insights into interventions describing the planned systematic development, implementation and evaluation are needed. METHODS AND DESIGN: The purpose of this study is to give an integrative insight into the development of the Active plus programme applying the six-step Intervention Mapping protocol. The Active plus programme consisted of two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity promotion interventions, both comprising three tailored letters delivered over four months and aimed at raising awareness of insufficient physical activity, and stimulating physical activity initiation and maintenance among the over-fifties. The first intervention, the basic tailored intervention, provided tailored letters that intervened on the psychosocial determinants of physical activity. The second intervention, the intervention plus, provided the same tailored information but additionally provided tailored information about physical activity opportunities in the specific environment in which the older adults lived. This environment-based component also provided access to a forum and e-buddy system on a website. A plan for implementation and evaluation is also described. DISCUSSION: The planned development of the Active plus programme resulted in two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity interventions targeted at the over-fifties. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NTR 920.
12867350	0	a	Young adults are often in periods of transition, and lifestyle changes such as a decline in physical activity can occur during this period. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between demographic, biologic, lifestyle, social support index, environmental factors, and physical activity in young adults. The participants were 4,152 young adults from 18 to 30 years of age enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). A moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) score was calculated from responses to nine activities and up to four activities not previously listed. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between MVPA and independent variables separately for men and women. Non-Hispanic Blacks were more active than non-Hispanic White or Mexican American men, whereas, among women, non-Hispanic Whites were more active. Education, social support index, and trying to lose weight were positively associated with MVPA, whereas being married was inversely related in both men and women. Among women, those who were unemployed, in better health, had smaller families, had lower body mass indexes (BMIs), and were not from the South had higher MVPA. Men who were in school during the past 12 months were more active than those who were not in school. The results from this study suggest that demographic and social factors are important determinants of physical activity in young adults and should be considered when planning interventions.
2802928	1	a	Using a subsample from the Copenhagen schizophrenia high-risk project, we examined the contributions of schizophrenic genetic liability and perinatal complications to computed tomographic (CT) measurements of ventricular enlargement and cortical and cerebellar abnormalities. A factor analysis of six CT measurements yielded two significant factors. One factor reflected multisite neural deficits as evidenced by abnormality of the cerebellar vermis and widening of the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures and cortical sulci. The other factor reflected periventricular damage as evidenced by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Because all of the subjects had schizophrenic mothers, the major source of genetic variation is contributed by the diagnostic status of their fathers. In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, it was determined that the multisite neural deficits factor was significantly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia (as measured by schizophrenia spectrum illness in the subjects' fathers) but was unrelated to pregnancy or delivery complications or to weight at birth. Periventricular damage was highly and significantly correlated with the number of complications suffered at delivery, but only among subjects with an elevated genetic risk. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the two types of CT abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect partially independent processes based on different combinations of genetic and perinatal influences.
12312686	1	a	"""This study of the determinants of legal abortion examines the interconnections between human reproduction and social organization. The hypothesis is that in the context of liberalized abortion laws, the incidence of abortion is determined by the socio-economic circumstances of women.

The policy implications for welfare and birth control planning are considered, as well as the implications for feminist action."
3730706	1	a	The non-fatal deliberate taking of overdoses in Cork city during 1982 was investigated from records in the general hospitals. In one of the hospitals, those attending after an overdose were personally interviewed. For both sexes, the greatest incidence of overdoses was in the younger groups; for females, there was a seasonal variation. Those taking overdoses were grouped by electoral wards, and the social characteristics of these wards determined. The frequency varied greatly throughout the city; some wards, particularly in corporation northern estates and part of the city centre, showed a rate of up to three times the average; these areas were the most likely to show social deprivation.
11818587	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mental health among severe hearing-impaired adults in the Netherlands, separately by prelingual and postlingual age of onset. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-three face-to-face interviews were carried out by persons with practical skills in communication with hearing-impaired people. RESULTS: Of prelingually and postlingually deaf men, 27.1% and 27.7%, respectively, reported mental distress (scores on the General Health Questionnaire > or = 2), and among women these figures were 32.4% and 43.2%. These rates are higher than in the general population (men: 22.0%; women: 26.6%). Among the prelingual category, none of the demographic or hearing loss-related characteristics was associated with mental health status as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Of these variables, only additional impairment or serious illness was associated with the brief Symptom Checklist (SCL-8D). Among the postlingual category, female gender and equilibrium disturbance was associated with both the GHQ and SCL-8D, and additional impairment or serious illness with the SCL-8D. For both categories, the risk of mental distress also was higher in those with more communication problems, lower levels of self-esteem, and poorer acceptance of the hearing loss. Opportunities for identification in youth and social support were not associated with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health status differs between the hearing-impaired and the general population, but not as much as is sometimes suggested. Mental distress is greater in those in certain categories of the hearing-impaired.
17462680	0	a	This paper examines the complex interconnections between the development of health promotion and multidisciplinary public health, respectively. Health promotion takes a distinctive interdisciplinary and multiprofessional perspective on health. Historically, it has brought together practitioners from varied disciplinary backgrounds, education and training. It therefore brings real advantages to the public health enterprise, where the goal is to bridge organisations, professions and partners to collectively address key determinants of health in the most effective manner. This paper debates the contribution health promotion has made to the development of multidisciplinary public health over the past 30 years and explores the principles, values, professional bases and practices of both. It is argued that health promotion's contribution to the development of 'the new public health' was critical, while its status and role within multidisciplinary public health remain problematic and unresolved. The nature of these dilemmas is discussed, reflecting on missed opportunities and possible resolutions.
6542479	1	a	Reproductive and agonistic behaviors in Siamese fighting fish were investigated in eight experiments, and some consequences and determinants of these sequences were isolated. First, fights and the formation of dominance-subordinancy relations were studied. Second, it was determined that large body size as well as males' prior residency in a tank produced an agonistic advantage; the magnitude of this advantage was positively related to the duration of residency. Third, the prior-residency effect in Bettas was determined by males' familiarity with visual and/or tactile cues in their home tanks. Fourth, dominant males had greater access to living space and were more likely to display at a mirror, build nests, and approach females than were subordinates. Finally, it was discovered that chemical cues associated with presumedly inert plastic tank dividers influence Bettas' social behavior.
3723341	1	a	We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report.
3730318	1	a	This paper presents findings concerning variables expected to influence the motivation of persons caring for a dementing relative in the community to continue giving care and support. The variables examined in relation to 'preference for institutional care' were those previously examined in relation to supporters' psychological well-being (Gilhooly, 1984). The results indicate that factors within the relationship between supporter and the dependent dementing relative are important determinants of motivation to continue giving support. Other variables significantly associated with advocacy of institutional care included the age of the supporter, supporter's contacts with friends, satisfaction with help from relatives, another dependent relative, and whether or not the supporter was employed. Help from the services and supporters' well-being were not significantly correlated with ratings of preference for institutional care.
12281047	1	a	"""This article reports findings that have emerged from an effort made at statistically measuring the effects of immigration on the earnings of U.S.-born youth. The presence of immigrants arriving before 1965 has a positive impact on youth earnings. Recently arrived immigrants impact negatively, however. These results are consistent with recent findings that the skill level of immigrants arriving within the last two decades is lower relative to that of immigrants arriving earlier. The results also show that the negative effects diminish as the youth ages, reflecting skill acquisition and job mobility of the young worker into jobs less vulnerable to competition from immigrant workers."""
6737214	1	a	This study examined Weiss' conceptualization of social and emotional loneliness. Using data from an extensive survey of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Iowa, we measured social and emotional loneliness, students' affective and behavioral reactions to loneliness, students' social relationships, and their judgments of the degree to which their relationships supply the six social provisions described by Weiss. As expected, we found differences in the subjective experiences of social and emotional loneliness, although both forms of loneliness were also characterized by a common core of experiences. The results generally supported Weiss's ideas concerning the determinants of social and emotional loneliness. Predictions concerning the affective and behavioral consequences associated with each type of loneliness, however, were only partly supported, although the two forms of loneliness were associated with different affective reactions and coping behaviors. The implications of these findings for Weiss's typology of loneliness are discussed.
7190778	1	a	The critical determinants of extended diurnal death feigning were assessed in a refinement experiment in which visual and tactile cues during rearing and/or testing were systematically eliminated. Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing. It was concluded that visual novelty of the environment is the minimal condition for sustained death feigning by young chicks in the daylight hours.
2710760	1	a	The purpose of this study was to explore the associations between several social learning theory variables and self-reported vigorous exercise and to consider the implications for exercise promotion. A random sample of adults in San Diego, California, was surveyed by mail. The 2,053 respondents (response rate, 43.4%) overrepresented Caucasian, affluent, and well-educated groups. A model of 24 variables accounted for 0.27 of the variance in exercise, and results strongly supported social learning theory. The strongest correlates were self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in the ability to exercise in specific situations), perceived barriers to exercise, modeling, dietary habits, support from friends, and age. Smoking was inversely associated with exercise in men only. We encourage researchers to conduct intervention trials to test the hypotheses generated in this study.
10984986	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Self-perceived class results from directly questioning subjects about his or her social class. The aim of this investigation was to analyse self-perceived class in relation to other indicator variables of socioeconomic level. METHODS: Data from the 1994 Catalan Health Interview Survey, a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the non-institutionalised population of Catalonia was used. We conducted a discriminant analysis to compute the degree of right classification when different socioeconomic variables potentially related to self-perceived class were considered. All subjects who directly answered the questionnaire were included (N = 12,245). With the aim of obtaining the discriminant functions in a group of subjects and to validate it in another one, the subjects were divided into two random samples, containing approximately 75% and 25% of subjects (analysis sample, n = 9,248; and validation sample, n = 2,997). RESULTS: The final function for men and women included level of education, social class (based in occupation) and equivalent income. This function correctly classified 40.9% of the subjects in the analysis sample and 39.2% in the validation sample. Two other functions were selected for men and women separately. In men, the function included level of education, professional category, and family income (39.2% of classification in analysis sample and 37.2% in validation sample). In women, the function (level of education, working status, and equivalent income) correctly classified 40.3% of women in analysis sample whereas the percentage was 38.9% in validation sample. The percentages of right classification were higher for the highest and lowest classes. CONCLUSION: These results show the utility of a simple variable to self-position within the social scale. Self-perceived class is related to education, income, and working determinants.
17279845	0	a	Three studies support the proposal that need for closure (NFC) involves a desire for consensual validation that leads to cultural conformity. Individual differences in NFC interact with cultural group variables to determine East Asian versus Western differences in conflict style and procedural preferences (Study 1), information gathering in disputes (Study 2), and fairness judgment in reward allocations (Study 3). Results from experimental tests indicate that the relevance of NFC to cultural conformity reflects consensus motives rather than effort minimization (Study 2) or political conservatism (Study 3). Implications for research on conflict resolution and motivated cultural cognition are discussed.
6826670	1	a	Among the infant's initial risks, interactional failures have recently been identified as potential links of vicious circles leading from inconspicuous deviance to severe clinical syndromes. The knowledge of the origins of interactional failure has been insufficient. In this paper a basic explanatory model is presented and two major determinants of successful parent-infant interactions are analysed: the infant's integrative competence and the initial forms of parenting. Particular attention is paid to pre-term infants and the biological roots of parenting.
3359393	1	a	Parents who had been placed in an orphanage as children rated the behaviour of all their children who were between the ages of 6-18 years on a children's behaviour survey instrument. All families were intact and the parents had not requested professional help for marital problems. A significant number of relationships were found between parental background variables and higher reported levels of conflict with siblings and with parents, dependent-unassertive behaviour, and undemandingness in the children. Although sampling difficulties preclude generalization, the results suggest that repercussion of events in the lives of the first and second generation that are usually pathogenic may be seen in the third generation, even when the second generation may not be grossly adversely affected. These events most frequently related to individual differences in the third generation in the area of undercontrol of aggression directed toward parents and siblings.
17273563	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health-related quality of life of patients submitted to resection of the pulmonary parenchyma due to neoplasia. METHODS: The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey was used to evaluate patients in the preoperative period and on postoperative days 30, 90 and 180. We used the GEE statistical model, in which the dependent variable (quality of life) changes for each patient over the course of the evaluation. Independent variables were gender, age, educational level, type of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, forced vital capacity and 6-minute walk test. The level of significance adopted was 5%. RESULTS: The final study sample comprised 36 patients, 20 of whom were men. Of those 36 patients, 17 were submitted to lobectomy, 10 to pneumonectomy, 6 to segmentectomy, and 3 to bilobectomy. Chemotherapy was used in 15 patients, radiotherapy in 2, and a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in 2. Improved quality of life was seen in the following domains: social (on postoperative day 90); physical/functional (some patients presenting better forced vital capacity and 6-minute walk test performance); and physical (in patients undergoing smaller resections). Lowered quality of life was seen in the following domains: social (for female patients); physical/social (resulting from radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both); and physical/functional (by postoperative day 30). CONCLUSIONS: It is important that studies evaluating the various determinants of quality of life, as well as the impact that cancer treatment modalities have on such variables, be conducted. The knowledge provided by such studies can contribute to improving the quality of life of patients undergoing pulmonary resection due to neoplasia.
17826170	0	a	BACKGROUND: Depression is an important public-health problem, and one of the leading causes of disease burden worldwide. Depression is often comorbid with other chronic diseases and can worsen their associated health outcomes. Few studies have explored the effect of depression, alone or as a comorbidity, on overall health status. METHODS: The WHO World Health Survey (WHS) studied adults aged 18 years and older to obtain data for health, health-related outcomes, and their determinants. Prevalence of depression in respondents based on ICD-10 criteria was estimated. Prevalence values for four chronic physical diseases--angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes--were also estimated using algorithms derived via a Diagnostic Item Probability Study. Mean health scores were constructed using factor analysis and compared across different disease states and demographic variables. The relation of these disease states to mean health scores was determined through regression modelling. FINDINGS: Observations were available for 245 404 participants from 60 countries in all regions of the world. Overall, 1-year prevalence for ICD-10 depressive episode alone was 3.2% (95% CI 3.0-3.5); for angina 4.5% (4.3-4.8); for arthritis 4.1% (3.8-4.3); for asthma 3.3% (2.9-3.6); and for diabetes 2.0% (1.8-2.2). An average of between 9.3% and 23.0% of participants with one or more chronic physical disease had comorbid depression. This result was significantly higher than the likelihood of having depression in the absence of a chronic physical disease (p<0.0001). After adjustment for socioeconomic factors and health conditions, depression had the largest effect on worsening mean health scores compared with the other chronic conditions. Consistently across countries and different demographic characteristics, respondents with depression comorbid with one or more chronic diseases had the worst health scores of all the disease states. INTERPRETATION: Depression produces the greatest decrement in health compared with the chronic diseases angina, arthritis, asthma, and diabetes. The comorbid state of depression incrementally worsens health compared with depression alone, with any of the chronic diseases alone, and with any combination of chronic diseases without depression. These results indicate the urgency of addressing depression as a public-health priority to reduce disease burden and disability, and to improve the overall health of populations.
7214067	1	a	Social and audiometric characteristics of the hearing-impaired elderly without aids have been analysed and some understanding developed of the factors which lead people to seek rehabilitation. The two major single determinants of seeking help were found to be severity of impairment and onset of deafness before reaching retirement age. There were strong indications that negative attitudes of both the elderly themselves and their general practitioners towards deafness and ageing played a crucial part in perpetuating the neglect of the disorder.
6892318	1	a	This study examined the records of the North Carolina Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect to determine which social, family, and child characteristics were most influential in the decision to place a child in foster care. These records contained all theoretically relevant factors as well as demographic data. Analysis included the computation of odds ratios for foster care for each of 250 variables. A maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed to obtain the independent and cumulative contribution of each factor. Some expected variables such as parental stress factors (substance abuse) and types of abuse (burns and scalds) placed a child at a significant risk for placement in foster care (p less than 0.01). However, less obvious factors such as referral source (law enforcement agencies) or geographic area also placed children at risk. Overall, the model explained little of the variance of these decisions (R2 = 0.168) and poorly predicted placement (sensitivity 66.3 per cent, specificity 74.6 per cent). Using existing data, we were unable to adequately describe the decision process in selecting foster care.
6148471	1	a	A cohort of homosexual men at high risk of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was monitored to examine the relation between lifestyle, clinical conditions, T-lymphocyte subsets, and antibody to the AIDS-associated human retrovirus, human T-cell leukaemia virus III (HTLV-III). HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS.
6814269	1	a	"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful."
17029939	0	a	BACKGROUND: Although social disparities in survival for patients with cancer are documented in an increasing number of papers, knowledge on the underlying mechanisms concerning screening, diagnosis, treatment or follow-up, is relatively poor. Our study was aimed at investigating the social determinants of access to reference cancer care centres for surgery for colorectal cancer in France. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on population-based data from a specialised cancer registry (County of Calvados, France). The population consisted of 5156 patients with surgical treatment for colorectal cancer recorded between January 1st 1981 and December 31st 2000. RESULTS: The probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was 1.3-fold lower for people living in a deprived district (mean income < 15000 euros) and 3-fold lower for people living in a district where more than 7% of houses were devoid of bath and shower in comparison with districts where this rate was under 2%. After adjustment for distance from reference care centre, the probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was still over one third lower for people living in a district with more than 7% of houses devoid of bath and shower. Social disparities in management of patients with colorectal cancer have increased in the last decade. The reduction of access to reference care with distance was stronger in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a social and geographical determination of type of treatment centre for care management of colorectal cancer in France. Special attention needs to be paid to the high quality of care management in non-specialised care centres in order to avoid an increased social gradient in cancer mortality in France.
3070761	1	a	Medical compliance researchers have produced more than 4000 scientific papers in the past two decades, but their research into the determinants of non-compliance has been inconclusive. This paper argues that the popularity of compliance and the uncertainty over its determinants can be understood if compliance is analyzed as an ideology that assumes and justifies physician authority. I explore compliance as a problematic concept, looking at its assumptions and its influences on clinical practice. The concept of patient compliance has a social history linked to the struggle to create and maintain physician control over infant feeding technology earlier in this century. But while physicians were successful in that struggle, they have never exercised complete control over health care products. Compliance must be reconceptualized and its research reoriented if it is accurately to portray medication usage and related health behaviors outside the clinic.
11682918	0	a	Given the longevity achievable with current prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for persons with HIV infection, quality of life (QOL) has emerged as a significant medical outcome measure, and its enhancement as an important goal. This review highlights current knowledge about the relevance and complexity of physical, psychological, and social factors as determinants of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected persons. Existing data suggest physical manifestations, antiretroviral therapy, psychological well-being, social support systems, coping strategies, spiritual well-being, and psychiatric comorbidities are important predictors of QOL in this population. Health care professionals are encouraged to become familiar with the full spectrum of predictors of HRQOL, which may eventually contribute to the development of multiple entry points for interventions in promoting QOL in these patients. Identifying variables influencing QOL among diverse groups, particularly women, injection drug users, and adolescents, and designing effective interventions specific to the social and psychological well-being of HIV-infected individuals are areas for research.
14681279	0	a	BACKGROUND: Having regained its political autonomy in 1991, Estonia experienced major changes in political, economic, and social realities. We aimed to analyse mortality changes by education from 1989 to 2000 in order to assess the impact of recent changes in Estonia, as well as the delayed effects of pre-transitional developments. METHODS: Two census-based analyses were compared. Individual cause-specific death data for those aged 20+ for 1987-1990 (72 003 deaths) and 1999-2000 (35 477 deaths) came from the national mortality database. Population denominators came from the population censuses of 1989 and 2000. Mortality for all causes combined and for selected causes of death were analysed for high, mid, and low educational groups. The absolute differences in mortality were evaluated through life expectancy at age 25 and age-standardized mortality rates. To assess the relative differences between educational levels, mortality rate ratios with 95% CI were calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Educational differences in mortality increased tremendously from 1989 to 2000: over the 10-year period life expectancy improved considerably for graduates, and worsened for those with the lowest education. In 2000, male graduates aged 25 could expect to live 13.1 years longer than corresponding men with the lowest education; among women the difference was 8.6 years. Large differences were observed in all selected causes of death in 1989 and in 2000 and the trends were invariably much more favourable for the higher educated. Educational differences in total mortality increased in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Social disruption and increasing inequalities in wealth can be considered main recent determinants; however, causal processes, shaped decades before recent reforms, also contribute to this widening gap.
11236399	0	a	"The privatization, or individualization, of risk factor knowledge has been largely responsible for a rising tide of criticism of epidemiology. The current debate seems polarized into 2 sides, those who support and those who attack ""risk factor"" epidemiology. This commentary aims to reinvigorate some of Geoffrey Rose's central arguments and show that this debate may miss a key point: a risk factor is a probabilistic concept that applies to an aggregate of individuals, not to a specific individual. Risk factor knowledge compels those in public health to seek actions that shift population distributions of these factors and, to do so, to understand their social, economic, and political determinants. The author links Rose's qualitative distinction between the causes of cases and the causes of incidence to an examination of the conceptual and quantitative limits of ""individual risk"" estimation. The attempt to predict individuals' futures on the basis of risk factor profile is especially prominent now with breast cancer. The author suggests reasons why a policy promoting private decision making about risk, while likely ineffective from a population standpoint, is viewed as the only feasible primary prevention option against this disease."
2649990	1	a	A social epidemiological approach has been used to study social factors associated with chronic disease, as well as to promote community-oriented intervention programs to modify risk for cardiovascular disease. The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk.
2529668	1	a	"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers."
18181819	0	a	This paper is based on a critical discourse content analysis of 40 stories from the 20 highest circulating English-language mass magazines available in Canada and published in Canada or the USA in 2001. It examines the presence or absence of the social determinants perspective in the portrayal of the two most significant causes of morbidity and mortality in these countries: cancer and heart disease. The media analysis documents an absence of reflection of the social determinants viewpoint on these, the most important causes of disease and death. Thus, magazine stories ignore the role of such considerations as income, education level, ethnicity, visible minority or, Aboriginal status, early life experiences, employment and working conditions, food accessibility and quality, housing, social services, social exclusion, or unemployment and employment security in explaining health. Instead, the magazine articles underscore an individualistic approach to disease that assumes that health care is accessible and available to all, and that these diseases are preventable and treatable through individual lifestyle choices in combination with the measures prescribed through conventional medicine. Although cancer and heart disease are framed by a medical discourse, articles tended to emphasise the independence, freedom and power of the individual within the medical care system. The research documents a continuation of the dominance of conventional medicine buttressed by individualism in media stories. Theoretical and methodological issues are discussed. Some of the practical consequences for policy-makers and professionals are noted.
19577695	0	a	The world's almost 400 million Indigenous people have low standards of health. This poor health is associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, poor hygiene, environmental contamination, and prevalent infections. Inadequate clinical care and health promotion, and poor disease prevention services aggravate this situation. Some Indigenous groups, as they move from traditional to transitional and modern lifestyles, are rapidly acquiring lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, and physical, social, and mental disorders linked to misuse of alcohol and of other drugs. Correction of these inequities needs increased awareness, political commitment, and recognition rather than governmental denial and neglect of these serious and complex problems. Indigenous people should be encouraged, trained, and enabled to become increasingly involved in overcoming these challenges.
18325417	0	a	PROBLEM: Preventive interventions to reduce occupational injuries and health problems in farmers require the identification of factors that contribute to unsafe and health damaging behavior. This paper describes the development and validation of a self-report questionnaire, which measures the determinants of occupational health-related behaviors in farmers. METHOD: A representative sample of 283 Flemish farmers completed a provisional 135 item questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, measuring four behaviors related to occupational health (machinery use, animal handling, preventing falls, and pesticide use), as well as the intentions, attitudes, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy for each of these behaviors. RESULTS: The fit indices of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis turned out not to be sufficient to reproduce the dimensions of the TPB. Therefore exploratory factor analysis was use to determine the underlying dimensions. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) on the behavioral items yielded single component solutions explaining a considerable proportion of the variance for each behavior and for behavioral intentions. Principal component analyses toward an a priori three-component structure reflecting the TPB dimensions did not produce sufficient congruence for the determinants of the four behaviors. Subsequent Varimax rotations and discarding of redundant items resulted in three component solutions explaining 50% to 69% of the variance in the determinants of each behavior, corresponding with the dimensions of the TPB. Internal consistencies ranged from .25 to .89. Scale scores accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in intention and self-reported behavior. IMPACT: The study demonstrates the validity of the TPB in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Both authors share the same view on this study's impact on industry. In recent years, efforts have been made to create awareness among farmers about occupational hazards, and to encourage farmers to perform safer and healthier behavior. However, only a limited number of these interventions have proven to be successful. A possible reason for this relative lack of success is that interventions typically focus on risk analysis and raising awareness, whereas the literature on preventive health behavior change indicates that knowledge and awareness with regard to possible health risks are neither necessary nor sufficient to change behavior. To raise the effectiveness of prevention programs, other relevant determinants of behavior need to be addressed as well, such as: attitudes, perceived social norms, self efficacy, and elements of the physical environment that elicit or reinforce behavior. These determinants play a key role in psychological models of health related behavior, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior. Thus far, the use of these models within agricultural settings is fairly limited. This study demonstrates the validity of the Theory of Planned Behavior in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model.
12315884	1	a	"The extent of variability in the social, economic, and demographic characteristics of infant deaths when grouped by detailed cause is analyzed using health statistics data for Florida for the period 1980-1982. ""The analysis first compares cause-of-death-specific infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality between each of the four cause-of-death models. Next, interest shifts to an examination of the variability among decedents, specific to cause of death, in a range of background, proximate, and immediate determinants of infant health and survival. Variability is evident in cause-specific mortality rates as well as in decedent characteristics across the cause-of-death models. These findings suggest that more attention be given to the mode of identifying cause of death in studies of infant mortality."" (SUMMARY IN FRE)"
3103834	1	a	"A pilot study was conducted in which 44 general practitioners completed cognitive behavioural self monitoring diaries. Hourly changes in emotional state were recorded together with associated circumstances. Lowering of mood was associated mainly with ""hassle"" at work, pressure of time, and domestic dissatisfaction. Improvement in mood was associated with domestic happiness and satisfaction at working efficiently and to time. Mood was significantly lower when the doctor was on call. Women doctors were more prone to mood changes associated with domestic matters. Responses to a questionnaire suggested that the doctors preferred traditional clinical medicine to problems of a social or psychological origin. Managerial skills would help alleviate several of the problems identified in this study and should be more prominent in the training that all doctors receive."
15598757	0	a	Our understanding of longitudinal patterns of adolescent smoking development and the determinants of these patterns is limited. The present study evaluated adolescent smoking trajectories and characterized these trajectories with social, psychological, and behavioral factors in a cohort of adolescents assessed annually from grades 9 to 12. Complete data (smoking practices, novelty seeking, academic performance, substance use, peer smoking, physical activity and sports participation, and tobacco ad receptivity) were available on 968 participants; data were analyzed using latent class growth modeling. Four adolescent smoking trajectories emerged: never smokers, experimenters, earlier/faster smoking adopters, and later/slower smoking adopters. Early adopters were characterized by their high novelty seeking personality, depressive symptoms, poorer academic performance, and receptivity to tobacco advertising, as well as their exposure to other smokers, and use of other substances. Later adopters were characterized quite similarly to the early adopters, although they tended to perform better in school and to be more involved in sports. Experimenters also shared many of these same risk characteristics but to a lesser degree. Overall, never smokers were the most conventional in their profile. These data suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in the timing, rate, and intensity of smoking progression. Adolescent smoking prevention and intervention programs will need to consider this heterogeneity and tailor or enhance attention to risk and protective factors depending on the subpopulation.
7264477	1	a	"This article discusses the nature and significance of the holistic health movement in four ways. First, a general characterization of the movement is proposed, based on shared commitment to five assumptions: (1) a positive view of health as well-being, (2) individual responsibility for health, (3) the importance of health education, (4) control of social and environmental determinants of health, and (5) low technology of ""natural"" therapeutic techniques. Second, a basic difference among advocates of holistic health/medicine is proposed in terms of the presence or absence of commitment to scientific method. Third, holistic health/medicine is briefly compared with concepts of holism in biology and in the social sciences. Finally, criticisms of each of the basic tenets of the holistic health movement are offered."
16442195	0	a	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of cognitive functioning, psychopathology, and severity of extrapyramidal side effects on community outcome in a group of Greek outpatients with schizophrenia. Participants were 40 outpatients with schizophrenia (25 men). Social adjustment was assessed with the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Severity of symptoms of schizophrenia was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS). Finally, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered in order to assess the following cognitive domains: executive functioning/set shifting, executive functioning/inhibition, fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, attention, visuospatial ability, and psychomotor speed/visual scanning. Total scores on the QLS were significantly correlated with negative symptoms, parkinsonism, and performance on the fluency tasks. Interpersonal relations subscale was significantly related with negative symptoms and fluency. No significant relationship was found between the Instrumental Role Functioning subscale and the PANSS, ESRS, or any cognitive domain. Scores on the Intrapsychic Foundation subscale were significantly correlated with negative symptoms and fluency. Finally, scores on the Common Objects and Activities subscale were significantly related with severity of negative symptoms, parkinsonism and visual memory. Our findings suggest that severity of negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, especially performance on fluency tasks and visual memory, as well as parkinsonism, are important determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia.
10719008	0	a	The social, medical and economic effects of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on individual patients and the resource implications of this disease for the healthcare sector are considerable. Optimizing the selection of patients who should receive antibiotics according to stringent clinical criteria is the first step in promoting good clinical practice and cost-effectiveness. Antibiotic efficacy is then the major driver of cost, especially when it reduces the need for hospitalization. Resistance to first-line antibiotics can be expected to increase the risk of treatment failure. Other drivers of cost include non-compliance, which predisposes to therapeutic failure, and the selection of resistant strains. Treatment regimens of short duration, once-daily dosing and good tolerability are determinants of good compliance and cost savings. The expenses of first-line antibiotics typically account for only a small proportion of the overall costs of healthcare and the cheapest antibiotics are not necessarily the most cost-effective. The clinical success rate of first-line therapy is the primary determinant of the overall expenditure on healthcare because of the high costs associated with treatment failure, especially if it leads to hospitalization. Factors such as poor patient compliance and high antibiotic resistance rates, which undermine the clinical efficacies of first-line therapy, will increase the overall costs of treatment.
18590548	0	a	BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most relevant human opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Two strains (PAO1 and PA14) have been mainly used as models for studying virulence of P. aeruginosa. The strain PA14 is more virulent than PAO1 in a wide range of hosts including insects, nematodes and plants. Whereas some of the differences might be attributable to concerted action of determinants encoded in pathogenicity islands present in the genome of PA14, a global analysis of the differential host responses to these P. aeruginosa strains has not been addressed. Little is known about the host response to infection with P. aeruginosa and whether or not the global host transcription is being affected as a defense mechanism or altered in the benefit of the pathogen. Since the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a suitable host to study virulence of P. aeruginosa and other pathogens, we used available genomic tools in this model system to study the transcriptional host response to P. aeruginosa infection. RESULTS: We have compared the virulence of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 using D. discoideum and studied the transcriptional response of the amoeba upon infection. Our results showed that PA14 is more virulent in Dictyostelium than PA01using different plating assays. For studying the differential response of the host to infection by these model strains, D. discoideum cells were exposed to either P. aeruginosa PAO1 or P. aeruginosa PA14 (mixed with an excess of the non-pathogenic bacterium Klebsiella aerogenes as food supply) and after 4 hours, cellular RNA extracted. A three-way comparison was made using whole-genome D. discoideum microarrays between RNA samples from cells treated with the two different strains and control cells exposed only to K. aerogenes. The transcriptomic analyses have shown the existence of common and specific responses to infection. The expression of 364 genes changed in a similar way upon infection with one or another strain, whereas 169 genes were differentially regulated depending on whether the infecting strain was either P. aeruginosa PAO1 or PA14. Effects on metabolism, signalling, stress response and cell cycle can be inferred from the genes affected. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pathogenic Pseudomonas strains invoke both a common transcriptional response from Dictyostelium and a strain specific one, indicating that the infective process of bacterial pathogens can be strain-specific and is more complex than previously thought.
7145506	1	a	"The relationship between levels of moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care was investigated in a sample of 452 pediatricians. Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed. Institutional type accounted for 43% of the variation in mean activism scores whereas moral reasoning accounted for only 4%; however, because one could, a priori, expect institutional norms and customs to be powerful determinants of behavior, any additional, identifiable influence deserves attention. The structure of individuals' moral reasoning seems to be such an influence."
2707518	1	a	Using the Swedish childhood diabetes register, a nationwide, case-referent study was performed from September 1, 1985 to August 31, 1986. Based on the information from a mailed questionnaire sent to all incident diabetic children and for each diabetic child - two referent children matched according to age, sex, and county, we have analysed perinatal events and aspects of the social environment as possible risk factors for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in childhood. A significantly larger proportion of the mothers of the diabetic children were older than 40 years compared to those of the referent children (33% and 24%, p = 0.01 respectively). A smaller percentage of mothers of the diabetic children had a high educational level compared to mothers of referent children (10% and 15%, p = 0.03 respectively) and 39% of the fathers of the diabetic children were manual workers compared to 31% of the fathers of referent children (p = 0.03). Perinatal events did not differ between diabetic and referent children. In children 0-6 years, the duration of breast-feeding was significantly shorter in diabetic children than among referent children (median duration for diabetic children 5 months compared to 6 months for referent children p = 0.03). When considering the presence of Type 1 diabetes among relatives, maternal age over 40 years, low educational level of the mother, and the father being a manual worker as risk factors, the presence of 1 to 4 of any of these risk factors increased the relative risk for Type 1 diabetes cumulatively from 1.2-7.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
18378372	0	a	The emerging fields of social epidemiology and population health seek to understand the social determinants of health. Especially, with regards to how income inequality causes health disparities, attention has been focused on material and psychosocial mechanisms. I use examples from the epidemiological and social science literature to argue for a third broad etiological framework: the role played by the ways we generally recognize, define, name, and categorize disease states and attribute them to a cause or set of causes. These framing effects shape population health by influencing: health and illness beliefs; patterns of consumption and other behaviors; perceptions of what interventions and policies work; class, ethnic, and other social dynamics; and clinical and public health practices. Important characteristics of many framing phenomena are their capacity to be self-perpetuating and their performative power. A better understanding of framing effects can lead to deploying them more deliberatively and flexibly to improve individual and population health.
22666725	0	a	BACKGROUND: Studies on quality of life (QoL) on youths are limited and have not examined determinants of QoL for this cohort. AIMS: The current study seeks to examine the QoL of Jamaican youths and to build a model that identifies factors that explain QoL. MATERIALS AND METHOD: During the period June to August 2006, the Centre of Leadership and Governance, Department of Government, at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, conducted a stratified random probability survey of 1,338 respondents. Data were collected using a 166-item questionnaire. Of the sampled population (N=1,338), the proportion of those respondents age 18 to 25 years was 27% (N=364) and this constitutes the sample for the current study. The data were stored and retrieved in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 12). Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data, and logistic regression was used to establish the model. RESULTS: The quality of life of Jamaican youths was determined by 4 factors which explain 20% of the variability in quality of life. The parents' economic wellbeing has the most influence on the quality of life of Jamaican youths (OR=1.348; 95% CI: 1.35, 3.04), followed by moderate religiosity (OR=3.594; 95% CI: 1.47, 8.82), the extent of the welfarism of the state (OR=5.273; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.69) and gender (OR = 1.329, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.69). CONCLUSION: The current work has offered us an understanding of the determinants of QoL of youths and how interventions can be planned for in the future.
6234636	1	a	Prejudicial social attitudes towards people with disabilities have from time out of mind been handed down from one generation to the other. They reach far back into the history of mankind. From a social-educational angle it is relevant to trace not only the motivational aspects involved but also the formative forces in historically evolved ambivalent attitudes towards persons with disabilities.
18569355	0	a	The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the merits of evaluating new public health campaign materials in the developmental phase using an experimental design. This is referred to as experimental pretesting. In practice, most new materials are tested only after they have been distributed using nonexperimental or quasiexperimental designs. In cases where materials are pretested prior to distribution, pretesting is usually done using qualitative research methods such as focus groups. Although these methods are useful, they cannot reliably predict the effectiveness of new campaign materials in a developmental phase. Therefore, we suggest when pretesting new materials, not only qualitative research methods but also experimental research methods must be used. The present study discusses an experimental pretest study of new campaign materials intended for distribution in a national sexually transmitted infection (STI) AIDS prevention campaign in the Netherlands. The campaign material tested was the storyline of a planned television commercial on safe sex. A storyboard that consisted of drawings and text was presented to members of the target population, namely, students between the ages of 14 and 16 enrolled in vocational schools. Results showed positive effects on targeted determinants of safe sexual behavior. The advantages, practical implications, and limitations of experimental pretesting are discussed.
7418140	1	a	Correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were studied in 4756 white males and females ages 20-59 years examined during a population survey conducted by 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined. These empirical findings from a cross-sectional study replicated across diverse populations were used to derive speculative estimates of the potential for modification of population levels of HDL cholesterol, consistent with hygienic intervention and lifestyle changes. The results of the study were considered in the context of the literature on determinants of HDL cholesterol.
3403934	1	a	"The postoperative wound infection experience in 11 Israeli hospitals was investigated with two objectives: (1) to utilize the variability among hospitals for a better understanding of the determinants of these infections, and (2) to present surgeons and infection control teams with information upon which they can take action. This article summarizes the methods that were applied to maximize the uniformity of information obtained from hospitals. (1) The same kind of patients were sampled in every hospital. (2) The data collection system was standardized, and analyzed for errors. The overall error rate was small (2%) but there were potential problem areas, such as missing information on underlying diagnoses (12%). Few errors (1%) were found in the nurses' observations of the wounds. (3) All wound infections were diagnosed in a uniform manner by convening a panel of four specialists at the central Israeli Study of Surgical Infections (ISSI) office. (4) The definition of infection that was finally chosen for this multicenter study had to be broadened to include, in addition to pus, ""discharge other than pus,"" because of the higher reliability among panel members. This definition was also clinically valid in terms of morbidity. (5) The rate of postdischarge infections was estimated and was not found to be related to the discharge policies in the various hospitals."
12720254	0	a	In many countries, social health insurance systems are being reformed in favor of more competition among insurers, while premiums are community rated by regulation. The implicit incentives for insurers to engage in risk selection can only be curtailed using appropriate systems of risk-adjusted equalization payments among insurers. To develop these systems, predictors of individual utilization patterns have to be identified, e.g. via regression analysis using previous utilization data. In some countries such as Germany, such data are hardly ever available. In the early nineties, a number of sickness funds participated in an experiment in which individual utilization data were collected. Our data set covers more than 70,000 members of company sickness funds over a 5-year period. We analyze socio-demographic determinants of utilization which could be used as risk adjusters in a risk equalization scheme. Our results suggest that besides age and sex, the set of risk adjusters should include income, family status and a dummy for the last year of life.
11324784	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To determine the features associated with mortality in a multiethnic US cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) within 5 years of study onset. METHODS: Socioeconomic and demographic features (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, occupation, poverty, and health-related behaviors [drinking, smoking, exercising]), clinical and immunologic features (disease duration, disease onset type, disease activity according to the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure [SLAM], disease damage according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics [SLICC] Damage Index [SDI], number of American College of Rheumatology criteria at diagnosis, organ system manifestations, fatigue and pain ratings, and medication usage and autoantibodies), immunogenetic features (HLA class II genotypes), and behavioral and psychosocial features (social support, illness-related behaviors, and helplessness), as obtained at enrollment into the study, were compared between survivors and deceased patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Within 5 years of study onset, 34 of 288 patients have died. Fourteen deaths could be directly attributed to SLE and 11 to infections. In 1 patient the cause of death could not be determined. In the remaining 8 patients the cause of death was neither infectious nor disease-related. There were 10 deaths among Hispanics, 18 among African Americans, and 6 among Caucasians (P < 0.05). Variables associated with mortality in the univariable analyses included poverty, less than full-time employment, difficulty in accessing health care, shorter disease duration, cardiovascular and renal involvement, higher serum creatinine levels and lower hematocrit values, higher SLAM and SDI scores, lower use of antimalarial drugs, and higher use of (some) immunosuppressants. Specific autoantibodies and class II HLA genotypes were not associated with mortality. Poverty and higher baseline SLAM and SDI scores were independently associated with mortality in the multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Disease activity, disease damage, and poverty appear to be the most important determinants of mortality in this multiethnic US cohort of SLE patients. These results have applicability to the management of patients with SLE, a disease that more severely affects disadvantaged minority population groups.
19346046	0	a	Several significant developmental and socialisation processes in the life of children and adolescents take place in the area where they live. The extent to which they can feel and be safe in this environment is an important component of the success of those processes. This study highlights the independent contribution of neighbourhood and individual-level demographic and socioeconomic attributes to child and adolescent injuries. All individuals between the ages of 7 and 16 years living in Stockholm County in January 1998 (n=184 545) were followed up for their injuries during a five-year period considering injuries sustained as a pedestrian/cyclist/motor-vehicle rider and intentional injuries (violence-related and self-inflicted). A series of two-level logistic regressions were conducted to examine the association between the occurrence of injuries and individual (compositional) characteristics nested into parish of residence as well as contextual characteristics. For children and adolescents living in Stockholm County, contextual socioeconomic and social attributes of their place of residence were significant for injuries sustained as motor-vehicle riders but not for those sustained as pedestrians/cyclists or those inflicted intentionally. In the latter case, only the highest concentration of social benefit recipients was associated with significantly higher odds ratios. This emphasises that each injury mechanism has its own socioeconomic and social pathway, where contextual and compositional factors come into play to varying degrees.
15273261	0	a	It is well known that there are social inequalities in health. Following the ecological approach, unemployment has been one of the most used indicators to study social inequalities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between indicators of extreme poverty and social unrest, along with unemployment, and mortality in Barcelona, during the years 1989 to 1993. A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out using Primary Health Care Areas (PHCAs) as the unit of analysis. The study population consisted of residents in Barcelona City. The indicators studied as dependent variables were the age-standardized mortality rates of the following causes of death: total mortality; lung cancer; bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma; cirrhosis; cerebrovascular disease; ischemic heart disease; breast cancer; traffic accidents; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); and drug overdose. Independent variables were male unemployment rate of the primary health care areas and indicators of extreme poverty and social conflict. A descriptive analysis, a bivariate analysis using Spearman correlation coefficients, and a multivariate analysis fitting Poisson regression models were carried out. For the main results, one group of causes of death was associated only with unemployment: bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease (both men and women); lung cancer (only among men); total mortality and cirrhosis (only among women). Among men, another group of causes of death was associated with extreme poverty and/or social unrest, as well as unemployment: total mortality, cirrhosis, and drug overdose. AIDS in men was only associated with extreme poverty and social unrest. We concluded that we see different types of relationships between deprivation and mortality. Unemployment has been related to mortality because of pathologies with socially accepted risk factors (tobacco and alcohol). Causes of death with risk factors not socially accepted (illegal drug use) have been related to indicators of marginality as well as unemployment.
6464823	1	a	A sample of delinquent and nondelinquent male adolescents was assessed with respect to locus of control and intellectual achievement responsibility. Data were also gathered concerning age, family size, birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and school grade. Results were subjected to a multivariate analysis and showed support for a multidimensional model of locus of control. There was no difference in expectancy of control for negative academic events between delinquents and nondelinquents. In general, birth order and delinquency were the two most important determinants of locus of control. Results are discussed in terms of previous literature on locus of control with particular consideration paid to expectations of control.
17520162	0	a	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the social factors associated with self-reported emotional and behavioral problems among Greek adolescents. METHODS: At age 18, a population-based sample of 3373 Greek adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) questionnaire. RESULTS: The results from the multivariate analysis indicated that both lack of intimate friendships and not having parental monitoring were independently associated with problem behavior among both male and female adolescents. Engagement in sexual activities was significantly associated with higher YSR scores among both genders. Absence of academic motivation was associated with higher YSR scores in girls only. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that social factors, including negative family functions, lack of academic motivation and not having close friends, were associated with emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents and imply the need to develop a supportive social network for adolescents.
7424839	1	a	A stratified sample (race, sex, and social class) of 469 laymen from two North Carolina communities responded to a 190-item MMPI-based questionnaire with the degree of mental illness concern evoked by each item. The results reflected systematic race and social class differences in the behavioral bases for mental illness attributions--differences not explainable by overall differences in toleration for deviance. Although laymen had roughly similar rank orderings for the 13 homogeneous clusters of items, blacks indicated greater concern over breakdowns in social orientation than whites, while the opposite pattern held for traditionally defined psychopathy (internal distresses). Upper-class concerns were, comparatively, with cognitive dysfunction, middle-class with moral and social responsibility, and lower-class with social inadequacies.
12281022	1	a	This paper analyzes the migration phenomenon within a framework that treats migration movements as continuous loops, from the country of origin to the destination and back. Significant social-psychological factors at each step of the loop process contribute to the development of migration streams along a predictable pattern. The general model of the loop process shows that the migration stream is 1st sparked when labor is recruited from less developed countries for work in developed industrialized countries. Once the social process of migration has begun, it tends to acquire a self-feeding character. Social and economic change in sending and receiving societies brought about by migration make further migration more likely. The case of the Mexico-US-Mexico loop process is analyzed. This case illustrates the effects of socioeconomic stratification that occurs in communities where the migration loop process reaches a certain level of maturity. The majority of a town's population may become committed to migration as a way of life. Eventually, wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those that are most able to migrate. Thus, migrants may become a new elite segment of rural populations that were once relatively homogenous societies. Further research of the migration loop process should be conducted. At least in the case of Mexico, the socioeconomic stratification in the villages and towns acting as sources of migration loops with destinations in the US have significant internal economic, social, and political implications.
3762472	1	a	In 1983-1984, 4578 Perth primary and secondary schoolchildren were studied. The selected sample was broadly representative of the ethnic groups that make up the Perth population and of the different social ranks within that population. The age, sex, weight, height, country of birth of the child and the parents, and occupation of the father were recorded for each subject. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI) increased with age. Age and sex were the most important determinants of body size. However, children of lower social rank and those with a southern European background were over-represented among the overweight children (greater than the 90th centile for BMI), particularly in adolescence. Children with an Asian background who were 11 years of age and younger were over-represented among the underweight children (less than or equal to the 10th centile for BMI). Results from this study indicate a continuing, though small (1.5 cm to 1.6 cm), secular increase in height over the past 13 to 14 years.
18269370	0	a	Aim To examine the association of socio-economic position (education, income and employment status) with cigarette consumption, intention to quit and self-efficacy to quit among male smokers in Thailand and Malaysia. Design and setting The data were based on a survey of adult smokers conducted in early 2005 in Thailand and Malaysia as part of the International Tobacco Control-South-East Asia (ITC-SEA) project. Participants A total of 1846 men in Thailand and 1906 men in Malaysia. Measurement Participants were asked questions on daily cigarette consumption, intention to quit and self-efficacy to quit in face-to-face interviews. Findings Analyses were based on multivariate regression models that adjusted for all three socio-economic indicators. In Thailand, higher level of education was associated strongly with not having self-efficacy, associated weakly with having an intention to quit and was not associated with cigarette consumption. Higher income was associated strongly with having self-efficacy, associated weakly with high cigarette consumption and was not associated with having an intention to quit. Being employed was associated strongly with having an intention to quit and was not associated with cigarette consumption or self-efficacy. In Malaysia, higher level of education was not associated with any of the outcomes. Higher income was associated strongly with having self-efficacy, and was not associated with the other outcomes. Being employed was associated moderately with higher cigarette consumption and was not associated with the other outcomes. Conclusion Socio-economic and cultural conditions, as well as tobacco control policies and tobacco industry activities, shape the determinants of smoking behaviour and beliefs. Existing knowledge from high-income countries about disparities in smoking should not be generalized readily to other countries.
6419709	1	a	This double-blind, controlled study of XYY and XXY men found in a birth cohort of 4,591 tall men born in Copenhagen assessed evidence of delinquent and aggressive behavior and explored the role of hormonal determinants in the behavioral and psychological differences noted among groups. Information from social records, a structured psychological interview, and projective tests did not support the notion that men with sex chromosome anomalies are particularly violent or aggressive. Hormonally, XYY men had significantly higher concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than matched control groups. In contrast, XXY men had higher levels of LH, FSH, and prolactin, but low concentrations of testosterone. There was a significantly positive relation among all subjects as well as XY controls alone between plasma testosterone level and evidence of criminal convictions. A proportionate increase in testosterone levels was noted when subjects were divided into nondelinquents, delinquents without violent convictions, and delinquents with violent convictions. The relation between testosterone level and criminal behavior was not reflected in measures of aggression derived from the psychological interview and projective tests. There was no specific evidence that testosterone is a mediating factor in the criminal behavior of XYY men.

16040212	0	a	OBJECTIVES: To explore the determinants of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use and possible health-related outcomes in Germany. METHODS: 827 current HRT users (age range 31-78 years, who had taken HRT products in the last 7 days before the medical interview) and 2371 age-matched nonusers were identified from five population-representative National Health Surveys performed from 1984 to 1999 in Germany. Cross-sectional comparisons between HRT users and nonusers were performed for socioeconomic factors and possible health-related outcomes. Regression models were used to obtain odds ratios of HRT use. RESULTS: HRT use increased dramatically from 3% in 1984/1985 to 21% in 1998/1999 among German women aged 40-69. Regression analysis and comparison between HRT users and nonusers suggested that HRT use was closely associated with socioeconomic factors and personal lifestyle that may favor better health. In HRT users, however, we did not observe any health-related benefits in satisfaction with life or health. While HRT users appeared superior to nonusers with respect to the glycemic status, histories of cardiovascular diseases, despite a favorable lipid profile, occurred not less than in the group of nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: In the settings of our cross-sectional studies in Germany HRT did not improve users' health benefits and did not show cardioprotective effects. The better glycemic status should be balanced against the higher risks of cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer.
18673067	0	a	This study used qualitative methods to explore the social and psychological context of sexual behavior and HIV risk among African American non-gay-identified men who have sex with men. Analysis of men's narratives on their sexual behaviors revealed four social and psychological factors contributing to risk for HIV infection: (a) a tendency to compartmentalize and personally disengage from same-sex behavior, (b) traditional gender roles that reinforce men's adherence to masculine images and ambivalent attitudes toward women, (c) cultural norms that favor secrecy and privacy about any personal matters, and (d) spontaneous and unplanned sexual episodes with other men. Findings indicate that innovative HIV prevention and risk reduction strategies are necessary to reach this group and question the legitimacy of conventional sexual orientation categories for these men. Interventions must address social contextual determinants of risk, reinforce men's public identifications as straight/heterosexual, and maintain men's need for privacy about same-sex behaviors.
2911699	1	a	A study of well-being in middle-aged and elderly spinal cord injured persons (Decker & Schulz, 1985) found that long-term coping was facilitated by the presence of a primary support person or caregiver. The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of life satisfaction and depression in 67 primary caregivers of middle-aged and elderly spinal cord injured persons. The study revealed that the availability of social support and feelings of control over one's life were important determinants of caregivers' well-being. In addition, those caregivers spending more time each day assisting the disabled person and feeling burdened by these responsibilities experienced more depression and less life satisfaction. In working with spinal cord injured persons, rehabilitation nurses must consider the well-being of the spinal cord injured person/primary caregiver dyad as an important focus of nursing assessment and intervention.
2489983	1	a	The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods.
15935588	0	a	Centenarians represent an intriguing model for ageing studies, since they demonstrate extreme longevity by definition, and at the same time a proportion of them have aged successfully. Here, we present data from the first nationwide study on Greek centenarians concerning their functional health status and life-style characteristics. We have identified 489 individuals (77% women) born in 1900 or before who were still alive between the years 2000 and 2002. Socio-demographic characteristics, activities of daily living (ADLs), living conditions, dependence on other people, former and current diseases and health disorders, current medication, nutrition and personal habits were recorded for every subject. Interestingly, only 2% of Greek centenarians lived in nursing homes, while the majority lived with their family or relatives. Furthermore, 6% were free from severe health disorders, autonomous (based on simple criteria for ADLs) and also leading an active social life, and hence may be considered as being in optimal condition. This group of centenarians may serve as a valuable source of information on genetic, environmental, and psychosocial determinants of successful ageing.
16326068	0	a	This study explored the factorial structure of the Italian version of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders questionnaire (SCARED), and investigated the contributions of genetic and environmental influences of individual variation of anxiety dimensions as reported in the SCARED. Three hundred and seventy-eight twin pairs aged 8-17 from the Italian Twin Registry filled in the SCARED through a mail survey. Four, distinct empirical factors, that corresponded closely to the original SCARED subscales of Generalized Anxiety (GAD), Panic (PD), Social Phobia (SP), and Separation Anxiety (SAD) disorder emerged from Exploratory Factor Analysis. The empirically derived scores were analyzed by structural equation modeling; moderate-to-high heritability, without age or sex differences, emerged for all dimensions with the exception of GAD, for which an age effect was found. The DSM-IV anxiety dimensions identified by the SCARED have a psychometric structure that can be replicated in the Italian culture, and are influenced at different extents by genetic and nonshared environmental determinants.
15797980	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36.
6875802	1	a	"An experiment was conducted to test the proposition that alcohol is consumed as a function of the quality of past performances and the individual's level of private self-consciousness. One hundred and twenty male subjects were randomly given success or failure feedback on an intellectual task. They then participated in a separate ""wine-tasting"" experiment in which they were allowed to regulate alcohol consumption. As predicted, high self-conscious subjects who had received failure feedback drank significantly more wine than did high self-conscious subjects who received success feedback. Consumption by low self-conscious subjects fell between these extremes and did not vary as a function of success and failure. Additional data indicated that these results were mediated by differential sensitivity to the positive or negative implications of success/failure by high and low self-conscious subjects. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for theoretical accounts of the psychological antecedents of alcohol consumption."
3292101	1	a	Drugs ingested by a lactating mother would be expected to appear in human milk to some extent and be ingested by a breast-feeding infant. Drugs pass from maternal plasma into milk by passive diffusion and are distributed within the aqueous, protein and lipid phases of milk. Distribution into milk will be affected by physiochemical characteristics of the drug: acid-base characteristics, relative protein binding in plasma and milk, and lipid solubility, as well as milk composition. The milk-to-plasma concentration ratio is the most commonly quoted index of drug distribution into human milk. However, calculation of the daily infant dose of drug ingested in milk, and from this the dose in milk relative to the maternal dose on a weight-adjusted basis, is a more relevant indicator of infant exposure to a drug. This is particularly true for drugs with a high volume of distribution, for which only a small proportion of the mother's dose is contained within the plasma and available for distribution into milk. A better indication of infant exposure to a drug is the steady-state plasma drug concentration in a breast-feeding infant, the major determinants of which are the dose rate (via milk) and the oral availability and clearance in the infant. Although in neonates the rate of absorption may be different from adults, there is little evidence that its extent is significantly different. Clearance, however, is impaired in very young infants, particularly if premature. The decreased clearance would result in a proportional increase in steady-state plasma concentrations in the breast-feeding infant. Consideration of the dose ingested in milk and the approximate clearance in infants of different ages allows estimation of likely steady-state plasma concentrations in breast-feeding infants. From these considerations, recommendations regarding the safety of drugs during breast-feeding can be made. Drugs which are very toxic or have dose-independent toxicity should be considered separately. Recommendations regarding 'social' drugs such as nicotine, alcohol, caffeine and theobromine are particularly difficult, as doses are uncontrolled and vary variable.
15246170	0	a	There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that negative health lifestyles are the principal social determinants of the mortality crisis in the former socialist states. Little is known, however, about health lifestyles in Central Asia, where the downturn in life expectancy was also experienced. This paper examines health lifestyles in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in order to fill an important gap in the literature. The data show, consistent with the improved longevity of the Kyrgyz population, that such lifestyles are more positive in Kyrgyzstan despite the somewhat better economic situation in Kazakhstan, where the mortality crisis continues.
12667891	0	a	"Borna Disease Virus (BDV) is a neurotropic RNA virus that is worldwide in distribution, causing movement and behavior disorders in a wide range of animal species. BDV has also been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric diseases of humans by serologic study and by recovery of nucleic acid or virus from blood or brain. Natural infections of horses and sheep produce encephalitis with erratic excited behaviors, hyperkinetic movement or gait abnormalities; naturally infected cats have ataxic ""staggering disease."" Experimentally infected primates develop hyperactivity, aggression, disinhibition, then apathy; prosimians (lower primates) have hyperactivity, circadian disruption, abnormal social and dominance behaviors, and postural disorders. However, the neuropharmacological determinants of BD phenotypes in laboratory and natural hosts are incompletely understood. Here we review how experimentally infected rodents have provided models for examining behavioral, pharmacologic, and biochemical responses to viral challenge, and how rodents experimentally infected as neonates or as adolescents are providing models for examining age-specific neuropharmacological adaptations to viral injury."
19036043	0	a	BACKGROUND: The rates of initiation and duration of breastfeeding in France are low when compared with those in other European countries. The objective of this study was to determine attributions of breastfeeding determinants in a French population. METHODS: A self-report survey listing 68 reasons for or against breastfeeding was developed. Nine hundred nine participants from the general population rated their level of agreement with each reason by means of a Likert-type scale. The survey explored gender, age, parenthood, decision to breastfeed, having friends who had breastfed, having family members who had breastfed, and having been breastfed themselves when younger. Exploratory factorial analyses extracted six factors for breastfeeding and five factors against breastfeeding. All the factors were entered in regression analyses to predict demographic variables that determined attributions for and against breastfeeding. Individuals were measured at two points in time to account for test-retest reliability (28.1 days +/- 6.95 day lapse). RESULTS: Determinants varied significantly with respect to gender, age, parenthood, and breastfeeding history. High endorsement for breastfeeding involved breastfeeding to fulfill gender roles, to prevent health risks, and because of external encouragement; little endorsement was given for the physiological advantages for babies, pleasant sensations, and preference factors. In terms of not breastfeeding, high endorsement was observed in lack of support, negative attitudes, and infant formula reasoning factors; medical and physiological reasons for not breastfeeding showed low endorsement. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed a strong impact of society and cultural norms on feeding choice. If breastfeeding initiation and duration rates are to be increased, we suggest approaching the rest of the population in addition to pregnant women and mothers since society as a whole influences the decision to breastfeed.

19488490	0	a	This evaluative study focused on expansion of the Family Health Strategy in large cities in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The study analyzed the functionality of health care modalities, performance, and supply of comprehensive care itself and its link to services at other levels. The thrust of the analysis was comprehensiveness of care in the daily routine of health services, with a focus on childbearing-age women, and with pregnancy as the tracer condition. The results emerged from an analysis of focus groups with health care users and health professionals, based on: characterization of key actors; their perceptions concerning health, healthcare model, and organization of primary care services and practices. The groups suggested that the actors perceive health as identified with social determinants. Access to services and actions was differentiated in the family health unit by enrollment of the clientele and active search, and the study showed the lack of a structured network. The study indicates that work processes contemplating the social determination of health and its intersectorality can lead to expanded access to comprehensive care for childbearing-age women.
3317879	1	a	Social science research on cultural issues in maternal and child health has stressed some aspects and neglected others. From the perspective of both policy applications and theory development, new research efforts could profitably be directed to the following areas: cultural adjustments to changed energy and nutrient requirements in pregnancy and lactation; maternal illness; the mother/infant dyadic interaction; emic views of growth and development; determinants of infant and young child feeding; management of childhood illnesses; popular medicine and childhood illnesses; intra-household food distribution; household composition and maternal and child health; and macrolevel/microlevel linkages and health.
11673127	0	a	The objectives of this study were to to identify maternal characteristics associated with traditional food consumption and to examine food items associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury body burden in pregnant Inuit women from Northern Quebec. We interviewed women from three communities at mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 11 months postpartum. We measured PCBs, Hg, and selenium in maternal blood; Hg was also measured in maternal hair. The women reported eating significant amounts of fish, beluga muktuk/fat, seal meat, and seal fat. Although consumption of fish and seal was associated with lower socioeconomic status, consumption of beluga whale was uniform across strata. Fish and seal meat consumption was associated with increased Hg concentrations in hair. Traditional food intake during pregnancy was unrelated to PCB body burden, which is more a function of lifetime consumption. This study corroborated previous findings relating marine mammal and fish consumption to increased Hg and selenium body burden. Despite widespread knowledge regarding the presence of these contaminants in traditional foods, a large proportion of Inuit women increased their consumption of these foods during pregnancy, primarily because of pregnancy-related changes in food preferences and the belief that these foods are beneficial during pregnancy.
3776295	1	a	"The relevant aspects of the psychosocial situation of men in old age were listed using two different methods: Identification of contextual determinants of the male aging process. Reporting on empirically based evidence of the situation of elderly men. ad 1. The following contextual aspects of the male aging process were under consideration: generalized and personalized images of elderly men, subjective reports on ""male aging"", changing images of the male sex role and the aging role, male sex role typing across the life span, middle and late adulthood as relevant lifespan segments preceding old age, and sociodemographic and health statistics concerning the situation in which elderly men live. ad 2. The report on empirically based data on the psychosocial situation of old aged men included the following aspects: Social roles of men in old age, comparisons between elderly men and elderly women and between elderly and younger men, interindividual variability (classifications) among the group of old-aged men and early antecedents as ""predictors"" of life satisfaction in old age. Analyzing these different kinds of material, the importance of a differential approach to the multidimensionally determined situation of men in old age was stressed; on the other hand, it seemed to be possible to identify certain ""typical"" characteristics at least for the present cohorts of old-aged men (e.g. importance of the quality of marital life, significance of being free of stress, tendency of experiential integration etc.)."
14518810	0	a	Using longitudinal, community-based data from the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging, the authors examined determinants of changes in social support receipt among 439 married older adults. In general, social support increased over time, especially for those with many preexisting social ties, but those experiencing more psychological distress and cognitive dysfunction reported more negative encounters with others. Gender affected social support receipt: Men received emotional support primarily from their spouses, whereas women drew more heavily on their friends and relatives and children for emotional support. Discussion centers on the importance of social support provision to those with the greatest needs.

The growth rates are examined on different levels of aggregation (individual counties, subregions and regions) and in relation to several possible determinants of growth. The main objective of the study is to examine whether the growth patterns in the eighties support the hypothesis of a turnaround in the population development of rural areas.... The results reveal a diversity of growth patterns and significant regional differences. Rural counties within the daily urban system of a metropolitan area have significantly higher growth rates than peripheral rural counties. The results do not support the notion of a turnaround of long established trends. The trends in the eighties bear more resemblance to traditional growth patterns of rural areas."" (SUMMARY IN ENG)"
16678558	0	a	This report reviews recent research on the psychosocial aspects of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). A review and evaluation of existing literature was conducted by a multidisciplinary committee of experts in this field. This report is a synopsis of a chapter published in the Rome III book. The committee reached consensus in finding considerable evidence supporting the association between psychological distress, childhood trauma and recent environmental stress, and several of the FGIDs but noted that this association is not specific to FGIDs. There is also considerable evidence that psychosocial variables are important determinants of the outcomes of global well-being, health-related quality of life, and health care seeking. In line with these descriptive findings, there is now increasing evidence that a number of psychological treatments and antidepressants are helpful in reducing symptoms and other consequences of the FGIDs in children and adults. The FGIDs are a result of complex interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors, and they can only be treated satisfactorily when all these factors are considered and addressed. Therefore, knowledge about the psychosocial aspects of FGIDs is fundamental and critical to the understanding, assessment, and treatment of these disorders. More extensive physician training is needed if these aspects of treatment are to be used effectively and widely in clinical practice.

12200101	0	a	BACKGROUND: This study examined factors that discriminate between parents who regularly inspect their children for ticks and those who do not do so. METHODS: Knowledge, cognitive and emotional attitudes, social influences, and self-efficacy expectations were assessed in 230 parents living in high endemic regions. RESULTS: Regression analysis showed that moral norms, emotional attitude, anticipated regret, role models, and stress self-efficacy were positively associated with inspection behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Health education programs not only need to stimulate parental knowledge and discuss the health effects of tick bite prevention, they also need to stress the emotional benefits of tick bite prevention for children and parents and induce positive norms toward inspecting others. Furthermore, they need to stimulate openness about inspection behaviors, since the modeling examples of partners, relatives, and grandparents and the behavior of friends discriminate between inspecting and noninspecting parents. Finally, education programs should clearly indicate how tick inspection works, how the need for it should be communicated to the children, and how to take enough time to do it.

The social function needs of persons with schizophrenia are similar to those of all individuals and include typical social roles, integration and contacts, and intimacy and sexual function. 2. Social function is essential to QOL, and aspects of social function are determinants of mental health and mental health outcomes. 3. Although intimacy and sexual function is found to be an important aspect of social function and QOL, health care workers neglect to discuss these issues with patients with schizophrenia. 4. Education, support, counseling, adequate transportation, safe environments, and treatment plans that include appropriate activities are important treatment interventions.
18789776	0	a	North Korea has survived the breakdown of the communist bloc and has been immune to the democratization process of the 1990s. In spite of national famines and economic collapse, the totalitarian regime in Pyongyang maintains a firm grip on its power. Reliable information on the population's biosocial welfare is scarce. Using height and weight data of 5991 North Korean pre-school children measured in 2002, we investigate determinants of height-for-age z-score (HAZ), weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) and weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) as an indicator for child health. We find a statistically significant impact of the age of the child and of the mother, as well as the sex of the child on HAZ and WAZ. In contrast, social status and wealth proxies at the individual and household level are not statistically significant possibly because of errors in these variables. We do not find a consistent effect for geographic regions or for rural-urban residents either. Yet, urban provinces seem to be better-off. Most importantly, we find that children living in families who benefit from food aid of the United Nations are healthier in terms of HAZ, WAZ and WHZ than those depending on the government. Hence, further delivery of United Nations food aid is likely to mitigate the effects of the ongoing food crisis in North Korea.
6584748	1	a	Maori mortality is compared with that of other New Zealanders aged 15-64 in the period 1974 to 1978. For males, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the Maori excess in mortality is associated with marked ethnic differences in socio-economic status. Of the remaining excess, an estimated 15% is linked with cigarette smoking, 10% with alcohol consumption (excluding accidental cause of deaths), 5% with obesity and 17% was due to accidents. However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris. It is recommended that resources should be allocated so that Maori people can be employed to maintain contact with Maori patients with these diseases in order to improve health services utilisation and compliance with therapy. While it was not possible to determine socio-economic status for females from national mortality data, other findings were similar to those found for males except that mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease also contributed to the Maori excess.
3788206	1	a	The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.
12338071	1	a	In the early 1950s, it was generally considered that social mortality differentials appeared during the 1st stages of industrialization and would be resolved with the socialization of health services. Admittedly, at that time, the spectacular progress achieved through antibiotics encouraged the belief that health was merely a matter of medicine and that the institution of a social security scheme would suffice for minimizing the risks of death that were not directly involved in the natural differences between individuals. 30 years have passed and the expectation of life has lengthened (although less than anticipated), but the social differences remain. They are, in fact, by no means attributable to lack of medical science. The elimination of the most discriminating causes of death (alcoholism, accidents, suicide, tuberculosis, etc.) is less dependent on further scientific progress than on a complete change in living conditions and behavior. The reduction in the excess mortality of the poorer classes from other causes (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc.) again calls more for a thorough cultural transformation of the least privileged social categories than for the discovery of new therapies or increased expenditure on hospitals. Faced with a mortality that is already very unequal (selection, differential risks), the various social categories behave in basically different ways, which, while aggravating the real inequities, lead to an apparent morbidity that is inversely proportional to true morbidity and to a more prompt and frequent use of medical care among the social categories in which true morbidity is lowest. Inequality with respect to death is only 1 dimension of social inequality. It was an illusion to imagine that 1 could be eliminated without the other. Today that illusion has been destroyed. That does not mean that the present situation must be accepted. Inequality with respect of death is still 1 of the most disgraceful consequences of social inequality and its abolition must still be our aim. Obviously, however, this aim cannot be achieved through the health services alone.
7326949	1	a	Medical anthropologist spend most of their time eliciting and interpreting people's statements about sickness and health. For this task, they make certain assumptions about the importance of language and reason. In this paper I argue that their assumptions are tailored to fit an hypothetical Rational Man rather than real people. The concept of 'explanatory models of sickness' is used to illustrate this point. My critique begins by drawing attention to two non-cognitive determinants of people's statements: their degree of emotional arousal and their capacities for discoursing on medical subjects. These determinants are briefly discussed and then set aside, to make room for the paper's argument proper. This starts with the observation that medical anthropologists tend to overlook the fact that they have established a cognitive no man's land stretching between their informants' statements and the cognitive structures which are supposed to generate these statements. I survey this void, using a five-fold model of medical knowledge. People use one kind of knowledge to organize their medical experiences and perceptions. In Rational Man writing, this form of knowledge is considered equivalent to cognitive structures (e.g., causal models, classificatory schemes), but I argue that is also includes knowledge of prototypical sickness events and knowledge that is embedded in actions, social relations, and material equipment. The theoretical implications of the five-fold model are outlined. This is followed by an analysis of the reasoning processes in which people use medical knowledge to produce the statements whose meaning we wish to learn. I demonstrate the importance of being able to distinguish operational and monothetic forms of reasoning from pre-operational and polythetic ones. Rational Man writers are described as ignoring the latter pair. The concept of 'prototypes' is reintroduced to illustrate these points.
18000134	0	a	International research on the social determinants of health has increasingly started to integrate a welfare state regimes perspective. Although this is to be welcomed, to date there has been an over-reliance on Esping-Andersen's The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology (1990). This is despite the fact that it has been subjected to extensive criticism and that there are in fact a number of competing welfare state typologies within the comparative social policy literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide public health researchers with an up-to-date overview of the welfare state regime literature so that it can be reflected more accurately in future research. It outlines The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology, and it presents the criticisms it received and an overview of alternative welfare state typologies. It concludes by suggesting new avenues of study in public health that could be explored by drawing upon this broader welfare state regimes literature.
12281047	1	a	"""This article reports findings that have emerged from an effort made at statistically measuring the effects of immigration on the earnings of U.S.-born youth. The presence of immigrants arriving before 1965 has a positive impact on youth earnings. Recently arrived immigrants impact negatively, however. These results are consistent with recent findings that the skill level of immigrants arriving within the last two decades is lower relative to that of immigrants arriving earlier. The results also show that the negative effects diminish as the youth ages, reflecting skill acquisition and job mobility of the young worker into jobs less vulnerable to competition from immigrant workers."""
15768772	0	a	This is an exploratory study to examine the social and cultural determinants of the teaching of HIV/AIDS sex education among secondary school teachers in Eastern Nigeria. The research analyses how teachers perceive passing their knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention measures to their students in the context of their cultural and social norms, which restrict open discussion of sex. This is a qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with 60 teachers drawn from secondary school teachers in Eastern Nigeria, supplemented with five focus group discussions, and content analysis of teachers' lesson preparatory notes. The findings show a high level knowledge of HIV/AIDS preventive measures among teachers. However, teachers are not passing on this knowledge because of cultural and social inhibitions. In addition, teachers have not been receiving adequate training and motivation on information, education and communication for HIV/AIDS sex education. The situation calls for serious policy intervention.
6391257	1	a	Data from 1002 households indicated that contextual factors (group size, subsequent activity) and individual difference factors (sex, extroversion, drinking frequency) differentially influenced consumption and normative ratings. These findings suggest that contextual cues serve as determinants of drinking norms and that drinking behavior reflects individual variation in sensitivity to these cues.
11580075	0	a	Although measures to enhance bone mineralization during childhood and adolescence are widely incorporated into preventive programmes against osteoporotic fracture, there are no published data directly linking growth rates in childhood with the risk of later hip fracture. We addressed this issue in a unique Finnish cohort in whom birth and childhood growth data were linked to later hospital discharge records. This permitted follow-up of 3639 men and 3447 women who were born in Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1924 and 1933, who went to school in Helsinki and still lived in Finland in 1971. Body size at birth was recorded and an average of 10 measurements were obtained of height and weight throughout childhood. We identified 112 subjects (55 men and 57 women) who sustained a hip fracture during 165 404 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex in a proportional hazards model, we identified two major determinants of hip fracture risk: tall maternal height (p < 0.001) and a low rate of childhood growth (height, p = 0.006; weight, p = 0.01). The hazard ratio for hip fracture was 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.5) among men and women born to mothers taller than 1.61 m, when compared with those whose mothers were shorter than 1.54 m. The ratio was 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.2) among those whose rate of childhood height gain was below the lowest quartile for the cohort, compared with those whose growth rate was above the highest quartile. The effects of maternal height and childhood growth rate were statistically independent of each other, and remained after adjusting for socioeconomic status. The patterns of childhood growth that predicted future hip fracture differed between boys and girls. In boys, there was a constant deficit in height and weight between ages 7 and 15 years among those later sustaining fractures; in girls, there was a progressively increasing deficit in weight but a delayed height gain among those later sustaining fractures. This epidemiologic study provides the first direct evidence that a low rate of childhood growth is a risk factor for later hip fracture. Whether reduced growth rate is a consequence of childhood lifestyle, genetic background or intrauterine hormonal programming, the data support measures to optimize childhood growth as part of preventive strategies against osteoporotic fracture in future generations.
2707518	1	a	Using the Swedish childhood diabetes register, a nationwide, case-referent study was performed from September 1, 1985 to August 31, 1986. Based on the information from a mailed questionnaire sent to all incident diabetic children and for each diabetic child - two referent children matched according to age, sex, and county, we have analysed perinatal events and aspects of the social environment as possible risk factors for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes in childhood. A significantly larger proportion of the mothers of the diabetic children were older than 40 years compared to those of the referent children (33% and 24%, p = 0.01 respectively). A smaller percentage of mothers of the diabetic children had a high educational level compared to mothers of referent children (10% and 15%, p = 0.03 respectively) and 39% of the fathers of the diabetic children were manual workers compared to 31% of the fathers of referent children (p = 0.03). Perinatal events did not differ between diabetic and referent children. In children 0-6 years, the duration of breast-feeding was significantly shorter in diabetic children than among referent children (median duration for diabetic children 5 months compared to 6 months for referent children p = 0.03). When considering the presence of Type 1 diabetes among relatives, maternal age over 40 years, low educational level of the mother, and the father being a manual worker as risk factors, the presence of 1 to 4 of any of these risk factors increased the relative risk for Type 1 diabetes cumulatively from 1.2-7.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2916712	1	a	The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture. Initial assessments were conducted shortly after surgery and follow up assessments 2, 6, and 12 months later. By 12 months, 15 patients had died and 15 had entered a nursing home. Substantial declines in physical functioning though not psychosocial status were observed. Only 21 per cent (compared to 81 per cent prefracture) reported walking independently; fewer than 30 per cent had regained reported prefracture levels of physical function. The proportion with elevated depression scores at 12 months was 20 per cent, down from 51 per cent following surgery; 64 per cent rated their health excellent or good at 12 months, up from 43 per cent after surgery. Poor cognitive status and post-surgical self-rated health were predictive of mortality. Among survivors, age, prefracture physical functioning, and cognitive status were associated with recovery in physical function but not psychosocial status. High post-surgery depression scores, but not the other psychosocial factors, were associated with poorer recovery in both functional and psychosocial status. These findings demonstrate the importance of depressive symptoms as one determinant of recovery from hip fracture and support the need to attend to the affective status of hip fracture patients following surgery.
12772438	0	a	AIM: To present currently available evidence on the role that adverse psychosocial factors play in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The specific objectives of the review were to (1) provide a picture of what is known about the relationship between psychosocial factors and hypertension, (2) summarize the major methodological and conceptual pitfalls, and (3) identify gaps in the literature and suggest areas for future research. DATA SYNTHESIS: The scope of the literature review was adults and the literature published since 1990 (acknowledging that some articles published earlier would need to be taken into account). A number of journal searches were carried out. They included Medline, PsychInfo, and SocioFile, with keywords, such as hypertension, blood pressure, psychosocial, psychological, social, acculturation, occupation, socio-economic status, social class, education, depression, anger, and anxiety. The search included articles related to hypertension in developed countries and was limited to studies in the English language. CONCLUSION: A growing body of evidence supports the thesis that psychosocial factors play a role in the pathogenesis for hypertension.
6372134	1	a	The multiple regression equation predicting lung function values for a study population of South African Blacks is compared with equations predicting normal values for Blacks elsewhere, and in almost all cases is found to predict higher values. This is so despite the study population's high prevalence of respiratory disease and long history of exposure to crocidolite asbestos dust. This anomalous finding is explored in terms of some problems with studies generating normal values. In particular, the confounding effect of social class status on ethnic determinants of lung function is considered. Low 'normal' values for Blacks reported from South Africa and elsewhere are examined. The disadvantages to workers of being evaluated in relation to low norms are discussed in terms of preventive medicine and workmen's compensation. The application of a universal standard for all is proposed.
18268195	0	a	BACKGROUND: Although risk factors for Alzheimer disease have been well studied, much less is known about risk factors for primary progressive aphasia (PPA). OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that learning disabilities (LDs) are more common in patients with PPA and their first-degree family members. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Self-report endorsement of an individual and family history of an LD in a sample of 699 subjects from the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Center registry. We compared 3 dementia groups (PPA, typical amnestic Alzheimer disease, and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia) and 1 elderly control group. A retrospective medical record review in the PPA probands was used to obtain additional information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of LDs among probands and their first-degree relatives. RESULTS: The patients with PPA and their first-degree family members had a significantly higher frequency of LD compared with the other dementia groups and the controls. Some of the families of patients with PPA displayed unusual concentrations of LD, especially dyslexia. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LD may constitute a risk factor for PPA, providing additional clues concerning the determinants for the selective vulnerability of the language network in this syndrome.
6558283	1	a	The incidence and prevalence of breastfeeding has increased in the United States and Canada in the past decade, but in spite of its known benefits it is often abandoned before infants are two months of age. Society lacks the attitudes and knowledge necessary for breastfeeding success. A survey of the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of 409 secondary school students in British Columbia, Canada, revealed misconceptions about the nature of breastfeeding. A high percentage felt it was unacceptable in social situations. The findings point to a need for the integration of information about breastfeeding into school health programs, biology, home economics/nutrition and family life/sexuality courses. Increased knowledge and discussion to foster positive attitudes could increase breastfeeding duration among parents in the future.
15222847	0	a	Research bearing on several popular conceptions of the major determinants of anger arousal indicates that the particular appraisals often identified as causes of anger frequently only serve to affect the intensity of the anger that is generated. Research into effects of physical pain or other physically unpleasant conditions or involving social stresses suggests that decidedly aversive conditions are a major spur to anger. Experiments are also reviewed showing that anger-related muscular movements can also lead to anger-related feelings, memories, cognitions, and autonomic responses. Alternative explanations for the findings are discussed. The authors urge emotion theorists to widen their methodology and analyses so that they give careful, detailed attention to the many different factors that can influence anger.
18576207	0	a	A multivariate model was developed incorporating various socio-demographic, social-environmental, and social-psychological factors in an attempt to predict suicidal ideation among Canadian youth. The main research objective sought to determine what socially based factors elevate or reduce suicidal ideation within this population. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth-Cycle 5 (2003), a cross-sectional sample of 1,032 was used to empirically identify various social determinants of suicidal ideation among youth between the ages of 12 and 15. Results reveal statistically significant correlations between suicide ideation and some lesser examined socially based measures. In particular, ability to communicate feelings, negative attachment to parents/guardians, taunting/bullying or abuse, and presence of deviant peers were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. As expected, depression/anxiety, gender, and age were also correlated with thoughts of suicide. Research findings should help foster a better understanding toward the social elements of suicide and provide insight into how suicide prevention strategies may be improved through an increased emphasis on substance use education, direct targeting of dysfunctional families and deviant peer groups, and exploring more avenues of self-expression for youth.
18156100	0	a	BACKGROUND: Sex (referring to the strict biological sense) and gender (referring to the sociocultural dimension) are major determinants of health and disease. OBJECTIVE: This review examines similarities and differences between the sexes in the prevalence of osteoporosis and fractures, bone- and fall-related risk factors for incident fractures, and the possibilities of fracture prevention, as well as gender differences in the perception of osteoporosis. METHODS: We reviewed recent English-language publications on sex and gender differences in the context of osteoporosis and fracture risk. We refer to several reviews that provide extensive reference lists on the topics discussed. RESULTS: The incidence of fractures is higher in boys than in girls. The burden of fractures in adults increases with age, and it starts earlier and is higher in adult women than in adult men. With life expectancy increasing, the annual number of fractures is likely to increase substantially. Fractures in adults contribute to increased mortality (more in men than in women), increased morbidity (equal in men and women), and high costs (greater for women than for men). Adult men experience fewer fractures than women do. Men build larger bones with better microarchitecture while they are growing and thereafter have less increase in bone remodeling. Furthermore, they develop bone loss at a later age. Compared with their female counterparts, fewer older men are hypogonadic, and life expectancy is shorter for men than for women. There are multiple reasons for the differences in the incidences of fractures between men and women, related to the many factors associated with both bone and falls that influence fracture risk from the molecular and cellular level to the organ level. Sex hormones play a central and essential role in the physiology of bone by direct and indirect mechanisms (eg, by interfering with the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 axis). Case-finding strategies to identify patients at highest risk for fractures, including bone densitometry and clinical risk factors, are much better documented at the population level in women than in men. Drug therapies that reduce the risk of a broad spectrum of fractures, even in the short term, are more clearly demonstrated in randomized controlled studies in women than in men. Drug therapy is more widely available for women with osteoporosis,but it is rarely given to men with osteoporosis. Differences in the perception of osteoporosis between men and women are even less well documented. CONCLUSIONS: In general, osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated in women but even more so in men, and is related to limits in the patient's and the physician's awareness at all clinical stages, from case finding to compliance with and persistence of therapy. Furthermore, the lay perception of a healthy lifestyle, the level of social isolation, networking within the health care system, and opportunities for screening appear to contribute to gender differences in participating in osteoporosis prevention and therapy. These aspects of health care deserve further attention and research.
2916712	1	a	The independent contributions to recovery from hip fracture of psychosocial factors including depression, personality, social connectedness, and self-rated health were studied in 219 women age 59 and older (mean age 78.5) who were community dwelling prior to fracture.

25195529	1	a	With the increasing interest in comparative studies of the elderly, China has become the focus of research attention. This society, which has been inaccessible to most Western researchers, offers a special site for studies of aging because of its sheer size as a world power, its relationship to Third World countries, and its population problem-a growing segment of elderly people. Available data from a variety of social science sources are utilized to compare how the sociocultural context of China and the United States impact differentially upon the older population in each society. Three major determinants specify the theoretical context: economic development (the level of production an economic system achieves); traditional cultural patterns (norms, roles, relationships); and the social control mechanisms (regulatory processes based upon the legal and sanctioning systems). These determinants provide a theoretical orientation for analyzing the outcome variables involved in the behavior and adaptation of the old. In American society, cultural norms and values are advantageous for active older persons in good health, particularly those with a favorable economic situation. In contemporary Chinese society, which blends traditional customs with the values of a revolutionary and changing society, there are advantages for the frail elderly.
2785722	1	a	In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact.
3266155	1	a	This article extends previous research on the household composition of older unmarried women, using a statistical model that treats each of a woman's surviving children as a distinct potential provider of a shared household. Additional possibilities--living alone, living with other nuclear-family relatives, and living with others--are also recognized, providing a varied range of household-structure opportunities for older women. The approach allows us to identify individual child attributes associated with the propensity to coreside with the older unmarried mother. The results confirm earlier findings regarding the importance of income, age, and disability status as determinants of the household composition of older women. We find, however, that unmarried children, especially sons, are more likely to share a household with an elderly mother than are married children. Working reduces the likelihood that a married daughter will live with her older mother. Overall, the findings suggest that the attributes, more so than the sheer numbers, of living children influence the household structure of their mothers.
12283031	1	a	"""The paper attempts to investigate and identify some of the most important predictors of family size-preferences in Pakistan. Based on cross-sectional data relating to 9,416 currently married women, the results of this study suggest that having one or more sons in the family is the principal predictor of the desired family size. Yet another important predictor is the education of the wife which plays a critical role in the family size determination. The study shows that the preferences for family size do not vary greatly between urban and rural areas."""
3046208	1	a	"The authors compared formalized case records contained in the data bank ""Rehabilitative Automated Information System"" (RAIS) for two groups of schizophrenics who have received a course of restorative therapy. The first group consists of 173 patients with A and B remissions, the second one, of 155 patients with D and C remissions and without remissions. The authors have analyzed 487 morbid characteristics of patients and identified 209 of them, which allow the differentiation of the groups under study at a statistically significant level. Forty of the most informative signs were utilized for constructing on the basis of image-recognizing algorithms of determinants for the individual prognosis of the remission type."
2807934	1	a	A national sample of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged was created by merging the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey and its counterpart, the National Health Interview Survey for the same year. A weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might be useful in calculating home- and community-based long-term care clients' risk of institutionalization. A model containing patient characteristics, nursing home bed supply, and a climate variable correctly classified 98.2 percent of cases residing in nursing homes or the community. Physical dependency, mental disorder and degenerative disease, lack of spouse, being white, poverty, old age, unoccupied nursing home beds, and climate all appear to be determinants of institutional residency among the aged.
7090573	1	a	Health education aimed mainly at changing individual behaviour and lifestyle faces growing challenges. Recent research suggests that broader economic, social and environmental forces are the determinants of many diseases and of behaviours that contribute to ill health. Furthermore, health education programmes seeking only to change behaviour have not been particularly effective in making significant improvements in morbidity or mortality. Finally, behavior change strategies locate the problem within the individual, leading to a tendency to blame the victim for the disease. This paper offers an alternative approach to health education, an approach which seeks to involve citizens in identifying and addressing social and environmental threats to health. From the practices of the women's health movement, the movement for occupational safety and health and the environmental movement in the United States in the last decade, an expanded foundation for health education is suggested. The following principles are illustrated: 1. Health education programmes must include informational, behavioural, political, legal and economic components; 2. Health education for social change recognizes the political character of health and disease; 3. Health education efforts can be rooted in popular struggles for a more just and humane society. 4. Health education activities should address people's day-to-day concerns about their lives and their health. The paper concludes with some specific recommendations on how health educators can include action for social change in their practice.
3566318	1	a	We followed 183 infants for two years, 31 of whom were breast fed less than three and a half months (median 70 days; short breast feeding group) and a further 31 of whom were exclusively breast fed for more than nine months (long breast feeding group). We assessed heredity for atopy, number of infections, and duration of breast feeding as determinants of atopy. During the first year of life 14 infants has signs of atopy. During the second year parents reported signs of atopy in a further 31. Heredity was the only significant predictor of atopy. Atopy was seen in 33% of infants with a positive heredity and in 16% without family history for atopy. The duration of breast feeding affected the incidence of atopy only among the infants without family history for atopy: fewer in the short breast feeding group (1/18) had atopy than in the long breast feeding group (5/13). Duration of breast feeding did not associate with incidence of respiratory infections. Diarrhoea was more common in the short breast feeding group than in the long breast feeding group during the first year of life. We conclude that prolonging exclusive breast feeding from the median of 70 days to nine months did not contribute to the prevention of infantile atopy and respiratory tract infections.
19032747	0	a	BACKGROUND: Air pollution and social characteristics have been shown to affect indicators of health. While use of spatial methods to estimate exposure to air pollution has increased the power to detect effects, questions have been raised about potential for confounding by social factors. METHODS: A study of singleton births in Eastern Massachusetts was conducted between 1996 and 2002 to examine the association between indicators of traffic, land use, individual and area-based socioeconomic measures (SEM), and birth outcomes (birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births), in a two-level hierarchical model. RESULTS: We found effects of both individual (education, race, prenatal care index) and area-based (median household income) SEM with all birth outcomes. The associations for traffic and land use variables were mainly seen with birth weight, with an exception for an effect of cumulative traffic density on small for gestational age. Race/ethnicity of mother was an important predictor of birth outcomes and a strong confounder for both area-based SEM and indices of physical environment. The effects of traffic and land use differed by level of education and median household income. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings of the study suggested greater likelihood of reduced birth weight and preterm births among the more socially disadvantaged, and a greater risk of reduced birth weight associated with traffic exposures. Results revealed the importance of controlling simultaneously for SEM and environmental exposures as the way to better understand determinants of health.
10726937	0	a	In order to understand and elicit the psychosocial factors influencing compliance with sexual partner referral, 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 40 individual interviews based on the attitude-social influence-self efficacy (ASE) model were held in Mbarara District of Uganda. The focus groups were derived from both rural and urban areas. Informal interviews were held with 20 men and 20 women presenting with symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) at the outpatient department of Mbarara Hospital. The emerging outcome of attitudinal beliefs regarding health consequences of partner referral were mainly positive. However, outcome beliefs relating to the relationship with the partners were mainly negative. Social influence for sexual partner referral was from health-care providers, partner(s), friends and relatives. The self-efficacy beliefs were mainly negative especially among women. Barriers hampering sexual partner referral were related to poor quality of health care, gender relations and type of sexual partners. There is a need to target these beliefs and self-efficacy expectations in health education and STD counselling and for more research to evaluate the psychosocial determinants of sexual partner referral quantitatively.
10287174	1	a	"Health policy can be described as policy directed at the determinants of health, i.e. biological and environmental factors, lifestyle and the health care system. This type of policy now has become a policy objective in an increasing number of countries. In this article mental health is placed in the broad context of this policy. The central question is: can the mental health field grasp the opportunity of a growing interest in prevention and health promotion in general, as major objectives of health policy? Or will it stay more or less isolated from the mainstream of current developments? Answering this question means looking at the conditions of health policy. For health policy it is required that a definition be given of health problems and ""causing"" conditions. There should further be available intervention possibilities of a preventive and intersectoral character and also preventive strategies. It is stated that there is enough standardized information on mental health problems and experience with community-based research to let mental health participate in drawing up a community diagnosis. It also appears possible to construct an ecological health status model for mental health. Research on the factors in this model shows a shift in focus from risk populations to risk situations, e.g. unemployment, industrial disability, divorce and isolation. Further it is recognized that the search for causal factors is substituted by that for precipitating factors. Social-demographic factors, taken alone, are not precipitating factors. What matters is the combination of an underdeveloped coping mechanism, little social support, and prolonged stressful conditions or sudden stressful events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2722362	1	a	Social class (SC) conveys information about a child's potential lead exposure (PB) as well as other, independent determinants of cognition (IQ). Thus, depending on the way in which SC is handled in statistical analyses, the PB-IQ association may be either 'overadjusted' or 'underadjusted' for SC. Two assumptions that underlie the inclusion of SC in correlation/regression analyses of the PB-IQ relationship are: 1) SC is an interval scale and 2) the PB-IQ relationship is homogeneous in all social strata. Simulation analyses are presented to illustrate the impact that different values of the bivariate correlations PB-SC, IQ-SC, and PB-IQ have on the estimate of the PB-IQ adjusted for SC. Alternative approaches to addressing these issues are discussed.
14765475	0	a	This article is one of a series commissioned to mark the tenth anniversary of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, discussing past developments and future directions in areas of policy and law related to HIV/AIDS. It takes a critical look at Canada's drug policy. Despite calls for a balanced approach focused on reducing drug-related harm, Canada's method of dealing with problems of illicit drug use has remained prohibitionist in nature, and by far the greatest part of federal funding is devoted to supply-reduction initiatives. Considerable changes in policy and law are needed to significantly reduce the harms associated with injection drug use in Canada. These include developing a comprehensive and integrated strategy, exploring alternative legal frameworks, piloting innovative approaches to reducing injection-related harms, and investing in broad social policies that address the determinants of injection drug use.
12521802	0	a	This study examines the determinants of Mission House Delivery among booked patients in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. During the 12 months of the study (1 May 199930 April 2000) 196 booked patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife who delivered at mission houses were analysed. All ages and parity groups, educational level and social classes were involved. The majority (73%) were of low socio-economic class. The reasons for mission house delivery included financial constraints (41%), fear of possible caesarean section (46%), industrial action by health-care workers (39%), transport difficulty at night (26%), previous deliveries in mission houses (16%) and communal feud (12%). Four maternal deaths occurred (MMR 978/100 000 births) and 20 perinatal deaths (PNMR 118/1000 total births). Reduction of hospital user fees, provision of transportation and efficient telecommunication facilities at all times, conflict resolution and proper remuneration of health care workers are urgent needs to be addressed. Legislation against delivery in unsafe places and establishment of appropriate facilities by churches interested in maternity services is highly recommended.
14761816	0	a	Culture determines the different ways that patients understand cancer, the ways they explain it, and their attitudes towards it. These factors affect the patient's emotional response to the disease and health behaviour in terms of prevention and treatment. In this paper we review the explanatory models for cancer in several cultural groups. These models range from metaphysical to interpersonal and physical. Cultural explanations of health and health behaviour could detract from social and economic factors that might be more important as determinants of these behaviours.
14709709	0	a	Individual behavior and social contexts are critical determinants of health. We surveyed commissioners or their designees in 22 departments of health serving US cities of at least 500,000 people to examine their use of scientific approaches to influence individual behavior and social contexts. Each department used behavioral or social science in its work, but only four departments were judged to have integrated these approaches throughout their operations, using both centralized and decentralized structures. Degree of integration was unrelated to collaboration with universities or communities but was related to use of explicit theories. Behavioral and social sciences were employed most frequently in the areas of HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health and in the service of changing individual behavior rather than larger contexts, although across departments many health problems and approaches were involved. Commissioners generally found the approaches valuable, but articulated barriers to more widespread adoption.
3067531	1	a	The present paper will review and discuss research issues and findings of recent cross-cultural studies of severe mental disorders. The paper is divided into two main sections. The first section will discuss: (1) the concept of culture, (2) hierarchical levels of human behavior determinants, (3) the cultural variability continuum, and (4) the concept of self. The second section will discuss: (1) epidemiology, (2) culture and clinical phenomenology in severe disorders, and (3) culture as an etiological determinant. The paper closes with a discussion of some conclusions and suggestions for future research.
3563565	1	a	Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed.
6684973	1	a	The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts.
2858150	1	a	"The validity of a questionnaire developed to assess negative attitudes towards drug therapy by relatives of schizophrenic patients is examined. The questionnaire items are tested against the statement: ""Patients should not take drugs, they can only be helped by good advice"". The prejudice of relatives of schizophrenics against drug therapy may have an effect on the patients' compliance to maintenance therapy and, subsequently, on their relapse rate. A number of factors, social and psychological, were examined as possible determinants of the negative attitudes of relatives. These factors include age, sex, profession, education, positive family history, and use of drugs among the relatives; mental state, residence, duration of illness, relapse rate and clinical features in the patients. Poor education of relatives correlated to negative attitudes towards drug therapy."
7287243	1	a	A profile of the demographic, sociologic, drug use, and drinking characteristics of a large group of inpatient alcoholics has been constructed as background for discussion of the clinical significance of these factors as determinants of physical morbidity in hazardous drinkers. Factors specifically considered include sex, skid row status, social class, and abnormal use of drugs of dependence, the amount of alcohol consumed and duration of drinking, drinking pattern, and type of beverage. While heavy drinking is of primary importance, the physical disease profile found in hazardous drinkers is modified by certain host and environmental characteristics. The implications for treatment planning and preventive programs are considered.
16704332	0	a	Over the past few decades, there has been increasing interest in the study of social impairment in schizophrenia. However, the concept of social functioning has been poorly defined in the literature. This article highlights the global and multi-factorial nature of social functioning and reviews the theoretical determinants of social dysfunction in schizophrenia. Emphasis is placed on outlining the social cognitive deficits that may occur. The study of social cognition appears particularly promising in elucidating our understanding of the development of social impairment in schizophrenia and has the potential to improve current psychosocial interventions. However, continued advances depend upon the existence of reliable and well-validated measures of social functioning and social cognition. A selection of measures are reviewed in this article in an attempt to highlight the importance of assessing multiple aspects of social functioning in schizophrenia and to assist researchers in the selection of appropriate measures. Future efforts should be directed towards the continued validation of social functioning and social cognitive measures and their adaptation for use in at-risk and early psychosis populations.
19161545	0	a	Child stunting, an outcome of chronic undernutrition, contributes to poor quality of life, morbidity and mortality. In South Asia, the low status of women is thought to be one of the primary determinants of undernutrition across the lifespan. Low female status can result in compromised health outcomes for women, which in turn are related to lower infant birthweight and may affect the quality of infant care and nutrition. Maternal autonomy (defined as a woman's personal power in the household and her ability to influence and change her environment) is likely an important factor influencing child care and ultimately infant and child health outcomes. To examine the relationship between maternal autonomy and child stunting in Andhra Pradesh, India, we analysed data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-2. We used cross-sectional demographic, health and anthropometric information for mothers and their oldest child <36 months (n = 821) from NFHS-2. The main explanatory variables of autonomy are presented by four dimensions - decision making, permission to travel, attitude towards domestic violence and financial autonomy - constructed using seven binary variables. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between indicators of female autonomy and the risk of having a stunted child. Women with higher autonomy {indicated by access to money [odds ratio (OR) = 0.731; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.546, 0.981] and freedom to choose to go to the market [OR = 0.593; 95% CI 0.376, 0.933]} were significantly less likely to have a stunted child, after controlling for household socio-economic status and mother's education. In this south Indian state, two dimensions of female autonomy have an independent effect on child growth, suggesting the need for interventions that increase women's financial and physical autonomy.
2718569	1	a	This investigation of the Ewe tribe in Togo tries to analyse the determining factors of the living conditions of the elderly in the rural areas. The migration from these areas into the cities is not clearly responsible for the economic situation of the old people. Rather, connected with supposed social problem are the negative image of the old and the education gap between the generations. The declining status is perceived by analysing shifts in the system of village government, which is a province of the old men. The structure of the decision-making system is described in the text.
11885033	0	a	The modern concept of public health, the New Public Health, carries a great potential for healthy and therefore less aggressive societies. Its core disciplines are health promotion, environmental health, and health care management based on advanced epidemiological methodologies. The main principles of living together in healthy societies can be summarized as four ethical concepts of the New Public Health essential to violence reduction equity, participation, subsidiarity, and sustainability. The following issues are discussed as violence determinants: the process of urbanization; type of neighborhood and accommodation, and consequent stigmatization; level of education; employment status; socialization of the family; women's status; alcohol and drug consumption; availability of the firearms; religious, ethnic, and racial prejudices; and poverty. Development of the health systems has to contribute to peace, since aggression, violence, and warfare are among the greatest risks for health and the economic welfare. This contribution can be described as follows: 1) full and indiscriminate access to all necessary services, 2) monitoring of their quality, 3) providing special support to vulnerable groups, and 4) constant scientific and public accountability of the evaluation of the epidemiological outcome. Violence can also destroy solidarity and social cohesion of groups, such as family, team, neighborhood, or any other social organization. Durkheim coined the term anomie for a state in which social disruption of the community results in health risks for individuals. Health professionals can make a threefold contribution to peace by 1) analyzing the causal interrelationships of violence phenomena, 2) curbing the determinants of violence according to the professional standards, and 3) training professionals for this increasingly important task. Because tolerance is an essential part of an amended definition of health, monitoring of the early signs of public intolerance is important. The vital interplay between the informed public and efficient administration, however, can only exist in an open society. The link between democracy and health of the people, and between public health and economic welfare is real. The Public Health Collaboration in South Eastern Europe (PH-SEE) evolved just in time to reconnect and strengthen disrupted professional networks in the region as a prerequisite of effective public health action.
19997790	0	a	BACKGROUND: Little is known about psychosocial mechanisms that may underlie differences in lifestyle change between socioeconomic groups. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine how educational level influences middle-aged participants' (N = 385) psychosocial responses to the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial. METHODS: The measurements of self-efficacy and planning for healthy lifestyle were conducted pre-intervention (T1) and post-intervention (T2, 3 months), and measurements of exercise and healthy eating as outcomes at T1 and at 12 months (T3). RESULTS: Psychosocial determinants at T1 and their T1-T2 changes were mostly similar, irrespective of educational levels. Exercise barriers self-efficacy was enhanced slightly less (p = 0.08) among the low-SES. T2 levels as well as pre-post-intervention changes in exercise self-efficacy predicted 12-month changes in exercise, and T2 diet coping planning predicted changes in dietary fat intake. The associations were similar across all SES groups. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing self-efficacy and planning is similarly effective among intervention participants regardless of education level.
6382590	1	a	This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.
18079335	0	a	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Previous studies of neighbourhood effects on ischaemic heart disease (IHD) have used census or administrative data to characterise the residential context, most commonly its socioeconomic level. Using the ecometric approach to define neighbourhood social interaction variables that may be relevant to IHD, neighbourhood social cohesion and safety were examined to see how they related to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality, after adjustment for individual and neighbourhood confounders. DESIGN: To construct social interaction variables, multilevel models were used to aggregate individual perceptions of safety and cohesion at the neighbourhood level. Linking data from the Health Survey in Scania, Sweden, and the Population, Hospital, and Mortality Registers, multilevel survival models were used to investigate determinants of AMI mortality over a three year and nine month period. PARTICIPANTS: 7791 Individuals aged 45 years and over. MAIN RESULTS: The rate of AMI mortality increased with decreasing neighbourhood safety and cohesion. After adjustment for individual health and socioeconomic variables, low neighbourhood cohesion, and to a lesser extent low safety, were associated with higher AMI mortality. Neighbourhood cohesion effects persisted after adjustment for various neighbourhood confounding factors (income, population density, percentage of residents from low-income countries, residential stability) and distance to the hospital. There was some evidence that neighbourhood cohesion effects on AMI mortality were caused by effects on one-day case-fatality, rather than on incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond commonly evoked effects of the physical environment, neighbourhood social interaction patterns may have a decisive influence on IHD, with a particularly strong effect on survival after AMI.

22077172	1	a	Summary In order to unravel the complex set of the determinants of fertility, we suggest that the child-bearing process be separated into a sequence of events and intervals. As the first step in the child-bearing process, age at first birth is a critical variable. Using data from the 1966-67 West Malaysia Family Survey, we formulate and test a model of the cultural, social and economic determinants of the timing of first birth among a sample of mothers, aged 30-44. Social origins, measured by the woman's father's occupation and the woman's birthplace are not important determinants, but education, early work experience, and ethnicity exercise very strong effects on the age at first birth. Age at first marriage mediates much of the effect of background variables, which suggest that there is little use of contraception to plan the first birth interval. The strong effect of ethnicity is consistent with a cultural interpretation, but important qualifications are noted.
16900044	0	a	This study investigates the determinants within socio-demography, health behaviour, employer characteristics, and psychosocial and physical work environment for return to work. In 2000, a total of 5357 employees were interviewed regarding age, gender, family status, education, health behaviour, employer characteristics and work environment. They were followed in a national register for 18 months in order to identify subjects with 2 weeks or more of sickness absence. They were followed for an additional 12 months in order to establish associations between baseline measurements and time to first return to work. A total of 930 (17.4%) employees experienced sickness absence in the 18 months after baseline. During the 12-month follow-up, 856 (92.0%) returned to work, the mean absence period being 6.6 weeks. Prolonged time to first return to work was associated with female gender, increased age, no post-school education, being employed by a public employer, working at a workplace with 20 or more employees, high emotional demands in work, high job insecurity and sedentary work. There were no associations between health behaviour variables and return to work. The study indicates a potential for promoting return to work through interventions targeting emotional job demands, job insecurity and decreasing the risks associated with sedentary work.
12283031	1	a	"""The paper attempts to investigate and identify some of the most important predictors of family size-preferences in Pakistan. Based on cross-sectional data relating to 9,416 currently married women, the results of this study suggest that having one or more sons in the family is the principal predictor of the desired family size. Yet another important predictor is the education of the wife which plays a critical role in the family size determination. The study shows that the preferences for family size do not vary greatly between urban and rural areas."""
15571115	0	a	The authors used a standardized questionnaire to survey 201 international and 193 German students at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, to determine differences in health practices between the 2 groups and to identify targets for health-promoting interventions. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that long-term female international students (those whose duration of residency in Germany was more than 2 years) had lower levels of physical activity and alcohol consumption than their German counterparts and higher rates of smoking independently associated with international citizenship. Short-term international female students were less likely than German students to receive social support. Among men, long-term international student status was associated with daily smoking and inconsistent seat belt use, whereas short-term student status was associated with a lower rate of seat belt use, a higher level of perceived stress, and a healthier diet, compared with domestic students. Findings from the study could give rise to health-promotion activities for international students at German universities; additional studies at other European universities are necessary before making further recommendations.
6338092	1	a	"Studies in age-related cognitive changes do not necessarily take into account the clinical and social phenomena associated with age that may have more effect on cognition than does psychologic senescence. Clinically inapparent biologic deterioration, drugs, mild dementia, and atypically presenting depression may influence cognition. Selection bias may skew the results of studies on the elderly when control groups are made up of undergraduates or of ""normal"" elderly whose normality is taken for granted rather than verified. The epiphenomena of aging, such as retirement, social isolation, and bereavement, which are not inherent in the aging process, influence cognition, as do labeling and learned helplessness. Laboratory-based tests of cognition may not sufficiently resemble real-life conditions to have validity. Future research will be shaped by how we conceptualize the relation between aging and intellectual function."

19770127	0	a	BACKGROUND: This study explores the current patterns of reproductive health service use among young women in the USA and the changing influence of socio-demographic factors on the types of services used over time. METHODS: The study population, drawn from the two last cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth, consists of women aged 15-24 (n = 2543 in 1995, n = 2157 in 2002). We examined trends in use of 'contraceptive services' and 'other reproductive health services for preventive care' and tested for changes in the patterns of use of these services over time. Logistic regression models were used to further clarify the factors associated with the use of the two types of services in 2002. RESULTS: Results show no difference in the overall use of reproductive health services in the past year but did reveal changes in the type of service sought. Use of services for contraception increased by 10 percentage points (39.3% in 1995 to 49.7% in 2002, P < 0.001), although the use of other services remained stable (53.2% in 1995, 50.2% in 2002, P = 0.14). The patterns of use varied over time, exhibiting growing social disparities. In 2002, the use of contraceptive services depended on women's age, number of partners, personal and mother's level of education, and menstrual problems. The use of other reproductive health services for preventive care varied across women's socio-economic background. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates increasing social differentials in the use of reproductive health services for preventive care among young women in the USA between 1995 and 2002, a finding which calls for careful monitoring in the context of limited resources.
3705997	1	a	Forty-five severely obese patients were treated with jaw fixation as a means of initiating weight loss. Patients who reported eating for consolation showed significantly greater difficulties in maintaining the achieved weight loss than the others. This finding constitutes further evidence of a relationship between obesity and depression. Low capacity to experience feelings of aggressiveness also seems to be linked to poor treatment results.
15144483	0	a	This paper categorizes multiracial youth (N=1,496) ages 14 to 19 and compares them with each other and with monoracial youth on identity development measures. The multiracial categories used here are derived from youths' reports of their own and their parents' race(s). Comparisons are made within groups of multiracial respondents who make different choices among single-race categories. Results show differences between subgroups in strength and importance of ethnic identity, self-esteem, and perceptions of ethnic discrimination. Multinomial logistic regression shows further that physiognomy, ethnic identity, and race of coresident parent(s) are significantly associated with reported race. Also related to racial identification among part-Hispanic youth are the racial distribution and socioeconomic status of their neighborhoods and the racial distributions of their schools.
7355038	1	a	The relationship of psychosocial adjustment, family functioning, self-esteem, and diabetic control was studied in 20 latency-aged diabetic children and their parents. Moderate to severe adjustment problems were found in 11 (55%) of the patients. Child self-esteem, parental self-esteem, and family functioning, as scored by standard instruments, were all significantly greater in the group of children considered to be well-adjusted as compared to the maladjusted group (P less than .05 to .001). Of these, parental self-esteem appeared to correlate most closely with the child's adjustment. Twenty-four-hour urinary glucose excretion was two- to threefold greater in maladjusted as compared to well-adjusted patients (71 +/- 20 vs 20 +/- 5 gm, P less than .05). These data suggest that psychosocial adjustment problems frequently occur in latency-aged children with diabetes, are associated with poorer chemical control, and require a family-centered approach to intervention and management.
3686078	1	a	Lifestyles of groups and individuals are significant determinants of the health status of a population. Behaviour with respect to such areas as alcohol, food, drugs, tobacco, physical exercise, etc., correlates with medical and social well-being and are thus on the agenda for modern health care. The present article reports a study of how such lifestyle habits, notably alcohol and tobacco consumption, are addressed in medical consultations. The results indicate that the areas of smoking and drinking are sensitive and that specific communicative strategies are used for introducing these topics and for eliciting information. Smoking habits are addressed in 75% of the consultations and alcohol habits in 30%. In most cases, the information exchanged is shallow and gives only a fragmentary picture of patients' habits. There is little evidence of attempts to influence patients' attitudes and behaviours and the physicians do not contextualise possible relationships between such lifestyle habits and health in the light of their medical knowledge. In this sense, a potentially very influential face-to-face encounter is not used as a vehicle for attempting to eliminate such significant causes of poor health.
12975677	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Senescence for some elderly people is a phase of with development and satisfaction, whereas for others is a negative stage of life. The determinants of a good quality of life in old age vary from person to person. The aims of this study were to identify 1) the prevalence of octogenarian people who evaluate their current life as being mainly characterized by a positive quality and 2) which were the domains that they identified as being the determinants of this positive quality. A same parallel study was conducted with subjects who evaluated senescence as a preponderantly negative experience. METHODS: A random and representative sample of 35% of the octogenarian people, living residing in the community, was selected among the dwellers of the city of Veranopolis, state of Rio Grande do Sul. A semi-structured questionnaire on quality of life quality was applied as well as the scale of depressive symptoms Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the index of general health Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). RESULTS: Slightly more than half of the studied sample (57%) defined their current quality of life with positive evaluations, whereas 18% presented a negative evaluation of it. A group 0f 25% defined their current lives as neutral or having both values (positive and negative). Those who were dissatisfied presented more health problems according to the CIRS and more depressive symptoms when evaluated by the GDS. Satisfied subjects ones had different reasons to justify this state, however, the dissatisfied had mainly the lack of health as a reason for their suffering. The main source of reported daily well-being was the involvement with rural or domestic activities. Among the interviewed, lack of health was the main source for not presenting well-being, although there was interpersonal variability regarding what each subject considered as loss of health. CONCLUSION: Possibly, for the elderly subjects a negative quality of life is equivalent to loss of health and a positive life quality is equivalent to a greater range of categories such as activity, income, social life and relationship with the family, categories which differed from subject to subject. Therefore, health seems to be a good indicator of negative quality of life, though an insufficient indicator of successful elderliness.
18194525	0	a	BACKGROUND: Considering the high costs of sick leave and the consequences of sick leave for employees, an early return-to-work of employees with mental disorders is very important. Therefore, a workplace intervention is developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for employees with low back pain. The objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of one year. Employees eligible for this study are on sick leave for 2 to 8 weeks with common mental disorders. The workplace intervention will be compared with usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise approach that aims to reach consensus about a return-to-work plan by active participation and strong commitment of both the sick-listed employee and the supervisor. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome of this study is lasting return-to-work, which will be acquired from continuous registration systems of the companies after the follow-up. Secondary outcomes are total number of days of sick leave during the follow-up, severity of common mental disorders, coping style, job content, and attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal perspective. A process evaluation will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: Return-to-work is difficult to discuss in the workplace for sick-listed employees with mental disorders and their supervisors. Therefore, this intervention offers a unique opportunity for the sick-listed employee and the supervisor to discuss barriers for return-to-work. Results of this study will possibly contribute to improvement of disability management for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Results will become available in 2009. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN92307123.
11814157	0	a	"OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to assess: (1) child health nurses' identification of abuse/neglect of children of preschool age in their districts; (2) overall prevalence of abuse/neglect according to the nurses; (3) determinants of nurse identification; (4) determinants of nurse-reported district prevalences; and (5) determinants of reporting to the child protection services (CPS). METHOD: Questionnaires were mailed to about 3,000 child health centers. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent responded. Of these, 22% identified no case and 33% at least one (mostly five or fewer). The overall prevalence was 1.4%. Identification correlated with general participation rate in the county. Other determinants of identification were acquaintance with the district, large district populations, and three variables assumed to reflect a personal interest. Determinants of prevalences were small district populations, regular contacts with the social services, and two personal interest variables. With large district populations, identification increased, whereas prevalences decreased. Only 30.3% had made a report to the CPS. Regular contacts with the social services correlated with reporting. Personal interest was a determinant of the decision to report, and acquaintance with the district a determinant of reporting rate. CONCLUSIONS: Abuse and neglect did not appear as priorities for the Child Health Services. The method probably led to an underestimation of the true prevalence. Personal interest and social services contacts emerged as important determinants. However, the assumed criteria of ""interest"" were not validated. For effective identification, no nurse should be responsible for more than 400 to 500 children. Implications for practice and research are discussed."
17876483	0	a	More than any other low- and middle-income country, Brazil has the longest research tradition of establishing, maintaining and exploiting birth cohort studies. This research pedigree is highlighted in the present issue of the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, which contains a series of twelve papers from the Ribeirao Preto and Sao Luis birth cohort studies from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, respectively. The topics covered in this raft of reports vary and include predictors of perinatal health and maternal risk factors, early life determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in childhood and adolescence, use of health services, and a description of dietary characteristics of young adults, amongst other topics. There is also a guide to the background, objectives, sampling and protocols employed across these studies, which, together with similar pieces published in past issues of the Brazilian Journal, serve as a very useful starting point, particularly for potential collaborators. In the fervent hope that further follow-up of these cohorts will take place--we provide our own justification for cohort maintenance and extension in this issue--future data collection could include: genetic material, atherosclerosis, ascertained, for instance, by intima-media thickness, and IQ testing in children--scores from which are emerging as potentially important predictors of adult health outcomes up to six decades later.
12774653	0	a	Epidemiology is a core science of public health, focusing on research related to the distribution and determinants of both positive and adverse health states and events and on application of knowledge gained to improve public health. The American College of Epidemiology (ACE) is a professional organization devoted to the professional practice of epidemiology. As part of that commitment, and in response to concerns for more explicit attention to core values and duties of epidemiologists in light of emerging issues and increased scrutiny of epidemiology, the College developed, adopted, and published a set of Ethics Guidelines. The structure of the ACE ethics guidelines is in four parts: (1) a brief statement of core values and duties of epidemiologists, coupled with the virtues important to professional practice; (2) concise statements of key duties and obligations; (3) exposition of the duties and obligations with more applications; and (4) a brief summary and conclusion. The Guidelines have been published on the ACE website and in the official College journal Annals of Epidemiology. The guidelines contain (and maintain) core elements that define the discipline of epidemiology and its fundamental duties, but they are also intended to be dynamic and evolving, responsive to a changing professional and social environment.
15578812	0	a	AIM: To examine infant growth characteristics and their socio-demographic determinants in Severodvinsk, northwest Russia. METHODS: Length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length Z-scores of 1,067 infants born in 1999-2000 in Severodvinsk were calculated on the basis of the data on the length and weight obtained from the medical files. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate independent effects of maternal age, education, occupation, marital status, weight, parity, sex of the baby, and breastfeeding duration on infant growth. RESULTS: At the age of 12 months, 1.1% of the infants were stunted, 1.1% underweight, and 0.5% wasted in comparison with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 reference population. The mean Z-scores for length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length were 0.48+/-0.93, 0.38+/-1.04, and 0.65+/-1.03, respectively. Mean weight-for-length Z-scores considerably increased from birth to 12 months, while length-for-age Z-score remained largely unchanged. In regression analysis, length-for-age Z-scores were lower by 0.43 (p=0.028) and by 0.30 (p<0.001) in infants born to mothers with basic and unknown education, respectively. Positive trends between linear growth and maternal age (p=0.027) and education (p=0.024) were observed. No social variations in weight-for-length Z-scores were found. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting were lower than previously reported from Russia, which may reflect good overall socio-economic conditions in the town. Social variations in linear growth indicate the existence of inequalities in infant health, which may further increase with age.

2802928	1	a	Using a subsample from the Copenhagen schizophrenia high-risk project, we examined the contributions of schizophrenic genetic liability and perinatal complications to computed tomographic (CT) measurements of ventricular enlargement and cortical and cerebellar abnormalities. A factor analysis of six CT measurements yielded two significant factors. One factor reflected multisite neural deficits as evidenced by abnormality of the cerebellar vermis and widening of the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures and cortical sulci. The other factor reflected periventricular damage as evidenced by enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Because all of the subjects had schizophrenic mothers, the major source of genetic variation is contributed by the diagnostic status of their fathers. In a stepwise multiple-regression analysis, it was determined that the multisite neural deficits factor was significantly related to genetic risk for schizophrenia (as measured by schizophrenia spectrum illness in the subjects' fathers) but was unrelated to pregnancy or delivery complications or to weight at birth. Periventricular damage was highly and significantly correlated with the number of complications suffered at delivery, but only among subjects with an elevated genetic risk. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the two types of CT abnormalities in schizophrenia may reflect partially independent processes based on different combinations of genetic and perinatal influences.
6504868	1	a	Preventive and therapeutic advances have brought life expectancy in the United States to well over 70 years and have shifted mortality causes from acute to chronic diseases, the determinants of which are genetics, lifestyle, the environment, and aging itself. Plausible approaches to chronic disease prevention are likely to increase longevity further, with some foreseeable effects on demographic and economic projections. Primarily, longevity advances would swell forecasts of population size, and would thus have to be met by production advances in order to maintain or improve living standards. This study, a restricted example, considers the probable demographic and economic consequences of a limited prevention program in the context of the Ford Motor Company, based on actual experience and certain expectations up to the year 2000. According to the results, prevention would reduce outlays for life insurance, disability, and health care, but would also generate the higher costs of extending pension plans. Undoubtedly, prevention will continue to be highly ranked in society's pursuit of happiness, and society must prepare to meet its effects with appropriate social and economic policies.
6584748	1	a	Maori mortality is compared with that of other New Zealanders aged 15-64 in the period 1974 to 1978. For males, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the Maori excess in mortality is associated with marked ethnic differences in socio-economic status. Of the remaining excess, an estimated 15% is linked with cigarette smoking, 10% with alcohol consumption (excluding accidental cause of deaths), 5% with obesity and 17% was due to accidents. However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris. It is recommended that resources should be allocated so that Maori people can be employed to maintain contact with Maori patients with these diseases in order to improve health services utilisation and compliance with therapy. While it was not possible to determine socio-economic status for females from national mortality data, other findings were similar to those found for males except that mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease also contributed to the Maori excess.
3791024	1	a	The present study documented later developmental outcome in a group of 29 failure-to-thrive (FTT) infants who received extended hospitalization in infancy as an intervention for their growth failure. All infants were seen at approximately 3 years of age and were given standardized assessments of intellectual and physical development. A standard interview documented demographic variables, health problems, placements subsequent to hospitalization and additional psychological and medical treatment. Infants were divided into three groups dependent on medical and treatment factors. Means and percentages of occurrence of outcome variables were compared through either one-way ANOVAS or single sample chi-square tests with post hoc analyses. Correlational analyses were used to understand the relationships between outcome and relevant demographic, medical, and treatment variables. In general, the infants manifest persistent intellectual delays at follow-up despite maintenance of weight gains achieved during early hospitalization. More than half the group suffered from chronic health problems. A large percentage of infants had been removed from parental custody at the time of follow-up. Several demographic, medical, and treatment factors bore moderate relationships to developmental outcome. Infants who achieved more optimal growth tended to be full-term at birth, later born and without a question of physical abuse in their social histories. Intellectual functioning was related only to parental and caretaker socioeconomic status. Infants placed in foster care were unlikely to return to their families of origin. The findings suggest the need for further investigation into the determinants and outcome of extended hospitalization as a treatment for FTT.
17929613	0	a	BACKGROUND: The term Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) has been used since the 1980s. NORCs are defined as communities where people remain or move to when they retire. NORCs develop 'naturally', meaning that seniors tend to remain or move there when they retire, although the residences and physical environment were not constructed for a senior population. The term, Healthy-NORC, has been introduced and is associated with healthy aging. OBJECTIVES/METHODS: We describe how demographic trends will facilitate a dramatic growth in NORCs. Acknowledging the 'Determinants of Health' model, we suggest that some determinants impact people differently at different ages. We also suggest that more attention be focused on the impact of physical/social environments on health, and that some determinants of health are particularly relevant for seniors. We argue that NORCs exist on a spectrum, from NORC to H-NORC, and that health benefits for seniors increase as NORCs adopt additional characteristics associated with improved senior health. We also illustrate H-NORC research methods and policy options for local governments. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Compared to the provision of additional medical and social services, H-NORCs represent a low-cost approach to facilitating healthy aging. Municipal governments can promote healthy aging and should pursue policies that will stimulate H-NORC development.
7287277	1	a	The linear regression procedure of stepwise elimination has been used to examine the association between a range of environmental variables and infant mortality rates (IMR) in Sri Lanka. The nature of the water supply was found to be significantly associated with IMR. Latrines were significantly associated with IMR once qualitative differences between districts were allowed for. Other 'environmental determinants of health', 3 indices of housing quality and the presence of electricity supplies, were not significant. The cost of effecting changes in IMR by extending subsidies to water supply improvements is estimated.
3071406	1	a	In this presentation, physical appearance has been considered an inseparable part of daily human existence. Relevant aspects of research in social psychology on interpersonal attraction and personality theory stressing narcissistic vulnerability were reviewed. General systems theory was proposed as a theoretical framework from which to view the multifactorial aspects of the psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness. In support of this proposition, the contemporary use of systems thinking in medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family therapy, and the understanding of emotions was stressed. Emotional reactions to the evaluations of physical appearance by self and others were shown to be inevitable, involving appraisal and feedback processes affecting different systems in the person's life. The person's self-image and self-esteem were stressed as underlying determinants of outcome in health and in illness. Finally, we hope to have communicated our belief that in the present, as a way of integrating and summarizing the knowledge obtained in the specialized fields, systems thinking allows for more creative and successful treatment outcomes.
6539156	1	a	"A majority of cases of failure to thrive (FTT) do not have a known organic etiology. Social and psychological determinants are sought for these ""non-organic failure to thrive"" (N-O FTT) cases. Social and psychological differences between non-organic and organic cases are also explored here. With the introduction of the term, ""maternal deprivation,"" medical practitioners have implicated mothers' deficiencies as instrumental in the etiology of N-O FTT. However, these mothers are themselves usually deprived. Lack of cooperation in childcare by both parents is noted when classic clinical cases are reviewed. We suggest that the concept, ""parental deprivation,"" provides a more accurate model. Preliminary research findings support our hypothesis that mothers of FTT infants do not have good social support networks. Teen motherhood and socioeconomic status also appear to be important, but not necessary as determinants. An unexpected finding is that there are few differences in the social deficiencies of families of N-O FTT infants as compared to those failing for organic reasons. Two unanticipated findings appear noteworthy. First, infants failing for organic reasons are significantly smaller and thinner at birth, independent of pregnancy complications or prematurity. Second, infants failing for non-organic reasons are more likely to present during the period of infant-caretaker role development and less likely in the later toddler stage. Additional research into the feasibility of strengthening family supports as a basis of intervention is recommended."
3615304	1	a	Alcohol use by teenagers is a widespread and well-documented behavior in many Western nations. In contrast, very little is known about the drinking habits and attitudes toward alcohol of teenagers in the world's developing countries. In this paper we propose that adolescents learn about alcohol as part of the socialization process, just as they learn other social behaviors. Central to this learning is the development of a set of expectancies within one's culture about the effects of alcohol upon the user. These expectancies are important determinants of subsequent drinking behavior. An understanding of the sociocultural environment in which these expectancies develop, and in which teenage drinking occurs, is essential for developing intervention strategies aimed at promoting responsible alcohol use and avoiding alcohol-related problems among young people.
15053395	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To establish the relationship between seroprevalence for antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi and its relationship with biotic and abiotic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between August 2000 and September 2001. The study population consisted of a simple random sample of 390 volunteers residing in Palmar de Bravo, Puebla, Mexico. Sample and data collection procedures included assaying antibodies against T. cruzi with validated assays, and searching for domestic reservoirs and triatomine bugs. The relationship between biotic and abiotic factors with seropositivity was assessed. Statistical analysis was conducted using Kappa values for diagnostic tests; statistical significance was assessed with 2 x 2 tables, chi-squared test with Yates' correction, Fisher exact test, and odds ratios. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in humans was 4%; in domestic reservoirs (horses, pigs, and dogs) only 10% of canine reservoirs were positive. Vector species recognized were T. borberi and T. pallidipennis, with a Dispersion Area Index and a Colonization Index of 55% and 40%, respectively. The most important risk factors associated with positive serology were altitude (>2,150 and <2,180 meters above sea level), presence of triatomines, age, time of residence, and participation in a social assistance program. CONCLUSIONS: T. cruzi infection was identified in human beings, vectors, and possibly in domestic reservoirs, in communities located over 2,000 meters above sea level.
6139036	1	a	A community sample of older adults was investigated to test some of the current hypothesis about the etiology of depression in the elderly. Multiple regression analysis showed that cognitive disturbances (memory, concentration), previous depressive episodes, and somatic health problems accounted for most of the etiological variance. Other variables, like stressful life events, financial problems, social isolation, alcohol use, age, sex, and previous somatic illnesses are significant but their numerical values are very small. Etiological insignificant were the variables: physical activities, competency in daily living, and support by ones own children.
15797980	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic illness with an unpredictable and variable course, profoundly affects the quality of life (QOL). General health questionnaires are used to assess QOL in SLE, but a disease-specific instrument could offer enhanced responsiveness and content validity. We detail the steps we took to develop and validate a new SLE-specific QOL instrument, SLEQOL. METHODS: Rheumatology professionals nominated items that they felt were important determinants of QOL of SLE patients. One hundred SLE patients were asked to assess the importance and frequency of occurrence of these items and to suggest those that had not been listed. Item reduction was performed using Rasch model and factor analyses to create a new questionnaire in English. This final questionnaire was administered to a cohort of 275 patients to study its psychometric properties. RESULTS: Fifty-one items covering a wide range of QOL concerns were identified. The patients' responses led to the elimination of 11. The new questionnaire of 40 items was found to have Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 and to consist of eight domains covering physical, mental and social QOL issues. It has good test-retest reliability, poor to fair cross-sectional correlation with the SF-36, with poor correlation with lupus activity or damage indices. The SLEQOL was more responsive to change than the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new 40-item SLEQOL in English and showed that it is valid for use in SLE patients in Singapore. It offers better content validity and responsiveness to change than the SF-36.
10881208	0	a	Epidemiologic studies in the general population and those based on the clinical assessment of schizophrenic populations have revealed a high degree of overlap between schizophrenia and addictive disorders. The abuse of psychoactive substances (including alcohol) throughout life is so frequent (50%) that the possibility of a specific link inevitably arises. Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain the high co-morbidity between schizophrenia and addiction: 1) The social-environmental hypothesis has been developed but studies have provided poor evidence to validate it. 2) The possible shared biological vulnerability between schizophrenia and addictions led researchers to explore common genetic determinants and study the involvement of the dopaminergic and opioid systems in the aetiology of both schizophrenia and the abuse of and dependence on psychoactive drugs. 3) Finally, the theory of self-medication suggests that schizophrenics may be attempting to counter the deficit linked to their disorders by using the substances they take or their dependency-type behaviour to cope with their emotional problems. The clinical profile of schizophrenic addicts does seem to display some distinctive features, such as the high level of depressive co-morbidity, very high nicotine and alcohol dependence, with a very poor prognosis. These patients are difficult to manage; the possibility of pharmacologic interactions between the substances they are taking and neuroleptic medication calls for prudence, and their compliance is also poor. Addictive disorders in schizophrenics are currently a topic of active research intended to lead to identifying specific treatments. The early identification of addictive disorders in schizophrenics should make it possible to limit their development and improve the prognosis.
19514604	0	a	INTRODUCTION: Several studies show that nursing is, by its very nature, an occupation exposed to a high degree of stress. The main aims of the present research were to analyze the presence and to identify occupational stress factors and assess stress levels among nurses in clinical/hospital settings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research was conducted as a cross-sectional study. The sample included nurses (n=205) employed in different settings, who were also control groups to each other. Expanded Nursing Stress Scale and an additional questionnaire created for the purpose of this investigation were used as research instruments. RESULTS: The results show that stressful situations, in the psychological occupational environment are the greatest stress factors regardless of the workplace: in regard to sociodemographic determinants, married nurses have significantly higher average values as compared to unmarried ones (p<0.05), and the values statistically significantly lower in nurses under 30 years of age, with less than 10 years of work experience (p<0.01). Workload is a potential stress factor from the physical environment, whereas average values of this stress factor highly statistically differ in regard to the workplace (p<0.01). Nurses working in settings without support from their superiors and engaged in inter-professional conflicts, especially between nurses and physicians, face a great problem. CONCLUSION: It is important to promote conditions of work (work space, providing new equipment), organization of work, as well as social relationships, which is in accordance with the recommendations of ICN.
11404202	0	a	Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) continue to be a significant and prevalent problem among adolescents. One in four sexually active teenagers are infected with one or more STDs. Certain STDs, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and possibly human papillomavirus infections have the highest prevalence in this age group. The determinants of risk for STDs in adolescence encompass a range of behavioral, biological, and social factors. This review focuses on the skin signs of STDs in adolescents. Recognition of these findings is important since they may represent the most prominent, earliest, or only evidence of an STD. The recognition of the non-AIDs STDs has the added importance of identifying a population at high risk for HIV infection. Although recent data suggest encouraging trends in sexual risk behaviors among high school students in the United States, great challenges remain in the efforts to expand primary and secondary prevention strategies for STDs in adolescents. Expertise in the recognition and treatment of STDs in adolescents remains important for clinicians who care for adolescents.
11410405	0	a	The major skeletal determinants of fracture risk are bone mass and postmenopausal bone loss with gradual destruction of trabecular bone architecture. Therefore, the management of osteoporosis is to prevent bone loss after menopause in women below 60 years of age. We need a screening test of bone mineral density (BMD) with the ability to identify correctly individuals with accelerated bone loss; unnecessary treatment has to be avoided. But without measurable extraskeletal factors, no technique assessing BMD as single test has the reasonable high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of fast bone losers. It is on principle the repeated volumetric bone measurement--within 12 months--in the pure trabecular bone, especially at distal radius of the non-dominant arm with the peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), being able to detect accurately the individuals as fast bone losers with trabecular bone loss > 8 mg/cm3 or > 3.5% per year (prevalence about 35%). Only women with very high trabecular BMD (in highest quintile) have no risk for osteoporosis.
7076787	1	a	Mortality from ischemic heart disease has declined sharply since the mid 1960's in the United States and several other industrialized nations. The causes of this decline have thus far not been established. Six major strategies for investigating determinants of ischemic heart disease mortality trends are discussed in this review: (1) analyses of mortality data; (2) morbidity surveillance; (3) surveillance of change in medical care; (4) surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors; (5) social and ecological surveillance; (6) experimental and quasi-experimental community approaches. The rationale, problems and limitations of each are discussed.
12027273	0	a	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to characterise the epidemiological and nutritional transition and their determinants in Mexico. DESIGN: Age-adjusted standardised mortality rates (SMRs) due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), diabetes mellitus and hypertension were calculated for 1980-1998. Changes in the prevalences of overweight and obesity in women and children and of dietary intake from 1988 to 1999 were also used in the analysis. Quantities of food groups purchased by adult equivalent (AE) and food expenditures away from home between 1984 and 1989 were used to assess trends. All information was analysed at the national and regional levels, and by urban and rural areas. RESULTS: SMR for diabetes, AMI and hypertension increased dramatically parallel to obesity at the national and regional levels. Fat intake in women and the purchase of refined carbohydrates, including soda, also increased. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that obesity is playing a role in the increased SMRs of diabetes, AMI and hypertension in Mexico. Total energy dietary intake and food purchase data could not explain the rise in the prevalence of obesity. The increases in fat intake and the purchase of refined carbohydrates may be risk factors for increased mortality. Information on physical activity was not available. CONCLUSION: SMRs due to diabetes, hypertension and AMI have increased dramatically in parallel with the prevalence of obesity; therefore actions should be taken for the prevention of obesity. Reliable information about food consumption and physical activity is required to assess their specific roles in the aetiology of obesity.

12200506	0	a	Most studies of psychopathology following disasters are concerned with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present analyses sought to assess the rate and determinants of depression in adult survivors of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia. Unlike previous studies of earthquakes, the present analyses derive from a well-defined cohort of survivors who underwent diagnostic interviewing to characterize psychiatric morbidity. As part of a cohort study of 32,743 survivors of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, a stratified population sample of 1,785 persons was interviewed about 2 years following the disaster using a special questionnaire based on the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Disaster Interview Schedule/Disaster Supplement. 52% met the criteria for major depression. Of these, a total of 177 cases of depression with no other psychiatric diagnosis or comorbidity were compared with 583 controls from the same interviewed group who did not fulfill the criteria for any psychiatric disorder. Cases and controls were compared as to data obtained independently at the aftermath of the disaster on a number of exposures and characteristics related to the earthquake. More of the cases involved females (odds ratio [OR] for males 0.7 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-0.9]) and from the city of Gumri, which had some of the worst destruction (OR for residents of Gumri 5.9 [95% CI 4.0-8.8]). Being with someone in the same building at the moment of the earthquake was protective for depression (OR for presence of other people 0.5 [95% CI 0.3-0.6]), and the risk of depression increased with the amount of loss that the family sustained as a result of the earthquake (OR for highest level of loss 2.5 [95% CI 1.3-4.8]). The use of alcohol was protective for depression (OR for those who drink 0.5 [95% CI 0.3-0.8]). In various models of multivariate adjustment and analysis, the increased risk of depression with loss, geographic location, and female gender was maintained. Also, being with someone during the disaster, receiving assistance and support after the earthquake, and alcohol use were protective for depression in these multivariate analyses. Depression is a common sequel to an earthquake. As with our previous study of PTSD, we were able to relate intensity of the disaster and loss to the risk of depression in a general population sample. The role of social support during and after the disaster as a protective mechanism against adverse psychological outcome was highlighted again. Whereas alcohol use in our previous study was not related to PTSD outcome, it is noteworthy that in the present analyses it emerged as a protective factor for depression.
6986089	1	a	The psychiatric emergency ward has become a primary entry point into the network of mental health services for people who need help to cope with their problems of living. It is also the only source of treatment for many chronically mentally ill patients living in the community. The authors critically review the literature on emergency psychiatric services, focusing on the ways these services are used, the atmosphere in the emergency room, and the determinants of disposition decision making. On the basis of their research, they suggest a model for emergency services that includes an evaluation of the patient's and his on her community's resources and competence and minimizes subtle diagnostic considerations.
19241491	0	a	OBJECTIVE: As a first step in planning interventions to promote exercise in rural breast cancer survivors (BCS), we sought to determine the exercise preferences of rural BCS and to identify the major determinants of these preferences. METHODS: Self-administered mail survey to a population-based sample from a state cancer registry. RESULTS: Among the 483 respondents, 96% were White with mean education of 13+/-2.5 years and mean months since diagnosis of 39.0+/-21.5. Only 19% reported >or=150 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. Although up to half were open to various counseling options, the most popular options were counseling after treatment (36%), face-to-face (47%), and from an exercise specialist (40%). Rural BCS preferred home-based (63%), unsupervised (47%), moderate intensity exercise (65%) that was primarily walking. The strongest preference correlates include higher education with exercise specialist, higher environment score with outdoors, more comorbidities with low intensity and counseling after cancer treatment, higher social support with exercising with friends or family, sedentary or insufficient physical activity with low intensity, and lower household income with preferring supervised exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions designed to promote exercise among rural BCS are needed. Such interventions should consider the environmental aspects of this population and include multiple options based on the preferences of targeted subgroups.
7190778	1	a	The critical determinants of extended diurnal death feigning were assessed in a refinement experiment in which visual and tactile cues during rearing and/or testing were systematically eliminated. Ninety-five domestic chicks were reared in either a social environment or physical (tactile) isolation, and half in each rearing condition were reared and/or tested under conditions of visual restriction. As expected, social rearing was prerequisite to the manifestation of extended death feigning; however, the incidence and duration of death-feigning was attenuated by functional visual isolation of socially reared chicks during either rearing or testing. It was concluded that visual novelty of the environment is the minimal condition for sustained death feigning by young chicks in the daylight hours.
18022299	0	a	This research explored the relationships between race/ethnicity and area factors affecting access to health care in the United States. The study represents an advance on previous research in this field because, in addition to including data on rurality, it incorporates additional contextual covariates describing aspects of health care accessibility. Individual-level data were obtained from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The county of residence reported by BRFSS respondents was used to link BRFSS data with county-level measures of health care access from the 2004 Area Resource File (ARF). Analyses of mammography were limited to women aged 40 years with known county of residence (n=91,492). Analyses of Pap testing were limited to women aged 18 years with no history of hysterectomy and known county of residence (n=97,820). In addition to individual-level covariates such as race, Hispanic ethnicity, health insurance coverage and routine physical exam in the previous year. We examined county-level covariates (residence in health professional shortage area, urban/rural continuum, racial/ethnic composition, and number of health centers/clinics, mammography screening centers, primary care physicians, and obstetrician-gynecologists per 100,000 female population or per 1000 square miles) as predictors of cancer screening. Both individual-level and contextual covariates are associated with the use of breast and cervical cancer screening. In the current study, covariates associated with health care access, such as health insurance coverage, household income, Black race, and percentage of county female population who were non-Hispanic Black, were important determinants of screening use. In multivariate analysis, we found significant interactions between individual-level covariates and contextual covariates. Among women who reside in areas with lower primary care physician supply, rural women are less likely than urban women to have had a recent Pap test. Black women were more likely than White women to have had a recent Pap test. Women with a non-rural county of residence were more likely to have had a recent mammogram than rural women. A significant interaction was also found between individual-level race and number of health centers or clinics per 100,000 population (p-value=0.0187). In counties with 2 or more health centers or clinics per 100,000 female population, Black women were more likely than White women to have had a recent mammogram. A significant interaction was also observed between the percentage of county female population who were Hispanic and the percentage who were non-Hispanic Black.
3811601	1	a	In the context of the first Swiss National Health Survey preventive health behaviour was tested in 3419 Swiss citizens aged over 20 years. A health behaviour index including favourable health attitudes and good utilization of preventive health services was correlated with different social indicators. Age, sex and a good self-rated health were the most important factors associated with a high preventive health behaviour score. Education showed a less strong but also significant influence on positive health behaviour. Overall utilization of health services decreased with high preventive health behavior index.
11398960	0	a	Until there is an effective vaccine, changing sexual behavior (e.g., use of condoms or fewer partners) is still the only course of action that can slow the spread of HIV for most Africans. But exactly which factors influence behavior change and how are still debated. This article examines the notion that as the HIV/AIDS epidemic strengthens and spreads through communities in Africa, and mortality mounts, behaviors that prevent transmission should be changing. We focus on men in three countries--Uganda, Kenya, and Zambia--examining determinants of their behavior change, and analyze the relative importance of knowing someone who has died of AIDS as compared with other factors such as age, education level, knowledge of HIV/AIDS, economic status, and marital status. Data from three DHS surveys in Uganda (1995), Zambia (1996), and Kenya (1998) are fitted to a model predicting behavior change. Results from this cross-sectional, multinational study suggest that married and working men aged 20-40 are significantly more likely to have changed their behavior. Personal experience of AIDS is a significant predictor of behavior change in Uganda and Zambia, and is marginally significant in Kenya. One implication in the context of the epidemic is that behavior change is partly determined by the high level of mortality experienced by African communities. A second implication is that higher levels of disclosure, or lower levels of denial of AIDS as a cause of death, may help individuals change their behavior.
12604477	0	a	"The author traces the development of the concept of health promotion from 1980s policies of the World Health Organization. Two approaches that signify the modernization of public health are outlined in detail: the European Health for All targets and the settings approach. Both aim to reorient health policy priorities from a risk factor approach to strategies that address the determinants of health and empower people to participate in improving the health of their communities. These approaches combine classic public health dictums with ""new"" strategies, some setting explicit goals to integrate public health with general welfare policy. Health for All, health promotion, and population health have contributed to this reorientation in thinking and strategy, but the focus of health policy remains expenditure rather than investment."
6882340	1	a	"This study examined the spatial distribution of urine marking by sexually inexperienced male rats under six odor conditions: minimum odor (baseline), conspecific male urine, conspecific female urine, an animal's own urine, male gerbil urine, and amyl acetate. The gerbil urine and amyl acetate conditions were included to test the theory that marking, rather than being elicited by and directed as a display to appropriate conspecifics, occurred to the introduction of any novel or disruptive odor. The subject's own urine was used to test the theory that the animal marked to maintain an optimum level of its own odor in the environment. The results showed that marking was directed predominantly at objects in the environment over which the animal could readily pass. All odor conditions except ""own odor"" sharply increased marking over baseline levels. Marking decreased with repeated exposure to particular stimuli. The results strongly supported the theory that urine marking, at least in sexually inexperienced male rats, is produced by novel odor stimuli introduced into a familiar environment."
18083444	0	a	BACKGROUND: Low educational attainment is a marker of socioeconomic status that correlates strongly with higher death rates from many conditions. No previous studies have analyzed national data to measure the number of deaths associated with lower education among working-aged adults (25-64 years) by race or ethnicity. Furthermore, no previous studies have examined comprehensively the relationship of education to cause-specific and all-cause mortality in the three largest racial or ethnic groups in the United States using national data. METHODS: Age-standardized, race/ethnicity-specific death rates from all causes and the 15 leading causes were measured among men and women aged 25-64 years by level of education based on U.S. national mortality data in 2001. The total number of deaths that potentially could be avoided among people aged 25-64 years was estimated by applying the mortality rates among college graduates (within each 5-year category of age, gender, and race/ethnicity) to each of the less-educated subpopulations. All analyses were performed in 2007. RESULTS: Nearly half (48%) of all deaths among men aged 25-64 years (white, black, and Hispanic), and 38% of all deaths in women would not have occurred in this age range if all segments of the population experienced the death rates of college graduates. Black men and women had the highest death rates from all causes combined and from many specific causes at nearly all levels of education, and the largest average life years lost before age 65 years. However, the total number of deaths associated with low education status was not confined to any single racial group. About 161,280 deaths in whites, 40,840 deaths in blacks, and 13,162 deaths in Hispanics in this age range were associated with educational disparity. CONCLUSIONS: Potentially avoidable factors associated with lower educational status account for almost half of all deaths among working-aged adults in the U.S.; these deaths are not confined to any single racial or ethnic group. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to social determinants of health.
11154248	0	a	STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate ethnic differences in self reported health in the city of Malmo, Sweden, and whether these differences could be explained by psychosocial and economic conditions. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The public health survey in Malmo 1994 was a cross sectional study. A total of 5600 people aged 20-80 years completed a postal questionnaire. The participation rate was 71%. The population was categorised according to country of origin: born in Sweden, other Western countries, Yugoslavia, Poland, Arabic speaking countries and all other countries. The multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model in order to investigate the importance of possible confounders on the differences by country of origin in self reported health. Finally, variables measuring psychosocial and economic conditions were introduced into the model. MAIN RESULTS: The odds ratios of having poor self reported health were significantly higher among men born in other Western countries, Yugoslavia, Arabic speaking countries and in the category all other countries, as well as among women born in Yugoslavia, Poland and all other countries, compared with men and women born in Sweden. The multivariate analysis including age and education did not change these results. A huge reduction of the odds ratios was observed for men and women born in Yugoslavia, Arabic speaking countries and all other countries, and for women born in Poland after the introduction of the social network, social support and economic factors into the multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant ethnic group differences in self reported health. These differences were greatly reduced by psychosocial and economic factors, which suggest that these factors may be important determinants of self rated health in certain minority groups.
12314663	1	a	"Dutch emigrant registration records for the nineteenth century are examined in an effort to shed light on the local circumstances of the Dutch emigration movement. ""Since nineteenth century emigration took place mostly through primary contacts this article will examine the newly established immigrant settlements as 'communities transplanted'...which directs our research to include local municipal records such as population censuses, population registers (which were supplemented after 1861 with registers of in- and out-migration), tax records, and records of vital events like marriage, birth and death registers. The quality and availability of these records vary from place to place, but generally speaking, in the case of the Netherlands, they are of high quality since population registration at the municipal level was required by law. The source of information for the local records are the population registers (Bevolkings Registers) which were originally constructed on the basis of information obtained from the 1850 population census...."""
28466762	1	a	Few studies provide an insight into what factors contributed to declines in the mortality rates of developing countries before the Second World War. In this paper, statistics on causes of death from Cuba, particularly Havana, are used to investigate what may have been some of the principal determinants of mortality decline in the developing world before the arrival of modern drugs and insecticides. Trends in cause-specific mortality are examined in the light of Cuba's social, economic, medical and public health history. The Cuban experience strongly suggests that in this country public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements were largely responsible for initial declines in mortality throughout the first half of the twentieth century. One important finding is that the impact of these reforms and improved nutrition was greatly influenced by prevailing economic conditions. Periods of economic prosperity facilitated declines in mortality; but in times of adversity, the reverse occurred. It appears that during prosperous periods the maintenance and expansion of public health and sanitary facilities were made possible by increased public and private revenues, and that individuals had access to a more abundant diet. The severe economic crisis of the Great Depression had the opposite effect. With the appearance of sulphonamides in the late 1930s, antibiotics, and residual insecticides and other specific measures at the end of the Second World War, the relevance of economic conditions as a determinant of mortality decline diminished. Although this analysis points to the aforementioned trends, the Cuban experience also suggests that other factors enter into the process of declining mortality and that this phenomenon can only be explained as the result of the complex interplay of many forces.
2661131	1	a	Epidemic diseases move in grand cycles, accompanying changes in culture, social organization, and environment. Coronary heart disease (CHD), a mass disease of twentieth century industrialized society, has a predominantly environmental aetiology. Although the major biomedical risk factors appear to have been identified over the past 40 years of epidemiological research, we are not certain why CHD is now on the wane in most Western nations. In Australia, CHD death rates have, since 1968, declined much more in professional and white-collar men than in blue-collar men. Any substantial reduction in CHD rates will require a generalized population shift towards a lower CHD risk profile. Numerically, the greatest gains should come from reducing the CHD risk of the bulk of the population, who are currently at medium risk of CHD. Notions of risk need, in the first instance, to be based on up-to-date knowledge of biomedical risk factors and mechanisms in order to develop optimal intervention strategies. A population-based strategy can be achieved via community education and structural modification of the social environment. The latter approach will require public health research into broader questions of the social-environmental influences on population cardiovascular health: for example, research into the social, political, and economic determinants of national food and nutrition policies; and into the various environmental (including workplace) changes that will facilitate risk-lowering behaviour. Hopefully, intervention strategies in such areas, set within a community development context, will be developed within the incipient National Program for Better Health.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
18569628	0	a	The health burden of environmental exposures, including ambient air pollution and climate-change-related health impacts, is not equally distributed between or within regions and countries. These inequalities are currently receiving increased attention in environmental research as well as enhanced appreciation in environmental policy, where calls for environmental equity are more frequently heard. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 Global Update of the Air Quality Guidelines attempted to address the global-scale inequalities in exposures to air pollution and the burden of diseases due to air pollution. The guidelines stop short, however, of addressing explicitly the inequalities in exposure and adverse health effects within countries and urban areas due to differential distribution of sources of air pollution such as motor vehicles and local industry, and differences in susceptibility to the adverse health effects attributed to air pollution. These inequalities, may, however, be addressed in local air quality and land use management decisions. Locally, community-based participatory research can play an important role in documenting potential inequities and fostering corrective action. Research on environmental inequities will also benefit from current efforts to (1) better understand social determinants of health and (2) apply research evidence to reduce health disparities. Similarly, future research and policy action will benefit from stronger linkages between equity concerns related to health consequences of both air pollution exposure and climate change, since combustion products are important contributors to both of these environmental problems.
4076484	1	a	This paper has analyzed a theoretical model of mobility decision-making. The model relies entirely on individual-level factors rather than macro-level factors as determinants of migration decision-making. The individual-level variables included in the model are: recent mobility history, urban social contacts, information about urban areas, evaluations of different locations, migration plans, and actual movements in the period subsequent to an initial interview. The empirical results indicate that with some exceptions there are relatively strong links of the type suggested in the model among these variables. The model was evaluated separately for two groups of villages for movement to Bangkok and for movement to Northeast Thai towns. Thus, four submodels were estimated, providing an opportunity to observe how robust the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins. Although certain differences are found among the four submodels, the overwhelming feature is their similarity. Where differences do exist, they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process. Clearly, a villager's previous history of movement is a key factor affecting subsequent movement and the entire decision-making process. The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center. Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans. Except in one submodel, evaluations have a significant effect on plans; and the existence of plans--which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts, information, and evaluations--is the only factor other than previous mobility which has a significant direct effect on subsequent movement. Thai policy makers are searching for ways to stimulate the growth of regional urban growth centers and reduce the growth of Bangkok. From the standpoint of intervention, a key variable in this process would appear to be information. Not only is information level related to evaluations of an urban area and mobility plans, but, compared to other variables in the model, it appears to be relatively amenable to modification by inputs deriving from a source external to the village itself. It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly, though both could be indirectly influenced by informational inputs. Movement history would be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate; while villagers could be sponsored for short trips to town, this is not likely to produce much long-range effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
16277821	0	a	This paper discusses possible consequences of energy excess throughout the life cycle. Firstly we consider the effects of foods on hunger, satiety and satiation. Also, the changes in food availability and consumption in relation to changes in social and economic determinants of energy excess. The relationship between physical activity and energy intake (EI) is also considered. Secondly we explore the definition of energy excess and the metabolic effects of macronutrients (mainly in relation to fuel partitioning oxidation/storage) on energy balance. The cellular and molecular regulation determined by specific genes involved in lipogenesis, fuel partitioning and/or in energy dissipation are explored. Thirdly, we examine the main consequences induced by energy excess and positive energy balance, starting with the alterations in glucose utilisation (insulin resistance) leading to type 2 diabetes and the linkage of energy excess with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Biological, social and psychological consequences during perinatal, childhood and adolescence periods are specifically analysed. Fourthly, the transition from energy deficit to excess, under the optic of a developing country is analysed with country examples drawn from Latin America. The possible role of supplementary food programmes in determining positive energy balance is discussed especially in relation to pre-school and school feeding programmes. Fifthly, we deal with the economic costs of energy excess and obesity related diseases. Finally, some areas where further research is needed are described; biological and genetic determinants of individual and population energy requirements, foods and food preparations as actually consumed, consumer education and research needs on social determinants of energy imbalances.
10677678	0	a	The production, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials are processes of vital economic importance for any advanced and technologically complex society. Although the production and distribution of hazardous materials is associated with economic development, there is a significant potential danger to the natural and social environment in the event of their accidental release, a fact that prompts for the development and implementation of methods and techniques that aim to improve hazardous materials risk management decisions. The objective of this paper is to present a unified framework for developing a Decision Support System (DSS) for supporting a vital function of risk management, namely the management of emergency response operations. The proposed framework recognizes the peculiarities of the hazardous materials decision-making environment which is characterized by: (i) multiple stakeholders, i.e., persons and organizations involved in and affected by hazardous materials risk management decisions; (ii) lack of a formal management structure for monitoring and controlling in a unified manner all Emergency Response Resources; (iii) lack of clear distinction and fragmentation of responsibilities of the actors involved in risk management operations; and (iv) dynamic/real-time decisions, i.e., risk determinants change over time. The proposed framework was used in order to develop a DSS for managing emergency response operations for large scale industrial accidents in Western Attica, Greece.
2767433	1	a	In Tamil Nadu, indigenous Siddha medicine (SM) is officially recognized and extensively used. Yet very little research information or published material is available on the extent of utilization behaviour of Siddha medicine in urban settings. This study examines the current patterns of utilization and consumer behavioural characteristics of SM through a field-based questionnaire survey of a sample of 300 patients attending 15 Siddha clinics in Salem, Tamil Nadu. Four areas were investigated: Socio-economic characteristics of the users; utilization behaviour pattern of patients; reasons for choice of Siddha therapy; opinions, attitudes, perception and satisfaction of users regarding Siddha therapy. The survey points out there is an inverse relationship between the number of patients using SM and income, education and distance travelled. Various factors were cited in choosing SM-such as, effectiveness of treatment, social influences of a relative or friend. Survey indicates that both modern medicine and SM seem to act as supporting rather than as competitive systems in a setting like Salem. People tend to seek both the system in search of a permanent cure.
4095592	1	a	Theoretical pathology' is defined as the conceptual foundation of medicine. Research in this area is concerned with the analysis of explicit and implicit patterns of thought dominating research and practice. Using the example of the stress concept, it is suggested that it is a 'key word' with denotative and connotative meanings accessible to professional and laymen, contributing to explore the 'gray zone' between 'health' and 'disease' by linking psychological, social and biological determinants of 'well-being' and 'discomfort'. Examples of current research illustrate possible expansions of medical theorization.
16020637	0	a	The world is increasingly shaped by powerful global forces, many of which have consequences for human health and the social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health are increasingly determined at a supranational level. As a result, local or national level efforts to influence health determinants can have only a limited impact and it is all too easy for the individual public health practitioner to feel powerless. Yet while public health practitioners, on their own, may indeed be comparatively powerless, together they can achieve a great deal. Part I of this glossary explores a range of issues that arise as they seek to make a difference.
6706793	1	a	Questionnaires addressing areas expected to relate to contraceptive use were completed by 230 female adolescents. Contraceptive use among the 130 sexually active subjects were predicted by a model composed of 12 scales assessing social permissiveness, costs and benefits of contraception, parent communication, boyfriend support, sex education and knowledge, attitudes about pregnancy and contraception, and access to contraception services. Scales from the predictive model which raise ideas for potential intervention strategies assessed parent communication, boyfriend support, and perceived costs and benefits related to contraception. Since there has been public concern that intervention programs for enhancing adolescent contraceptive use might also stimulate sexual activity, correlations were computed between the predictive scales and the measure of sexual experience among all 230 subjects. These data indicated that positive parent communication about sexuality and a perception of high benefits and low costs associated with contraceptive use were not positively correlated with sexual experience. Implications for the prevention of adolescent pregnancy are discussed with an emphasis on designing innovative sex education, improving parent-child communication, resolving conflicts in contraceptive decisionmaking, and supporting the role of boyfriends in contraceptive use.
17903329	0	a	BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered a major public health issue in most developed countries nowadays. This paper provides an overview of current population data available in Spain and the approach to develop preventive strategies in the country. METHODS: Review of population data available is based on individually measured weight and height as well as determinants. On this basis, the approach used in the country to develop preventive strategies is discussed. RESULTS: According to the DORICA study, the prevalence of obesity (BMI >or=30 kg m-2) is 15.5% in Spanish adults aged 25-60 years (13.2% in men and 17.5% in women). Obesity rates are higher among women aged 45 years and older, low social class, living in semi-urban places. Population estimates for the prevalence of obesity in Spanish children and young people based on the enKid study are 13.9% for the whole group. In this study, overweight and obesity is related to absence of breastfeeding, low consumption of fruit and vegetables, high consumption of cakes, buns, softdrinks and butchery products, low physical activity levels and a positive association with time spent watching TV. In 2005, the Spanish Ministry of Health jointly with the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition launched the multifaceted NAOS strategy for nutrition, physical activity and the prevention of obesity. The important role of the family and the school setting as well as the responsibility of the Health Administration and Pediatric Care in the prevention of obesity is highlighted in the document. The need for environmental actions is recognised. The PERSEO programme, a multicomponent school-based intervention project is part of the strategy currently in place. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a public health issue in Spain. A national multifaceted strategy was launched to counteract the problem. Environmental and policy actions are a priority. Young children and their families are among the main target groups.
2558204	1	a	To identify factors associated with the decision to consult with dyspepsia, patients with dyspepsia were identified from a postal survey in the community. A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.
18434246	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To understand the personal, social and cultural factors likely to explain recourse to the Internet as a preferred source of personal health information. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a population of 2923 Internet users visiting a firmly established website that offers information on personal health. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the determinants of site use. MEASUREMENT: The analysis template comprised four classes of determinants likely to explain Internet use: beliefs, intentions, user satisfaction and socio-demographic characteristics. Seven-point Likert scales were used. An analysis of the psychometric qualities of the variables provided compelling evidence of the construct's validity and reliability. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the correspondence with the factors predicted by the theoretical model. FINDINGS: The regression analysis explained 35% of the variance in Internet use. Use was directly associated with five factors: perceived usefulness, importance given to written media in searches for health information, concern for personal health, importance given to the opinions of physicians and other health professionals, and the trust placed in the information available on the site itself. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the importance of the credibility of information on the frequency of Internet use as a preferred source of information on personal health. It also shows the potentially influential role of the Internet in the development of personal knowledge of health issues.
15798114	0	a	The innovative practice that resulted from the Ottawa Charter challenges public health knowledge about programming and evaluation. Specifically, there is a need to formulate program theory that embraces social determinants of health and local actors' mobilization for social change. Likewise, it is imperative to develop a theory of evaluation that fosters reflexive understanding of public health programs engaged in social change. We believe advances in contemporary social theory that are founded on a critique of modernity and that articulate a coherent theory of practice should be considered when addressing these critical challenges.

18209291	0	a	While infrastructure conditions constitute 'primary routes', contamination of water within households and other behavioural determinants are considered as 'secondary routes'. However, recontaminated water has been considered not to constitute a serious risk though it occurs commonly in poorer societies. A study was conducted in Delhi where individual risk factors were located within a larger socio-economic, political and administrative framework, as they were often independent variables. This component of the larger study hypothesised that behavioural factors at individual household levels lose significance as major determinants of diarrhoeal diseases once they are analysed in a holistic epidemiology frame. Determinants at the household level were explored through a dataset based on a primary survey of 300 households in three slum clusters. Amongst households storing municipal water (proven to be safe at source), adhering to the best storage practices did not translate into lower incidence rates as compared to those with relatively unsafe practices. The explanation lay in factors which were external to the home and beyond the control of the affected household. Thus, household level behavioural factors such as storage practises should not be analysed in isolation as determinants of diarrhoeal illness particularly when pitted against stronger neighbourhood and external determinants.

Especially the influence of characteristics of the delivery system (e.g. differences between urban and rural regions) and characteristics of users (e.g. social class) are investigated. In this article the conceptual frame of the study is described. The model is based on assumptions of the action-decision-theory. It structures the process of decision and action into four phases: the first two, perception and interpretation, are summarized as ""process of attention""; the subsequent ones, coping and evaluation, as ""process of acting"". The model describes the social system (the total of demographic, socio-structural and socio-economic variables) and the memory system (contained within the individual life history) as mediating factors influencing the decision to act."
17278673	0	a	"OBJECTIVE: To promote multiculturalism among grade school students through drama education. PARTICIPANTS: Grade 3-6 students (N = 665) from 6 targeted schools including lead-class students (n = 158) representing each school. SETTINGS: Elementary schools in Windsor-Essex County, Ontario, Canada. INTERVENTION: In this non-experimental design study, group discussions conducted with each lead class to explore students' understanding of multiculturalism were developed into an interactive drama performance and performed for all grades 3-6 students in their respective schools. A follow-up drama workshop was offered to each lead class one week after the drama performance. All students completed a 7-item questionnaire before and after the drama performance and after the drama workshop. Pre-test and post-test data collected were analyzed using T-test and ANOVA to determine the effects of drama education on students' attitudes toward multiculturalism. OUTCOMES: Statistical analysis at 0.05 significance level revealed that both the performance and the drama workshop heightened students' awareness of racism, and instilled cultural respect through ""talking with others"", ""accepting others"", and ""believing that they can make a difference"" in multiculturalism promotion. CONCLUSION: Drama education was an effective experiential tool for promoting multiculturalism in a school setting. The key to promoting inter-racial harmony is to respect and accept individual differences and to broaden the social determinants of health by providing culture safety care."
19567981	0	a	Development is defined sustainable when it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Pivoting on social, environmental and economic aspects of food chain sustainability, this paper presents the concept of sustainable food safety based on the prevention of risks and burden of poor health for generations to come. Under this respect, the assessment of long-term, transgenerational risks is still hampered by serious scientific uncertainties. Critical issues to the development of a sustainable food safety framework may include: endocrine disrupters as emerging contaminants that specifically target developing organisms; toxicological risks assessment in Countries at the turning point of development; translating knowledge into toxicity indexes to support risk management approaches, such as hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP); the interplay between chemical hazards and social determinants. Efforts towards the comprehensive knowledge and management of key factors of sustainable food safety appear critical to the effectiveness of the overall sustainability policies.
19775869	0	a	Deficits in everyday living skills and social skills are associated with the pervasive disability seen in schizophrenia. Cognitive impairments are determinants of these skills deficits and it is known that positive and negative symptoms add to the influence of cognitive impairments for prediction of real-world outcomes. This study examined the relative importance of cognitive impairments measured with a neuropsychological battery, performance-based measures of social and everyday living skills, and positive and negative symptoms for the prediction of real-world outcomes in social and residential domains. In contrast to most previous studies, we examined the importance of individual symptoms, as well as total subscale scores, for predicting clinician rated outcomes in 194 older outpatients with schizophrenia. Symptoms were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; everyday living skills were measured by the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment; and social skills were measured with the Social Skills Performance Assessment. For prediction of real-world social outcomes, blunted affect and passive-apathetic social withdrawal accounted for all of the predicted variance, while social competence and cognitive impairments did not enter the final equation. For residential functioning, everyday living skills were the most important predictor, followed by lack of spontaneity. The positive symptoms of hallucinatory behavior and suspiciousness also predicted real-world residential outcomes. These results suggest that real-world disability is the product of a complex array of ability deficits and symptoms, indicating interventions will need to be carefully targeted. For social and everyday living outcomes, variance accounted for by the entire array of predictive variables was less than 40%, suggesting that other factors, such as social and cultural influences, are involved as well.

3992291	1	a	The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed.
15155587	0	a	In this study, determinants of tobacco use among Gambian youths were examined. A cross-sectional school-based survey was conducted among 282 students, aged 14-18. The potential determinants were derived from the core constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the ASE model. Moreover, various measures of knowledge and media influence were added to the research model. The results show that free cigarette offers by representatives of tobacco companies were mostly responsible for the difference between smokers and non-smokers. Other variables associated with smoking behavior were greater intention to smoke in the future, lower self-efficacy expectations regarding emotional situations, smoking behavior of the respondent's best friend, the mother having a job and the absence of other family members living in the house. Our study supports current efforts to prohibit tobacco advertising and promotions in The Gambia, especially the distribution of free samples. Additionally, we recommend prevention activities in schools and communities to aim at making children less vulnerable to 'sampling', increasing their self-efficacy expectations regarding emotional situations and making them aware of the influence of their best friend.
3852242	1	a	Nursing clinic clients' health beliefs, values, and demographic characteristics were analyzed for their impact on health promotion activities. A sample of 175 clients was administered measures of health beliefs, health values, and health promotion activities. The type of health care clients had requested at the clinic for the previous 2 years was categorized as health promotion, illness prevention, health maintenance, or health restoration. Findings included: health value was not related to self-reported health promotion activities or to types of clinic visits; a strong belief in chance was negatively associated with engaging in health promotion activities; a strong belief in powerful others was negatively associated with a high percentage of restoration visits. The combination of beliefs, values, and selected demographic factors accounted for 16% of the variance in health promotion activities and 18% of the variance in the type of health care sought.
18568706	0	a	BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has damaging impacts on victims and family members' lives and their long-term social integration constitutes a major challenge. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to document the repercussions of TBI on victims' long-term social integration (10 years post-trauma) and the contribution made by the services received from the point of view of TBI victims and family caregivers. This article examines the determinants of long-term social integration as well as the impact of TBI on family caregivers. METHODS: A qualitative design was used (semi-directed interviews). The sample consisted of 22 individuals who had sustained a moderate or severe TBI and 21 family caregivers. RESULTS: The results show that TBI is an experience that continues to present difficulties, even 10 years after the accident, and that different barriers contribute to this difficulty: not going back to work, depressive episodes, problems in relationships and sequellae. Family caregivers must help TBI victims confront the barriers in their path. IMPLICATIONS: This study adopts a longitudinal perspective to help professionals determine how to intervene with TBI victims and their families. It validates the importance of having clients and family caregivers describe their reality.
17934578	0	a	This exploratory research based on the Social Ecological Theory aimed to study the health promotion of 39 people working in the harvest of the sugarcane in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The objectives were to identify the individual, social and environmental factors predisposing the workers to illnesses. The data were collected through direct observation of the labor activity and a questionnaire. The main individual determinant factors were physical effort and hectic work rhythm, and among the environmental factors, intense solar radiation, dust, soot and the presence of venomous animals were highlighted. The conditions of life and work reflect the poverty of these individuals and are the main social determinants of illness. The interaction of these factors can cause respiratory, cutaneous, musculoskeletal problems, occupational accidents. Thus, eradicating poverty and improving work conditions are fundamental for the health promotion of these workers.
18808396	0	a	This article reports a study on consumer attitudes to 21 food and nonfood technologies in Canada. The study involves repertory grid interviews with 36 food consumers, the data from which are analyzed using generalized Procrustes analysis. Results highlight the role of perceived risk and perceived benefit in determining the acceptability of the technologies, with individual technologies lying along a continuum between the two. For technology as a whole and the 21 specific technologies, the perceived risk and perceived benefit constructs were the dominant determinants of consumer acceptability. While perceptions of perceived risk and perceived benefit differed between individual respondents, there were very limited consistent relations with a range of sociodemographic variables.
3811607	1	a	Data concerning histories of Adenoidectomy (Ad), Tonsillectomy (T) and Appendectomy (Ap) were collected from the escorts (mainly mothers) of 2296 children 3-12 years-old. The children were admitted as outpatients at the First Department of Paediatrics of the University of Athens or the Polyclinic of the Children's Welfare Center of PIKPA in Pireaus, during the last six months of 1983. Among children with median age of about six years, 12 percent had already had at least one operation (Ad, T or Ap); this proportion increased to about 25 percent among children with median age of about 10 years. The cumulative incidence of Ad and/or T was higher among boys, whereas the cumulative incidence of Ap was higher among girls. The age adjusted cumulative incidence of Ap was significantly higher in the lower social class, whereas there was no social gradient with respect to Ad or T. There were strong intra-individual correlations among the three studied operations; in particular the age adjusted cumulative incidence of Ap was 2.9 times higher among children with Ad and/or T than among children without any of these operations. Since there are no apparent biomedical reasons to account for the observed intra-individual associations, it appears likely, that these associations reflect parental or physician's attitudes leading to unjustifiable operations in some of the children.
12512223	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Psychological resources and social support are important determinants of health, but brief and validated scales measuring these dimensions in French are lacking. METHODS: Instruments measuring self-esteem and mastery, and affective and confident social support were administered by mail to 1257 university students. Factor analysis, internal consistency statistics, and correlations with related variables were used to derive abbreviated scales and confirm their validity. RESULTS: Factor analysis and item reduction yielded four brief scales: mastery (4 items), self-esteem (4 items), affective social support (2 items), and problem-solving social support (4 items). All four scales had few missing items and adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.70). All scores were associated with self-reported general health, and with visits to mental health specialists. Scores of self-esteem and mastery were also associated with physician visits (inversely), and confidence in finishing studies and finding a job. Scores of affective and confident social support correlated with the intensity of social activities and the number of people the respondent could count on. CONCLUSIONS: The abbreviated scales retained adequate psychometric properties and may be usefully applied in health research among similar French-speaking populations.
2529668	1	a	"Ludwik Fleck has shown in his discussion of the logical empirism of the Vienna Circle that his concept of reality presupposes an unproven logico-structural correspondence between the world and the formal logical structure of language, i.e. between reality and thought. Upon this questionable foundation he proceeds to develop his own position concerning the theory of medical science. He claims that scientific knowledge is at no time exempt from cultural, historical and social conditions, of which scientific knowledge itself is a function. These conditions find expression in the style of thought of a particular epoch (""Denkstil"") as well as in the interaction of the participating scientists (""Denkkollektiv""). Flecks merits for having explicated the conditionality of the process of scientific knowledge over against positivistic thought have been honourably elaborated in many studies. The present study offers an analysis of the manner in which the Fleck position attempts to serve as an explanation of change in the content and style of thought in history. It will be made clear that these changes and developments can only be explained as the result of the interaction and competition among the collectives of scientists and thinkers. Fleck deprives his socio-historical position of its logical foundation by radicalizing these conditions in such a manner that they become fundamental determinants of human thought generally and for the individual scientist particularly. As a consequence, from the perspective in which the thought of the individual is thus determined, he can neither establish a convincing theory for changes in thought in history nor for the human relations obtaining within the collective of scientists and thinkers."
6701567	1	a	This study deals with the relationship between social support and mental health. This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports. It is further suggested that sex roles may be important determinants of the availability and use of different support sources.
6984992	1	a	The hypothesis that social indices and educational level of mother are potential sources of childhood malnutrition was tested in Kampumbu, Zambia. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, protein and albumin levels in children were studied in relation to malnutrition. Six hundred and fifty rural children (306 males and 344 females) aged one and fourteen years exposed to various types of diet and environmental factors were selected randomly. Data on economic status, diet environment and educational attainment as well as other demographic information were collected. The major epidemiological findings were that the difference in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by income) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis was significant (X2 = 4.1, P less than 0.025), and the relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Similarly, there was a very significant difference (X2 = 7.4, P less than 0.005) in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by house grades) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis. The estimated relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Other variables, including age, history of hookworm, were not found to be determinants of risk for malnutrition.
12355987	0	a	The main clinical presentation of osteoporosis is fracture and its consequences. However a number of diseases and factors can induce bone loss and increase the risk of fracture. Therefore the clinical approach should be initially directed to exclude secondary osteoporosis. Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures; they are characterized by back pain, typical physical changes such as kyphosis and height loss, functional impairment and social decline. On the other hand, hip fracture is the most severe consequence of osteoporosis, because of its higher morbility and mortality. The main pathogenetic determinants of hip fracture are represented by both bone loss and several factors contributing to fall in the elderly. Moreover, a number of conditions are responsible for the high mortality rate following hip fracture. Colles' fracture is rarely hospitalized; however, most patients complain a complex algodystrophic syndrome which impairs the quality of life.
12521802	0	a	This study examines the determinants of Mission House Delivery among booked patients in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. During the 12 months of the study (1 May 199930 April 2000) 196 booked patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife who delivered at mission houses were analysed. All ages and parity groups, educational level and social classes were involved. The majority (73%) were of low socio-economic class. The reasons for mission house delivery included financial constraints (41%), fear of possible caesarean section (46%), industrial action by health-care workers (39%), transport difficulty at night (26%), previous deliveries in mission houses (16%) and communal feud (12%). Four maternal deaths occurred (MMR 978/100 000 births) and 20 perinatal deaths (PNMR 118/1000 total births). Reduction of hospital user fees, provision of transportation and efficient telecommunication facilities at all times, conflict resolution and proper remuneration of health care workers are urgent needs to be addressed. Legislation against delivery in unsafe places and establishment of appropriate facilities by churches interested in maternity services is highly recommended.
3070761	1	a	Medical compliance researchers have produced more than 4000 scientific papers in the past two decades, but their research into the determinants of non-compliance has been inconclusive. This paper argues that the popularity of compliance and the uncertainty over its determinants can be understood if compliance is analyzed as an ideology that assumes and justifies physician authority. I explore compliance as a problematic concept, looking at its assumptions and its influences on clinical practice. The concept of patient compliance has a social history linked to the struggle to create and maintain physician control over infant feeding technology earlier in this century. But while physicians were successful in that struggle, they have never exercised complete control over health care products. Compliance must be reconceptualized and its research reoriented if it is accurately to portray medication usage and related health behaviors outside the clinic.
17705873	0	a	BACKGROUND: The inappropriate use of emergency room (ER) service by patients with non-urgent health problems is a worldwide problem. Inappropriate ER use makes it difficult to guarantee access for real emergency cases, decreases readiness for care, produces negative spillover effects on the quality of emergency services, and raises overall costs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a medium-sized city in southern Brazil. The urgency of the presenting complaint was defined according to the Hospital Urgencies Appropriateness Protocol (HUAP). Multivariable Poisson regression was carried out to examine factors associated with inappropriate ER use. RESULTS: The study interviewed 1,647 patients over a consecutive 13-day sampling period. The prevalence of inappropriate ER use was 24.2% (95% CI 22.1-26.3). Inappropriate ER use was inversely associated with age (P = 0.001), longer stay in the waiting room, longer duration of symptoms and morning shift. However, the determinants of inappropriate ER use differed according age groups (P value for interaction = 0.04). Within the younger age-group (15-49 years), inappropriate ER use was higher among females, patients who reported visiting the ER because there was no other place to go, patients reporting that the doctor at the regular place of care refused to attend to them without a prior appointment, and individuals who reported that the PHC clinic which they use is open for shorter periods during the day. Among older patients (50+ years), those with highest level of education, absence of self-reported chronic diseases and lack of social support were more likely to engage in higher inappropriate ER use. CONCLUSION: Efforts should be made to redirect inappropriate ER demand. Besides expanding access to, and improving the quality of primary and secondary care, it is important to mobilize social support for older patients, to enhance the relationship between different levels of care, as well as to develop campaigns to educate the public about the appropriate use of medical services.
4061712	1	a	The extent to which the values attached to health states are similar in different cultures or social groups is important for understanding health and illness behaviors and for developing standardized health status measures. A cross-cultural study was conducted to compare the health status values obtained in a United States population (Seattle, Washington) with those from another English-speaking culture (London, England) on the Sickness Impact Profile, a standardized measure composed of 136 items. London judges rated the severity of dysfunction described in each item on an equal interval scale using the same methods of scaling and analysis employed in the Seattle study. A regression of English mean item values on US mean values yielded a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of -0.07, indicating that judges gave strikingly similar ratings to most items. Agreement was higher at the more severe end of the dysfunction continuum than at the least severe end, a finding consistent with the notion that what constitutes health is more difficult to define than what constitutes illness. While a universal conception of dysfunction may exist in English-speaking societies, the social and cultural determinants of health status values deserve more systematic study.
16510888	0	a	Affective factors are likely to play a major role in determining the extent to which offenders are able to engage with, and benefit from, treatment. In this article, it is argued that the relationship between affect and treatment engagement may be understood in three ways: the access the client has to emotional states, the ability to express such states, and the willingness of the client to do this in the therapeutic session. It is suggested that affective determinants of treatment readiness can be understood with reference to models of emotional regulation and that attention to these affective factors in the early stages of treatment is likely to promote engagement, reduce attrition, and consequently improve treatment outcomes for violent offenders.
3430425	1	a	To evaluate the possible first-night effect on the nocturnal motor activity 25 poor sleepers and 12 good sleepers slept on the Static Charge Sensitive Bed (SCSB) during two consecutive nights. The frequency of body movements in poor sleepers was almost two times higher than in good sleepers. The method itself was reproducible across two nights. There were no statistically significant and systemic level differences between the nights in the movements in bed (MIB). The difference t-test did not either reveal group differences in the magnitude or direction of changes from night to night. Results are consistent with the view that the level of motor activity is one of the determinants of sleep quality. No first-night effect exists in terms of psychomotor activity.

3293236	1	a	Cancer of the esophagus poses a unique challenge for students of cancer prevention. The role of nutritional determinants and other environmental factors in modulating esophageal cancer has received increasing support from data collected during the last decades. Ecologic, geographic, economic, and cultural variables appear to be collectively operational in determining the nutritional profiles of high-risk populations in the Asian esophageal cancer belt and discrete hyperendemic pockets throughout the world. Altering dietary staples, preventing food contamination by mycotoxins, using molybdenum as a chemical fertilizer, modifying social habits, and adding deficient micronutrients to diets of high-risk groups will potentially avert the development of this devastating malignant neoplasm.
3186028	1	a	The pattern of disease in New Zealand is changing and will continue to do so. Some trends are predictable, while others (such as the epidemic of AIDS) may be unexpected. Analysis of past improvements in health suggests that medical research would be more productive if greater attention were paid to the external influences and personal behaviour which are the chief determinants of health. Apart from such general implications, analysis of the changing patterns of disease is vital as a stimulus and guide for medical research of all kinds. More effective monitoring of disease trends in New Zealand will require improvement in the quality and timeliness of routine health statistics, and training of adequate numbers of epidemiologists to analyse and interpret the data. Such developments are essential if medical research is to make a full contribution to the health of New Zealanders.

Directions for further research are outlined.
12664962	0	a	Final body height is achieved as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this article is to review past studies on body height that have followed different scientific traditions. In modern Western societies, about 20% of variation in body height is due to environmental variation. In poorer environments, this proportion is probably larger, with lower heritability of body height as well as larger socioeconomic body height differences. The role of childhood environment is seen in the increase in body height during the 20th century simultaneously with the increase in the standard of living. The most important non-genetic factors affecting growth and adult body height are nutrition and diseases. Short stature is associated with poorer education and lower social position in adulthood. This is mainly due to family background, but other environmental factors in childhood also contribute to this association. Body height is a good indicator of childhood living conditions, not only in developing countries but also in modern Western societies. Future studies combining different scientific traditions in auxology are needed to create a more holistic view of body height.
3282449	1	a	"The authors discuss the phenomenon of lying, a common psychic process that has received remarkably little scrutiny. The ubiquity of lying and others forms of deception suggests that they have ""normal"" aspects, but lying which is persistent or destructive to the quality of a person's life becomes pathological. Lying has many determinants, including developmental, biological, social, and psychodynamic. Antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic, borderline, and compulsive personalities have been associated with lying. The treatment of lying needs to be individualized according to the overall symptom complex in which it is embedded."
17132545	0	a	OBJECTIVE: This study assesses neuropsychological and psychosocial determinants of judgements of personality change (PC) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from 87 participants with TBI analysed using hierarchical binary regression. METHODS: Interview of participants assessed, injury severity (post-traumatic amnesia), degree of cognitive impairment (IQ and memory), presence of orbitofrontal and/or medial temporal damage (olfaction) and emotional reactions (anger, depression and anxiety questionnaires). Separate interview of relatives assessed their own response to the injury (emotional reactions and critical comments from the Expressed Emotion index) and their judgements of participants' behavioural change. RESULTS: As expected, memory loss and impaired olfaction predicted relatives' PC judgements. However, the most striking and novel result was that social-emotional factors (participants' and relatives' reactions) predicted PC judgements best. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the need (a) for future studies measuring social behaviours (e.g. impulsivity and emotional perception) (b) to explore the differing determinants of relatives' and participants' PC judgements and (c) to develop and to tailor clinical responses to the various psychosocial determinants of PC.
7418140	1	a	Correlates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were studied in 4756 white males and females ages 20-59 years examined during a population survey conducted by 10 North American Lipid Research Clinics. Multivariable analysis was used to assess the relation of social, demographic, physical and behavioral characteristics for HDL cholesterol in each of the study populations and in subgroups defined by sex, age and gonadal hormone use. Characteristics associated with higher HDL cholesterol concentrations were a lean body habitus, not smoking, consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, physical activity or exercise, membership in a high educational stratum, increased age and low dietary consumption of sucrose and starch. Each of these characteristics was examined in detail in its relation to HDL cholesterol concentrations in the respective chapters in this monograph; the purpose of the study reported here was to summarize the findings. When all variables were considered simultaneously in the analysis, body mass, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were the attributes most strongly and consistently associated with HDL cholesterol concentrations in the populations examined. These empirical findings from a cross-sectional study replicated across diverse populations were used to derive speculative estimates of the potential for modification of population levels of HDL cholesterol, consistent with hygienic intervention and lifestyle changes. The results of the study were considered in the context of the literature on determinants of HDL cholesterol.

6706795	1	a	A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed. Smoking, use of drugs, sexual behavior, and drinking of alcoholic beverages at the age of 16 years was related to dropout from secondary school during the 2-year study period. The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed.
3975667	1	a	Attitudes of medical students towards the psychosocial aspects of illness is of serious concern to medical educators. It is thought that medical students are overwhelmingly disease-oriented and not sufficiently sensitive to the role of the psychological, emotional, sociological and economic factors in the etiology and management of illness. In the present study the ATSIM (Attitudes Towards Social Issues in Medicine) was presented to third year medical students and compared with their responses obtained 2 years previously when they were first year students. The data suggest that third year medical students have positive attitudes towards certain psychosocial issues (the importance of social factors as determinants of health or illness, the role of preventive medicine in maintaining health, the role of physician-patient interactions in patient care). These attitudes were positive during the students' first year and have been maintained during the course of medical school. These finding are contrary to previous studies which indicate a deterioration in attitudes during the course of medical school.
17522961	0	a	The pattern of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has changed significantly with the emerging predominance of elderly patients. Age is no longer seen as a contraindication to dialysis. Based on 2004 data, in the USA, patients aged 45-64 years old comprise the largest portion of the incident population, while patients aged 75 and older have the highest incident rates of ESRD. Mortality is higher among the elderly dialysis patients for whom cardiovascular diseases and infections are the most common causes of death. The quality of life (QoL) of these patients has been found to vary in different investigations, dependent on such factors as the investigator(s), the composition of the study group and the criteria used, among others; however, age was always found one of the major determinants of their QoL. Quality-of-life data suggest that older dialysis patients have similar levels of social functioning and mental health as younger dialysis patients but that their level of physical functioning is poorer. As such, the survival and QoL of elderly patients depends mainly on the severity of the comorbid conditions. The rationing of dialysis on the basis of age alone is not justified as dialysis can provide elderly patients with the means to gain the health status that permits them to enjoy life, but in their own way.
3834353	1	a	Using ethnicity of surname, nativity, residential social class, and inferred age at migration to characterize and subdivide Hispanics in Los Angeles, we compared risk ratios and proportional incidence ratios to examine the patterns of occurrence of selected neoplasms within the Hispanic community. Common neoplasms for which Hispanics have high, low, and intermediary risk were examined in detail. Although the patterns expected on the basis of current concepts of etiology were generally found and served to reinforce presumptions about the biologic significance of the risk factors, a number of observations cannot be explained easily with current knowledge. The risks for stomach and bowel cancers do not conform to the mirror-image patterns to be expected on the basis of inverse patterns of dietary acculturation. Incidence of cancer of the breast, in contrast to that of cervix, does not appear to reflect early cultural practice. Consistent details in the patterns of cancers of the bladder, rectum, ovary, prostate, and possibly pancreas imply unrecognized determinants of disease. Gallbladder cancer in Hispanic women is the disease most closely tied to Hispanic origin or culture, or both, but the ethnic pattern in women differs greatly from that in men.

4034814	1	a	"To measure the extent to which progress in psychotherapy can be predicted from the interpersonal styles of therapists and clients, 42 outpatients and their 11 therapists rated themselves and each other on Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) scales. In addition, therapists rated amount of client change and therapy success-failure, based on the outcome section of the Rogers and Dymond (1954) scale, and clients used the Strupp, Fox, and Lessler (1969) questionnaire to evaluate progress-to-date. Clients also completed the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) at the start of therapy and after they had completed at least 6 treatment sessions. Canonical analyses indicated that when optimally weighted, SASB scores can predict at least 65% of the reported progress variance, lending credence to claims that ""reflexive social behavior"" and ""the relationship"" are important determinants of certain aspects of therapeutic outcome. Consistent with previous literature, clients reported more satisfaction with therapy when they perceived their therapists as ""warm and freeing,"" but such perceptions were not systematically related to reported symptom reduction. Unfavorable self-concept ratings by therapists and therapist ratings of clients as ""helping or protecting,"" which suggest role reversal, were negatively associated with symptom amelioration."

3788206	1	a	The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.
19191176	0	a	PURPOSE: International and national programs to control vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) among children in developing countries are reducing the magnitude but VADD still occurs in deprived populations. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for xerophthalmia in children aged 6-71 months living in slums in Pune, India in 2003. METHODS: Children were enrolled into a cross sectional study from randomly selected Anganwadis (kindergartens) in selected slums using proportional to size sampling. Parents/caregivers were interviewed by social workers about night blindness, risk factors for VADD at individual and household levels, intake of vitamin A rich foods, and history of vitamin A supplementation. Children were examined for signs of xerophthalmia by an ophthalmologist. Risk factors for xerophthalmia were explored using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: 1,589 children were examined (response rate 80.2%) 22 of whom had xerophthalmia, prevalence 1.32% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.88%). There were no gender differences. Independent risk factors for xerophthalmia were having an illiterate mother [Odds ratio [OR]15.4 (95% CI 4.4-64.1)] and lack of a safe water supply [OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.5-5.1)]. Only 11.3 and 13.3% of children in different slums had taken vitamin A supplements. CONCLUSIONS: Xerophthalmia was at a level of public health significance in children living in slums in Pune. This study highlights the importance of female education and indicates that vitamin A supplementation and other approaches to control need to be improved in children living in deprived areas like urban slums.
4076484	1	a	This paper has analyzed a theoretical model of mobility decision-making. The model relies entirely on individual-level factors rather than macro-level factors as determinants of migration decision-making. The individual-level variables included in the model are: recent mobility history, urban social contacts, information about urban areas, evaluations of different locations, migration plans, and actual movements in the period subsequent to an initial interview. The empirical results indicate that with some exceptions there are relatively strong links of the type suggested in the model among these variables. The model was evaluated separately for two groups of villages for movement to Bangkok and for movement to Northeast Thai towns. Thus, four submodels were estimated, providing an opportunity to observe how robust the model is with respect to varying destinations and origins. Although certain differences are found among the four submodels, the overwhelming feature is their similarity. Where differences do exist, they generally reflect differences in the effectiveness of prior mobility as a predictor of other variables in the process. Clearly, a villager's previous history of movement is a key factor affecting subsequent movement and the entire decision-making process. The primary effect of having friends and relatives in a particular urban center is to increase the amount of information a villager has about that urban center. Information has a significant effect on evaluations and plans. Except in one submodel, evaluations have a significant effect on plans; and the existence of plans--which to some extent represent a culmination of social contacts, information, and evaluations--is the only factor other than previous mobility which has a significant direct effect on subsequent movement. Thai policy makers are searching for ways to stimulate the growth of regional urban growth centers and reduce the growth of Bangkok. From the standpoint of intervention, a key variable in this process would appear to be information. Not only is information level related to evaluations of an urban area and mobility plans, but, compared to other variables in the model, it appears to be relatively amenable to modification by inputs deriving from a source external to the village itself. It appears difficult to modify evaluations or migration plans directly, though both could be indirectly influenced by informational inputs. Movement history would be difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate; while villagers could be sponsored for short trips to town, this is not likely to produce much long-range effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

20131685	0	a	OBJECTIVE: This study examined correlates of tobacco use among Hmong people residing in Wisconsin. METHODS: Surveys of youth (ages 12-17) and adults (ages > or =18), available in English and Hmong, were distributed in 14 communities through Hmong Mutual Assistance Associations and analyzed centrally. Surveys assessed daily and ever use of tobacco, as well as other sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of those contacted, 2856 people completed the survey (1460 youth and 1396 adults). Among youth, 15% reported daily use (18.8% for males, 11.7% for females); 32% reported ever use (36.3% for males, 28.2% for females). Education and birth location were significant predictors of tobacco use. Youth who reported someone in their household smoked were more likely to use tobacco. The odds of ever use of tobacco increased as the percent of life lived in the United States increased (OR = 3.7). Among adults, prevalence of daily use was 20% (25.3% for males, 12.4% for females) and ever use was 35.9% (45% for males, 23.2% for females.) Adults born in the United States were 3.4 to 3.7 times more likely to use tobacco. The less education reported, the more likely they were to be a daily tobacco user. Adults who reported that someone in their household smoked were 2.8 to 3.4 times more likely to use tobacco. CONCLUSION: Overall, Hmong males are at higher risk of smoking than females, although this difference is smaller for youth than adults. Education and household exposure are strong predictors of smoking prevalence.
19306200	0	a	Cancer is primarily a chronic disease of older adults that must be managed and incorporated into everyday activities. Online sites are important sources of health care information and support. Health literacy is necessary for full utilisation of online resources. The objective of this study was to examine and compare cancer related conversations in online forums hosted by Canadian and American associations for retired persons. A content analysis was used to evaluate archived cancer conversations of general-health online forums representing two leading North American associations for retired persons. There were 125/1817 (6.8%) Canadians and 70/892 (7.8%) US cancer discussions among participants in 2006. Online conversations were grouped into three categories: request for information, provision of information and sharing of information. Important subthemes included cancer prevention and screening, treatment and cancer care and health system issues. There were significantly more posts about provision of cancer information from the Canadian compared with the US site (p = 0.023). American more than Canadian conversations emphasised the health system concerns as determinants of cancer care practices. Online discussion forums hosted by retirement associations may serve as an important channel in information dissemination about cancer prevention and screening, treatment and care support and health care advice for seniors.
19003692	0	a	In this paper I argue that a narrow view of justice dominates the bioethics literature. I urge a broader view. As bioethicists, we often conceive of justice using a medical model. This model focuses attention at a particular point in time, namely, when someone who is already sick seeks access to scarce or expensive services. A medical model asks how we can fairly distribute those services. The broader view I endorse requires looking upstream, and asking how disease and suffering came about. In contrast to a medical model, a social model of justice considers how social determinants affect the health of a population. For example, social factors such as access to clean drinking water, education, safe workplaces, and police protection, profoundly affect risk for disease and early death. I examine one important social determinant of health, health care coverage, to show the limits of a medical model and the merits of a broader view.
6139036	1	a	A community sample of older adults was investigated to test some of the current hypothesis about the etiology of depression in the elderly. Multiple regression analysis showed that cognitive disturbances (memory, concentration), previous depressive episodes, and somatic health problems accounted for most of the etiological variance. Other variables, like stressful life events, financial problems, social isolation, alcohol use, age, sex, and previous somatic illnesses are significant but their numerical values are very small. Etiological insignificant were the variables: physical activities, competency in daily living, and support by ones own children.
3384599	1	a	Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological reasons were studied prospectively for a four month period in an Indian General Hospital. Psychiatric emergencies constituted only 2% of all emergency visits. Most of the patients were new except for 7.4% who were already registered with the outpatient services of the psychiatry department. Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 2:1. Self-referrals constituted 77% of the samples; 21% of patients were brought by police. Two-thirds of the patients were brought owing to the severity of their clinical condition and the rest, one-third, for medico-legal and social reasons. Approximately 80% of the patients sought consultation within one month of the onset of illness episode. First episode of mental illness was within last one year of the emergency room visit in 60% patients. Past history of hospitalization for mental illness was obtained only in 10% of cases. The pattern suggested that there was no misuse of emergency services by psychiatric patients although 20% of the patients presented with social problems only which required social rather than psychiatric intervention.
17170020	0	a	BACKGROUND: Parent child relationships and parenting processes are emerging as potential life course determinants of health. Parenting is socially patterned and could be one of the factors responsible for the negative effects of social inequalities on health, both in childhood and adulthood. This study tests the hypothesis that some of the effect of socioeconomic risk on health in mid childhood is transmitted via early parenting. METHODS: Prospective cohort study in 10 USA communities involving 1041 mother/child pairs, selected at birth at random with conditional sampling. EXPOSURES: income, maternal education, maternal age, lone parenthood, ethnic status and objective assessments of mother child interaction in the first 4 years of life covering warmth, negativity and positive control. OUTCOMES: mother's report of child's health in general at 6 years. Modelling: multiple regression analyses with statistical testing of mediational processes. RESULTS: All five indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) were correlated with all three measures of parenting, such that low SES was associated with poor parenting. Among the measures of parenting maternal warmth was independently predictive of future health, and among the socioeconomic variables maternal education, partner presence and 'other ethnic group' proved predictive. Measures of parenting significantly mediated the impact of measures of SES on child health. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting mediates some, but not all of the detectable effects of socioeconomic risk on health in childhood. As part of a package of measures that address other determinants, interventions to support parenting are likely to make a useful contribution to reducing childhood inequalities in health.
12282709	1	a	"""This study examines the divorce pattern of Bangladesh with a set of socio-economic factors: education, religion, current residence, childhood residence, work status before and after marriage and age at first marriage. The source of data was ever-married women aged 15-49 of 1975 Bangladesh Fertility Survey. Multiple classification analysis technique was used for analyzing the data.... Divorce is found to have a strong inverse relation with age at marriage, and is more common among illiterates, Muslims, and rural women. The duration of marriage before divorce is found to be very low and the divorce rate is strongly associated with childlessness."""
3453175	1	a	"To explore the psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination (BSE) among women, we studied a stratified random sample of 264 women students, faculty, and staff in a university community. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported frequency of BSE, and predictors included measures of general health predispositions, variables of the Health Belief Model, the impact of a woman's social network, a set of secondary non-health-related barriers and benefits, and the woman's evaluation of her personal health care system. Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice."
23978888	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To analyze the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of admitted patients and the patterns of their service utilization over a decade from March 1988 to March 1998. METHODS: Prospective data compilation using a structured questionnaire, hospital records and follow-up observations at King Fahd Hospital of the University in Al-Khobar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 1366 patients (683 of each sex) had 2217 admissions in 10 years. By the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition criteria, 19.5% had schizophrenia, 15.2% bipolar disorder, 9.9% depressive episodes, 8.6% acute and transient psychotic disorders, 7.7% adjustment disorders and 7.6% dissociative disorders. Males were more frequently admitted for schizophrenia and females for mood and anxiety disorders. Most non-Arab expatriates were diagnosed as acute and transient psychotic, stress-related or dissociative disorders. Re-hospitalizations constituted 28% of all admissions. The mean length of stay was 25 days per admission and 41 days per patient. The overall bed occupancy rate was 84.9%. A subgroup of 16.9% of patients, mostly with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, consumed 62.3% of the bed occupancy. CONCLUSION: Gender and immigration were the main determinants of variance in patient characteristics, nosological distribution and pattern of service use. More beds are needed. Psycho-educational programs should be intensified to reduce the social stigma and societal intolerance to mental patients. Active family involvement improves compliance and might reduce re-hospitalization rates. Heavy service consumers should be transferred to long-stay facilities.
2649990	1	a	A social epidemiological approach has been used to study social factors associated with chronic disease, as well as to promote community-oriented intervention programs to modify risk for cardiovascular disease. The present review suggests using a social epidemiological approach in a third way; to promote efforts directed toward family-oriented primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented which shows an association between three family social factors (marital status, family socioeconomic status, family size) and risk for cardiovascular disease. The real determinants of risk, however, may be the underlying health-related behaviors indicated by each of these factors. Evidence is also presented which shows the importance of a fourth family social factor (family age) in promoting effective health education efforts to modify risk. Thus, a social epidemiological approach is more valuable than a single discipline-based approach in identifying, understanding, and modifying family social influences on cardiovascular risk.
15006238	0	a	OBJECTIVE: There is concern about whether public services in Northern Ireland are equitably targeted across the religious divide. This study investigates whether use of acute hospital inpatient services differs by religious denomination, after adjusting for supply and for identified demographic, morbidity and socio-economic determinants of need for such services. METHODS: Hospital utilisation at small area level was modelled against a wide range of potential health and socioeconomic factors. Spatial interactive modelling was used to estimate the effect of supply of hospital beds and other facilities on hospital utilisation. Two-stage weighted least-squares regression was used to model utilisation against need and supply. RESULTS: There was a clear positive relationship between the proportion of Roman Catholics in a ward and both need for and utilisation of inpatient services. The higher levels of relative utilisation in wards with a greater proportion of Catholics persisted after controlling for needs but not when supply variables were also entered in the regression equation. The surviving needs drivers were: uptake levels of 'income maintenance' benefits, all-ages standardised mortality ratio, low birth weight and elderly people living alone. Most of these indicators of need are positively correlated with proportion of Catholics. CONCLUSIONS: When both need and supply factors are taken into account, there appears to be no significant effect of religion on inpatient hospital use in Northern Ireland. Efforts to ensure socio-economic equity between the two communities should focus on ensuring that hospital rationalisation does not lead to disadvantage and on reducing socio-economic differentials between the Catholic and Protestant communities.
10672101	0	a	Midwives practice within the normal childbirth paradigm. It is argued that midwives failure to define normality has allowed increasing technicalization and medicalization of the normal physiological process of birth because doctors so closely define abnormality. A concept analysis model is used to clarify what is meant by the term 'normal labour'; the emphasis being on understanding what normal labour is as it applies to midwifery practice today. This analysis highlights the importance of movement and the sequential nature of normal labour, and reveals how this is implicit within the other uses of both the words normal and labour. The final definition of normal labour offered is intended to be complimentary to existing medical determinants of progress of normal labour, because as the body of the text stresses, medical knowledge is fundamentally enmeshed in midwifery care.
15868185	0	a	The mechanism of final cessation of the reproductive life span has not been solved yet. It is generally assumed that the most important factor is ovarian follicular reserve. In ovaries at intrauterine period, a major factor that determines the number of the primordial follicle is the mitotic ability as well as the number of primordial germ cells, which migrate to gonadal ridge. The telomere length is one factor that determines the number of mitosis of the cell. The differences between the telomere lengths of same aged healthy women reflect the difference of the telomeres of the primordial germ cells at the intrauterine period. Women with long telomeres supposedly have had their primordial germ cells at the beginning of life with long telomeres. So, these cells should have had more mitotic division and more follicle numbers in the ovaries than the short ones. The aim of this study was to analyse the relation of the reproductive life span and telomere length. The telomere lengths of 37 women volunteers aged 50 years were measured by fiber FISH technique. A positive correlation was found between reproductive life span and the telomere length.
24301629	1	a	"A social-learning model [R. C. Akers, M. D. Krohn, L. Lanza-Koduce, and M. Radosevich (1979), ""Social Learning and Deviant Behavior: A Specific Test of a General Theory,""American Sociology Review, 44: 636-655] was tested for its ability to explain why adolescents drive under the influence of alcohol and ride with drinking drivers. Data were gathered from a survey of 1,082 high school students. Findings indicate that all five subsets of the model are significant determinants of adolescent driving under the influence and riding with drinking drivers. The study demonstrates that if adolescent drinking and driving is to be prevented, careful attention must be paid to ways that it is learned and maintained."
17132545	0	a	OBJECTIVE: This study assesses neuropsychological and psychosocial determinants of judgements of personality change (PC) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from 87 participants with TBI analysed using hierarchical binary regression. METHODS: Interview of participants assessed, injury severity (post-traumatic amnesia), degree of cognitive impairment (IQ and memory), presence of orbitofrontal and/or medial temporal damage (olfaction) and emotional reactions (anger, depression and anxiety questionnaires). Separate interview of relatives assessed their own response to the injury (emotional reactions and critical comments from the Expressed Emotion index) and their judgements of participants' behavioural change. RESULTS: As expected, memory loss and impaired olfaction predicted relatives' PC judgements. However, the most striking and novel result was that social-emotional factors (participants' and relatives' reactions) predicted PC judgements best. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the need (a) for future studies measuring social behaviours (e.g. impulsivity and emotional perception) (b) to explore the differing determinants of relatives' and participants' PC judgements and (c) to develop and to tailor clinical responses to the various psychosocial determinants of PC.
11450925	0	a	BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify 'non-medical' datasets holding routinely collected information that might be used to measure and monitor the wider determinants of community health and well-being. METHODS: An expert panel discussion, involving public health and environmental health academics and professionals with expertise in a variety of backgrounds (including environmental health, housing, transport, community safety, public health, primary and secondary care), and interrogation of the Office for National Statistics database were carried out for the West Midlands region. The aim was to identify routinely collected 'non-medical' datasets containing information on the following factors: physical environment, crime, housing and homelessness, social services, socio-economic environment including employment, lifestyles, education, leisure and culture, transport and accidents. RESULTS: Fifty-six datasets were identified. Although 43 (77 per cent) were collected at least annually, few (17; 30 per cent) held data that were disaggregated and routinely available at the sub-local authority level. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a number of datasets that hold information relevant to health. However, no single dataset is likely to provide information on all dimensions of health and the determinants of health, and local agencies should consider carefully the strengths and weaknesses of each. Through the development of inter-sectoral working and multi-agency involvement at the local level there is now considerable scope to improve the quality of many of these datasets and to promote their use in the measurement and monitoring of community health.
6737214	1	a	This study examined Weiss' conceptualization of social and emotional loneliness. Using data from an extensive survey of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Iowa, we measured social and emotional loneliness, students' affective and behavioral reactions to loneliness, students' social relationships, and their judgments of the degree to which their relationships supply the six social provisions described by Weiss. As expected, we found differences in the subjective experiences of social and emotional loneliness, although both forms of loneliness were also characterized by a common core of experiences. The results generally supported Weiss's ideas concerning the determinants of social and emotional loneliness. Predictions concerning the affective and behavioral consequences associated with each type of loneliness, however, were only partly supported, although the two forms of loneliness were associated with different affective reactions and coping behaviors. The implications of these findings for Weiss's typology of loneliness are discussed.
2526781	1	a	Among 269 functionally impaired elderly people residing on 53 Israeli kibbutzim, those cared for principally by informal caregivers were compared with those cared for principally by formal caregivers. The major findings were that the variables differentiating between primary reliance on formal versus informal care are similar to those that have been found in other studies, and that the availability of formal resources was not accompanied by withdrawal of informal supports.
18785182	0	a	Individuals adapt to changes in their environment, such as food availability and temperature, by adjusting the amount of time spent in different behavioral activities. These adjustments in behavior should vary across age-sex class according to specific physiological and social needs. We studied the activity budgets of three social Japanese macaque groups inhabiting either vegetated or nonvegetated enclosures in order to compare the effects of access with vegetation, as both food and substrate on resting, feeding, grooming and moving activities over a 12-month period. Daily access to natural foods for monkeys in the vegetated enclosure seems to be largely responsible for the differences in daily time budgets of these three groups. Resting time in all three groups was longer than the time devoted to other activities. Resting and moving time in the two nonvegetated enclosures was significantly longer than in the vegetated enclosure. In contrast, feeding and grooming time was significantly longer in the vegetated enclosure. Seasonal variation in time spent feeding, resting and grooming was significantly effected by enclosure type. In all three enclosures, immatures, particularly females, spent more time feeding and moving, whereas adults spent more time resting. Significant monthly variation in time spent by age-sex class was noted only for feeding and resting. Interestingly, in the vegetated enclosure, time spent feeding on natural vegetation was equal to the amount of time spent feeding on provisioned food. This suggests that factors other than energetic and nutritional needs may be important determinants of the activity budget of the species. These results have important implications for the enrichment of captive primates and our understanding of the maintenance of activity patterns by primates in the wild.
19652692	0	a	During the past several decades, smoking prevalence among youth has fluctuated in puzzling and unexpected ways. To help understand these changes, this study tests seven explanations: (a) compositional changes, (b) sample selection, (c) adult smoking, (d) social strain, (e) cigarette prices, (f) tobacco advertising, and (g) other drug use. Figures on smoking prevalence come from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Surveys from 1976-2002, whereas figures on aggregate determinants for the same time period come from government publications. Graphs of the time-series trends to determine temporal correspondence and time-series regression models to test for statistical influence reveal two variables that have expected effects. Increases in cigarette prices reduce smoking, particularly in the most recent years, and higher marijuana initiation (or use) is associated with greater smoking during most of the time period. However, much of the change in youth smoking, particularly the most recent rise and fall, remains unexplained.
3771079	1	a	The utilization of antenatal, delivery and postnatal services by a random sample of married women in Jordan during their most recent pregnancy resulting in a live birth is analysed. Marked variations are shown in the use of these services and of preventive infant care for women living in urban and rural areas. Women with increasing levels of formal education and those living near services were significantly more likely to use services. If effective coverage of these services is to be achieved then it is suggested that greater emphasis should be placed upon outreach and realistic social marketing.
3762472	1	a	In 1983-1984, 4578 Perth primary and secondary schoolchildren were studied. The selected sample was broadly representative of the ethnic groups that make up the Perth population and of the different social ranks within that population. The age, sex, weight, height, country of birth of the child and the parents, and occupation of the father were recorded for each subject. Weight, height and body mass index (BMI) increased with age. Age and sex were the most important determinants of body size. However, children of lower social rank and those with a southern European background were over-represented among the overweight children (greater than the 90th centile for BMI), particularly in adolescence. Children with an Asian background who were 11 years of age and younger were over-represented among the underweight children (less than or equal to the 10th centile for BMI). Results from this study indicate a continuing, though small (1.5 cm to 1.6 cm), secular increase in height over the past 13 to 14 years.
18384491	0	a	Two studies were conducted among elite young judokas to examine (a) whether those who persisted in national training centers (n=52) were different from dropouts (n=52) in their perceptions of coach-, parent-, and peer-induced motivational climates, goal orientations, self-perceptions, perceived competence, and intention of dropping out, and (b) whether these variables varied during the persisting athletes' (n=82) first 2 years in these centers. Compared with persisting athletes, dropouts perceived the roles of coaches, parents, and peers as less task-involving, were less task-oriented, and intended more to drop. The association of peer-, coach-, and parent-induced task-involving climates predicted athletes' persistence. During the 2 years, persisting athletes' perceptions of coach-, parent-, and peer-induced task-involving climates decreased, while perceptions of a coach-induced ego-involving climate and the intention of dropping out increased in spite of more positive self-perceptions. Gender differences favoring males were observed for self-perceptions only. These results stress the importance for all the agents of the athletes' social environment to promote task-involving climates, because such climates appear to be naturally prone to degradation in the context of elite competition. The results also shed light on some high-level athletes' characteristics regarding motivational dispositions and self-concept.
3776295	1	a	"The relevant aspects of the psychosocial situation of men in old age were listed using two different methods: Identification of contextual determinants of the male aging process. Reporting on empirically based evidence of the situation of elderly men. ad 1. The following contextual aspects of the male aging process were under consideration: generalized and personalized images of elderly men, subjective reports on ""male aging"", changing images of the male sex role and the aging role, male sex role typing across the life span, middle and late adulthood as relevant lifespan segments preceding old age, and sociodemographic and health statistics concerning the situation in which elderly men live. ad 2. The report on empirically based data on the psychosocial situation of old aged men included the following aspects: Social roles of men in old age, comparisons between elderly men and elderly women and between elderly and younger men, interindividual variability (classifications) among the group of old-aged men and early antecedents as ""predictors"" of life satisfaction in old age. Analyzing these different kinds of material, the importance of a differential approach to the multidimensionally determined situation of men in old age was stressed; on the other hand, it seemed to be possible to identify certain ""typical"" characteristics at least for the present cohorts of old-aged men (e.g. importance of the quality of marital life, significance of being free of stress, tendency of experiential integration etc.)."
12197201	0	a	Spain has been a crossroads, for confrontation and peaceful living-together. The problems arising from immigration as a mass phenomenon are characteristic of the present times. Variables which define the immigration phenomenon are the attraction to the economically developed countries with an active labour market, while it is inversely related to the distance from the departure countries. The phenomenon is also modified by positive influences as the common language, and by negative factors as the political or social instability. The aging of the populations in developed countries, and the need of labour market, stimulate the immigration phenomenon, which may affect to 2.3% of the population. The reproductive capacity of the population depends not only on biological determinants but also on the heterogeneous culture of immigration, because immigrants are candidates to become stable members of society. There is a logic of discrimination of those which are different. Thus, we need a legislation to establish their rights and duties, as well as an integration policy to favour the cultural diversity.
12266410	1	a	"A micro study of inter-regional migration by women in Nicaragua is presented. The authors ""explore three sets of migratory incentives: (1) labor market factors such as usually are emphasized; (2) 'demographic marriage market' considerations (i.e., the probability of having a male companion)...; and (3) 'economic marriage market' considerations (i.e., the expected earnings from a companion given regional labor market conditions and assortative mating)....[They] use estimates of expected outcomes in origin, destination and third regions--conditional upon the woman's characteristics and upon regional differences in labor and marriage markets--to explore the consistency of actual migratory flows with these three sets of migratory incentives.""

15385696	0	a	OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and their partners, and the role of personality factors and social support as determinants of distress. METHODS: Of all surviving patients (n = 221) having had an ICD implanted between October 1998 and January 2003, 182 patients and 144 partners completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Type D Personality Scale, and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Type D personality defines those who tend to experience increased negative distress and who do not express these negative emotions in social interactions. Clinical variables for the patients were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients versus 42% of partners suffered from symptoms of anxiety (p =.048); symptoms of anxiety were particularly prevalent in male partners. Twenty-eight vs. 29% suffered from depressive symptoms (p =.901). In patients, Type D personality was independently related to anxiety (OR: 7.03; 95% CI: 2.32-21.32) and depressive symptoms (OR: 7.40; 95% CI: 2.49-21.94) adjusting for all other variables. Underlying cardiac disease pathology did not explain differences in patient distress. In partners, Type D personality was independently associated with increased symptoms of anxiety (OR: 8.77; 95% CI: 3.19-24.14) and depression (OR: 4.40; 95% CI: 1.76-11.01). CONCLUSION: Partners experienced similar levels of depression but higher levels of anxiety compared with ICD patients. Personality was an important explanatory factor of distress in both ICD patients and their partners. Research is now warranted to investigate the implications of this finding for the clinical course of ICD patients, as Type D personality has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease.
7180620	1	a	The purpose of this paper is to provide fundamental information about individual subject smoking behavior when the behavior is characterized as an event time-series. Each subject's smoking series revealed a characteristic inter-cigarette interval frequency distribution but there was little evidence of sequential dependencies in the series with respect to either successive intervals or successive events in time. Several subjects exhibited possible characteristic peaks or troughs during successive 2-hour periods, a finding which was in agreement with previous studies, but even in these subjects temporal patterning accounted for only a small proportion of the total variance. The implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for the future treatment of smoking data and for possible experimental approaches to the determinants of smoking are presented.
2692802	1	a	Our emphasis in the past has been on disease prevention rather than health promotion. This emphasis served us reasonably well when morbidity was high throughout society and when interventions at the community level were able to achieve massive reductions. It is not faring as well now that the major shared environmental determinants of disease have been controlled. The present situation calls for changes in individual health-related behaviour and individual clinical interventions to achieve comparable progress. As difficult to win as collective commitments to community-level interventions have been, compliance in a free society by often unmotivated persons in numerous individual instances of decision making in daily life is even more difficult. Health promotion offers the promise of a quantum leap in improving the health status of the community by participating in behaviour perceived as not only responsible but appropriate and desirable, providing positive reinforcement rather than anxiety-provoking caution. Favourable social trends, such as physical conditioning and dietary changes may be encouraged through media interventions. There are biological limitations to this approach, however. Many healthful practices confer little benefit on large groups of people and a few may be harmful to selected groups. Vigorous promotion of weight reduction and obesity control, for example, may lead to profound dissatisfaction with body image and to severely self-destructive behaviour among those prone to eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obsessive eating. Health promotion activities may fit well with social trends but their adverse potential can be aggravated because failure to comply can be penalized by peer disapproval in a way that disease prevention strategies usually are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
17320253	0	a	OBJECTIVE: to explore the perceptions among post-delivery mothers of skin-to-skin contact and newborn baby care. DESIGN: a qualitative design using focus-group discussions. Five focus groups were conducted with post-delivery mothers who had had normal deliveries. A latent content analysis was used to derive the themes from the focus-group discussions. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: 30 post-delivery mothers were purposely sampled from 249 mothers in the postnatal ward at St Francis Hospital, Nsambya, which is located in a periurban area in Kampala, Uganda. FINDINGS: two main themes emerged from the focus-group discussions: 'acceptability of health practices are influenced by knowledge and sensitisation' and 'pregnant women's choices are dependent on social, cultural and economic factors'. Mothers expressed varying opinions about the usefulness of skin-to-skin contact: some knew about its use to reduce the risk of hypothermia; others were ignorant, whereas some believed skin-to-skin contact was an intervention used to distract them from the pain in the post-delivery period. The vernix caseosa and the mixture of amniotic fluid with blood in the post-delivery period were perceived as dirty and infectious. The best informants for helping mothers understand the skin-to-skin intervention were the health-care providers. Social, cultural and economic factors, as well as the dominant role of the husband, were identified as important determinants for their choice and place of delivery. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: the gap between the knowledge and practice of skin-to-skin contact in hospital needs to be bridged. Health-care providers need to be encouraged to continuously advocate for, educate and implement regular skin-to-skin contact.
12279766	1	a	"""The past decade has witnessed a substantial contraction in the size of the Irishborn community in Britain. This paper uses shift share analysis to assess the extent to which job losses amongst the Irish in Britain over the years 1971-1977 may have induced return migration to Ireland.

10607798	0	a	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that, in addition to genetic liability and environment in early childhood, intrauterine life also influences the risk for asthma beyond childhood. Low birth weight, prematurity, young maternal age, and maternal smoking have all shown an association with asthma. The effect of perinatal factors on the risk for asthma in relation to familial and social risk factors was studied in a nationwide population-based sample of adolescent twins. In addition to a distribution of birth characteristics among twins which differs from that of singletons, data on twins enable a distinction to be made between genetic and environmental sources of variation. METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to five consecutive birth cohorts of Finnish 16 year old twins born in 1975-9 and to their parents (3065 families). The outcome measure was life time prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma in these adolescents. The association between asthma and potential risk factors was assessed by multiple logistic regression and discordant twin pair analysis. RESULTS: Risk for asthma increased with increasing ponderal index (p for trend <0.01) and decreasing maternal age (p for trend <0.05). Among the 25% of twins with the highest ponderal index, the odds ratio for asthma was 1.82 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.79) compared with those in the lowest 25%. Neither birth weight, gestational age, nor Apgar score was associated with asthma. When perinatal risk factors were combined with familial and social risk factors, ponderal index, maternal smoking, parental asthma, and sibship size were all significant independent determinants of asthma in these adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for asthma in adolescent twins increases with increasing ponderal index when adjusted for familial and social factors.
6285155	1	a	In normal pregnant women, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) frequently occurs. Cellular immune responses are apparently suppressed, but high titer EBV-specific antibodies of IgG class may compensate. The antibodies cross the placenta and protect the infant against primary infection for many months. Reactivation of EBV in pregnancy and oral excretion of virus by normal pregnant women could be one explanation why young children in large sibships (among families of low social classes) become infected early in life. Infants are likely infected by EBV from their pregnant mothers who shed virus in saliva. Moreover, the natural protection for several months in the perinatal period against Burkitt lymphoma and fatal EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases in congenitally immune deficient children is explained. The maturity and immunocompetence of the immune system at the time of primary infection by EBV and the size of the sibship seem to determine whether infectious mononucleosis occurs. Gammaglobulin derived from human cord blood may be a valuable source of viral-specific antibodies for serotherapy in immune deficient patients.
11018394	0	a	PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between social class factors and squamous cell esophageal cancer and the extent to which alcohol, tobacco, diet, and social class contribute to the five-fold higher incidence among black than white men in the United States.METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 347 incident cases of squamous cell esophageal cancer (119 white males and 228 black males) and 1354 population-based controls (743 white males and 611 black males) from Atlanta, Detroit, and New Jersey. Risks were estimated using unconditional logistic regression controlling for potential confounders.RESULTS: Elevated risks of squamous cell esophageal cancer were associated with indicators of low social class, especially low annual income. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for subjects with incomes < $10,000 versus incomes of $25,000 or more were 4.3 (95% CI = 2.1-8.7) for whites and 8.0 (95% CI = 4.3-15.0) for blacks. The combination of all four major risk factors: annual income less than $25,000, moderate/heavy use of alcohol, use of tobacco for six months or longer, and consumption of less than 2.5 servings of raw fruits and vegetables per day accounted for almost all of the squamous cell esophageal cancers in whites (98%) and blacks (99%), and for 99% of the excess incidence among black men.CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle modifications, especially a lower intake of alcoholic beverages, would markedly decrease the incidence of this cancer in both races and narrow the racial disparity in risk. Further studies into the determinants of social class may help identify a new set of exposures for this tumor that are amendable to intervention.
2614820	1	a	Social and psychological variables are used to explain why young people become cigarette smokers, whereas biological factors have been virtually ignored as possible determinants of that behavior. In this study, salivary testosterone was positively associated with cigarette smoking among 201 subjects 12-14 years of age. This finding suggests that testosterone should be included in future considerations of adolescent cigarette smoking.
6886584	1	a	Dietary, social, and constitutional determinants of plasma concentrations of some major risk factors for ischaemic heart disease were investigated in a cross sectional study among 711 men from the general population aged 30-69. For high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) six variables were significantly associated with plasma concentrations, and these variables explained 12.6% of the variance. For low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (T-C), and triglyceride 8.4%, 7.5%, and 18.5% of the variance was explained by significantly associated variables. Fibrinogen concentrations determined chemically were significantly associated with age, smoking habit, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and intake of cereal fibre (24.2% variance). These data provide some encouragement for the possibility of dietary intervention to influence plasma concentrations of major risk factors for ischaemic heart disease in men.
6695831	1	a	The association between duration of breast-feeding and nutritional status was studied in a population-based sample of 802 children aged 12 to 35.9 months in Southern Brazil during 1982. The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis. These results are also consistent with a controlled trial on supplementary feeding in the Sudan.
3701582	1	a	Objective characteristics of people's social networks were examined as determinants of the perceived availability of social support in two populations: elderly adults (n = 50) and mothers of 1-year-olds (n = 71). Number of network members and frequency of contact with network members, computed separately for kin and nonkin were examined as predictors of loneliness, overall social support, and the six components of social support proposed by Weiss (1974). Kin were found to be more effective providers than nonkin of some aspects of social support. Network characteristics were better predictors of perceived social support for the elderly than for the mothers, but a maximum of 30% of the variance in perceived social support was attributable to the objective network characteristics in either sample. It is recommended that future research on the determinants of perceived social support consider actual interpersonal behaviors, their contexts, and personality characteristics that affect the facilitation an interpretation of supportive behaviors.
6701567	1	a	This study deals with the relationship between social support and mental health. This relationship was conceptualized as a multi-faceted one which may be understood in terms of direct (main), protective (buffering) and compensatory effects. Hypotheses relating to these effects were evaluated in terms of spousal/community support and job strains (pressure, autonomy, opportunities) among a sample of 455 married males who were employed on a full-time basis. Results indicated that spousal support generally had more important implications for psychological well-being than did community support. However, the relative impact of these different sources of support appeared to be related to the degree to which the mental health symptomology reported was affectively defined. With respect to protective effects, spousal support was found to moderate the relationship between certain job strains (pressure) and mental health. No protective effects were found for community support. Tests of the hypothesis that community support compensates for low levels of spousal support were made in terms of both direct and protective effects. No direct effect compensation was observed. However, protective effect compensation was observed for certain job strains (opportunities) and was relevant to a wide range of symptomology. The overall results suggest a primary/secondary hierarchy of supports and strains in which primary supports (e.g. spousal) assume a protective function with respect to secondary strains (e.g. job) while secondary supports (e.g. community) do not protect individuals from primary strains (e.g. spousal). Secondary supports have a protective function for secondary strains in the absence of primary supports. It is further suggested that sex roles may be important determinants of the availability and use of different support sources.
17992965	0	a	A study was carried out with 501 persons to analyze the predictive capacity of various psychosocial variables-symptom perception, neuroticism, Personality Types 2 and 4 of Grossarth-Maticek and Eysenck, beliefs about health, social support, or certain coping styles-on two health-related behaviors: the frequency of visits to the doctor and self-medication. The results were analyzed by two structural equation models that revealed that some of the variables have direct effects on the behaviors, whereas other variables, such as attribution style, coping styles, or the impact of the stressors, have indirect effects via the reported symptoms or neuroticism. In addition, self-medication and the frequency of health service visits are independent of each other, which shows that their determinants are different. It is concluded that to address these factors in the two health indicators, it is also necessary to take in account the psychosocial variables considered herein.
16808139	0	a	Currently, women comprise 17% of the 1.4 million U.S. active military and 20% of the 1.2 million reserve force. Well over three-quarters of these women are enlisted (82%). Enlisted women are young, between the ages of 17 and 29, and one-half are ethnic minorities. Enlisted women are a growing minority within the predominantly male hierarchical military organization. The most junior of these women, in addition to being vastly outnumbered by men, fall along with junior enlisted men at the bottom of the military organizational structure. This unique position may have health consequences. The purpose of this article is to propose research questions within the context of the Marmot and Wilkinson's social determinants of health model. Proposed research questions are provided to address the current gaps in the science related to the contextual health readiness issues of junior enlisted military women.
18441275	0	a	OBJECTIVE: . Objectives were to study the effects of socioeconomic factors on transitions in living arrangements and mortality for men and women. METHODS: We used a sample of Finns aged 65 years and older living alone or with a partner at the end of 1997 (N = 250,787) drawn from population registers, and followed them up for transitions in living arrangements (with partner, alone, with others, institutionalized) and death at the end of 2002. RESULTS: Health conditions associated with functional difficulties were major determinants of institutionalization and death and were associated with transitions between private households. Low income among men and in particular not owning a home were independently associated with institutionalization and death among those living alone or with a partner at baseline. Among those living with a partner, the transition to living alone was associated with all socioeconomic factors but most strongly with a low income and not owning a home. Transitions to living with others were associated in particular with low occupational social class and education. DISCUSSION: Variations in the associations of different socioeconomic indicators with living arrangement transitions imply different social pathways. However, material socioeconomic indicators dominated other measures of socioeconomic status in determining such transitions, and their effects were only partly mediated by chronic conditions.
2801277	1	a	This study investigated the relationships among family environment, demographic measures, the decisions made by unintentionally pregnant adolescents regarding postdelivery plans and the certainty with which these decisions were made. Subjects were 175 pregnant adolescents, ages 14 through 22, who intended to carry their pregnancies to term. Greater uncertainty was associated with living with both natural parents or with mother only. Higher levels of negative affect were related to lower levels of perceived family cohesion, independence, expressiveness, and intellectual-cultural orientation. Age, trimester of pregnancy, and family constellation also were related to levels of negative affect. Discriminant analysis revealed that subjects choosing adoption were more likely to be older and to be white than were those choosing to keep the child. They also tended to perceive higher levels of expressiveness and independence in their families. The implications of these findings for the delivery of services and for future research efforts in this area are discussed.
15969760	0	a	BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength and predisposition to increased risk of fracture, with consequent increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is therefore an important public health problem. International and Canadian associations have issued clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OP. In this study, we identified potential predictors of bone mineral density (BMD) testing and OP treatment, which include place of residence. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Quebec Health Insurance Board. The studied population consisted of all individuals 65 years and older for whom a physician claimed a consultation for a low velocity vertebral, hip, wrist, or humerus fracture in 1999 and 2000. Individuals were considered to have undergone BMD testing if there was a claim for such a procedure within two years following a fracture. They were considered to have received an OP treatment if there was at least one claim to Quebec's health insurance plan (RAMQ) for OP treatment within one year following a fracture. We performed descriptive analyses and logistic regressions by gender. Predictors included age, site of fracture, social status, comorbidity index, prior BMD testing, prior OP treatment, long-term glucocorticoid use, and physical distance to BMD device. RESULTS: The cohort, 77% of which was female, consisted of 25,852 individuals with fragility fractures. BMD testing and OP treatment rates were low and gender dependent (BMD: men 4.6%; women 13.1%; OP treatment: men 9.9%; women 29.7%). There was an obvious regional variation, particularly in BMD testing, ranging from 0 to 16%. Logistic regressions demonstrate that individuals living in long term care facilities received less BMD testing. Patients who had suffered from vertebral fractures, or who had received prior OP treatment or BMD testing, regardless of gender, subsequently received more BMD testing and OP treatments. Furthermore, increasing the distance between a patient's residence and BMD facility precluded likelihood of BMD testing. CONCLUSION: BMD testing rate was extremely low but not completely explained by reduced physical access; gender, age, social status, prior BMD testing and OP treatment were all important predictors for future BMD testing and OP treatment.
10795960	0	a	"This paper is an introduction to the various contributions in this special issue of Social Science & Medicine which are an attempt to synthesise the main debates of the 2nd European Conference on Social and Behavioural Research on AIDS held in Paris, in January 1998. The paper discusses how the recent advent of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) and new trends in the epidemic (its concentration in the socially most vulnerable groups and countries) have affected the research agenda of European social and behavioural sciences (SBS) in HIV/AIDS. Questions which had already been thoroughly studied by SBS (like determinants of HIV-related risk behaviours, or impact of gender and socio-economic inequities as well as discrimination on the diffusion of HIV) will have to be ""revisited"" in light of these recent changes. New issues (such as risk behaviours among already infected patients. impact of therapeutic advances on psychosocial and daily life management of their disease by people living with HIV/AIDS, adherence to treatment, or ""normalisation"" of AIDS public policies) will have to be strongly and quickly dealt with, in order for SSB to keep the pace with the rapid evolution of the epidemic and of the societal responses to it. Finally, the paper argues that to face these challenges, new theoretical and methodological advances will have to go beyond the classical oppositions in internal debates among SSB between individualistic and holistic approaches, or between radical criticism of the existing state of the world and practical involvement in public health decision-making."
3232413	1	a	With the aging of populations in developing countries there is both a demographic and an epidemiological transition which affects the impact of chronic degenerative diseases on the health status of the populations. Demographic transition takes place in countries where there are effective programmes of disease control which allow for survival during the early years of childhood and adolescence. This results in an increase in life expectancy which places larger proportions of the population in the age range (60 years and older) in which chronic degenerative diseases become the major determinants of health status. Epidemiological transition in diseases may also be brought about by shifts in social and economic patterns which favour detrimental changes in risk factors for the chronic degenerative diseases. Such changes may include health-related behaviour which augments dietary consumption of fats and alcohol, increases obesity, increases smoking and decreases physical activity. Such changes in risk-factor levels increase the prevalence of chronic degenerative diseases which manifest themselves at later ages, and for which early preventive actions could be cost-effective. In order to illustrate the impact of both demographic and risk-factor effects, analyses are made of the impact of increases in life expectancy on cause-specific mortality in both developing and developed countries. It is shown that there is great similarity in the effect of major noncommunicable diseases on the life expectancy of adults in both developed and developing countries. The major differences are seen to be in the proportions of deaths expected from such diseases as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cirrhosis; but not in the distribution of age at death which is the better measure of disease impact. Demographic analyses, computing indirect estimates of mortality, also demonstrate that there are currently more chronic disease deaths in developing than developed countries and that as expectation of life increases in developing countries the global chronic disease burden will be greatly concentrated in the developing countries. Analyses of risk-factor reduction by feasible intervention strategies, e.g. smoking cessation campaigns, treatment of high blood pressure, using relationships between risk factors and diseases established in longitudinal studies carried out in developed countries, point out that the effect of risk-factor control in long-living populations can be hidden by the dependency of risk factors and various related causes of death, e.g. smoking has an impact on lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and emphysema, but at different ages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3293236	1	a	Cancer of the esophagus poses a unique challenge for students of cancer prevention. The role of nutritional determinants and other environmental factors in modulating esophageal cancer has received increasing support from data collected during the last decades. Ecologic, geographic, economic, and cultural variables appear to be collectively operational in determining the nutritional profiles of high-risk populations in the Asian esophageal cancer belt and discrete hyperendemic pockets throughout the world. Altering dietary staples, preventing food contamination by mycotoxins, using molybdenum as a chemical fertilizer, modifying social habits, and adding deficient micronutrients to diets of high-risk groups will potentially avert the development of this devastating malignant neoplasm.
6695831	1	a	The association between duration of breast-feeding and nutritional status was studied in a population-based sample of 802 children aged 12 to 35.9 months in Southern Brazil during 1982. The prevalence of malnutrition (low weight for age, length for age, and weight for length) was smallest in those children breast-fed for 3 to 6 months, but after this age nutritional status appeared to be worse in those breast-fed for longer. Children still being breast-fed at the time of the survey presented with a significantly higher prevalence of low weight for length than those who had been totally weaned, and those receiving breast-plus bottle-feeding presented with intermediate levels. This association could not be explained by a number of possible confounding variables using a multiple logistic regression analysis. These results are also consistent with a controlled trial on supplementary feeding in the Sudan.
10301136	1	a	The mid-1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe--and other parts of the world--a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches.
3989430	1	a	The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats.
15918661	0	a	Our knowledge of juvenile delinquency has progressed considerably since the early 1980s, thanks to self-reported delinquency surveys. They teach us that the determinants of delinquent behaviors among teenagers are dependent on the facility with which the offense is committed, the internal motivation (frustration in the family and school, observational learning of the use of violence in the media) and the weakness of social reactions.
14502860	0	a	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the prevalence of ischemic stroke, little is known regarding driving resumption and its determinants after stroke. This study documents driving resumption poststroke and describes the relationship between specific variables and driving resumption. METHOD: Between May 2001 and January 2002, 110 consecutive patients admitted to Hartford Hospital with acute ischemic stroke, who had driven during the month before admission, were enrolled in this cohort study. Stroke outcome measures including the NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form (SF-12), COOPS social support scale, and an original questionnaire were administered. Patients were followed up at three and six months to establish poststroke driving status. The relationship between driving resumption and the predictor variables was determined using correlations (point-biserial and phi coefficients) and forward multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty (50%) of the surveyed patients resumed driving within one month of their strokes. The best logistic regression model (R2 = 0.391) for predicting resumption of driving after stroke included the variables prestroke driving frequency (OR = 7.74 [2.47-24.3]), poststroke Barthel Index score (OR = 1.16 [1.06-1.27]), and marital status (OR = 3.55 [1.28-9.83]). CONCLUSION: Resumption of driving is early after mild strokes. Factors other than the specific consequences of the stroke contribute to the prediction of driving resumption. While factors such as prestroke driving frequency, functional independence and marital status should not be used as a sanction for driving resumption, they offer insights to individuals who are likely to resume driving early after an ischemic stroke.
17905053	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Sickness absence is a major occupational health problem, but evidence for associations between potentially modifiable psychosocial work factors and sickness absence is still scarce. We studied the impact of relational justice and effort-reward imbalance on subsequent rates of sickness absence. METHODS: The Whitehall II prospective cohort study of British civil servants, 10,308 men and women, was established between 1985 and 1988. Indicators of effort-reward imbalance and the relational component of organizational justice were constructed from questions included at baseline. Participants were classified into three groups (low, intermediate, and high) for both effort-reward imbalance and relational justice. Short (< or =7 days) and long (>7 days) spells of sickness absence during 1985-1989 and 1991-1995 were used to study immediate and longer term effects of work characteristics. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, employment grade, and baseline health, men and women with low relational justice had increased risks of long spells of sickness absence of 14% and 28% in comparison to men and women experiencing high levels of justice. Similar effect sizes (25% and 21%) were found for high vs. low effort-reward imbalance. Both work measures also predicted short spells of sickness absence. Effort-reward imbalance (men and women) and relational justice (women only) each predicted long spells of sickness absence independently of the other. CONCLUSIONS: Both relational justice and effort-reward imbalance are important determinants of sickness absence. Workplace interventions to improve these aspects of working conditions have the potential to reduce levels of sickness absence.
6706795	1	a	A longitudinal study of the changes in health-related behavior in Israeli adolescents was undertaken in a large, comprehensive secondary school. The incidence of starting to smoke and its relationship to the development of sexual behavior was assessed. Smoking, use of drugs, sexual behavior, and drinking of alcoholic beverages at the age of 16 years was related to dropout from secondary school during the 2-year study period. The possibility of developing a model of adolescent risk behavior and its relevance to planning of health and educational services is discussed.
6148471	1	a	A cohort of homosexual men at high risk of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was monitored to examine the relation between lifestyle, clinical conditions, T-lymphocyte subsets, and antibody to the AIDS-associated human retrovirus, human T-cell leukaemia virus III (HTLV-III). HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS.
3276981	1	a	The growth of dental health services over the past 15 years has produced several issues in dentistry. Because economic markets are the cornerstone of dental delivery in the US, informed responses to these issues require a thorough understanding of dental-care markets. The empirical literature is reviewed to examine the structure of dental markets, to assess the major determinants of market equilibrium, and to examine the social and health consequences of dental-care markets. Results reveal that while dental markets are imperfectly competitive, it is unclear whether prices exceed competitive levels. Little is known about the effects of dental markets on public oral health and society. Future research is proposed in two broad areas: 1) updating early studies conducted when few Americans had dental insurance benefits; and 2) path-breaking research to advance our knowledge of dental-care markets in particular and medical-care markets in general.
19142700	0	a	Primate socioecological studies have attempted to derive general frameworks using the average behavioural traits of species or genera to place them into categories. However, with the accumulation of primate studies, it is timely to place more emphasis on understanding within-species variation in social structure. In this review we have four objectives. First, we examine within-species variation in the potential determinants of social structure, including diet, demography, predation and infanticide, and document considerable variation. Second, we present case studies of within-species variation in social structure to illustrate the potential magnitude of this variation. For example, there are cases within a single interbreeding population where multi-male, uni-male, fission-fusion and monogamous groups are found. Third, by examining widespread primate lineages that occur in a variety of habitats, we note that there are differences in the magnitude of variation in social structures across different lineages and as a result we consider phylogenetic constraints on phenotypic variation in social structure. Finally, we reflect on the implications of extensive variation in social structure. We suggest that primate social structure will represent a combination of adaptation to present-day environment and phylogenetic inertia. To advance our understanding of the relative contribution of phylogeny versus ecology we propose two approaches. One approach is to compare groups in the same interbreeding population that inhabit different ecological conditions. Any differences that are found can be attributed to ecological differences, since phylogeny should not play a role within a single population. The second approach is to study distantly related species that have similar social structures to illustrate how similar ecological pressures might be operating to select for parallel social structures.

Sixteen generations of equipment later, Dr Fernandez Yero heads the 21-year-old Immunoassay Center, a leader in the field of medical technology for population health. The road traveled has not been an easy one, lack of resources threatening delays and detours along the way. He shares his thoughts with MEDICC Review on his work, the meaning of appropriate technology and the challenges he foresees ahead."
3453175	1	a	"To explore the psychosocial determinants of breast self-examination (BSE) among women, we studied a stratified random sample of 264 women students, faculty, and staff in a university community. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported frequency of BSE, and predictors included measures of general health predispositions, variables of the Health Belief Model, the impact of a woman's social network, a set of secondary non-health-related barriers and benefits, and the woman's evaluation of her personal health care system. Analysis of the data showed strong relationships between most of the predictor variables and BSE. Regression analysis showed that variables measuring a woman's recent experience in the health care system were stronger predictors of BSE practice than intrapersonal ""health belief"" variables. However, the independent variables included in the regression accounted for almost 35 percent of the total variance in BSE practice."
20025778	0	a	BACKGROUND: Substantial empirical evidence has demonstrated that individuals who are socially isolated or have few positive social connections seem to age at a faster rate and have more chronic diseases. Oxytocin is a neurohypophyseal hormone hypothesized to coordinate both the causes and effects of positive social interactions, and may be involved in positive physiological adaptations such as buffering the deleterious effects of stress and promoting resilience. The proposed research will examine whether and how oxytocin influences responses to stress in humans and will consider effects in relation to those of social support. METHODS/DESIGN: Experimental research will be used to determine whether exogenously administered oxytocin (intranasal) influences psychological and physiological outcomes under conditions of stress across gender and age in adulthood. Hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Oxytocin ameliorates the deleterious neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and subjective effects of stress; 2) Oxytocin and social support have similar and additive stress-buffering effects; 3) Oxytocin effects are stronger in women versus men; and 4) Oxytocin effects are similar across a range of adult ages. Hypotheses will be tested with a placebo-controlled, double-blind study using a sample of healthy men and women recruited from the community. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either oxytocin or placebo. They undergo a social stress manipulation with and without social support (randomly assigned), and outcome measures are obtained at multiple times during the procedure. DISCUSSION: Understanding the determinants of healthy aging is a major public health priority and identifying effective measures to prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases is an important goal. Experimental research on oxytocin, social relationships, and health in adulthood will contribute to the scientific knowledge base for maximizing active life and health expectancy. At conclusion of the study we will have solid evidence concerning the effects of oxytocin on stress response and whether it has similar effects across age and gender groups. A neurobiological understanding of resilience can inform efforts for both prevention and intervention of diseases or problems common in later life.
3053480	1	a	"The offense-defense dichotomy undeniably proved to be of heuristic interest in that it allowed relevant distinctions between specific behaviour patterns, to establish correlations between situations in which either ""offensive"" or ""defensive"" patterns are likely to be displayed, and to uncover differential drug effects on those distinct behavior patterns. But for a number of reasons, the author is led to conclude that even though the offense-defense dichotomy indeed helps in many instances to describe and to distinguish, it has rather limited potential really to explain in depth what it distinguishes at a phenomenological level of investigation."
15357207	0	a	As a consequence of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, 30% of victims may develop chronic Chagas disease, which presents a spectrum of pathology including cardiomyopathy, megacolon and megaesophagus. The outcome of infection in a particular individual is the result of a set of complex interactions among the host genetic background, environmental and social factors, and the genetic composition of the parasite, all of which can be complicated by mixed infections and re-infections. Initially we consider what is known about the genetic structure and biological properties of the protozoan. Currently, six distinct subgroups have been characterized by different combinations of four distinct genotypic classes. The recent demonstration of genetic exchange via non-meiotic cell fusion illustrates a mechanism by which maintained heterogeneous polyploidy may have been generated in these parasites. Subsequently, we consider factors in humans and in experimental mouse-infection and tissue culture models that have contributed to our understanding of the host's susceptibility or resistance to disease. Identification of the direct players in host-pathogen interactions at the establishment and chronic phases of the disease is perhaps the best hope of a clinical handle for treatment. At some point in the future, these disparate areas of study will have to come together. It is to be hoped that this scientific fusion will result in better prognosis and treatment of Chagas disease.
3239150	1	a	"The interaction of environmental housing conditions and personality traits on life-satisfaction in late adulthood is studied. ""Life satisfaction"", ""extraversion"", ""neuroticism"", and ""locus of control"" of 52 persons (aged 65-85 years old) living in different environments (private house, retired home, self organized community) are measured. A multiple regression analysis shows that satisfaction is rather more predictable from personality traits than from housing conditions. The variance of satisfaction scores can be explained, to 64% by the ""person factor"". In different living environments different pattern of traits predict satisfaction."
17126972	0	a	This paper reviews the nexus between poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa using a sustainable livelihood framework. Much of the literature on HIV and AIDS has generated an almost universal consensus that the AIDS epidemic is having an immense impact on the economies of hard-hit countries, hurting not only individuals, families and firms, but also significantly slowing economic growth and worsening poverty. International evidence has concentrated on the pathways through which HIV/AIDS undermines livelihoods and raises vulnerability to future collapse of livelihoods. Yet, little attention has been paid to the role that social relations and livelihood strategies can play in bringing about risky social interaction that raises the chance of contracting HIV. Using the sustainable livelihood and social relation approaches, this article demonstrates that although AIDS is not simply a disease of the poor, determinants of the epidemic go far beyond individual volition and that some dimensions of being poor increase risk and vulnerability to HIV.
14758854	0	a	The geographic distribution of health status across Italian regions shows a North-South gradient, with better conditions in the North for both males and females. Using data from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey, the authors first analyze the geographic variation in subjective health and presence of chronic conditions, with specific attention to the effects of individual and area-based socioeconomic conditions and their heterogeneity across regions. The results suggest the North-South gradient in health is mainly affected, at least for subjective health, by the different composition of macro-areas with respect to individual education, and is slightly influenced by contextual circumstances. Moreover, being less educated results in poorer health in some regions (mainly South and Isles) than in others (mainly Northeast). The authors next analyze the circumstances affecting the presence of more disadvantaged people in the South, to highlight features of the Southern context that might exacerbate social inequalities in health and features of Northern areas that might allay them. Indicators of inequalities, welfare, labor, and power resources were analyzed. The results confirm the disadvantage of the South in terms of social, economic, and cultural features, mainly revealing the compositional effects found in the first part of the study. However, the contextual predictive value of income inequalities, quality of care, and social cohesion can have a supplementary effect on health outcomes of disadvantaged persons.
17999706	0	a	AIMS: The health hazards and prevalence of ecstasy use have been documented in two decades of research, but no review reporting on potentially modifiable antecedents of use is available. The aim of this study was to integrate systematically research identifying cognitive correlates of ecstasy use. Such research has the potential to identify targets for evidence-based interventions designed to discourage use. METHODS: The databases PsycINFO and MedLine were searched, inclusion criteria applied to resulting hits, and descendency and ancestry approaches applied to the selected publications. Reported associations between cognitive determinants, including intention to use and ecstasy use measures, were synthesized by calculating a weighted mean effect size, r. RESULTS: The pattern of associations lent support both to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the expectancy approach as descriptions of potentially useful determinants. Attitudes were associated most strongly with intention and use, followed by subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the strength of associations and the potential modifiability of identified cognitions suggests that evidence-based interventions to discourage ecstasy use should target negative expectancies, perceived behavioural control and anticipated regret, and consider tailoring perceived behavioural control elements.
15256519	0	a	BACKGROUND: Stature is an important determinant of several reproductive and non-reproductive health problems. Documentation of secular trends in stature has been based primarily on cross-sectional studies of special populations, primarily of men. The objective of this study is to determine how growth and socio-economic status (SES) factors relate to stature changes among lineal female relatives, maternal grandmothers to mothers. METHODS: The study base was derived from a population-based intergenerational cohort which linked several statewide databases to data from the mothers' own birth certificates: the Washington State Intergenerational Cohort. Mothers in these ethnic groups were separately studied: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association between stature and other growth and SES factors. RESULTS: A mother's stature is determined partly by her own mother's stature and partly by her birthweight. These two measures are individually stronger predictors of stature than are several available SES factors considered in combination-grandmother's age, parity, marital status, and mother's age. The maximal multiple correlation models yielded R2 values from 18% to 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Growth measures are stronger predictors of intergenerational changes in stature than are the several available socio-economic factors. However, socio-economic factors are partly responsible for the level of achieved prenatal and postnatal growth. Since grandmother's stature is a determinant of mother's birthweight, which in turn is a determinant of infant birthweight, some environmentally influenced determinants of some birth outcomes are already established before a prospective mother is conceived or born.
12281546	1	a	"""This paper links data obtained from a one-in-five systematic sample of New Zealand divorce files covering the period 1940-78 with published marriage and birth statistics to examine socio-demographic differentials in divorce rates among couples married between 1939 and 1973. Differentials investigated are those by age at marriage, relative age of bride and groom, marital status prior to marriage, relative marital status of bride and groom, pregnancy status of the wife at marriage, timing of the first birth, religion, country of birth and socioeconomic status. Several findings of overseas studies, such as the special proneness to divorce of very youthful marriages and remarriages following previous divorces, are verified for New Zealand. After controlling for age at marriage, pregnancy does not seem to have directly increased the risk of divorce."""
11020935	0	a	In Bangladesh, the total fertility rate declined from more than six children per woman of reproductive age in 1980 to 3.3 children per woman in 1996. Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decision making to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning.
3806448	1	a	Social psychological models of health care behaviour frequently take as their starting point perception of the illness. This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed.
3384511	1	a	Empirical data on Japanese American drinking behavior are scarce. The present study was a random sample (N = 295) of households in Los Angeles with Japanese surnames. Japanese Americans born in the United States tended to drink less than those born in Japan. The study also observed significant gender differences in Japanese American drinking behavior which were attributed to ascribed social roles. Other demographic and social determinants of drinking were examined through two logistic regression models. The first model predicted drinking (as opposed to abstaining), while the other distinguished heavy drinkers from those who drank alcohol in more moderate amounts. Potential reference groups (e.g., parents, friends, church groups, etc.) were often significant in predicting whether and how much a Japanese American drank.
7020985	1	a	The association between reported alcohol intake and plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration is examined in an effort to establish whether it was a cause-and-effect basis. A cross-sectional descriptive study of several populations reveals a strong and consistent dose-response pattern: Social drinkers have mean HDL cholesterol levels that are higher than those of teetotalers by as much as 33%. Cross-sectional analyses in another epidemiological study reveal the association to be independent of potential confounding factors such as smoking and body weight, and longitudinal analyses suggest that it is also not a result of certain unmeasured sources of confounding. A small experiment reveals a 15% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels among social drinkers who abstain from alcohol from a 2-week period. The evidence supports the conclusion that alcohol habits are probably one of the determinants of plasma HDL cholesterol level. A clarification of the relevance of this phenomenon to clinical medicine awaits future clinical efforts.
15791922	0	a	Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting girls, caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. There are no population-based data on the extent and determinants of health service use in this disorder. The population-based registry, the Australian Rett Syndrome database, was the source of phenotype data. This also contains data from mutation screening and X-inactivation studies. Data on retrospective (n = 152) and prospective (n = 162) health service use were collected in 2000 from a questionnaire and a calendar study, respectively. Health service use was highest in younger cases (P = .001) and lowest in cases with milder phenotypes (P < .001). Random X-inactivation was associated with service use (P = .02). Maternal education, phenotype, and individual mutations were determinants of health service use. The use of a retrospective and prospective data set enabled accurate assessment of service use in Rett syndrome. Both genetic and sociodemographic determinants of health service use were identified, with important implications for the optimal and equitable management of children with Rett syndrome.
7282978	1	a	The psychogenesis of anality is in the psychosexual events of the second year of life. An analysis of that phase of development centers on the biological determinants of psychological development, specifically on the erotization of the excretory functions. The social structures interfering with this process are examined. The interrelationship of feces, child, and penis are analyzed within the context of the total libidinal spectrum of development and object relations. Bipolarity is seen as an integral facet of the anal character, manifested in the retentive-eliminative continuum and in the aggressive-erotic divergences. These trends are examined in detail vis-a-vis the ultimate ossification of the anal adult. In this context, the percept of anal-sadism is introduced and alternate interpretations of the phenomenon are suggested. Various characteristics frequently associated with anal characterology are discussed and an attempt is made to demarcate the status (as integral or peripheral) of these traits. Sociocultural contingencies of anality are also considered, particularly with regard to Western institutions. The major pathological maladaptions related to anality are detailed. These include the obsessions and rigid superego development, paranoia, and homosexuality. The status of anality is then evaluated from the ego-psychological perspective, and interpersonal and societal factors are considered. What emerges is a unitary construct of anality which incorporates both erotism and characterology.
2785722	1	a	In contrast to social, religious, and economic determinants of acceptance and sustained use of family planning in developing countries, perceived side effects resulting from reproductive tract infections can usually be ameliorated easily and expeditiously. This population-based study examines the magnitude and nature of morbidity due to reproductive tract infections among users of various contraceptive methods and among nonusers in a rural community in Bangladesh. Overall, 22 percent of the 2,929 women surveyed reported symptoms of reproductive tract infection. Of the 472 symptomatic women examined, 68 percent had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection. Users of intrauterine devices and tubectomy were each approximately four times as likely to report symptoms and seven times as likely to have examination-confirmed infection as nonusers. The epidemiology of reproductive tract infections in this population is addressed, and the findings are discussed in terms of their potential programmatic impact.

11217704	0	a	MEGA is the chemical workplace exposure database of the Institute for Occupational Safety (BIA) of the German Berufsgenossenschaften (BG) (statutory accident institutions for insurance and prevention). On the legal basis of the social insurance law the inspectorates of the BGs conduct workplace measurements of chemical and biological agents. The BGs have cooperated with BIA within the Berufsgenossenschaftliches Messsystem Gefahrstoffe--BGMG since 1972: measurements are done by the BGs, analyses and data processing are the tasks of BIA. In 1999 31,000 measurements with 68,000 analyses were taken in 4,000 enterprises. All data are stored in the MEGA-database with up to 150 pieces of information (describing type of workplace, working conditions, measured substances, sampling strategy, sampling duration, sampling and analytical method etc.), for each result. MEGA contains today about 1,000,000 measurements of more than 400 substances starting in 1972. MEGA is used by BIA and the BGs for the following purposes: prevention (e.g., identification of hazards, efficiency of exposure reducing measures, determination of technical criteria for exposure limit values), epidemiological questions, and investigations of occupational diseases. In the framework of the measuring and inspection activities and tasks of the inspectorates of the BGs the locations for measurements are not randomly selected, but are based on criteria such as supposed critical exposure situations or testing the efficiency of exposure reducing measures. Nevertheless, a statistical appraisal of the data is possible for different purposes considering the specific determinants of the results, as, for example, classification of enterprises (sectors), workplaces (activities, tasks), used materials, and products. The MEGA-database will be further developed into a multifactorial exposure database with additional data on biological exposure to bacteria and funghi, but also noise and other data.
3669072	1	a	This study employed multivariate analyses and structural modeling procedures to examine a model for the determinants of adherence to medical regimens. Fifty adult hypertensive patients at a health maintenance organization completed questionnaires and participated in home interviews over a 10-week period. Knowledge of medical regimens, information communication between the patient and the medical professionals, satisfaction with health-care providers, health locus of control, social support, and treatment disruption to life-style were assessed. Adherence was assessed through self-report and behavioral (i.e., pill-count ratio, percentage of kept medical appointments) indices. Finally, repeated blood-pressure measurements were obtained. Structural modeling procedures revealed that greater expectancy for internal control over health and hypertension, greater knowledge of the treatment regimen, and stronger social support were significant determinants of adherence; in turn, higher levels of adherence facilitated blood-pressure reduction.
18556168	0	a	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this exploratory study was to test the applicability of a theoretical model to develop patient-related interventions. In this model knowledge, psychosocial mediators, self-efficacy and behaviour are determinants of patient-related interventions. METHODS: The model was tested on 278 patients with mild or moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recruited in a primary care setting. Hierarchical regression analyses were applied using data from self-reported questionnaires and clinical data from an electronic data registry. RESULTS: Knowledge, psychosocial mediators, self-efficacy and behaviour proved to be, to a moderate degree, predictors of outcomes in COPD care. Moreover, physical activity appeared to be a significant predictor for all clinical and functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Theoretically expected associations of patient-related interventions are existent in patients with mild or moderate COPD. The application of theoretical models in designing patient-directed interventions in COPD care is therefore feasible. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More attention should be paid to the patterns of physical activity in patients with mild to moderate COPD. The results of this study are also useful in the development of patient-related interventions. Future interventions should be designed along the lines of theory on behaviour change, such as social cognitive theory.
17959411	0	a	The influence of socio-economic determinants among the elderly is a complex subject. Although they rely on pension income, the wealth that they have accumulated over their lifetime (primarily housing assets), jointly with housing-related determinants, could have a more significant effect on health production. Hence, owning a house has more potential than income for reducing health inequalities. This study makes use of a representative cross-sectional database on the Spanish population aged 55 or over. Using a continuous variable to measure health and a measure of disabilities in old age, the study explores some socio-economic determinants of health and disability and provides a breakdown of inequalities in socio-economic status and in aggregate individual health. The study's findings indicate that housing equity overrides the effect of income as a determinant of health and (absence of) disability in old age. Furthermore, housing assets account for more than 90% of socio-economic inequalities and 54% of inequalities in disability.
2911699	1	a	A study of well-being in middle-aged and elderly spinal cord injured persons (Decker & Schulz, 1985) found that long-term coping was facilitated by the presence of a primary support person or caregiver. The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of life satisfaction and depression in 67 primary caregivers of middle-aged and elderly spinal cord injured persons. The study revealed that the availability of social support and feelings of control over one's life were important determinants of caregivers' well-being. In addition, those caregivers spending more time each day assisting the disabled person and feeling burdened by these responsibilities experienced more depression and less life satisfaction. In working with spinal cord injured persons, rehabilitation nurses must consider the well-being of the spinal cord injured person/primary caregiver dyad as an important focus of nursing assessment and intervention.
6736597	1	a	"This article analyzes and criticizes the "" technocratic "" view of occupational health and safety policies, which sees the values of the personnel in ""post-industrial"" regulatory agencies as the most important determinant of those policies. It takes an alternate position, which explains occupational health and safety policies as primarily resulting from the different degrees of political power of the two major classes (capital and labor), and from the set of influences exerted on the regulatory agencies by the instruments (e.g., parties, unions, trade organizations) of those classes. It shows how an analysis of the historical evolution of those classes in Sweden and their conflict in both civil and political societies explains Swedish occupational health and safety policies better than a mere analysis of the regulators' views. And it concludes that the occupational health and safety policies in Sweden are not identical to those in the U.S.--as the "" technocratic "" theorists assume--but rather offer more protection to the workers than U.S. policies do. This situation is a result of labor having more power in Sweden than it has in the U.S. The different class formations and class behavior in the two societies are compared, and the implications of this comparison for occupational health and safety policies are discussed."
19968876	0	a	BACKGROUND: A large proportion of people living with hip or knee pain do not consult health care professionals. Pain severity is often believed to be the main reason for help seeking in this population; however the evidence for this is contradictory. This study explores the importance of several potential risk factors on help seeking across different practitioner groups, among adults living with chronic hip or knee pain in a large community sample. METHODS: Health care utilization, defined as having seen a family doctor (GP) during the past 12 months; or an allied health professional (AHP) or alternative therapist during the past 3 months, was assessed in a community based sample aged 35 or over and reporting pain in hip or knee. Adjusted odds ratios were determined for social deprivation, rurality, pain severity, mobility, anxiety/depression, co-morbidities, and body mass index. RESULTS: Of 1119 persons reporting hip or knee pain, 52% had pain in both sites. Twenty-five percent of them had seen a doctor only, 3% an AHP only, and 4% an alternative therapist only. Thirteen percent had seen more than one category of health care professionals, and 55% had not seen any health care professional. In the multivariate model, factors associated with consulting a GP were mobility problems (OR 2.62 (1.64-4.17)), urban living (OR 2.40 (1.14-5.04) and pain severity (1.28 (1.13-1.44)). There was also some evidence that obesity was associated with increased consultation (OR 1.72 (1.00-2.93)). Factors were similar for consultation with a combination of several health care professionals. In contrast, seeing an alternative therapist was negatively associated with pain severity, anxiety and mobility problems (adjusting for age and sex). CONCLUSION: Disability appears to be a more important determinant of help-seeking than pain severity or anxiety and depression, for adults with chronic pain in hip or knee. The determinants of seeking help from alternative practitioners are different from determinants of consulting GPs, AHPs or a combination of different health care providers.
11472446	0	a	AIMS: Many psycho-social factors can affect the glycaemic control of children with Type 1 diabetes, but the influence of the intelligence of the child and their parents has not been reported. METHODS: Seventy-eight children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and their mothers performed standardized tests to assess psychometric intelligence. The children were aged (median (range)) 12.0 (5-17) years with duration of diabetes 5.0 (1.0-13.0) years and required an insulin dose of (mean +/- SD) 1.0 +/- 0.3 U/kg per day. The children completed the Wide Range Achievement Test 3 reading test (WRAT3) and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM). A mean annual HbA1c was calculated for each subject (8.6 +/- 1.4%). The mothers performed the National Adult Reading Test (NART) and provided details of the occupation of the main wage-earner in the family from which social class (SC) was derived. RESULTS: The HbA1c of the child correlated with their age (r = 0.26, P = 0.02), SC (Kendall's rank correlation, tau = 0.17, P = 0.03) and with the NART error score of their mother (r = 0.28, P = 0.01), but no correlation was observed with the child's WRAT3 or RSPM score. Stepwise regression revealed that age and NART error score were the strongest independent determinants of glycaemic control (total adjusted r2 = 0.117). CONCLUSIONS: Parental intelligence appears to have a significant influence on the glycaemic control of a child with Type 1 diabetes, accounting for 7.6% of the reliable variance in HbA1c.
3563565	1	a	Patient-practitioner transactions in the ambulatory setting have become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years. In particular, there is growing interest in providing empirical support for our anecdotal, 'common-sense' notions that clinical encounter experiences are a major determinant of outcomes such as the patient's satisfaction with the encounter. The present study was designed to look at this issue and addressed the following two research questions: Is there a relationship between fulfillment of patient requests for services and patient satisfaction with the clinical encounter? and What degree of satisfaction is explained by the qualities of the encounter as compared to the characteristics of the patient, physician, and system of health care? Four newly-developed instruments were administered to a convenience sample of 144 adult patients and their physicians prior to and following actual visits to a University Family Practice Center. Meeting patients' requests increased their satisfaction with the encounter. At least 19% of the variance in patient satisfaction could be attributed to request fulfillment. The implications of these findings for future research into the doctor-patient relationship are discussed.
18390845	0	a	Schools are overloaded with health promotion programs that, altogether, focus on a broad array of behavioral domains, including substance abuse, sexuality and nutrition. Although the specific content of programs varies according to the domain focus, programs usually address similar concepts: knowledge, attitudinal beliefs, social influences and skills. This apparent conceptual overlap between behaviors and programs provides opportunities for a transfer-oriented approach which will stimulate students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in one domain (e.g. skills for resisting tobacco use) to other domains (e.g. alcohol, sex). A requirement for such an approach is that behaviors share at least some determinants. This review addresses this issue by examining similarities between domain-specific determinants of smoking, drinking, safe sex and healthy nutrition among adolescents. Recent empirical studies and reviews were examined. The results show that the following determinants are relevant to all four behaviors: beliefs about immediate gratification and social advantages, peer norms, peer and parental modeling and refusal self-efficacy. Several other determinants have been found to relate to at least two behaviors, e.g. health risk beliefs and parental norms. These results can be used for the development of a transfer-oriented school health promotion curriculum.
3730318	1	a	This paper presents findings concerning variables expected to influence the motivation of persons caring for a dementing relative in the community to continue giving care and support. The variables examined in relation to 'preference for institutional care' were those previously examined in relation to supporters' psychological well-being (Gilhooly, 1984). The results indicate that factors within the relationship between supporter and the dependent dementing relative are important determinants of motivation to continue giving support. Other variables significantly associated with advocacy of institutional care included the age of the supporter, supporter's contacts with friends, satisfaction with help from relatives, another dependent relative, and whether or not the supporter was employed. Help from the services and supporters' well-being were not significantly correlated with ratings of preference for institutional care.
16004700	0	a	BACKGROUND: Little work has been published on short-term inpatient treatments combining the virtues of inpatient treatments and short-term psychotherapy. The purposes of this study are to (a) determine the outcomes of short-term psychodynamic inpatient psychotherapy from patients' and therapists' perspectives, (b) assess the stability of changes, and (c) identify predictors of long-term outcome. METHODS: 83 consecutive inpatients (76% of those eligible) were assessed at intake, discharge, and 1 year follow-up by standardized questionnaires regarding symptoms (SCL-90R), interpersonal problems (IIP), object relationships (IPO), and the therapeutic relationship (HAQ). Diagnoses and functioning (GAF) were assessed by the therapists. RESULTS: Psychological distress (effect size S = 1.14) and physical complaints (ES = 1.03) decreased strongly from intake to discharge, the majority of patients moving from the pathological to the normal range of the global severity index GSI (SCL-90R). At follow-up, average distress remained at a low level, and the majority of patients, and their therapists and physicians, regarded their well-being as improved. In a multivariate approach, a substantial proportion of variance of the distress at follow-up (42%) was explained by an infantile object relationship pattern (IPO), social avoidance (IIP), negative vocational changes, and a lack of a confidant at follow-up. A delayed start of subsequent ambulatory psychotherapy was another negative outcome predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Attention should be given to maladaptive interpersonal relationship patterns, to vocational reintegration, and a confiding relationship as potential predictors of long-term outcome. Also, patterns of ambulatory after-care following inpatient treatment need further scrutiny.
3989430	1	a	The public health movement has been concerned with the relation between housing and health for well over a century. Nevertheless the Black Report still identified housing as one of the major causes of ill-health and suggested, on one indicator at least, that council housing is the least healthy form of tenure. An exploratory study concerning housing and health in a north eastern local authority area is described. It was found that smoking, work experience, and age were the most important determinants of self assessed respiratory conditions. When the background factors were held constant people in areas of 'bad' housing were found to report more respiratory symptoms than those in 'good' housing areas. Respiratory conditions were affected by the age of housing, and flats were found to be worse than houses. High rise flats were worse than low or medium rise flats.
6984992	1	a	The hypothesis that social indices and educational level of mother are potential sources of childhood malnutrition was tested in Kampumbu, Zambia. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, protein and albumin levels in children were studied in relation to malnutrition. Six hundred and fifty rural children (306 males and 344 females) aged one and fourteen years exposed to various types of diet and environmental factors were selected randomly. Data on economic status, diet environment and educational attainment as well as other demographic information were collected. The major epidemiological findings were that the difference in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by income) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis was significant (X2 = 4.1, P less than 0.025), and the relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Similarly, there was a very significant difference (X2 = 7.4, P less than 0.005) in the distribution of malnourished children by socio-economic status (as measured by house grades) and hypochromotrichia, oedema or stomatitis. The estimated relative odds were significantly greater than unity at 0.05 level. Other variables, including age, history of hookworm, were not found to be determinants of risk for malnutrition.
16251223	0	a	A systematic review was conducted to examine the barriers to, and facilitators of, healthy eating among young people (11-16 years). The review focused on the wider determinants of health, examining community- and society-level interventions. Seven outcome evaluations and eight studies of young people's views were included. The effectiveness of the interventions was mixed, with improvements in knowledge and increases in healthy eating but differences according to gender. Barriers to healthy eating included poor school meal provision and ease of access to, relative cheapness of and personal taste preferences for fast food. Facilitators included support from family, wider availability of healthy foods, desire to look after one's appearance and will-power. Friends and teachers were generally not a common source of information. Some of the barriers and facilitators identified by young people had been addressed by soundly evaluated effective interventions, but significant gaps were identified where no evaluated interventions appear to have been published (e.g. better labelling of food products), or where there were no methodologically sound evaluations. Rigorous evaluation is required particularly to assess the effectiveness of increasing the availability of affordable healthy food in the public and private spaces occupied by young people.
12339589	1	a	"""This article surveys significant changes in fertility and nuptiality in Central and Western Europe since the middle of the 19th century.

17157105	0	a	BACKGROUND: In France, the 1999 introduction of a dedicated emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) available without a prescription has resulted in a 72% increase in its use over the past 5 years, especially among younger women. METHODS: We used a population-based health survey conducted in 1999 and in 2004 to examine the changes in the determinants of lifetime ECP use among women aged between 15 and 24 years. We also explored the determinants and circumstances of recent use of ECPs in 2004 among women aged between 15 and 44 years who are at risk for unplanned pregnancy. RESULTS: In 1999, 14.6% of women aged between 15 and 24 years had ever used ECPs; this proportion rose to 31.7% in 2004. Results show consistent patterns of lifetime ECP use in 1999 and in 2004, with greater use among higher-educated women and women living in large cities. In 2004, 22% of women were using no contraceptive at the time they used ECPs and 84% resumed use of a regular contraceptive after ECP use. However, 5.5% had unprotected intercourse after taking ECPs in the same menstrual cycle and in the next. CONCLUSION: Despite direct pharmacy access, differences in ECP use remain by social and residential status. Emergency contraceptive pills were used as a backup method in case of contraceptive failure and did not impede the use of subsequent regular contraception.
3729384	1	a	This study evaluated methods for empirically identifying environmental determinants of aggressive and disruptive behavior in three developmentally delayed children. A variety of sessions conducted on an inpatient treatment unit were designed to stimulate contingencies maintaining aggression and disruption in the subjects' natural environments. The basic analog conditions included: instructional demands, contingent social disapproval, and structured play. In addition, variations of the three basic conditions were developed based on informal observation and parental reports of naturally occurring contingencies. Results showed considerable variability both between and within subjects. However, for each subject a specific analog condition was shown to produce relatively higher rates of aberrant behavior. Subsequently, behavioral treatments based on assessment results were successfully implemented with two of the subjects. Results are discussed in terms of the importance and practical limitations of conducting systematic assessment of aberrant repertoires in developmentally delayed clients.
6684973	1	a	The present study argues that a greater understanding of the factors which contribute to a youth's sexual victimization is likely to not only be based on what we know about the youths who are victimized but also on comparative information on youths who are not. Selected social background variables from a sample of young victims (n = 20) and nonvictims (n = 21) representing a population of youths with histories of antisocial behavior were compared. Using stepwise discriminant analysis several factors relating to youths' home environment significantly discriminated victims from nonvictims. The results suggest that the probability of being sexually victimized is increased when the home environment is unstable and lacks adequate control over youths' activities. The need for improved research methodologies to achieve better identification of determinants of risk is discussed. Multivariate assessment of social, situational, and personal factors of victims and nonvictims is recommended as a potentially promising approach for improving current rape prevention efforts.
17457370	0	a	Nutrition might induce, at some loci, epigenetic or other changes that could be transmitted to the next generation impacting on health. The slow growth period (SGP) before the prepubertal peak in growth velocity has emerged as a sensitive period where different food availability is followed by different transgenerational response (TGR). The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent the probands own childhood circumstances are in fact the determinants of the findings. In the analysis, data from three random samples, comprising 271 probands and their 1626 parents and grandparents, left after exclusions because of missing data, were utilized. The availability of food during any given year was classified based on regional statistics. The ancestors' SGP was set at the ages of 8-12 years and the availability of food during these years classified as good, intermediate or poor. The probands' childhood circumstances were defined by the father's ownership of land, the number of siblings and order in the sibship, the death of parents and the parents' level of literacy. An earlier finding of a sex-specific influence from the ancestors' nutrition during the SGP, going from the paternal grandmother to the female proband and from the paternal grandfather to the male proband, was confirmed. In addition, a response from father to son emerged when childhood social circumstances of the son were accounted for. Early social circumstances influenced longevity for the male proband. TGRs to ancestors' nutrition prevailed as the main influence on longevity.
11020935	0	a	In Bangladesh, the total fertility rate declined from more than six children per woman of reproductive age in 1980 to 3.3 children per woman in 1996. Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decision making to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning.
12314548	1	a	"""Theories of trade and migration explain the distribution of individuals among regions based on private good productivities. The theory of local public goods (LPG's) uses collective good consumption economies to explain the size and composition of communities. This essay combines the two theories, to explore regional population heterogeneity and stability. Assuming that individuals must consume and produce in the same jurisdiction, the paper examines the nature of efficient allocations, the tensions between the private and public incentives, the nature of the equilibrium (if any) which migration among jurisdictions will generate, and how such equilibrium will depend on tax rules for sharing the costs of the LPG."""
11761316	0	a	"Two studies examined how ""syndromal"" approaches to assessment confound differences between individuals in the person and situation variables that contribute to their behavior. In a field study, a widely used instrument was found to be sensitive to the base rates of boys' aggression but, as expected, did not discriminate between boys who were similar in their behavior base rates but different in their social environments and how they responded to them. A laboratory experiment replicated this finding and demonstrated that social observers discriminated between targets on the basis of their functional properties even though syndrome scores did not. The results clarify how syndromal methods can obscure situational factors, conflict with people's social knowledge, and reinforce the view that syndromes exist ""in the individual"" rather than in person-environment interactions. Implications for developing more contextually sensitive instruments are discussed."
10907657	0	a	This study of 72 undergraduate men examined the effects of two determinants of cardiovascular response-active coping and vigilance-on blood pressure and heart rate responses to social stressors. Observation of a future debate partner (i.e., vigilance) evoked larger increases in blood pressure than did observation of a less relevant person, apparently through the combination of increases in cardiac output and vascular resistance. Preparation and enactment of efforts to exert social influence (i.e., active coping) evoked heightened blood pressure and heart rate responses through increased cardiac contractility and output. Thus, both vigilance and active coping in social contexts increased cardiovascular reactivity, but apparently through different psychophysiological processes.
22029554	0	a	Because of increased concerns about terrorism around the globe, international organizations are very interested in understanding how safety and cultural issues impact their employees' willingness to relocate abroad. This has been especially true for international companies based in the United States, given the recent salience of US activities around the world. Additionally, questions remain regarding the efficacy of financial incentives to motivate individuals' willingness to relocate when the destination may be dangerous. Therefore, the factors impacting willingness to relocate from the US to another country were examined experimentally in this study. Based upon theory and research in social and organizational psychology, it was hypothesized that cultural similarity, destination safety, and financial incentives would have direct effects on individuals' willingness to accept relocation offers. It was also predicted that cultural similarity and destination safety would moderate the effects of incentives upon willingness to relocate. The study used a 2 x 2 x 3 between-subjects design manipulating destination similarity (similar, different), destination safety (safe, dangerous), and bonus for relocating (0% bonus, 20% bonus, 40% bonus). Results from 196 participants at a university in the northeastern part of the US revealed that financial incentives and safety perceptions directly impacted willingness to relocate. In line with moderator predictions, financial incentives had a stronger effect on willingness to relocate when the destination was culturally different from the United States than when it was similar. Against expectations, there was no interaction between financial incentives and safety. Destination safety perceptions were relatively strong determinants of willingness to relocate.
3529422	1	a	The development of a theory of quality of life following serious illness is currently an important field of endeavour in rehabilitation research. The interpersonal relationships of people and elements of the self-concept appear to be salient factors in causal models of subjective well-being. One such model developed to explain characteristic levels of well-being was used in a longitudinal study of adaptation to a first myocardial infarction. Data were collected from a national sample of male cardiac patients and their spouses on the illness and marital situation as predictors of long-term well-being or ill-being. Analyses of data from the first three waves of the study, which is to extend over 5 years after the onset of illness, are to be discussed in the paper. Marital status, the emotional quality of the spouse relationship and long-standing marital stressors were found to have direct and indirect effects on the two dimensions of the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. The same is true of continuing problems associated with the heart attack relative to perceptions of having coped effectively with the after effects of illness. Differences in self-esteem and personal competence were suggested as mediators of socio-environmental and illness-related influences. The two-factor conception of well-being developed was found to be a useful framework for investigating positive and negative aspects of psychosocial rehabilitation. The same factors that explain differences between happy and unhappy people in social indicators research also appeared to be determinants of different trajectories of adaptation in the wake of a life-threatening illness. Previous research using theoretical models from stress research has overemphasized psychosocial morbidity and stress management and neglected positive processes of adaptation. The identification of love resources related to positive feeling states and life satisfaction has, therefore, not received the attention it deserves. This is especially the case regarding an overemphasis of the concept of social support as a buffer of stress. Instruments were developed to measure high and low marital intimacy, as well as chronic marital role strains, and these measures appeared to explain different trajectories of adjustment to cardiac disease. The two-factor model appears to be useful for future work on quality of life with chronic illness. The same is true of four marital contexts of rehabilitation that were identified in the study.
3754503	1	a	Following opportunity to copulate with a female housed in an adjacent compartment, male Japanese quail spent 64% of their time near a window that provided visual access to the female (Experiment 1). This social proximity behavior persisted for at least 2 weeks of continual exposure to the window despite lack of further physical access to the female (Experiment 2) and was evident at all daylight hours (Experiment 3). Female Japanese quail stimulated more proximity behavior in male conspecifics than did other male Japanese quail or birds of other species (Experiments 4 and 5). However, many characteristics of the female quail were not critical. The female quail did not have to be previous sexual partners, familiar, sexually experienced, or reproductively competent to stimulate proximity behavior in males (Experiments 4 and 5). Experiment 6 demonstrated that the social proximity behavior was primarily a response to the visual aspects of the females. The results are discussed in relation to mate-guarding and surveillance behavior, and implications of the data for sexual classical conditioning of male Japanese quail are noted.
18158271	0	a	OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of our study was to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of children with epilepsy in Hong Kong with that of children with epilepsy in Canada, and to explore possible factors affecting these findings. A second interest was to determine agreement between proxy reports and self-ratings among children with epilepsy in Hong Kong, compare these with findings in Canada, and identify factors that influence the concordance. METHODS: Child self-report and parent-proxy questionnaires on an epilepsy-specific HRQL measure, appropriately translated and validated in Chinese, were administered to 266 Hong Kong children and their parents. An unpaired t test was used to compare the scores with published results from 381 Canadian children and their parents, who used the original English version of the measure. Demographic characteristics of the two groups were compared using t tests, chi2 tests, and Fisher's exact tests. Agreement between parents' and children's scores was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standardized response means (SRMs). The total HRQL score differences between parents and children in Hong Kong were compared with those in Canada using an unpaired t test. Factors that might affect the parent-child score difference were studied using Pearson correlation analysis, chi2 test, and analysis of variance. Factors studied included: sex, current age, age at diagnosis, duration of epilepsy, number of antiepileptic drugs used, type of seizure, seizure severity, cognition of the child, the type of school attended, presence of neurological problems, presence of behavioral problems, recent health care usage, education and employment status of both parents, housing status of the family, and relationship of the proxy respondent to the child. RESULTS: (1) In contrast to the Canadian sample, Hong Kong children with epilepsy were older (P<0.01), had a longer duration of epilepsy (P<0.01) and less severe seizures (P<0.01), and were more likely to attend normal schools (P<0.01). Children in Hong Kong reported more interpersonal/social difficulties (P<0.01), more worries (P<0.01), and more secrecy about their epilepsy (P<0.01). Parents in Hong Kong believed that their children perceived more worries (P<0.01) and were more secretive about their epilepsy (P<0.01). (2) Moderate to good agreement between parent-proxy response scores and child self-report scores was demonstrated (ICC=0.50-0.69, SRM=0.19-0.33). The total HRQL score differences between parent and child in Hong Kong were not different from those in Canada. None of the factors studied were related to the parent-child score difference. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with epilepsy in Hong Kong and their parents reported poorer quality of life than children with epilepsy in Canada. Further studies are necessary to identify the determinants of HRQL in children with epilepsy in different cultures. Acceptable agreement between the two ratings suggests that proxy reports can be used when child self-reports cannot be obtained.
4061712	1	a	The extent to which the values attached to health states are similar in different cultures or social groups is important for understanding health and illness behaviors and for developing standardized health status measures. A cross-cultural study was conducted to compare the health status values obtained in a United States population (Seattle, Washington) with those from another English-speaking culture (London, England) on the Sickness Impact Profile, a standardized measure composed of 136 items. London judges rated the severity of dysfunction described in each item on an equal interval scale using the same methods of scaling and analysis employed in the Seattle study. A regression of English mean item values on US mean values yielded a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of -0.07, indicating that judges gave strikingly similar ratings to most items. Agreement was higher at the more severe end of the dysfunction continuum than at the least severe end, a finding consistent with the notion that what constitutes health is more difficult to define than what constitutes illness. While a universal conception of dysfunction may exist in English-speaking societies, the social and cultural determinants of health status values deserve more systematic study.
2641946	1	a	A follow-up study of 58 patients with spinal cord injury was conducted. As measure of function the Barthel index was used. There was correlation between functional capacity and ability of self-care as well as some social determinants. However, no association was found with employment rate or certain other determinants of independent living, such as going on a holiday. We conclude that the severity of the lesion is a fundamental factor in determining the outcome, but factors related to personal and psychosocial variables, not easily measured, also have great influence on the rehabilitation process.
15911811	0	a	The determinants of ALS caregiver burden and the feeling of the patients as being a burden were assessed using the Caregiver Burden Inventory and the Self-Perceived Burden Scale in 60 caregiver-patient couples. Caregiver burden was correlated to their level of depression and quality of life and, differently from other chronic disorders, increased with the worsening of patients' disability. ALS patients have a good objective perception of their impact on caregivers.
10951443	0	a	We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population.

This program seeks to improve local socioeconomic and physical environments through the intensive regeneration of disadvantaged communities. We describe the challenges facing evaluators tasked with assessing the impacts of 1 component of the NSNR--the New Deal for Communities initiative--and explore techniques that may be adopted in the evaluation process.
11823650	0	a	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to investigate how stroke rehabilitation professionals understand the concept of motivation and the ways that they use this concept in their clinical practice. METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured, in-depth interviews with the professionals working in the stroke unit of an inner-city teaching hospital in the UK. RESULTS: Motivation was a frequently used concept and was described as an important determinant of rehabilitation outcome. Motivation was attributed to patients on the basis of their demeanor (proactivity was equated with motivation, passivity with lack of motivation) and their compliance with rehabilitation (compliance was seen as indicative of motivation, noncompliance as a lack of motivation). These criteria were found to have blurred boundaries. The determinants of motivation were located partly in personality factors but also in social factors. Central among the social factors were aspects of the professionals' own behavior taken to positively and negatively affect motivation. Some professionals reported treating unmotivated patients differently from motivated ones, especially if these unmotivated patients were elderly. Motivation was described as a potentially dangerous label. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals are wary of the concept of motivation yet commonly use it in their clinical practice. The blurred boundaries of the criteria used to identify motivation mean that patients must strike a delicate balance between proactivity and compliance to avoid being categorized as unmotivated. The way the concept of motivation is used in clinical practice might have negative implications for patient care, eg, when reticent yet motivated patients are labeled unmotivated.
11818587	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mental health among severe hearing-impaired adults in the Netherlands, separately by prelingual and postlingual age of onset. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-three face-to-face interviews were carried out by persons with practical skills in communication with hearing-impaired people. RESULTS: Of prelingually and postlingually deaf men, 27.1% and 27.7%, respectively, reported mental distress (scores on the General Health Questionnaire > or = 2), and among women these figures were 32.4% and 43.2%. These rates are higher than in the general population (men: 22.0%; women: 26.6%). Among the prelingual category, none of the demographic or hearing loss-related characteristics was associated with mental health status as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Of these variables, only additional impairment or serious illness was associated with the brief Symptom Checklist (SCL-8D). Among the postlingual category, female gender and equilibrium disturbance was associated with both the GHQ and SCL-8D, and additional impairment or serious illness with the SCL-8D. For both categories, the risk of mental distress also was higher in those with more communication problems, lower levels of self-esteem, and poorer acceptance of the hearing loss. Opportunities for identification in youth and social support were not associated with mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health status differs between the hearing-impaired and the general population, but not as much as is sometimes suggested. Mental distress is greater in those in certain categories of the hearing-impaired.

6520656	1	a	Smoking during pregnancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including fetal and neonatal death. These consequences are tragic in many ways, but perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they are preventable if the smoker ceases to smoke during pregnancy. Although in some instances the so-called constitutional hypothesis is difficult to disprove, the available evidence seems more than convincing that it is smoking itself, and not the smoker's unique constitution, that is responsible. Cessation from smoking is clearly advisable at any time, but more so during pregnancy when every cigarette affects both the smoker and her unborn child.
3723341	1	a	We provided a microanalytic description of facial reactions to a series of painful and nonpainful electric shocks and examined the impact of these as discrete facial cues for observer judgments of acute pain. Thirty female volunteers were videotaped and reported their discomfort in response to electric shocks after earlier exposure to one of three social influence conditions: a tolerant model, an intolerant model, or neutral peer presence. We coded the videotapes for facial activity using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978b), and peer judges rated them for painful discomfort. Subjects exposed to a tolerant model reported no more discomfort than did subjects exposed to an intolerant model, despite receiving more intense levels of shock, but were judged by observers to be in more pain. Analyses of facial activity yielded consistent findings: Tolerant-model subjects, though reporting discomfort equivalent to that reported in other groups, displayed more pain-related facial activity (brow lowering, narrowing of the eye aperture from below, raising the upper lip, and blinking). There was a substantial direct relation between observer judgments of distress and discrete, pain-related facial actions (mean multiple R = .74 for the various shock levels rated). These data indicate that nonverbal expression yields information about the response to noxious stimulation that is non-redundant with self-report.
16533103	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively identify attitudinal and psychosocial determinants of early prenatal care among Black women of low socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Focus group discussions were conducted among Black women who attended community clinics for prenatal care. RESULTS: Early initiators of prenatal care, compared with late initiators, had positive attitudes toward pregnancy, were knowledgeable about pregnancy signs/symptoms, and thought prenatal care was important. All participants indicated strong social support during pregnancy. Late initiators, particularly multiparous women, perceived clinic staff to be insensitive. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide valuable insight into overcoming barriers to early initiation of prenatal care among low SES Black women.
7145506	1	a	"The relationship between levels of moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care was investigated in a sample of 452 pediatricians. Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed. Institutional type accounted for 43% of the variation in mean activism scores whereas moral reasoning accounted for only 4%; however, because one could, a priori, expect institutional norms and customs to be powerful determinants of behavior, any additional, identifiable influence deserves attention. The structure of individuals' moral reasoning seems to be such an influence."
7202850	1	a	Preweanling rats, 15 days of age, were placed in an unfamiliar cage containing 1 of a variety of surrogate conspecific stimuli. The surrogate stimuli consisted of a rat-sized aluminum tube covered with soft fluffy synthetic fur, a tanned rat pelt, felt, and an aluminum sheet. The surrogate was either maintained at ambient temperature or heated to body surface temperature (37 degrees C). The 1st experiment revealed that both furriness (length and softness of fur) and temperature of the surrogate stimulus are important determinants of conspecific aggregation (huddling). The 2nd experiment demonstrated that preference for the soft, fluffy surrogate was not mediated by temperature conservation by showing that the same huddling behavior was obtained when ambient temperature was raised to thermoneutrality (33 degrees C). The final experiment demonstrated that amphetamine restricted the range of surrogate stimuli that elicited huddling in the preweanling rat. The finding that amphetamine produces a steeper generalization gradient of approach to surrogate stimuli further confirms our previous hypothesis that amphetamine canalizes arousal toward salient environmental stimuli. These findings have implications for the use of amphetamines to treat hyperkinetic children.
17543712	0	a	BACKGROUND: Drug abuse is a significant public health problem because of its association with numerous negative health and social consequences. Examining the social context of drug use represents a burgeoning avenue of research in drug abuse. This study investigates the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and network factors on current heroin and cocaine use among a predominantly African-American adult sample residing in Baltimore City. METHODS: This study employs a cross-sectional, multilevel design using data from two sources: the SHIELD Study, a network-oriented HIV intervention in Baltimore City and the 1990 U.S. Decennial Census. The sample consisted of 1305 adults from 249 neighborhoods (census block groups) across Baltimore City. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to examine personal network and neighborhood effects on current heroin and cocaine use. RESULTS: Neighborhood poverty was significantly associated with current heroin and cocaine use (odds ratio [OR]=1.51, confidence interval [CI]=1.06-2.15). Social support (OR=0.80, CI=0.69-0.92) and having ties to employed people (OR=0.47, CI=0.24-0.92) were protective of current drug use, but did not buffer negative effects of neighborhood poverty in the face of negative drug influences in the network (OR=8.62, CI=5.81-12.79). CONCLUSIONS: The contexts of neighborhoods and networks represent key determinants in understanding the social epidemiology of drug abuse. Network attributes have strong influences on drug use, and neighborhood poverty may increase odds of use. Further research is warranted to determine other aspects of neighborhood environments that may put individuals at risk for drug use and abuse.
19135287	0	a	Although individual factors have been shown to predict weight gain, contextual determinants have also attracted attention, with some authors stressing the role played by deprivation, urban sprawl, social capital and safety. Recent evidence has implicated environmental factors that facilitate the consumption of excess calories and/or make it more difficult to expend them in routine physical activity. The interrelationships found in some places between physical and social environments (key mediators) and body mass index (BMI), as well as the potential that exists for the development of healthier places, mean that more research is required into the contextual determinants of health. In Portugal, particularly in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), the effects of physical and social environments on physical activity and BMI have not previously been explored in any detail. This study aims to highlight the associations between residential (physical and social) environment and the risk of weight gain and obesity, over and above individual attributes, assessing which indicators are the best predictors of excess weight in the LMA. The study involved data from 7669 individuals aged 18 and over from 143 neighbourhoods. Self-reported body height and weight were used to define overweight body mass index (BMI> or =25). BMI and individual (socio-demographic and behavioural) characteristics were linked to contextual data and analysed in a multilevel framework. Our findings show that different environmental factors are significantly associated with excess weight and obesity, either directly or indirectly (e.g. health-related behaviours such as eating patterns and physical activity, which are key mediators), after adjustment for individual characteristics. The results suggest that a deeper understanding of these mechanisms is critical if we want to tackle the obesity epidemic, and that policies aimed at weight control and obesity reduction must address people and places in order to bear fruit.
15456977	0	a	Reform of the Lithuanian health system is a challenging process. The aim of this article is to assess the role of health managers in the process of health reform, evaluating the perception of health management and their training needs, as the possible determinants for the success of the reform. The results of several questionnaire surveys of Lithuanian health managers, particularly the one carried out in 2002 are used. The studies demonstrate great diversity in the conceptual understanding of health management, with prevailing rational and technical understanding. This might be associated with the rapid structural and organizational changes in the early stages of health reform and insufficient involvement of health managers in the planning and management of changes. General management, health policy, economic and law are considered as the most important study areas for health managers. The major lacking knowledge is in the subjects of law, economics and health financing. Health managers should act as mediators between politicians and health professionals. Enlargement of the area of competences, increasing autonomy in solving problems and meeting of the training needs of health managers is essential.
12064266	0	a	This article explores whether the impact of marital status on the risk of preterm birth varies in relation to marital practices in the population, defined by the proportion of out-of-marriage births. Data come from a case-control study of the determinants of preterm birth in 16 European countries (5456 cases and 8234 controls). There is a significantly elevated risk of preterm birth associated with both cohabitation (OR = 1.29 [1.08, 1.55]) and single motherhood (OR = 1.61 [1.26, 2.07]) for women living in countries where fewer than 20 of births occur outside marriage. In contrast, there is no excess risk associated with marital status when out-of-marriage births are more common. This overall result does not apply to all subgroups of preterm births: different patterns emerge for early preterm births and preterm births induced for medical reasons. It is important to consider social context in the analysis of individual risk factors.
16414146	0	a	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of contextual (social capital and administrative/neo-materialist) and individual factors on lack of access to a regular doctor. METHODS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional study. A total of 13,715 persons answered a postal questionnaire, which is 59% of the random sample. A multilevel logistic regression model, with individuals at the first level and municipalities at the second, was performed. The effect (intra-class correlations, cross-level modification and odds ratios) of individual and municipality (social capital and health care district) factors on lack of access to a regular doctor was analysed using simulation method. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was used as information criterion for the models. RESULTS: The second level municipality variance in lack of access to a regular doctor is substantial even in the final models with all individual and contextual variables included. The model that results in the largest reduction in DIC is the model including age, sex and individual social participation (which is a network aspect of social capital), but the models which include administrative and social capital second level factors also reduced the DIC values. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that both administrative health care district and social capital may partly explain the individual's self reported lack of access to a regular doctor.
2650741	1	a	Perinatal mortality in Belgium remains high compared with other countries of Western Europe, although a marked decrease was observed during the period from 1956 to 1984. Analysis of the death causes indicates that further progress is feasible. Social inequalities and geographic variation are persisting in spite of the long-established policy of social welfare and free access to health services. Most of the studies on perinatal mortality in Belgium are descriptive and based on data recorded in birth and infant death certificates. In the future, alternative sources of information should be used to analyze more precisely and to understand more clearly the interactions between the different determinants of perinatal mortality and to evaluate the impact of social and health services.
6478846	1	a	"The relationship between blood pressure and behavioural syndromes assessed by means of an ""adjective test"" was examined in a group of 467 pre-adolescents. Preliminary results suggest that certain specific behaviour characteristics can be identified in individuals with elevated blood pressure already in childhood and adolescence. Cluster analysis showed that subjects with higher blood pressure do not constitute a psychologically homogeneous group but can be classed into one of the following three subgroups: individuals with ""High Academic Performance"", ""Dysthymic Behaviour"" or ""Behavioural Disturbances"". The relationship between blood pressure and behavioural factors is not mediated by covariables such as social status, sexual maturity, body mass, smoking habits, etc."
3812826	1	a	The historical and cultural forces that have affected the identity development of Black Americans are analyzed. In particular the psychological effect of historical events in shaping the identity of Blacks is examined. Revealed are the critical influences that social, historical, political, and economic movements have had on Black Americans because of their powerless status. Ethnicity and culture are important determinants in the development of a positive and healthy sense of self for Black Americans.
7124811	1	a	Social desirability and intellectual limitations were investigated as possible determinants of two response biases--acquiescence and naysaying--among mentally retarded respondents. Results clearly indicated that naysaying and acquiescence occur more frequently among lower IQ individuals and naysaying occurs more frequently concerning prohibited behavior, whereas respondents acquiesce regarding desirable behavior. These results suggest that intellectual limitations predispose people to biased responding, whereas social desirability factors determine the type of bias.
17093748	1	a	This study lies within the framework of an earlier descriptive study related to psychiatric problems in the Montreal metropolitain area. That study showed that there is a high level of re-utilization of emergency services by people who have had or still have serious mental health problems. This phenomenon is investigated in the present study with a view firstly for describing the incidence of the re-utilization of emergency services in the 6 A social/health region and secondly, for showing the contribution of certains factors that, from the viewpoint of socio-psychiatric features of a target group of patients, are presupposed determinants of re-utilization. The analysis of a collection of socio-demographic and clinical is based on a sample of 1 259 patients re-utilizers of emergency resources. On one hand, such an analysis provided a certain number of factual data for describing the types of re-utilization profiles and identifying the group of patients concerned. On the other hand, the proposed conceptual pattern aims at situating the various factors involved and contributes therefore to defining a perspective that would consider the dynamics various components of the re-utilization (general model). Our hypothesis to the effect that the social-demographic and clinical variables associated to the socio-psychiatric profiles of known patients in the public network only accounts for a weak proportion of the re-utilization, is confirmed. This important conclusion suggests that the other field of determination, particularly the functioning of our system of care distribution (continuity of care, follow up, procedures theories within the framework on non-institutional services) and the difficulties of reintegration encountered by people identified as being <<mental>> (community's tolerance) would be the most determinant factors of re-utilization. The present discussion proposes several ways of considering the necessity for developing a general problematic based on the fact that the phenomenon of re-utilization is both the result of a special type of interdependence between the system of care distribution and the identified patient in the network, as well as the result of the interdependence between this person, his/her illness and his/her social setting.
2943159	1	a	The maladaptive behavior of 474 persons from a residential facility for mentally retarded individuals was investigated. Eleven independent variables pertaining to demographic and environmental characteristics were initially related to the frequency and topography of residents' maladaptive behavior. Multiple regression analysis revealed that maladaptive behaviors were related to sex, social age, chronological age, resident's time spent on outside activities, number of residents per direct-care staff member, presence of sensory handicaps, and ambulation. Results were related to existing literature and discussed in terms of their use for intervention efforts and differential assignment of resources.
3434411	1	a	This study is concerned with the effect of age, sex, social class, and quality of family interaction on the future orientation of adolescents aged 10-11, 14-15, and 17-19 years. Seventy-three girls and 75 boys were interviewed about their future hopes and fears. The content and extension of each aim and fear as well as the amount of planning, knowledge, and perceived locus of control involved was estimated from answers. The contents of aims and fears were closely related to the developmental tasks. Nearly half the subjects were afraid of war. The extension of subjects' future orientation decreased, whereas their knowledge about the future increased with age. The subjects from the higher social classes were oriented farther into the future than those from the lower classes. An interpretation emphasizing the importance of the principal developmental tasks on young people's future orientation is discussed.
12624605	0	a	Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) measured by electrocardiography (ECG LVH) in hypertensive patients has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular sequelae. Analysis of the determinants predisposing to ECG LVH may be helpful in the prevention of LVH. The Department of Health and Social Security Hypertension Care Computer Project studied 2994 hypertensive patients in whom an electrocardiogram was recorded while not on treatment. LVH was determined as the voltage sum SV1+RV5 or RV6>or=35 mm using Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria. The relations were determined between the presence of LVH or voltage sum and different variables. Untreated systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and pulse pressure were positively related to the increasing ECG voltage, while body mass index (BMI) and serum cholesterol were inversely related. Blood glucose and age did not correlate significantly. Patients with the presence of ECG LVH were more often men, black people, smokers and users of alcohol. In multiple logistic regression analyses, SBP, DBP, male gender and black race were positively, whereas BMI was negatively related to the presence of LVH. The positive relation of smoking and negative relation of serum cholesterol concentration to the presence of ECG LVH were apparent in men but not in women. This study confirms the adverse association between ECG LVH and SBP and DBP, male gender, black race and decreased BMI. It also addresses the less well-known associations of blood glucose, cholesterol, smoking and alcohol consumption.
3168446	1	a	In order to disclose differences between users and non-users of oral contraceptives (OC), 620 women aged 15-54 were invited to participate in an in depth interview about sexual, contraceptive, and reproductive life events. Of the 585 women who participated, 459 were consecutive gynecological in- or outpatients, and 126 were selected from visitors in general practice. Data was analysed by multivariate test statistics. After correction for present age and social class, the duration of use of OC (DOC) among women 15-34 years of age correlated negatively to age at menarche and coital debut and positively to number of sexual partners, oral-genital sexual practice, and number of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Among women over 35, DOC was positively associated only to cigarette smoking. No correlation was found to coital frequency (whether earlier, present or during pregnancy or menstruation), number of births and abortions, or to social classification. In epidemiological research on benefits and risks of oral contraceptives, confounding influence of one or more variables is of crucial importance. The present findings point at sexual and life-style habits as potential confounders in the study of OC and associated diseases.
2808474	1	a	The seasonality of births in the period 1871-1977 is studied in a rural north-western Spanish population. Based on a total sample of 11,695 birth registrations, temporal variation is analysed. For siblings, according to family reconstitution, the total family size, the legitimacy of the child, and birth order are considered. A coefficient of birth month dispersion is defined and estimated for each family. Intra-family variation is related to inter-family coefficients in order to determine whether the local seasonal pattern of births may be partly explained by family characteristics.
11602474	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To investigate withdrawal from the labour force because of inability to work owing to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to determine the characteristics of patients with no job because of work disability attributable to AS. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was sent to 709 patients with AS aged 16-60 years followed up by a rheumatologist. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics were used to assess the time lapse between diagnosis and withdrawal from work. Standardised incidence ratios were calculated to compare withdrawal from the labour force in patients with AS and the general population. Determinants of withdrawal were assessed by Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis using variables assumed to be time independent. Cross sectional characteristics of patients without a job owing to disability were further analysed by simple and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 658 patients returned the questionnaire. Of 529 patients with a paid job before diagnosis of AS, 5% had left the labour force within the first year after the diagnosis, 13% after 5 years, 21% after 10 years, 23% after 15 years, and 31% after 20 years. Age and sex adjusted risk for withdrawal was 3.1 (95% CI 2.5 to 3.7) times higher than in the general population. In patients with AS, determinants of withdrawal from work were older age at diagnosis, manual work, and coping strategies characterised by limiting or adapting activities. Patients with work disability at the time of the study were older, came from a lower social class, and were more likely to have total hip replacement, peripheral arthritis, or comorbidity. Moreover, they reported worse physical function (BAS-FI), experienced lower quality of life, and more often had extraspinal disease than those with a job. CONCLUSION: Withdrawal from work is 3.1 times higher in patients with AS than expected in the general population. Within patients, higher age at diagnosis, manual work, and unfavourable coping strategies are important determinants of withdrawal. Patients without a job experience a lower quality of life.
15969760	0	a	BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength and predisposition to increased risk of fracture, with consequent increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is therefore an important public health problem. International and Canadian associations have issued clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OP. In this study, we identified potential predictors of bone mineral density (BMD) testing and OP treatment, which include place of residence. METHODS: Our study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Quebec Health Insurance Board. The studied population consisted of all individuals 65 years and older for whom a physician claimed a consultation for a low velocity vertebral, hip, wrist, or humerus fracture in 1999 and 2000. Individuals were considered to have undergone BMD testing if there was a claim for such a procedure within two years following a fracture. They were considered to have received an OP treatment if there was at least one claim to Quebec's health insurance plan (RAMQ) for OP treatment within one year following a fracture. We performed descriptive analyses and logistic regressions by gender. Predictors included age, site of fracture, social status, comorbidity index, prior BMD testing, prior OP treatment, long-term glucocorticoid use, and physical distance to BMD device. RESULTS: The cohort, 77% of which was female, consisted of 25,852 individuals with fragility fractures. BMD testing and OP treatment rates were low and gender dependent (BMD: men 4.6%; women 13.1%; OP treatment: men 9.9%; women 29.7%). There was an obvious regional variation, particularly in BMD testing, ranging from 0 to 16%. Logistic regressions demonstrate that individuals living in long term care facilities received less BMD testing. Patients who had suffered from vertebral fractures, or who had received prior OP treatment or BMD testing, regardless of gender, subsequently received more BMD testing and OP treatments. Furthermore, increasing the distance between a patient's residence and BMD facility precluded likelihood of BMD testing. CONCLUSION: BMD testing rate was extremely low but not completely explained by reduced physical access; gender, age, social status, prior BMD testing and OP treatment were all important predictors for future BMD testing and OP treatment.
28514037	1	a	Social and economic determinants of fertility, mortality, and child survival were studied in a sample of 519 mothers from EL Progreso, a disadvantaged community located on the outskirts of Guatemala city. Fertility (children ever-born) and mortality (number of children who had died postnatally) data were obtained from interviews, along with data on the characteristics of the mothers, fathers, and the households. Contraceptive use was recorded on a subsample of 167 mothers of 5-year old children. Following factor analyses, three variables were selected for analysis: Years of schooling of the father and the mother and the type of fuel used for cooking. Father's education and type of fuel were significantly related to maternal fertility, while only the educational attainment of the mother was related to child mortality and survival. When contraceptive use was included in the ANCOVA in the subsample, it was a significant determinant of fertility, while father's education became nonsignificant. In terms of mortality, contraceptive use was a significant determinant, while the significance of the mother's education fell to a borderline value (P = 0.084).
15963873	0	a	"To better understand temporal trends in sexual behavior and their determinants, it is important to look at the demographic and technologic context in which we live; both affect sexual behaviors. Mental disorders and CSA emerge as important correlates of high-risk sexual behaviors. The changing role and expectations of women-the result of major economic and social transformation-transform society further through changes to family and community structures. These changes occur alongside increasing inequality and upheavals in the world, all of which are more visible through increased mobility and communication in the ""global village."" Changes in sexual norms, relationships, abuse, and mental health are better understood in the context of this broad political background."
7376236	1	a	Survey data from women in pregnancy risk in Venezuela and Kenya are used to examine the determinants of contraceptive intention, use, and the intention/use consistency. The five ranking determinants of contraceptive use are: intention to contracept, social support, accessibility, conjugal communication, and desire for additional children. All five determinants have direct and additive effects on contraception, but their relative impacts vary significantly between the two cultures. Contraceptive intention and use are highly consistent, while level of consistency varies significantly between the two samples and within each by various combinations of ranking variables and by parity. Major research and policy implications of the results are reviewed.
3791024	1	a	The present study documented later developmental outcome in a group of 29 failure-to-thrive (FTT) infants who received extended hospitalization in infancy as an intervention for their growth failure. All infants were seen at approximately 3 years of age and were given standardized assessments of intellectual and physical development. A standard interview documented demographic variables, health problems, placements subsequent to hospitalization and additional psychological and medical treatment. Infants were divided into three groups dependent on medical and treatment factors. Means and percentages of occurrence of outcome variables were compared through either one-way ANOVAS or single sample chi-square tests with post hoc analyses. Correlational analyses were used to understand the relationships between outcome and relevant demographic, medical, and treatment variables. In general, the infants manifest persistent intellectual delays at follow-up despite maintenance of weight gains achieved during early hospitalization. More than half the group suffered from chronic health problems. A large percentage of infants had been removed from parental custody at the time of follow-up. Several demographic, medical, and treatment factors bore moderate relationships to developmental outcome. Infants who achieved more optimal growth tended to be full-term at birth, later born and without a question of physical abuse in their social histories. Intellectual functioning was related only to parental and caretaker socioeconomic status. Infants placed in foster care were unlikely to return to their families of origin. The findings suggest the need for further investigation into the determinants and outcome of extended hospitalization as a treatment for FTT.
6520880	1	a	This study tests two theories regarding the attitude and behavioral determinants of women's coital and masturbatory orgasmic responsiveness. Data from 115 sexually active women were analyzed using latent-variable structural equation models. Twenty-one variables are used to represent seven latent constructs: Parent Sexual Attitudes, Sexual Latency, Sexual Behavior, Dating Competence, Social Assertiveness, Subjective Masturbatory Responsiveness, and Subjective Coital Responsiveness. Two specific theories are tested with these constructs. Each theory predicts a different structural arrangement among these latent factors with the fundamental difference being whether behavior predicts responsiveness or vice-versa. Two alternate models were found to reflect the data adequately. In both instances, attitudes predicted behavior and, in general, orgasmic responsiveness tended to be a function of behavior.
6382590	1	a	This article combines a review and meta-analysis of research on IQ in schizophrenia, with emphasis on areas of convergence in the findings, as well as questions that remain to be answered. Taken together, the findings suggest that early-onset and adult-onset schizophrenia are associated with intellectual deficits across the lifespan. Preschizophrenic children, adolescents, and young adults perform below matched controls on a variety of standardized measures of intelligence. Significant IQ deficits are also apparent after the onset of the disorder. Moreover, IQ is positively related to several indices of prognosis, and, among hospitalized patients, there is negative within-subject covariance between intellectual performance and symptom severity. Although there is fairly consistent evidence that Verbal IQ is higher than Performance IQ among schizophrenic patients, a more specific pattern of subtest performance is not apparent. A central question raised by the results is whether IQ is an independently determined factor that can serve to mitigate the vulnerability of individuals who are constitutionally predisposed to schizophrenia, or whether intellectual deficit is one manifestation of the constitutional predisposition to the disorder. The findings also raise the question of possible sex differences in the developmental determinants of schizophrenia: Meta-analyses revealed that premorbid IQ deficits are more prevalent among males than females.
10686574	0	a	The purpose of this study was to investigate the individual and social determinants of rural nurses' willingness to care for people with AIDS (PWAs). Willingness to care was viewed as a function of nurses' personal attitudes about AIDS care and PWAs; the influence of normative (significant others), comparative (the nursing profession), and generalized (the rural community) reference group norms on these attitudes; and how much importance respondents placed on membership in these reference groups. Responses to a mailed questionnaire from 615 rural nurses were analyzed. Individual determinants were nurses' feelings of preparedness and favorable attitudes about their personal safety when administering care. Social determinants were the degree of upset of respondents' significant others about their caring for AIDS patients and favorable attitudes of the respondents about professional and social concerns related to AIDS.
7143281	1	a	Changes in frequency of sexual intercourse and of leisure activities were related to degree of physical impairment and levels of dependence in primary and secondary ADL in 110 subjects with one stroke. About 75% of the subjects reduced their frequency or ceased having intercourse and active leisure. While changes in frequency of intercourse were temporally independent, changes in leisure activities were less pronounced for subjects examined later than 12 months after the stroke than for those investigated earlier. For intercourse, primarily ADL-dependence and impaired cutaneous sensibility were major negative determinants. Moreover, subjects with previously known arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus had changed relatively less than those without these ailments, probably due to pre-stroke reductions. It is suggested that the marked changes in sexual and leisure activities are accomplished by unsuccessful coping with the vascular catastrophe and its sequelae. Aspects of coping problems, primarily the disease-related, but also those of intra- and inter-personal nature are discussed.
7439106	1	a	The evolution of medicine from an applied science to the extension of specialized medical care delivery, has had a bearing on the student's early decision, influenced by a specialist teacher, to chose specialization in a given field. The author gives current explanations of the specialization process in order to conclude that, in Brazil, one of its leading determinants is a policy of the social welfare system that favors the specialist. Other factors cited are the (not always justified) preference of patients--at least of those who can afford it--for physicians who work with sophisticated equipment, the vested interests of the industry that produces or owns that equipment, and the desire of the young physician to escape the stiff competition he would encounter in general practice, while at the same time separating himself from the somewhat negative image of the general clinician who does not keep abreast of developments in medicine. The author examines the question in light of sociological theories of social and technical division of labor, and asserts that the process has led to the atomization of responsibilities among physicians who have become incapable, because of overspecialization, of viewing the patient as a biological, psychological, social and cultural whole.
12315065	1	a	"The author develops the hypothesis that women from different population subgroups respond differently to economic and background influences when timing initial childbearing. Data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience and concern some 5,000 U.S. women followed from 1968 to 1978. ""Among all groups examined, age at first birth tends to increase as education levels increase, and married women with spouses present tend to be older than other women at first childbirth. Among whites, all economic influences considered--hourly pay rate, nonmarket income, and work during the year prior to childbearing--have a significant influence in deferring first childbirth, but family background does not. Among blacks, family background plays a significant role in determining age at first childbirth, but only one economic influence--the hourly pay rate--is significant."""
3530546	1	a	The present paper reviews the epidemiologic patterns of blood pressure in children by demographic variables such as age, race, sex, education and social class. Other possible determinants for high blood pressure in both adults and children are also discussed, including obesity and salt intake. Special attention is given to the phenomenon of tracking and to genetic influences in blood pressure, the latter discussed in the context of the strengths and limitations of twin and familial aggregation studies.
18036211	0	a	BACKGROUND: Health and well-being are the result of synergistic interactions among a variety of determinants. Family structure and composition are social determinants that may also affect health behaviours and outcomes. This study was performed to examine the associations between family structure and health and to determine the protective effects of support mechanisms to improve quality of health outcome. METHODS: Six hundred people, selected by multistage sampling to obtain a representative population of men and women aged 20-60 living in communities in Japan, were included in this study. Data regarding subjective views of one's own health, family structure, lifestyle and social support were collected through structured face-to-face interviews on home visits. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, height and weight were measured by trained examiners. The associations between family structure and health after controlling for demographics, lifestyle and social support were examined using logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Subjects living alone were significantly more likely to be in ill health, as determined using the General Health Questionnaire, in comparison to those in extended families (OR = 3.14). Subjects living alone or as couples were significantly more likely to suffer from severe hypertension in comparison to those living in extended families (OR = 8.25, OR = 4.90). These associations remained after controlling for the influence of lifestyle. Subjects living only with spouse or in nuclear family had higher probabilities of mental ill health in the absence than in the presence of people showing concern for their well-being. CONCLUSION: The results of this study infers that a support mechanism consisting of companionship and the presence of family or other people concerned for one's well being acts as a buffer against deleterious influence of living in small family that will lead to improved quality of health outcome.
25136398	0	a	UNLABELLED: In recent decades the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been adopted by many business sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry. However, in this and other sectors its application remains variable, particularly between mature and developing economies. Its stakeholders include pharmacy and medical students, their attitude to the involvement of companies in socially responsible activities will be important determinants of public response to the industry. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of senior medical and pharmacy students towards the CSR concept in the pharmaceutical sector in mature (Germany) and developing (Russia) markets. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was carried out among senior pharmacy and medical students during the summer semester 2008 in two Russian and one German university. In each country 120 questionnaires were distributed. The response rate was 95% in Russia and 93% in Germany. RESULTS: Although the relevance of CSR was widely acknowledged by the students, very few were aware of CSR practices currently performed by companies. THE REPUTATION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WAS GENERALLY POOR: less than 15% of respondents gave credence to the information provided in advertisements and fully supported pricing strategies as well as policies towards the developing countries. When choosing an employer more than 90% of respondents consider the policies affecting an employee directly as pivotal. However, for a high proportion of students (59% in Russia and 64% in Germany) socially irresponsible behavior by companies has a significant negative impact. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies practices which students believe should be a part of the CSR programmes for the pharmaceutical industry, and also some that should be abandoned. It recommends that corporate communication on CSR should be expanded. Key differences are seen in perceptions of students in Germany and Russia towards the extent of irresponsible actions and the variation between them.
18095183	0	a	OBJECTIVE: General practitioners and pharmacists do not properly educate their patients about the disadvantages of benzodiazepines. In order to increase and improve education, this study will investigate which psychological factors (i.e., beliefs, outcome expectation, social norm and self-efficacy) predict the intention to educate. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in which 339 general practitioners and 149 pharmacists in the Netherlands completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: The Results show that the above-mentioned factors play an important role in forming intentions to educate. However, differences exist between general practitioners and pharmacists. CONCLUSION: General practitioners and pharmacists intend to educate in cases where they think that benzodiazepines have well-defined disadvantages, when the education they undertake leads to success, when they feel pressure to educate from their surroundings and when they are capable of educating. Implications for practice These findings contribute to a better understanding of patient education and are of great value in developing new interventions to improve education.
18067465	0	a	"OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between puberty, sedentary behaviors, and psychosocial influences with intention for physical activity (PA) and PA. METHODS: Low-income, overweight African American girls (n=72) completed 5 questionnaires that assessed PA, sedentary behaviors, and psychosocial influences. Puberty was assessed using Tanner stages. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationships between these measures and intention for PA. RESULTS: Puberty was significantly associated with lower intention for PA, whereas health beliefs such as ""staying in shape"" and social support were significantly associated with greater intention for PA. CONCLUSIONS: Puberty, health beliefs for PA, and social support from parents and peers were significant predictors of intention for PA in low-income, overweight African American girls."
2675244	1	a	The available data on the association between the cellular handling of sodium and high BP indicate that alteration of these parameters could be linked to the level of high BP. Limited data are available with regard to the association between BP and these aspects of the intracellular ion metabolism in childhood. The study of intracellular ion metabolism in children could help clarify the pathogenesis and etiology of essential hypertension by providing an opportunity to study this relationship before the effects of possible determinants of adult BP (ie, age, body weight, diet, physical activity) affect ion transport and modify its effect on BP. Specifically, familial predisposition to hypertension, growth and maturation, and the various components of body size need to be studied further to determine their role in the relationship between Na-Li CT and RBC Na and BP. Better understanding of this complex association could help elucidate the pathophysiology of essential hypertension.
15571622	0	a	BACKGROUND: Malnutrition in children can be a consequence of unfavourable socioeconomic conditions. However, some families maintain adequate nutritional status in their children despite living in poverty. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether family-related factors are determinants of stunting in young Mexican children living in extreme poverty, and whether these factors differ between rural or urban contexts. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in one rural and one urban extreme poverty level areas in Mexico. Cases comprised stunted children aged between 6 and 23 months. Controls were well-nourished children. Independent variables were defined in five dimensions: family characteristics; family income; household allocation of resources and family organisation; social networks; and child health care. Information was collected from 108 cases and 139 controls in the rural area and from 198 cases and 211 controls in the urban area. Statistical analysis was carried out separately for each area; unconditional multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain the best explanatory model for stunting. RESULTS: In the rural area, a greater risk of stunting was associated with father's occupation as farmer and the presence of family networks for child care. The greatest protective effect was found in children cared for exclusively by their mothers. In the urban area, risk factors for stunting were father with unstable job, presence of small social networks, low rate of attendance to the Well Child Program activities, breast-feeding longer than six months, and two variables within the family characteristics dimension (longer duration of parents' union and migration from rural to urban area). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the influence of the family on the nutritional status of children under two years of age living in extreme poverty areas. Factors associated with stunting were different in rural and urban communities.Therefore, developing and implementing health programs to tackle malnutrition should take into account such differences that are consequence of the social, economic, and cultural contexts in which the family lives.
19276334	0	a	Globally, research on social determinants of health has built a considerable knowledge base over the last decade. Still, not much of this research has been carried out in the extremely poor areas of the world, like for instance Africa south of the Sahara. In very poor ruralities, classic indicators of socioeconomic status are not well suited. Few people have any education, monetary income is not a good measure of material standing and people cannot be classified by occupation as they make their livelihood from a variety of activities. For efforts towards health equity to benefit the poorest of the poor, more suitable indicators of social health determinants must be identified. Health research might benefit from knowledge developed in neighbouring fields like development research, anthropology and sociology.
3812821	1	a	"This paper attempts to define the characteristics of the ""insolvable problem"" in the dynamics of suicidal children. It posits that part of the underlying dynamics of suicidal children is being pressured to solve a problem, in the family milieu, which is beyond the child's--and often anybody else's--ability to resolve. Moreover, the paper outlines the possible relation between the insolvable problem and various determinants involved in suicidal behavior such as depression, helplessness, hopelessness, rigidity, etc. This discussion will be accompanied by case demonstrations."
24302171	1	a	Within our present health care system, there is a growing movement that argues that our perceptions of health and illness are in need of change. This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited.
6701728	1	a	This article, which is based on data from the Social Security Administration's 1978 Survey of Survivor Families With Children, examines the continuity of health care coverage held by families headed by widows from the time of the husband's death to the interview. The data are presented by duration of widowhood and kind of coverage the family had before the husband died. Over this period, it was found that new kinds of coverage, such as the widow's job-related health insurance or directly purchased protection, often replaced the former coverage. At the time of the interview, about three-fourths of the families had coverage, including government assistance such as Medicaid. Whether or not the young survivor families had coverage was affected by the widow's current employment status and by family income. Premiums varied by type of policy: those with individual policies paid more (and received less extensive coverage) than did those with group policies. Compared with the general population, the widows and their children were in poorer health, generally used physician services less, and had somewhat higher expenditures for health care.
10284405	1	a	Much research on internal labor markets has been hampered by the failure to differentiate the wide variety of ILMs, by accounts of their determinants that too heavily emphasize isolated causal factors, by the lack of detailed material describing the economic and organizational dimensions of their design and implementation, and by the neglect of managerial perceptions of and motivations for constructing ILMs. This paper presents detailed case studies of three organizations that have constructed very different ILMs. Based on this material, a model of the determinants of ILMs is developed that centers around the concepts of costs, commitment, and rewards and that attempts to assess the interactions of effects of markets and hierarchies on ILMs. The model is built on the premise that the underlying imperatives typically held to affect ILMs are inevitably filtered through managerial beliefs and the constraints on managerial decision making. The implications of these findings for theory and research on ILMs are discussed.
16492623	0	a	AIMS: The aim of the present study is to identify self-rated health predictors of return to work (RTW) within the study population as a whole as well as in three subgroups, namely musculoskeletal complaints, other physical health complaints, and psychological complaints. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 862 employees on sickness absence (maximum duration of 12 weeks). The employees filled out a baseline questionnaire and were subsequently followed until the tenth month after listing sick. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify determinants of RTW. RESULTS: For the study population as a whole type of complaint, earlier sickness absence, subjective severity of complaints and several RAND-36 subscales were predictive of RTW. Furthermore, the RAND-36 subscales physical functioning, physical role limitations, mental health, and health change were predictive of RTW among employees with musculoskeletal complaints. For employees with other physical health problems subjective severity of complaints and the RAND-36 subscales physical and social functioning, general health perception, and health change were associated with RTW. Finally, with regard to the group with psychological complaints the RAND-36 subscales mental health and general health perception predicted RTW. CONCLUSION: Several aspects of self-rated health predict RTW for employees on long-term sickness absence. Variables related to functional status predict RTW for employees with physical complaints in contrast to psychological problems.
17056454	0	a	OBJECTIVE: There might be a difference between non-working and working women in their perception of rights and privileges which may influence their contraceptive behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine contraceptive behavior among non-working and working women in Bangladesh determining associated factors. METHOD: Analysis was based on data from the 1999-2000 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey which employs nationally representative sample. RESULTS: The prevalence of current contraceptive use (any method) was 58.2% among non-working women and 65.5% among working women. Both rates are still low for the country. Some factors, such as discussed family planning with husband, husband approves family planning, desire for more children, and husband lives together, were influential determinants of lower contraceptive prevalence among the non-working women. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a necessity for social activities promoting husband-wife communication and women's participation in employment to enhance the use of contraceptives among Bangladeshi women, especially non-working women.
3437081	1	a	Although it is of both practical and theoretical importance very little work has been done on adolescents' knowledge of, and beliefs about, the economy. Two studies are reported in this paper--the first concerns the determinants of economic values in a population of 16-17 year old British schoolchildren, and the second concerns economic preferences and knowledge in a larger group of slightly older adolescents. By-and-large the pattern of results is not dissimilar from other studies done on older children. The results are discussed in terms of the literature on economic socialization.
6725588	1	a	"Conducted a survey to determine how aware drinkers are of the situational determinants of alcohol (N = 64). Findings showed that social drinkers were well aware of the effects of different settings on the quantity consumed and the effects experienced. These findings suggest the need for caution in generalizing laboratory findings conducted under ""non-natural"" conditions to practical applications."
2610569	1	a	The results of a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of caries in a sample of 3,237 children aged 5 to 21 are described in relation to some objectives of the WHO program. The prevalence of caries is high in the sample: 1. 31.5% of the children aged 5 to 6 are free of caries (according to the WHO objectives, 50% of the children aged 5 to 6 should have no caries), 2. the mean number of decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMF/T index) in children aged 11 to 12 is 6.6 (The DMF/T should be less than or equal to 3). The frequency of toothbrushing is distributed as follows: 23% of the children brush their teeth once a week or less, 46% brush their teeth once a day, and 31% brush their teeth twice a day or more. The purpose and the frequency of the consultations at the dentist's office have been examined: 15% of the children never consult the dentist, 44% consult the dentist in case of toothache, and 41% go to the dentist's office for screening or control. Only 3.2% of the children use regularly and appropriately fluoride tablets. Since the variance of the results is large, it is difficult to distinguish explaining variables or determinants. However, the data indicate that social groups show differences in DMF indices as well as in the behaviors associated with dental hygiene and prevention.
3628634	1	a	A theoretical model designed to assess the contribution of systematic factors contributing to vulnerability to life-events exposure is described. This model is applied to six-year longitudinal data on life events exposure for a sample of New Zealand women with school-aged children. The fitted model suggests that in the region of 30% of the variance in life-event reports over the six-year period was attributable to a common vulnerability factor. Modelling of this vulnerability factor suggested that two major determinants of vulnerability to life events were the level of social disadvantage of the woman and her level of neuroticism: women of socially disadvantaged backgrounds and women with high neuroticism scores showed a consistent tendency to report high life-event exposure during the six-year period. The implications of these findings are discussed.
19997790	0	a	BACKGROUND: Little is known about psychosocial mechanisms that may underlie differences in lifestyle change between socioeconomic groups. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine how educational level influences middle-aged participants' (N = 385) psychosocial responses to the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial. METHODS: The measurements of self-efficacy and planning for healthy lifestyle were conducted pre-intervention (T1) and post-intervention (T2, 3 months), and measurements of exercise and healthy eating as outcomes at T1 and at 12 months (T3). RESULTS: Psychosocial determinants at T1 and their T1-T2 changes were mostly similar, irrespective of educational levels. Exercise barriers self-efficacy was enhanced slightly less (p = 0.08) among the low-SES. T2 levels as well as pre-post-intervention changes in exercise self-efficacy predicted 12-month changes in exercise, and T2 diet coping planning predicted changes in dietary fat intake. The associations were similar across all SES groups. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing self-efficacy and planning is similarly effective among intervention participants regardless of education level.
19342853	0	a	BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a recognized and important outcome after stroke. An increased survival and the presence of moderate impairment in long-term stroke survivors impact their HRQoL. METHODS: HRQoL measures and HRQoL determinants in stroke survivors are reviewed. RESULTS: Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in western countries. Specific HRQoL scales have been developed in the last years, such as the Stroke Impact Scale, the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale, the Stroke and Aphasia HRQoL Scale, and the Burden of Stroke Scale. Disability and poststroke depression are consistent determinants of HRQoL. Other determinants include female sex, coping strategies, and social support. Poststroke depression affects HRQoL, functional recovery, cognitive function and healthcare use in stroke survivors. Stroke caregivers have lower HRQoL, greater prevalence of stress and depression, economical burden, and changes in social relationships. Advancing age and anxiety in patients and caregivers, high dependency and poor family support identify caregivers at risk of adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Physical and psychosocial well-being is greatly affected in stroke survivors and their caregivers.
15778630	0	a	This study examined the relationship between early childhood caries (ECC) and measures of socioeconomic status as environmental determinants of oral health inequalities. Dental caries and quality of oral hygiene were reported on 384 young inner-city children (24-35 months) by clinical examination. Early childhood caries was diagnosed in 18.5% of children. Ethnicity (P < 0.001) and neighborhood (P < 0.001) were the social variables significantly predictive of ECC in a logistic regression model. Living in a deprived neighborhood and the mother being of East European descent were the social variables with strongest association with ECC. These variables can be considered adequate criteria to identify groups at risk within the overall population.
19476670	0	a	A recent study to measure social disability used the results of a questionnaire administered to 696 patients between March 14th and April 7th 2007 which showed that three-quarters of the population surveyed have a social disability. Major determinants of social disadvantage are found using three specific indicators: income, assets and home-interior comfort. A greater deterioration of poor health status was not particularly noted within the most socially disadvantage group of patients, and social disability did not lead to actual over-consumption of medical products or services. People with social disabilities remained hospitalised more than 1.5 days over the average length of hospital stay which accounts for an inferred additional costs to hospital budgets equivalent to 10.3 million ?. The article proposes a model for measuring social disability that can be used routinely upon patient admission to identify socially disadvantaged cases in order to offer those patients specific and tailored assistance and reduce the length of their stay. This model may also support public health policy monitoring.
7405948	1	a	The transitions from person to patient and back represent social decision points rather than boundaries determined by shifting biological equilibria, as doctors so often suppose. Moreover, host resistance to pathogenic agents is weakened by social stress and strengthened by social support. Thus, the efficiency and effectivenss of medical care will be improved if the clinician, in assessing patient problems, systematically inquires into the social determinants of the decision to seek help. The probability of resolving the patient's difficulties will be enhanced by targeting treatment measures at the social components of the illness experience as well as at the pathophysiology of the disease process.
12783770	0	a	CONTEXT: Gender discrimination and son preference are key demographic features of South Asia and are well documented for India. However, gender bias and sex preference in Nepal have received little attention. METHODS: 1996 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data on ever-married women aged 15-49 who did not desire any more children were used to investigate levels of gender bias and sex preference. The level of contraceptive use and the total fertility rate in the absence of sex preference were estimated, and logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between socioeconomic and demographic variables and stopping childbearing after the birth of a son. RESULTS: Commonly used indicators of gender bias, such as sex ratio at birth and sex-specific immunization rates, do not suggest a high level of gender discrimination in Nepal. However, sex preference decreases contraceptive use by 24% and increases the total fertility rate by more than 6%. Women's contraceptive use, exposure to the media, parity, last birth interval, educational level and religion are linked to stopping childbearing after the birth of a boy, as is the ethnic makeup of the local area. CONCLUSIONS: The level of sex preference in Nepal is substantial. Sex preference is an important barrier to the increase of contraceptive use and decline of fertility in the country; its impact will be greater as desired family size declines.
16172560	0	a	Community health centers in the United States, first launched as a federal initiative in 1965, were rooted in models from South Africa, the American civil rights struggle, and a national commitment to address poverty. The first 2 centers, one serving a rural population in the Mississippi Delta and another a public housing project in Boston, incorporated such core principles as provision of primary care to a defined area or population; public health interventions addressing social determinants of health; emphasis on community participation; community empowerment leading to control of the new institutions; epidemiologic methods to identify problems and guide decisions; new combinations of clinical and public health personnel; and reduction of disparities in health and healthcare of the poor and minorities. The continuing relevance of these principles in today's greatly expanded health center network is reviewed.
10256650	1	a	Analyses were performed to investigate several hypotheses concerning the multiple determinants of levels of life expectancy in developing countries in recent decades and some possible explanation for the observed variations in amount of gain in life expectancy from the 1950's to the 1970's. The findings were significant. For level of life expectancy the results of this present work conform by and large to results of other scholars in this area, although the present work is unique in that only developing countries were included. From the 1960's to the 1970's there has been a shift in the relative importance of economic indicators and general social indicators in favor of the social indicators. In the period 1960-65 some 70% of the variation in levels of life expectancy was associated with per capita income and literacy rates in a ratio of about three to two in favor of the economic variable. By 1970-75 the ratio has become six to one in favor of literacy. In addition, the multivariate model showed that the sanitation variables began to appear as significant correlates of levels of life expectancy in the more recent time period, playing a larger role than level of income per capita. Work pursued as part of a separate but concurrent project explored explicitly this three-way interaction between literacy, life expectancy and sanitation.
18477747	0	a	"BACKGROUND: This paper analyses gender inequalities in health status and in social determinants of health among the elderly in western Europe. METHODS: Data came from the first wave of the ""Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe"" (2004). For the purposes of this study a subsample of community-residing people aged 65-85 years with no paid work was selected (4218 men and 5007 women). Multiple logistic regression models separated by sex and adjusted for age and country were fitted. RESULTS: Women were more likely to report poor health status, limitations in mobility and poor mental health. Whereas in both sexes educational attainment was associated with the three health indicators, household income was only related to poor self-rated health among women. The relationship between living arrangements and health differed by gender and was primarily associated with poor mental health. In both sexes, not living with their partner but living with other people and being the household head was related to poor mental health status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.14; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.14 for men and aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.72 for women). In addition, women living with their partner and other(s) and those living alone were more likely to report poor mental health status (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.41 and aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities persist among the elderly. Women have poorer health status than men and in both sexes the risk of poor health status increases among those with low educational attainment. Living arrangements are primarily associated with poor mental health status with patterns that differ by gender."
15641886	0	a	In the present research, the authors examined the effect of procedural fairness and rewarding leadership style on an important variable for employees: self-esteem. The authors predicted that procedural fairness would positively influence people's reported self-esteem if the leader adopted a style of rewarding behavior for a job well done. Results from a scenario experiment, a laboratory experiment, and an organizational survey indeed show that procedural fairness and rewarding leadership style interacted to influence followers' self-esteem, such that the positive relationship between procedural fairness and self-esteem was more pronounced when the leadership style was high in rewarding behavior. Implications in terms of integrating the leadership and procedural fairness literature are discussed.
16115285	0	a	Birthweight is used as an indicator of individual and population health and is known to be strongly correlated with adult cardiovascular disease. This paper uses routinely collected maternity discharge data from Scotland between 1980 and 2000 to look at birthweight trends and the changes in the distribution of maternal risk factors for birthweight. We also examine the contributions of each of the risk factors to birthweight trends and investigate whether there has been a reduction in inequality in birthweight over time. Data from 1,282,172 singleton live births were used in the analysis. Both mean birthweight and low birthweight (LBW:<2500 g) were used as outcomes. The risk factors studied were maternal age, parity, maternal height, marital status and occupational social class of the father. The slope and relative indices of inequality were used to measure the change in inequalities over time. Mean birthweight increased from 3320 g in 1980 to 3410 g in 2000, while the percentage LBW decreased slightly from 5.7% in 1980 to 5.4% in 2000. The prevalence of many risk factors changed; there has been an increase in the proportion of older mothers, single mothers, taller mothers and mothers with undetermined social class. Although most risk factors had a significant change in effect over time, the inequalities in birthweight between groups did not appear to diminish over time. Both the slope and relative index of inequality had a quadratic relationship over time, with the inequalities in birthweight being greatest in the early 1980s and late 1990s.
6663350	1	a	The epidemiological and clinical profile of Chronic Post-Traumatic Headache (CPTH) has been studied in 57 out of 130 consecutive patients hospitalized, following closed head injuries, at the Institute of Neurosurgery of the University of Milan. The incidence of CPTH has been 44%. Age of the patients ranged between 4 and 69 years. Clinical pictures included closed head injuries of different degree of severity: mild, moderate and severe. Time of onset, headache frequency, character, intensity, duration and associated symptoms showed a great degree of variability. However, chronic muscle contraction headache was the commonest clinical syndrome followed by migraine. Moderate correlations have been found between the severity of CPTH disturbance of consciousness, following the head trauma, and positive findings at CT scan. Moreover the comparison of personality profiles (MMPI) of CPTH (n=26) with a post-traumatic control group, without headache (n=17) showed higher scores on hypocondriasis, depression, hysteria and schizophrenia scales only in the severe CPTH group. Age of the patients, duration of unconsciousness, neurological deficits, course length and pending litigation or compensations were unrelated to the occurrence and outcome of CPTH. These findings suggest the importance of both physical and psychological determinants (social or emotional maladjustment) in the pathogenesis of CPTH.

3529422	1	a	The development of a theory of quality of life following serious illness is currently an important field of endeavour in rehabilitation research. The interpersonal relationships of people and elements of the self-concept appear to be salient factors in causal models of subjective well-being. One such model developed to explain characteristic levels of well-being was used in a longitudinal study of adaptation to a first myocardial infarction. Data were collected from a national sample of male cardiac patients and their spouses on the illness and marital situation as predictors of long-term well-being or ill-being. Analyses of data from the first three waves of the study, which is to extend over 5 years after the onset of illness, are to be discussed in the paper. Marital status, the emotional quality of the spouse relationship and long-standing marital stressors were found to have direct and indirect effects on the two dimensions of the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. The same is true of continuing problems associated with the heart attack relative to perceptions of having coped effectively with the after effects of illness. Differences in self-esteem and personal competence were suggested as mediators of socio-environmental and illness-related influences. The two-factor conception of well-being developed was found to be a useful framework for investigating positive and negative aspects of psychosocial rehabilitation. The same factors that explain differences between happy and unhappy people in social indicators research also appeared to be determinants of different trajectories of adaptation in the wake of a life-threatening illness. Previous research using theoretical models from stress research has overemphasized psychosocial morbidity and stress management and neglected positive processes of adaptation. The identification of love resources related to positive feeling states and life satisfaction has, therefore, not received the attention it deserves. This is especially the case regarding an overemphasis of the concept of social support as a buffer of stress. Instruments were developed to measure high and low marital intimacy, as well as chronic marital role strains, and these measures appeared to explain different trajectories of adjustment to cardiac disease. The two-factor model appears to be useful for future work on quality of life with chronic illness. The same is true of four marital contexts of rehabilitation that were identified in the study.
20841084	1	a	The paper deals with the factors which affect contraceptive attitudes, behaviors, and the relationship between the two. The analysis is based upon original survey data from 2,446 women in Venezuela and related literature. The results suggest that both positive attitudes and contraceptive accessibility are major determinants of contraception but at the aggregate level neither has a decisive advantage over the other. The three best predictors of contraceptive use are: specific contraceptive attitudes, social support, and accessibility of contraceptives. Their impacts on behavior are direct and additive; however, their impacts vary significantly by education and number of living children. In general attitude change strategy is more effective with younger women while improving accessibility affects older women more often. Implications for policy and programs are presented.
3806448	1	a	Social psychological models of health care behaviour frequently take as their starting point perception of the illness. This paper seeks to examine factors that may influence these perceptions. Beliefs about the seriousness of eleven childhood illnesses are compared in four groups of parents. Significant differences were evident between the groups of parents depending upon their experiences with illness. For three conditions (diabetes, asthma and epilepsy) the lowest rating of seriousness was made by parents with a child with that condition. For parents of children with diabetes, having a relative with diabetes in good health was associated with a perception of the illness as significantly less serious than those with a relative in average or poor health, or those with no relatives with diabetes. These results are interpreted within an information processing model. Implications of the findings for social psychological models of health care behaviour are discussed.
18720399	0	a	Hurricane Katrina was the most devastating natural disaster to hit the United States in the past 75 years. The authors conducted interviews of 810 persons who were representative of adult residents living in the 23 southernmost counties of Mississippi before Hurricane Katrina. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) since Hurricane Katrina was 22.5%. The determinants of PTSD were female gender, experience of hurricane-related financial loss, postdisaster stressors, low social support, and postdisaster traumatic events. Kaplan-Meier survival curves suggest that exposure to both hurricane-related traumatic events and to financial and social stressors influenced the duration of PTSD symptoms. Postdisaster interventions that aim to improve manipulable stressors after these events may influence the onset and course of PTSD.
3130744	1	a	In a longitudinal pilot study on the course of the PCB concentration in human milk during six months of lactation, some important PCB determinants could be studied in 23 women and their infants. PCB values were within the range of those found in the literature. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the association of the mean PCB concentration over the first half year of lactation with maternal parameters, such as age, height, weight, previous lactation period, education, occupation, residence, smoking, drinking and dietary habits as well as the infant parameters gestational age, birthweight and weight gain in the first six months of life. Since the PCB concentration on fat basis and the fat content of the milk were strongly inversely related, statistical analyses were carried out both on fat and on milk basis. In univariate analyses the PCB concentration on fat basis was most strongly associated with pre- versus post-pregnancy weight gain, age and occupation. After multiple regression analysis PCB concentration on fat basis remained significantly associated with weight gain changes and remained borderline (p less than 0.10) significantly related with occupation. The pre-pregnancy Quetelet Index of the mother (height/weight) and the estimated PCB content of the diet (primarily fish) were strongly correlated with the PCB concentration on milk basis. Only the Quetelet Index remained significantly related after multiple regression analysis.

15210092	0	a	Social capital is an increasingly popular construct in research examining social and behavioral determinants of health and well-being. Yet, comparing the results of social capital research is inhibited by inconsistencies in labeling, different definitions and subsequent disagreement on level of analysis, and limited evaluation of the psychometric properties of measures of social capital. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Social Capital Questionnaire (Journal of Applied Behavioral Science 36(1) (2000) 23). In the current study, the original Australian-based instrument was modified for telephone administration with a US sample. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a similar factor structure to that found during initial survey development. These findings lend support to the notion of social capital as a meaningful construct and suggest the Onyx and Bullen instrument deserves further attention as a practical tool for health researchers and community agencies interested in social capital.
3529452	1	a	The literature was reviewed to assess whether the evidence implicating socio-environmental (SE) factors as determinants of adult lung function was sufficient to require that they be taken into account in epidemiological studies, together with other factors, such as age and smoking. In six studies involving 11,000 adults resident in the USA, France and Denmark forced expiratory volume in 1 second was related to social class and/or one of a number of other factors including education, area of residence and housing status. Trends in three other studies involving approximately 15,000 children resident in the UK and the USA were similar. The consistency of the findings makes it difficult to escape the conclusion that SE factors should be taken into account in comparisons of lung function between populations when the purpose is to assess the role of other environmental factors such as occupational exposure.
3992291	1	a	The dominant explanation of nurses' affective experience in work is the conflict between the beliefs and expectations developed during the formal training process (education) and the role definitions in the hospital work setting. Specifically, it is generally proposed that baccalaureate trained nurses experience this person-role conflict more than the associate or diploma trained nurse because baccalaureate training instills more beliefs/expectations that conflict with the hospital nursing role. However, research has not sufficiently compared the effect of 'socialization' variables like education with other variables found to affect the work experience. This study uses path analysis to explore the relative effects of education, length of experience and the measured interpersonal work environment across types of person-role conflicts, on overall job satisfaction and on propensity to leave. The results show that the interpersonal factors are the paramount determinants of the measured person-role conflicts and, as well, have a greater effect than education and experience on job satisfaction. Also, education and length of experience have greater direct than indirect effects on propensity to leave, indicating that their effects are not via causality of job-related stress. Implications for programs designed to improve the nurse's work experience and affects are discussed.
11697274	0	a	We examined the effect of relation between interferences from distractor and inhibitory mechanism on the occurrence of negative priming, by using a matching paradigm. The ease of perceptual target selection was determined by magnitudes of interference. Stereoscopic depth was used to manipulate the relative position of a target, a distractor and a standard figure. When the ease of perceptual target selection was manipulated by separation of the target from the distractor in depth, positive priming occurred. However, the ease of target selection turned out to be unnecessary in the occurrence of priming effects. When the distractor and the standard figure were displayed at the same depth plane, where the distractor was supposed to interfere with the encoding of a standard figure, negative priming occurred consistently regardless of the ease of perceptual target selection. This study suggests that inhibitory mechanism contributes to the suppression of inappropriate processes by distractor, and inhibitory mechanism actively keeps distractors from interfering with standard figures.
19243657	0	a	BACKGROUND: Depression in old age is an important public health problem causing considerable morbidity and disability worldwide. There is a dearth of community studies from India investigating geriatric depression and its associated risk factors. This study aimed to establish the nature, prevalence and factors associated with geriatric depression in a rural south Indian community. METHODS: We recruited 1000 participants aged over 65 years from Kaniyambadi block, Vellore, India. We assessed their socio-demographic profile, psychiatric morbidity, cognitive functioning, anthropometrics and disability status using the following structured assessment tools: Geriatric Mental State, Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, Modified CERAD 10 word list learning task, History and Aetiology Schedule Dementia Diagnosis and Subtype, WHO Disability Assessment Scale II, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We adopted a case control framework to study the factors associated with geriatric depression. RESULTS: Prevalence of geriatric depression (ICD-10) within the previous one month was 12.7% (95% CI 10.64-14.76%). Low income (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.08-2.91), experiencing hunger (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.56-4.26), history of cardiac illnesses (OR 4.75; 95% CI 1.96-11.52), transient ischemic attack (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.17-5.05), past head injury (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.36-5.36) and diabetes (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.15-4.72) increased the risk for geriatric depression after adjusting for other determinants using conditional logistic regression. Having more confidants (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.06-0.26) was the significant protective factor. Age, female gender, cognitive impairment and disability status were not significantly associated with geriatric depression. DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression was significantly correlated with experiencing hunger, diabetes, transient ischemic attack, past head injury, more disability and less nourishment; having more friends was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric depression is prevalent in rural south India. Poverty and physical ill health are risk factors for depression among elderly while good social support is protective.
3071406	1	a	In this presentation, physical appearance has been considered an inseparable part of daily human existence. Relevant aspects of research in social psychology on interpersonal attraction and personality theory stressing narcissistic vulnerability were reviewed. General systems theory was proposed as a theoretical framework from which to view the multifactorial aspects of the psychosomatics of beauty and ugliness. In support of this proposition, the contemporary use of systems thinking in medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, family therapy, and the understanding of emotions was stressed. Emotional reactions to the evaluations of physical appearance by self and others were shown to be inevitable, involving appraisal and feedback processes affecting different systems in the person's life. The person's self-image and self-esteem were stressed as underlying determinants of outcome in health and in illness. Finally, we hope to have communicated our belief that in the present, as a way of integrating and summarizing the knowledge obtained in the specialized fields, systems thinking allows for more creative and successful treatment outcomes.
3266745	1	a	Few studies have analysed the influence of exercise training or cardiac rehabilitation on return to work in patients with coronary artery disease. In a consecutive series of 41 men less than 60 years of age admitted for acute myocardial infarction, 19 participated in a comprehensive rehabilitation programme focused on physical training, and 22 received standard care. The baseline clinical and social variables of the two groups were comparable except for left ventricular ejection fraction which was significantly lower in the intervention group. Work resumption was not significantly different between the two groups (9/19, 47% in the intervention group vs 17/22, 77% in the control group); after three years, 42% and 73%, respectively, were still employed. These results are in keeping with that of most controlled studies of cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction or coronary artery surgery, which fail to demonstrate a significant improvement in work resumption. Psychosocial factors are probably more important determinants of work resumption than is exercise training.
3168891	1	a	"This article analyses the practice of what is termed ""liberal medicine""--which has paralleled developments in how society is organized--and examines its historical and social determinants. The evolution of the term ""liberal"" over the centuries, to its present meaning of ""practicing the profession as a self-employed physician,"" is discussed. The author continues the analysis by describing the liberal practice of medicine in the context of the terms of trade in the market for health services and professionals, which lead them to become small-businessmen in their profession. Liberal medicine develops when the unrestricted supply and demand for goods and services reaches the point where production and consumption are determined by systematic trade in a free market, without the restrictions and ties of an outdated social order. But legitimacy and controls related to the rules and regulations of the State, and of professional organizations do exist. This field of study will be examined further in future publications by the author, and by others interested in the problems of the labor force in the health sector."

3384599	1	a	Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological reasons were studied prospectively for a four month period in an Indian General Hospital. Psychiatric emergencies constituted only 2% of all emergency visits. Most of the patients were new except for 7.4% who were already registered with the outpatient services of the psychiatry department. Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 2:1. Self-referrals constituted 77% of the samples; 21% of patients were brought by police. Two-thirds of the patients were brought owing to the severity of their clinical condition and the rest, one-third, for medico-legal and social reasons. Approximately 80% of the patients sought consultation within one month of the onset of illness episode. First episode of mental illness was within last one year of the emergency room visit in 60% patients. Past history of hospitalization for mental illness was obtained only in 10% of cases. The pattern suggested that there was no misuse of emergency services by psychiatric patients although 20% of the patients presented with social problems only which required social rather than psychiatric intervention.
12137318	0	a	The present paper aims at describing the most relevant background data on geomorphological, economic, ethnohistoric, demographic and linguistic features of the island of Vis. As an introduction to future holistic anthropological research on the island, it seeks to identify both internal and external impulses of change and/or continuity of the island population structure within a wider socio-cultural and historical context. The ethnohistorical and demographic data indicate a higher degree of isolation throughout history as compared to other islands in the region and a continuous depopulation trend during the last century. The analysis of the existing linguistic data on two main settlements shows a certain amount of intradialectal micro-differentiation, which is mainly due to various social and non-linguistic reasons.
10960532	0	a	"BACKGROUND: Health policymakers are concerned about the proportion of people who say they are unwilling to receive a blood transfusion. This article examines how social, cultural, and political factors affect the perceived risk of transfusions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected as part of a large national telephone survey of 1204 people conducted in the United States in 1997 and 1998. The survey elicited images associated with blood transfusions and contained questions about the perceived risk of the blood supply, sensitivity to stigma, world views, trust, and demographics. RESULTS: The results showed that a substantial proportion of people do not consider the US blood supply to be safe and say they would not accept blood if hospitalized. The images evoked most frequently by the stimulus phrase ""blood transfusions"" were related to AIDS or HIV. The people who tend to perceive the greatest personal and public risk from blood transfusions are female, nonwhite, and less educated, and they have not previously received a transfusion. Sensitivity to stigma, mistrust, one's perceived inability to control hazardous activities and technologies, and fatalistic and egalitarian world views tend to be associated with heightened concern about the risk of blood transfusions. CONCLUSION: Risk perceptions need to be monitored to anticipate and deal with problems of public acceptance. Risk management strategies should be tailored to the specific characteristics of individuals that are important determinants of the perceived risk of transfusions."
3384599	1	a	Determinants of emergency room visits for psychological reasons were studied prospectively for a four month period in an Indian General Hospital. Psychiatric emergencies constituted only 2% of all emergency visits. Most of the patients were new except for 7.4% who were already registered with the outpatient services of the psychiatry department. Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 2:1. Self-referrals constituted 77% of the samples; 21% of patients were brought by police. Two-thirds of the patients were brought owing to the severity of their clinical condition and the rest, one-third, for medico-legal and social reasons. Approximately 80% of the patients sought consultation within one month of the onset of illness episode. First episode of mental illness was within last one year of the emergency room visit in 60% patients. Past history of hospitalization for mental illness was obtained only in 10% of cases. The pattern suggested that there was no misuse of emergency services by psychiatric patients although 20% of the patients presented with social problems only which required social rather than psychiatric intervention.
19826556	0	a	Understanding social inequalities in health is of great importance; it provides the conceptual frame for investigating the social factors that affect health, together with empirical evidence for improving population health. Individual and socioeconomic data, disease related conditions and self rated health (SRH) ratings were collected from a representative sample of 1,000 participants in order to study health inequalities in Greece. 20.8% of men and 37.2% of women reported poor health status. Significant inequalities in SRH were observed. Strong associations of poor SRH with gender, age, insurance coverage and chronic diseases were identified. Social insurance scheme captured partly the effects of educational level, income and residence area in SRH in multivariate analysis. Respondents under chronic treatment and those suffering from cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and neurological/psychiatric disorders exhibited the highest risk of reporting poor SRH. Our findings provide decision-makers with insights into how to manage health inequalities by prioritizing preventive measures and consequently, progress towards the fair distribution of healthcare resources.
6705636	1	a	This essay is based on the assumption that a long-neglected topic of socialization, the determinants of individual differences in parental functioning, is illuminated by research on the etiology of child maltreatment. Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child.
3067531	1	a	The present paper will review and discuss research issues and findings of recent cross-cultural studies of severe mental disorders. The paper is divided into two main sections. The first section will discuss: (1) the concept of culture, (2) hierarchical levels of human behavior determinants, (3) the cultural variability continuum, and (4) the concept of self. The second section will discuss: (1) epidemiology, (2) culture and clinical phenomenology in severe disorders, and (3) culture as an etiological determinant. The paper closes with a discussion of some conclusions and suggestions for future research.
18365511	0	a	Loneliness is an indicator of social well-being and pertains to the feeling of missing an intimate relationship (emotional loneliness) or missing a wider social network (social loneliness). The 11-item De Jong Gierveld scale has proved to be a valid and reliable measuring instrument for overall, emotional and social loneliness, although its length has sometimes rendered it difficult to use the scale in large surveys. In this study, we empirically tested a shortened version of the scale on data from two surveys (N=9448). Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the specification of two latent factors. Congruent validity and the relationship with determinants (partner status, health) proved to be optimal. The 6-item De Jong Gierveld scale is a reliable and valid measuring instrument for overall, emotional and social loneliness, which is suitable for large surveys.
6486090	1	a	Associations between smoking habit, social class, body mass index, and diet were examined in 493 men aged 45 to 59 yr, selected from the general population and who had completed a 7-day weighed dietary record. Smokers were lighter than nonsmokers and had a lower body mass index. There was no difference in energy intake, but in general, smokers had lower intakes of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Exsmokers had similar intakes to nonsmokers. Manual workers tended to be shorter, had a higher body mass index, higher intakes of energy and carbohydrates, and lower intakes of vitamins and minerals than nonmanual workers. Social class had a greater effect than smoking habit on intakes of energy and carbohydrates, whereas smoking habit had the greater effect on intakes of minerals and vitamins. Body mass index was associated negatively with sucrose intake and positively with protein intake, smoking habit, and social class being less important determinants.
18777671	0	a	There exists a lot of research on the reservation wages of the unemployed as a determinant of unemployment duration. Little is known about the reservation wages of those who are not in the labor force but might be potential labor force returnees, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries. The main objective of this article is to assess what can be learned from the subjective reservation wages of DI beneficiaries. Using the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS), the article assesses the magnitudes of reservation wages compared to the last wage earned and the benefit amount, as well as the determinants of reservation wages in a regression framework. The NBDS is unique in that it provides the reservation wages and the work history of DI beneficiaries before and after joining the DI rolls. The article has several noteworthy results and policy implications: *Data show that a significant portion of beneficiaries report being likely to accept a job if offered one. Based on the NBDS, 13 percent of DI beneficiaries who did not work since joining the rolls in 1981-1982 reported in 1991 that they would be willing to work if offered a job and provided their reservation wages. *DI beneficiaries do not appear to price themselves out of the labor market. Half of them would want a wage that is 80 percent or less of the last wage earned before receiving DI. It is estimated that approximately 7 percent of long-term DI beneficiaries may potentially return-to-work if they search for jobs and have a wage offer distribution with a mean at 80 percent of their last wage. *The nonlabor income in addition to the benefit is positively and significantly associated with the reservation wage, while the benefit amount per se is not. However, this result needs to be treated with caution given that nonlabor income is endogenous to the model. *Heterogeneity exists between persons still under the DI program and those that have moved to the Old-Age program. The subsamples of persons who have shifted to the Old-Age program and those who are still under the DI program have median reservation wage to the last wage ratios of 0.69 and 0.93, respectively. A significantly lower reservation wage for persons who have moved to the Old-Age program was also found in a regression framework. This heterogeneity between the two groups may result in part from the different program characteristics both groups face, for instance, in terms of benefit termination and Medicare eligibility rules. *Subjective reservation wage data can be useful to study populations that are out of the labor force. This article is innovative in that it focuses on a group of persons who are typically considered as being out of the labor force, and therefore are not asked reservation wages in general household surveys such as the Current Population Survey. It would be of great interest to collect more reservation wage data for DI beneficiaries in a longitudinal data set to expand this analysis, for instance, to assess conclusively the effects of changing program characteristics on reservation wages and return-to-work outcomes as beneficiaries transition to the Old-Age program or as new return-to-work programs are put in place.
15522793	0	a	"Voles of the genus Microtus represent one of the most speciose mammalian genera in the Holarctic. We established a molecular phylogeny for Microtus to resolve contentious issues of systematic relationships and evolutionary history in this genus. A total of 81 specimens representing ten Microtus species endemic to Europe as well as eight Eurasian, six Asian and one Holarctic species were sequenced for the entire cytochrome b gene (1140 bp). A further 25 sequences were retrieved from GenBank, providing data on an additional 23, mainly Nearctic, Microtus species. Phylogenetic analysis of these 48 species generated four well-supported monophyletic lineages. The genus Chionomys, snow voles, formed a distinct and well-supported lineage separate from the genus Microtus. The subgenus Microtus formed the strongest supported lineage with two sublineages displaying a close relationship between the arvalis species group (common voles) and the socialis species group (social voles). Monophyly of the Palearctic pitymyid voles, subgenus Terricola, was supported, and this subgenus was also subdivided into two monophyletic species groups. Together, these groupings clarify long-standing taxonomic uncertainties in Microtus. In addition, the ""Asian"" and the Nearctic lineages reported previously were identified although the latter group was not supported. However, relationships among the main Microtus branches were not resolved, suggesting a rapid and potentially simultaneous radiation of a widespread ancestor early in the history of the genus. This and subsequent radiations discernible in the cytochrome b phylogeny, show the considerable potential of Microtus for analysis of historical and ecological determinants of speciation in small mammals. It is evident that speciation is an ongoing process in the genus and that the molecular data provides a vital insight into current species limits as well as cladogenic events of the past."
16783115	0	a	The purpose of this study was to examine the demographic, medical, and social cognitive determinants of exercise intentions in a population-based sample of multiple myeloma cancer survivors. Using a cross-sectional survey, 70 multiple myeloma cancer survivors completed a questionnaire that assessed their medical and demographic characteristics, past exercise behavior, and social cognitive exercise beliefs using the theory of planned behavior. Seventy participants provided valuable data. Descriptive statistics indicated that participants had quite positive instrumental attitude, intentions, and subjective norms and moderate levels of perceived behavioral control and affective attitudes for exercise. Forced entry multiple regression showed that the theory of planned behavior explained 43% of the variance in exercise intentions. Instrumental attitude and perceived behavioral control were both independent predictors of exercise intentions. No demographic or medical variable moderated the association between the theory of planned behavior constructs and exercise intentions. The results of the present investigation support the growing body of evidence confirming the utility of the theory of planned behavior to understand the salient determinants of exercise in cancer survivors. Knowledge gained from this study provides important information to oncology practitioners who are responsible for delivering supportive care interventions, including exercise, to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma.
2489983	1	a	The determinants of contraceptive method choice in Sri Lanka are examined during a period in which contraceptive prevalence increased by over 60% and involved substantial use of sterilization and traditional methods. Data are from the 1975 World Fertility and 1982 Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. Polytomous logistic regression is used to model four current contraceptive choices: non-use, use of a traditional method, use of a modern temporary method and use of sterilization. The analysis shows, in 1975 and 1982, strong socioeconomic as well as demographic effects on whether any method is used. However, in both years the type of method chosen is primarily a function of demographic considerations related to the couple's family-building stage rather than social status, implying that in Sri Lanka there are few socioeconomic barriers limiting access to different contraceptive methods. The family planning programme, however, has emphasized sterilization rather than birth spacing methods.
16821508	0	a	Many Americans do not have access to adequate medical care. Previous research on this problem focuses primarily on individual-level determinants of access such as income and insurance coverage. The role of community-level factors in helping or hindering individuals in obtaining needed medical care, however, has not received much attention. We address this gap in the literature by investigating the association between neighborhood residential instability and access to health care. Using individual-level data from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and block-group level data from the 2000 decennial census, we find that individuals who live in neighborhoods with high residential turnover have worse health care access than residents of other neighborhoods. This association persists even when the prevalence of poverty, the supply of health care, and a variety of individual characteristics are held constant. We offer explanations for these findings and suggest directions for future research.
11556777	0	a	The contamination of blood products by HIV in the early 1980s resulted in thousands of deaths among people with hemophilia in the United States and elsewhere. In the US, industry, government, physicians, and advocacy groups were implicated in this tragedy. In response to pleas from members of the US hemophilia community, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science convened a public hearing to identify the institutional determinants of the HIV/AIDS epidemic among US hemophilia patients. The resulting IOM Report (1995) established a narrative of the crisis and indicated necessary improvements to the management of the US blood supply. The Report, however, failed to address the hemophilia community's demands for accountability and retribution. In this paper we explore the moral and social dimensions of this tragedy through narrative analysis of the original testimonies of hemophilia sufferers, interviews with some patients and their families, and a re-examination of the text of the IOM Report itself. We examine the process by which this crisis was addressed--through the discourses of science and law--and how it was ultimately framed as a failure of management and oversight rather than a moral failure of the for-profit health-care system. Thus, while the Report and its aftermath demonstrate powerfully how testimonials of suffering can influence public policy, by not addressing what is at stake for the victims--failure to protect patients in an era of increasingly commodified health care--it led to an exculpatory solution that obfuscated the moral dimensions of suffering.
16880215	0	a	There is an extensive literature within anthropology, sociology and psychology about lay concepts of determinants of health and illness. Many of these studies have used single sex or social class samples, often in narrow age bands, and many are qualitative in approach. We asked respondents in a health survey to say how important (on a five-point scale) they thought seven potential influences on health (habits, self-care, the environment, family relationships, one's constitution, money and luck) were. The first three were regarded as very important, the second three as less important and luck as least important. Responses were consistent with current public health and epidemiological knowledge; these respondents endorsed prevailing views about personal responsibility for health and about the role of the physical and social environment in influencing health. In mutually adjusted models, there were no significant gender differences, social class differences and neighbourhood differences in three out of seven influences, and age differences in four out of seven influences. Thus, socio-demographic differences were less marked than might be inferred from studies of specific social groups, indicating a need for caution in health education and health promotion practice against always assuming socio-demographic differences.
14959592	0	a	UNLABELLED: A prospective cohort study was conducted to explore the extent of congruence and to identify the determinants of congruence between the preferred and actual place of death of terminally ill cancer patients. A total of 180 terminally ill cancer patients were enrolled (87% response rate) and 127 died during the one-year study period. Nearly 90% of the subjects preferred to die at home. One-third achieved their preference for place of death. The kappa value of congruence (kappa = 0.11, 95% confidence interval = 0.05-0.17) indicated poor to slight agreement between the preferred and actual place death. Important determinants of congruence between the preferred and actual place of death for terminally ill cancer patients included rehospitalisation and receiving hospice home care during the final days of life, perceived ability for family to help achieve preferred place of death, and residence in New Haven County. CONCLUSIONS: This study directly confirms that the degree of congruence between the preferred and actual place death is unsatisfactory. Clinical interventions and health policies need to be developed to assist terminally ill cancer patients who may not be able to achieve their preference for place of end-of-life care and death.
17876483	0	a	More than any other low- and middle-income country, Brazil has the longest research tradition of establishing, maintaining and exploiting birth cohort studies. This research pedigree is highlighted in the present issue of the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, which contains a series of twelve papers from the Ribeirao Preto and Sao Luis birth cohort studies from the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil, respectively. The topics covered in this raft of reports vary and include predictors of perinatal health and maternal risk factors, early life determinants of cardiovascular risk factors in childhood and adolescence, use of health services, and a description of dietary characteristics of young adults, amongst other topics. There is also a guide to the background, objectives, sampling and protocols employed across these studies, which, together with similar pieces published in past issues of the Brazilian Journal, serve as a very useful starting point, particularly for potential collaborators. In the fervent hope that further follow-up of these cohorts will take place--we provide our own justification for cohort maintenance and extension in this issue--future data collection could include: genetic material, atherosclerosis, ascertained, for instance, by intima-media thickness, and IQ testing in children--scores from which are emerging as potentially important predictors of adult health outcomes up to six decades later.
3749967	1	a	Rumor and misinformation about oral contraceptives continue to prevail in much of Egypt. This study tests the hypothesis that rumor involvement can have a negative and independent impact on pill usage by focusing on a common misbelief that the pill causes 'weakness'. The data comes from a 1981-1982 national self-weighted sample survey of 3283 currently married men and women dealing with family planning and mass media behaviors. The analyses confirm that rumor involvement decreases the probability of current or future pill use by previous users and by those who have never used it. Correct knowledge about the pill is shown to enhance pill usage as do other determinants such as social support for birth control and the desire for no more children. The importance of providing strong contraceptive education programs giving deeper consideration to contraceptive and related health beliefs in delivering fertility regulation services is highlighted.
12316261	1	a	The impact of differentials in key socioeconomic variables on fertility levels in 32 developing countries is assessed through multiple regression analysis of aggregate-level data on 27 developing countries for 3 recent guinguennia, grouped into 4 categories according to region (Latin America vs Asia/Oceania/Africa) and stage of fertility transition (recent vs relatively prolonged fertility decline). The results demonstrate the substantial impact of differences in child survival and educational attainment on the intercountry variance of fertility rate ranges from 46-84%), while economic indicators (per capita gross national product and % labor force in agriculture) have slight net impact.
2723595	1	a	Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services.
17031317	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To describe the maternal acceptability of formula-feeding proposed to reduce postnatal HIV transmission in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. METHODS: Each consenting HIV-infected pregnant women, age > or =18 years, who received a perinatal antiretroviral prophylaxis was eligible. Two hierarchical infant-feeding options were proposed antenatally: exclusive formula-feeding or short-term exclusive breast-feeding. Formula-feeding was provided free up to age 9 months. Determinants of acceptability were analyzed using a logistic regression. Formula-feeding failure was defined as having breast-fed one's child at least once. RESULTS: Between March 2001 and March 2003, 580 women delivered: 97% expressed their infant-feeding choice before delivery; 53% chose formula-feeding. Significant prenatal determinants for refusing formula-feeding were: living with her partner, being Muslim, having a low educational level, being followed in one of the study sites, having not disclosed her HIV status, and having been included within the first 6 months of the project. Among the 295 mothers who formula-fed, the Kaplan-Meier probability of success of the formula-feeding option was 93.6% at Day 2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.7% to 96.3%) and 84.2% at 12 months (95% CI: 79.9% to 88.5%): 46 of 295 (15.6%) women breast-fed at least once, of whom 41% temporarily practiced mixed-feeding at Day 2 because of social stigma or newborn poor health. CONCLUSIONS: In settings with general access to clean water, structured antenatal counseling, and sustained provision of free formula, slightly over half of HIV-infected women chose to artificially feed their newborn infant. Low mixed-feeding rates were observed. This social acceptability must be balanced with mother-child long-term health outcomes to guide safe recommendations on infant-feeding among HIV-infected women in African urban settings.
17363221	0	a	"PURPOSE: Recent work suggested that psychosis might be expressed at subclinical levels. However, the determinants of subclinical psychotic symptoms, the degree of continuity over the life span, and the impact on functioning remain unclear. Thus we analyzed the prevalence, determinants, patterns and impact of subclinical psychotic symptoms in a community cohort over a 20-year period. METHODS: The Zurich Study - a longitudinal community study - started in 1979 with a sample of 591 participants aged 20/21 years. Follow-up interviews were conducted at age 23, 28, 30, 35 and 41. Symptoms were assessed with a semi-structured interview and the SCL90-R. In this analysis, items of the SCL90-R symptom dimensions ""paranoid ideation"" and ""psychoticism"" were examined. RESULTS: Two distinct symptom dimensions of subclinical psychosis became evident, one representing schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, the other representing schizotypal signs. Cannabis use in adolescence was associated specifically with schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, whereas childhood adversity as well as chronic physical or mental disorders in parents contributed to schizotypal signs. Individuals with a persistently high level of either of the two identified symptom dimensions over 20 years experienced significant deficiencies in social achievement and functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of psychotic symptoms in populations is continuous and characterized by differing levels of severity and persistence. A small group of individuals displays persistence of subclinical psychotic symptoms over a period of 20 years. The causes of and pathways to clinical psychotic disorder can be studied long before the disorder becomes clinically relevant."
2814648	1	a	The paper provides the results of sample socio-hygienic survey of 418 women after operation of mini-abortion. The women are classified according to age and family status. The contraceptive behaviour of women is analysed, methods and types of contraception are examined. With respect to this new type of activity, main causes of visits to the women's consultation clinic and certain medical and organisational aspects of its work are analysed.
6584748	1	a	Maori mortality is compared with that of other New Zealanders aged 15-64 in the period 1974 to 1978. For males, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the Maori excess in mortality is associated with marked ethnic differences in socio-economic status. Of the remaining excess, an estimated 15% is linked with cigarette smoking, 10% with alcohol consumption (excluding accidental cause of deaths), 5% with obesity and 17% was due to accidents. However 36% of the non-social class related excess involved rheumatic and hypertensive heart disease, nephritis, bronchiectasis, diabetes and tuberculosis which were all associated with a Maori mortality five or more times that for non-Maoris. It is recommended that resources should be allocated so that Maori people can be employed to maintain contact with Maori patients with these diseases in order to improve health services utilisation and compliance with therapy. While it was not possible to determine socio-economic status for females from national mortality data, other findings were similar to those found for males except that mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease also contributed to the Maori excess.
2521115	1	a	This research examined elderly people's social network ties and their awareness of services available to them. For this sample of 1,224 persons aged 60 years or older, having nonkin advisers, membership in clubs, or contacts with other community agencies and availability of transportation, education, and moderate-size kin networks predicted service awareness. Lack of available kin, the presence of large kin networks, having kin confidants, and being old, poor, and female, or black inhibited service awareness.
16211164	0	a	Oral health is an important element of general health and well-being. Although largely preventable, many people across the world still suffer unnecessarily from the pain and discomfort associated with oral diseases. In addition, the costs of dental treatment are high, both to the individual and to society. Effective evidence-based preventive approaches are needed to address this major public health problem. The aim of this paper is to outline public health strategies to promote oral health and reduce inequalities. An extensive collection of public health policy documents produced by WHO are reviewed to guide the development of oral health strategies. In addition a range of Cochrane and other systematic reviews assessing the evidence base for oral health interventions are summarized. Public health strategies should tackle the underlying social determinants of oral health through the adoption of a common risk approach. Isolated interventions which merely focus on changing oral health behaviours will not achieve sustainable improvements in oral health. Radical public health action on the conditions which determine unhealthy behaviours across the population is needed rather than relying solely on the high-risk approach. Based upon the Ottawa Charter, a range of complementary strategies can be implemented in partnership with relevant local, national and international agencies. At the core of this public health approach is the need to empower local communities to become actively involved in efforts to promote their oral health.
18202085	0	a	BACKGROUND: Parenting and parent-child relationships influence children's emotional and social development and evidence exists that they may be life-course determinants of health. This study tests the hypothesis that adverse parenting in the early years predicts poor health in mid-childhood. METHODS: A prospective study using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Health data on over 8000 children (60% of those recruited) were available for analysis at 6.9 and 7.7 years. EXPOSURES: self-reported maternal hostility, resentment and hitting/shouting in early childhood. OUTCOMES: maternal report of child's health in general and number of health problems when the child was 6.9 and 7.7 years, adjusting for socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Sub-optimal parenting, as measured here, was observed among 62, 80 and 83% of families for hostility, resentment and hitting/shouting, respectively. Resentment was more common among older mothers in owner-occupied housing. Resentment and hostility predicted health at both ages independently of socioeconomic circumstances. 'Hitting/shouting' was weakly predictive of number of health problems. A greater proportion of variance was explained by parenting variables than by socio-economic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting and parent-child relationships in the early years predict health in mid-childhood in a way consistent with a causal role. If further studies replicate this finding, policies to improve parenting could be expected to have a modest beneficial impact on health as well as emotional and social development. As some aspects of sub-optimal parenting show reverse social class distribution, initiatives targeted at those living in social deprivation may not achieve the optimum impact on health.
19161600	0	a	BACKGROUND: Vertical and horizontal trust, as dimensions of social capital, may be important determinants of health. As mass media campaigns have been used extensively to promote healthy lifestyles and convey health-related information, high levels of individual trust in the media may facilitate the success of such campaigns and, hence, have a positive influence on health. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between trust levels in mass media, an aspect of vertical trust, and health. METHODS: Based on cross-sectional data of the general population from the AsiaBarometer Survey (2003-2006), we analyzed the relationship between self-rated health and trust in mass media, using a multilevel logistic model, adjusted for age, gender, marital status, income, education, occupation, horizontal trust, and trust in the healthcare system. RESULTS: In a total of 39082 participants (mean age 38; 49% male), 26808 (69%) were classified as in good health. By the levels of trust in mass media, there were 6399 (16%) who reported that they trust a lot, 16327 (42%) reporting trust to a degree, 9838 (25%) who do not really trust, 3307 (9%) who do not trust at all, and 191 (0.5%) who have not thought about it. In the multilevel model, trust in mass media was associated with good health (do not trust at all as the base group): the odds ratios (OR) of 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.27) for do not really trust; OR of 1.35 (95% CI = 1.23-1.49) for trust to a degree, and 1.57 (95% CI = 1.36-1.81) for trust a lot. Horizontal trust and trust in the healthcare system were also associated with health. CONCLUSION: Vertical trust in mass media is associated with better health in Asian people. Since mass media is likely an important arena for public health, media trust should be enhanced to make people healthier.
17945162	0	a	BACKGROUND: Pharmacy is a dynamic, growing, and increasingly diverse profession. It has a new patient orientation, especially in developed countries. There is a paucity of work examining pharmacists' satisfaction and professionalization in developing nations, such as Lebanon. OBJECTIVE: The purpose this study is to explore the Lebanese pharmacists' professional satisfaction and applicable needs regarding their profession. Specific objectives aimed to examine Lebanese pharmacists' satisfaction and determine whether the Lebanese Order of Pharmacists helps pharmacists to meet their professional needs. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of Lebanese pharmacists working in all pharmacy practicing environments in Lebanon. A random sample was drawn from the list of registered pharmacists provided by the Lebanese Order of Pharmacists. Selected individuals were visited and interviewed in their workplace. Pharmacists who had no registered address were contacted and interviewed face to face. RESULTS: Newly graduated pharmacists seemed more likely to work in community pharmacies or as medical representatives. Most interviewed pharmacists had no difficulty finding a job, but they all thought that the Order of Pharmacists should get more involved in advising and providing job opportunities, because the market is currently saturated. Most were financially satisfied, especially owners of community pharmacies. Although half of the pharmacists were psychologically satisfied, a great number of community, hospital, and medical representative pharmacists were not physically satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is necessary for a thorough evaluation of Lebanese pharmacists' professional satisfaction and its specific determinants, with the ultimate goal of finding adequate solutions for their needs.
10972425	0	a	The economic crisis in Thailand in July 1997 had major social implications for unemployment, under employment, household income contraction, changing expenditure patterns, and child abandonment. The crisis increased poverty incidence by 1 million, of whom 54% were the ultra-poor. This paper explores and explains the short-term health impact of the crisis, using existing data and some special surveys and interviews for 2 years during 1998-99. The health impacts of the crisis are mixed, some being negative and some being positive. Household health expenditure reduced by 24% in real terms; among the poorer households, institutional care was replaced by self-medication. The pre-crisis rising trend in expenditure on alcohol and tobacco consumption was reversed. Immunization spending and coverage were sustained at a very high level after the crisis, but reports of increases in diphtheria and pertussis indicate declining programme quality. An increase in malaria, despite budget increases, had many causes but was mainly due to reduced programme effectiveness. STD incidence continued the pre-crisis downward trend. Rates of HIV risky sexual behaviour were higher among conscripts than other male workers, but in both groups there was lower condom use with casual partners. HIV serosurveillance showed a continuation of the pre-crisis downward trend among commercial sex workers (CSW, both brothel and non-brothel based), pregnant women and donated blood; this trend was slightly reversed among male STD patients and more among intravenous drug users. Condom coverage among brothel based CSW continued to increase to 97.5%, despite a 72% budget cut in free condom distribution. Poverty and lack of insurance coverage are two major determinants of absence of or inadequate antenatal care, and low birthweight. The Low Income Scheme could not adequately cover the poor but the voluntary Health Card Scheme played a health safety net role for maternal and child health. Low birthweight and underweight among school children were observed during the crisis. The impact of the crisis on health was minimal in some sectors but not in the others if the pre-crisis condition is efficient and healthy and vice versa. We demonstrated some key health status parameters during the 2-year period after the 1997 crisis but do not have firm conclusions on the impact of the economic crisis on health status, as our observation is too short and there is uncertainty on how long the crisis will last.
16861190	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of contextual and individual factors on self-reported psychological health. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/MEASUREMENTS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional postal questionnaire study with a 59% participation rate. A total of 13,715 persons aged 18-80 answered the questionnaire. A multilevel logistic regression model, with individuals at the first level and municipalities/city quarters at the second, was performed. The effect (intra-class correlation, cross-level modification, and odds ratios) of individual and municipality/city quarter factors on self-reported psychological health was analysed. RESULTS: The crude variance between municipalities/city quarters was small but significant. It was particularly affected and lowered by individual civil status, country of origin, economic stress, and social participation. The inclusion of all individual factors age, sex, civil status, country of origin, education, economic stress, and social participation lowered the between municipality variance to not-significant levels, which is the reason why no contextual variables were included in the calculations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that poor self-reported psychological health is affected mainly by individual characteristics of the population and not by contextual factors at the municipality/city quarter level.
18274042	0	a	Disasters have been and will continue to be relatively common events in the human experience, and they make important contributions to variations in population health. There is a need, therefore, for conceptual models that identify the social and ecological factors influencing post-disaster consequences on population health. This article presents one such conceptual model which links the health consequences of natural, technological, and human-made disasters to a set of nested socioecological factors. Specifically, we attempt to link post-disaster consequences to aspects of the global and local environment and to highlight the roles played by social and ecological factors, including the social infrastructure, cultural beliefs, demography, and underlying historical and geographical circumstances. Examples from existing population-based health and disaster research are used to illustrate and amplify connections drawn from the model. From an applied standpoint, the model suggests that the role of multiple contextual determinants in shaping population health is likely to be complex. Practitioners interested in mitigating the consequences of disasters should pursue strategies that improve the underlying determinants of health, as well as practicable population-based interventions that could be implemented rapidly.
3186028	1	a	The pattern of disease in New Zealand is changing and will continue to do so. Some trends are predictable, while others (such as the epidemic of AIDS) may be unexpected. Analysis of past improvements in health suggests that medical research would be more productive if greater attention were paid to the external influences and personal behaviour which are the chief determinants of health. Apart from such general implications, analysis of the changing patterns of disease is vital as a stimulus and guide for medical research of all kinds. More effective monitoring of disease trends in New Zealand will require improvement in the quality and timeliness of routine health statistics, and training of adequate numbers of epidemiologists to analyse and interpret the data. Such developments are essential if medical research is to make a full contribution to the health of New Zealanders.
6106945	1	a	Given the poor quantity and quality of medical care in most villages in the developing countries, the economic determinants of village health are the supply of labour, the cash flow associated with that labour and the availability of land. The paper examines these in the three classical 'time periods', arguing that inability to meet labour peaks is of great significance in explaining seasonal shortage of food and chronic shortage of cash. It also explains community indifference to upkeep of social overhead capital. Substitution of capital goods for labour is socially differentiated, not least by labour availability, and leads inevitably to a regressive distribution of land and the creation or enlargement of a class of landless labourers. Under certain limited conditions this class may enjoy a rising real income with associated health-promotive expenditures. The more normal case, however, is extreme poverty, whether rural or urban, with all that that implies for the undermining of health. Land reform therefore becomes a necessary precondition of health promotion.
19678974	0	a	OBJECTIVE: To assess anaemia prevalence and correlated social and biological determinants among pregnant women in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (oPt). DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey conducted among pregnant women attending/accessing UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) health centres in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in September and October 2006. SETTING: Fifty-five UNRWA health centres in the oPt (eighteen in the Gaza Strip and thirty-seven in the West Bank). SUBJECTS: A random sample of 1740 pregnant women. RESULTS: Overall anaemia prevalence was 38.6 % (95 % CI 36.3, 40.9 %). A substantial difference in anaemia prevalence was observed between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (44.9 % v. 31.1 %, respectively), as well as a significant increase in anaemia prevalence in the Gaza Strip compared with an Agency-wide survey conducted in 2004 (44.9 % v. 35.7 %, respectively). Anaemia prevalence was found to increase with age, parity and trimester of gestation. CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia still appears to be a public health problem among pregnant women in spite of UNRWA interventions. The West Bank shows prevalence rates similar to those observed in neighbouring countries, while the Gaza Strip has higher rates. Prevalence rates of anaemia among pregnant Palestinian women are more than two times higher than those observed in Europe.
10951443	0	a	We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population.
3819251	1	a	"Postpartum factors affecting the duration of lactation were identified for 250 women through a telephone survey. The survey examined the behaviors and attitudes of women who had chosen to nurse and who were still nursing at 2 weeks postpartum. Sixty percent of the mothers nursed their infants after delivery. However, by 10 weeks postpartum, only 34% of the babies were still breast fed. By self-report, the most significant factors associated with the maintenance of lactation at 10 weeks were related to perinatal hospital protocol, especially letting the infant suckle soon after birth. Other significant predictors of successful lactation outcome included early milk ""let down,"" little use of supplemental formula, the mother's expectation at parturition of an extended nursing period, her feeling well and being satisfied with her body weight, her previous successful experience with lactation, and her perception that she feeds her infant on demand. Few of the women who had stopped nursing after 2 weeks sought advice on breast feeding from anyone other than the pediatrician. Most coped with their nursing problems themselves. The data reinforce the importance of labor and delivery practices that support early maternal-infant contact. They also suggest the use of infant health indexes and weight and height percentile placement records rather than reliance solely on weight gain as the index of lactation adequacy. Further, they indicate the need for clinical intervention before 2 weeks postpartum."
12971112	0	a	As we move forward in the new century, epidemiologists and public health practitioners are faced with the challenge of reviewing the current direction of epidemiology and its links with public health. While the history of epidemiology has been a successful and productive one, there is a danger that modern epidemiology is becoming too narrow in its scope, concerned primarily with the analysis of risk factors in individuals, while ignoring sociological and ecological perspectives of health. We argue that a theoretical framework to guide the practice of epidemiology is needed which encompasses a role for social determinants of health while simultaneously also acknowledging the importance of behaviour and biology, and the inter-connectedness of all these factors. This paper presents a public health model of social determinants of health, which provides a framework for testing the causal pathways linking social determinant variables with health care system attributes, disease inducing behaviours and health outcomes. This approach provides an improved opportunity to identify and evaluate evidence-based public health interventions, and facilitates stronger links between modern epidemiology and public health practice.
6705636	1	a	This essay is based on the assumption that a long-neglected topic of socialization, the determinants of individual differences in parental functioning, is illuminated by research on the etiology of child maltreatment. Three domains of determinants are identified (personal psychological resources of parents, characteristics of the child, and contextual sources of stress and support), and a process model of competent parental functioning is offered on the basis of the analysis. The model presumes that parental functioning is multiply determined, that sources of contextual stress and support can directly affect parenting or indirectly affect parenting by first influencing individual psychological well-being, that personality influences contextual support/stress, which feeds back to shape parenting, and that, in order of importance, the personal psychological resources of the parent are more effective in buffering the parent-child relation from stress than are contextual sources of support, which are themselves more effective than characteristics of the child.
6473033	1	a	Personality determinants of characteristic trends in inferred hemispheric utilization were investigated using conjugate lateral eye movement as an index of hemispheric involvement. The Adjective Checklist provided a number of personality and cognitive-style variables. Two independent samples were assessed, a group of 54 undergraduate psychology students and a group of 39 mechanical engineering students. Subjects were classified as predominantly right-, left-, or bidirectional movers. Discriminant analyses significantly separated these groups in terms of checklist scales. Accuracy of classification was 51.9% in the psychology sample and 89.7% in the engineering sample. A bidirectional pattern in eye movement was associated with a more adaptive and well-adjusted personality style than unidirectional consistency.
20589143	0	a	BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a growing public health problem in Uganda and Africa as a whole. We conducted a study to determine the prevalence and identify factors associated withy hypertension among residents of the rural district of Rukungiri, Uganda. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was used to conduct this study. Between January and February 2006, a random sample of consenting district residents, aged 20 years or older were enrolled to participate in this study. Trained research assistants administered a standardized questionnaire and performed the physical measurements. The questionnaire collected data on demographics, social economic and exposure history to various potential risk factors for hypertension. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) equal or greater than 140mmHg and/or diastolic BP equal or greater than 90mmHg, and/or being on regular anti-hypertensive therapy. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with hypertension. RESULTS: Of the 842 study participants, 252 were hypertensive. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 30.5%, with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 26.6 - 34.3%. Factors found to be associated with hypertension included: past alcohol use, Odds Ratio (OR)=2.28, [1.42 - 3.64], present alcohol use OR=1.64 [1.12 - 2.43], being overweight OR=1.95 [1.37 - 2.79], obesity OR=5.07 [2.79 - 9.21], female sex OR=1.44 [1.03 - 2.06], having attained tertiary education OR=1.91 [1.03 - 3.56], and older age OR=1.42 [1.27 - 1.59]). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension in this rural Ugandan district is relatively high. The findings confirm the growing concern about hypertension as a public health problem in Uganda. More studies are however required to determine the distribution and determinants of hypertension in other parts of the country.
6699384	1	a	Data from an Australian survey of 1,050 elderly men and women were analyzed with regard to sex differences in life satisfaction and its determinants. Men and women had very similar levels of education, health, financial satisfaction, subjective social integration, and morale. Little difference between sexes was found in the causal process determining life satisfaction. There was little or no interaction between sex and the other variables examined.
17077411	0	a	We provide a framework for health services-related researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to guide future health disparities research in areas ranging from detecting differences in health and health care to understanding the determinants that underlie disparities to ultimately designing interventions that reduce and eliminate these disparities. To do this, we identified potential selection biases and definitions of vulnerable groups when detecting disparities. The key factors to understanding disparities were multilevel determinants of health disparities, including individual beliefs and preferences, effective patient-provider communication; and the organizational culture of the health care system. We encourage interventions that yield generalizable data on their effectiveness and that promote further engagement of communities, providers, and policymakers to ultimately enhance the application and the impact of health disparities research.
6518143	1	a	This paper investigates the range, structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of alcoholism. The different explicit medical and psychological theories are reviewed as are studies on lay beliefs about alcoholism and heavy drinking. After a number of interviews in which people were asked to list what they believed to be the major causes of alcoholism, 265 people completed a questionnaire in which they rated 30 explanations for their importance in explaining the causes of alcoholism. Females more than males believed alcoholics to be socially inadequate and anxious and that there was too much social pressure and not enough prohibitions against drinking. Middle-aged rather than younger or older people tended to explain alcoholism in terms of poor education, social and cultural pressures and biological or genetic mechanisms. However, there were few differences in the ratings of heavy, moderate, light and non-drinkers. Factor analysis revealed six factors labelled psychological stress, personal and social problems, psychoanalytic theories, sociocultural explanations, biological or genetic explanations and social desirability or pressure. The results are discussed in terms of the research on lay understandings of psychological and medical phenomena, and the relationship between explicit and implicit theories.
3961043	1	a	Groups of highly anxious, moderately anxious and minimally anxious primiparous mothers (N = 147) were obtained on the basis of Spielberger trait anxiety scores in the postpartum period, and subjects were compared. Allocation to those groups appeared to be more likely to reflect constitutional levels of anxiety, rather than recent or current social stressors. Highly anxious mothers were distinguished on a number of presumed correlates of anxiety measured by clinical questions (e.g. terminating of anxious situations), hospital notes (e.g. mood problems noted by nursing staff) and blind rater assessments (e.g. unassertiveness). While highly anxious mothers were more likely to report more recent life events, less social support, and negative interpretations of the pregnancy, the hospital experience and the hospital staff, such variables were less discriminating when neuroticism levels were effectively controlled. This suggests an intrinsic perceptual bias, rather than that the factors were determinants. Highly anxious mothers had more delivery complications, while their babies were more likely to be dysmature and slow to suckle, features we interpret as consequences of the anxiety levels. In the postpartum period these mothers were more depressed, had more concerns about their baby, themselves and their marriage, and were less confident about coping and their parenting capacities. Such variables may be correlates or consequences of anxiety.
10281815	1	a	The historical equilibrium of the health care industry has been disturbed by recent and radical changes in both the financing of medical services and the structure of the industry. The applicability of antitrust laws to the health field, the use of advertising, and the dismantling of quasilegal barriers, such as certificate-of-need (CON) laws, have made economics of scale and efficiency increasingly important determinants of the size and type of organization delivering health services. Such changes, coupled with those pertaining to the financial incentives facing both patients and providers and emerging excess capacity, have wrought a rapid transformation of the structure of the industry. If hospitals and physicians are to survive, they must be able to anticipate new and increasingly competitive developments. Because competition eliminates cross-subsidies, access to care, especially by the poor, is certain to become more precarious.
7258317	1	a	Class and gender and determinants of therapists' perceptions of clients were investigated in a survey of 418 psychologists presented with a case history that manipulated all possible combinations of client class (working/middle) and gender (male/female). Findings suggest that among male clients, the higher the social class, the more favorable the therapists' attitude; among female clients, the trend is in the opposite direction. Results are discussed in the context of the sexual division of labor and differential expectations for male and female clients in therapy.
6849845	1	a	Between 1969 and 1980 1443 patients with vesicovaginal fistulas were operated on in Ahmadu Bello University Hospital in Northern Nigeria. They have been studied in relation to their obstetric, social and environmental background. The preventable nature of the lesion was explored particularly with respect to age, parity and obstructed labour, and to traditional practices including 'gishiri cutting', which alone accounts for 13% of all the fistulas. Vesicovaginal fistulas are still a major cause for concern in many developing countries; measures for prevention include universal education and improved status of women in society as well as improved and accessible medical services.
2709190	1	a	A longitudinal study of rural-urban migration from a low blood pressure community was completed in 1985. It is suggested that the rapid increase in blood pressure observed with acculturation in this study constitutes a new dynamic model for the early phase of human essential hypertension. Analysis of data derived from this study indicates that increases in dietary sodium, weight gain and sympathetic tone (possibly reflecting acute environmental stress) are important determinants of the early blood pressure rise. It is proposed that a defence reaction occurs in response to environmental stress which maintains or increases cardiorenal sympathetic outflow, thereby overriding the negative feedback inhibition of sympathetic activity which otherwise occurs when dietary sodium is suddenly increased. The antinatriuretic response results in an early volume-dependent rise in blood pressure. We also propose that variation in individual blood pressure responses to migration may be explained not only by quantum differences in the two environmental factors, but also by a genetically-determined failure of adaptation to the combined effects of these stimuli on renal tubular reabsorption of sodium.
17259636	0	a	BACKGROUND: fall-related injuries in older people are a major public health concern. This study examined the relationship between psychosocial determinants of healthy ageing and risk of fall-related hip fracture in community-dwelling older people. The purpose was to contribute evidence for promotion of healthy ageing strategies in population-based interventions for fall injury prevention. METHODS: a case-control study was conducted with 387 participants, with at least two controls recruited per case. Cases of fall-related hip fracture in community-dwelling people aged 65 and older were recruited from hospital admissions in Brisbane, Australia, in 2003-2004. Community-based controls, matched by age, sex and postcode, were recruited via electoral roll sampling. A questionnaire assessing psychosocial factors, identified as determinants of healthy ageing, was administered at face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: psychosocial factors having a significant independent protective effect on hip fracture risk included being currently married [OR: 0.44 (0.22 to 0.88)], living in present residence for 5 years or more [OR: 0.43 (0.22 to 0.84)], having private health insurance [OR: 0.49 (0.27 to 0.90)], using proactive coping strategies [OR: 0.52 (0.29 to 0.92)], having a higher level of life satisfaction [OR: 0.47 (0.27 to 0.81)], and engagement in social activities in older age [OR: 0.30 (0.17 to 0.54)]. CONCLUSION: this study suggests that psychosocial determinants of healthy ageing are protective in fall-related hip fracture injury in older people. Reduction in the public health burden caused by this injury may then be achieved by implementing healthy ageing strategies involving community-based approaches to enhance the psychosocial environments of older people.
19923665	0	a	BACKGROUND: Intersectoral action is now widely recognized as an effective approach to addressing the social determinants of health. In particular, collaboration between different sectors of the community has been recommended as a strategy for developing employment opportunities for persons diagnosed with mental illness. However, there is limited evidence on the actual implementation of intersectoral action between the employment and mental health sector. METHODS: Case study methodology was utilized to examine a unique partnership formed under the principles of public health and local development to create a social enterprise. Stakeholders representing organizations from several sectors of the community, including health and employment, partnered to develop work opportunities for a population that is disadvantaged from the mainstream employment market including (but not exclusive to) persons diagnosed with mental illness. The three main methods of inquiry were: semistructured interviews, participant observation and collected documentation. FINDINGS: Stakeholders experienced several kinds of challenges during the implementation process and used different strategies to manage these challenges. The findings suggest barriers and facilitators to successful intersectoral action initiatives, some of which are directly applicable to the context of employment and mental illness. CONCLUSION: Several lessons are drawn from these experiences.
17963491	0	a	BACKGROUND: The fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy determine the postpartum evaluation of birth. However, researchers have seldom considered the multiple determinants in one analysis. To explore to what extent the results can be generalised between countries, we analyse data of Belgian and Dutch women. Although Belgium and the Netherlands share the same language, geography and political system and have a common history, their health care systems diverge. The Belgian maternity care system corresponds to the ideal type of the medical model, whereas the Dutch system approaches the midwifery model. In this paper we examine multiple determinants, the fulfilment of expectations, labour pain, personal control and self-efficacy, for their association with satisfaction with childbirth in a cross-national perspective. METHODS: Two questionnaires were filled out by 605 women, one at 30 weeks of pregnancy and one within the first 2 weeks after childbirth either at home or in a hospital. Of these, 560 questionnaires were usable for analysis. Women were invited to participate in the study by independent midwives and obstetricians during antenatal visits in 2004-2005. Satisfaction with childbirth was measured by the Mackey Satisfaction with Childbirth Rating Scale, which takes into account the multidimensional nature of the concept. Labour pain was rated retrospectively using Visual Analogue Scales. Personal control was assessed with the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire and Pearlin and Schooler's mastery scale. A hierarchical linear analysis was performed. RESULTS: Satisfaction with childbirth benefited most consistently from the fulfilment of expectations. In addition, the experience of personal control buffered the lowering impact of labour pain. Women with high self-efficacy showed more satisfaction with self-, midwife- and physician-related aspects of the birth experience. CONCLUSION: Our findings focus the attention toward personal control, self-efficacy and expectations about childbirth. This study confirms the multidimensionality of childbirth satisfaction and demonstrates that different factors predict the various dimensions of satisfaction. The model applies to both Belgian and Dutch women. Cross-national comparative research should further assess the dependence of the determinants of childbirth satisfaction on the organisation of maternity care.
12280705	1	a	"""In the literature on population migration, increasing attention has been devoted to quality-of-life factors. Measures of temperature (as proxies for climate) have frequently been employed in empirical work regarding the determinants of population migration decisions. A wide range of such specifications have been used, most of which imply restrictions on the preferences of migrants. In this paper, a variety of temperature variable specifications are analyzed and interpreted. Statistical tests for nested and nonnested hypotheses are used to compare and choose among the various specifications."" The model is used to analyze interstate migration in the 48 contiguous states of the United States for the period 1975-1980."
12340179	1	a	Using a sociodemographic model of the determinants of illegitimacy rates, a multivariate regression analysis of annual change in age-specific Swedish illegitimacy rates is applied to the 1911-74 period. The proxy measure of change in sexual activity was significant for all age groups. Legitimation rates for out-of-wedlock conceived births were significant for all ages except teenagers, and the final predictor, women's status, was significant for all ages except women 35-44. Explained variance for annual change was highest among ages 20-24 (66%), 25-29 (66%), and 30-34 (63%) and lower among teens (34%) and women 35-44 (47%). These results support earlier research that used a sociodemographic model to explain post-World War II change in cross-national illegitimacy rates among 23 developed countries.
18573196	0	a	BACKGROUND: Many youth fail to meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity. Walking and cycling, forms of active travel, have the potential to contribute significantly towards overall physical activity levels. Recent research examining the associations between physical activity and the environment has shown that environmental factors play a role in determining behaviour in children and adolescents. However, links between the environment and active travel have received less attention. METHODS: Twenty four studies were identified which examined the associations between the environment (perceived or objectively measured) and active travel among youth aged 5-18 years. Findings were categorised according to the location of the environmental measure examined; attributes of the neighbourhood, destination and the route between home and destination. RESULTS: Results from the reviewed studies indicated that youth active travel is positively associated with social interactions, facilities to assist active travel and urban form in the neighbourhood as well as shorter route length and road safety en-route. A conceptual framework is presented which highlights the associations between active travel behaviours and environmental factors, drawing upon both existing and hypothesised relationships. CONCLUSION: We provide a review of the available literature and present a novel theoretical framework that integrates the environment into the wider decision making process around travel choices for children and adolescents. Further work should explore associations where gaps in understanding have been identified, and account for the main moderators of behaviour so hypothesised associations can be confirmed.
3788206	1	a	The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and methods of a prospective study of medical care utilization and morbidity in a fixed cohort of over 500 preschool children whose families belonged to a prepaid group practice affiliated with Yale University. Following baseline interviews with their mothers, study children were followed for 12 months between 1981 and 1982. Information concerning the subjects' contacts with the health care facility serving members of the group practice was collected from accompanying adults, attending clinicians, and medical records. Using these data, we were able to identify episodes of care, linking all clinical visits and phone calls for single occurrences of an illness or injury. The major aim of the study is to identify psychosocial determinants of pediatric utilization (for both acute and preventive care) and of childhood morbidity. The possible predictors of principal interest are factors associated with the family environment, such as social stress and strain, family structure, and different aspects of the mother's social network. The dual emphasis on both illness and behavior outcomes is based on the important interrelationship between epidemiologic and health services research, especially when examining psychosocial effects.
16566822	0	a	BACKGROUND: Because of the rapid aging population, the demand for residential care exceeds availability. This paper presents the results of a study that focuses on the demand of elderly people for residential care and determinants (elderly people's personal characteristics, needs and resources) that are associated with this demand. Furthermore, the accuracy of the waiting list as a reflection of this demand has been examined. METHODS: 67 elderly people waiting for admission into a home for the elderly, are subjected to semi-structured interviews. The data are analyzed by using multivariate statistics. RESULTS: Elderly people who indicate that they would refuse an offer of admission into a home for the elderly feel healthier (p = 0.02), have greater self-care agency (p = 0.02) and perceive less necessity of admission (p < 0.01), compared to those who would accept such an offer. Especially the inability to manage everyday activities and the lack of a social network are highly associated with the elderly people's demand for residential care. Furthermore, it is evident that waiting lists for homes for the elderly do not accurately reflect the demand for residential care, since 35% of the elderly people on a waiting list did not actually experience an immediate demand for residential care and stated that they would not accept an offer of admission. Quite a lot of respondents just registered out of a sense of precaution; a strategic decision dictated by current shortages in care provision and a vulnerable health status. CONCLUSION: The results contribute to the understanding of waiting lists and the demand for residential care. It became apparent that not everybody who asks for admission into a home for the elderly, really needed it. The importance of elderly people's resources like social networks and the ability to manage everyday activities in relation to the demand for care became clear. These findings are important because they indicate that resources also play a role in predicting elderly people's demand and as a result can guide the development and the (re)design of adequate health care services.
3874527	1	a	Data from longitudinal studies of adolescents carried out over the last ten years are reviewed to provide an integrated and dynamic perspective on the nature of friendships and processes of peer influence in adolescent drug involvement, within a general developmental perspective. Four interrelated questions are examined: What individual attributes are especially important in the formation of friendships among adolescents? Which of two processes, selection or socialization, account for the similarity in values and behaviors observed in ongoing friendship dyads, and how important is similarity in friendship formation and dissolution? What is the nature of friends' influence as compared to parents', and in which domains of adolescent's life do these influences exert themselves? What mechanisms, role modeling or social learning, underlie processes of interpersonal influences? Relational dyadic and triadic samples of adolescents matched to a parent and/or a best friend and observed at one point in time as well as over time provide important and relatively rare sources of data on processes of interpersonal influence. Sociodemographic characteristics are the strongest determinants of friendship formation, with participation in illicit drugs following next in importance. Both selection (assortative pairing) and socialization contribute to observed similarity in friendship pairs. Adolescents coordinate their choice of friends and their values and behaviors, in particular the use of marijuana, so as to maximize congruency in the friendship dyad. If there is a state of unbalance such that the friend's attitude or behavior is inconsistent with the adolescent's, the adolescent will either break off the friendship and seek another friend or will keep the friend and modify his or her own behavior. Both parents and peers can have strong influences on adolescents, depending upon the arena of influence. Parents are especially important for future life plans, while peers are most important for involvement in illicit drug use. However, for drug use itself, there are different patterns of influence depending upon the stage of drug involvement. Peers are especially important for initiation into marijuana use, while parental factors gain in importance in the transition from marijuana use to the use of other illicit drugs. Interpersonal influences of peers on ongoing marijuana and alcohol use result from modeling and imitation more than from social reinforcement and the transmission of values.
14571309	0	a	BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Canada with wide, unexplained regional variations in heart disease mortality. However, no studies to date have explored the relationship between a number of health region characteristics and regional variation in heart disease mortality rates across Canada. INTRODUCTION: We studied the contribution of various traditional cardiac risk factors, social determinants of health and other community characteristics to regional variations in heart disease mortality rates across Canada. METHODS: Cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart disease (IHD) age-standardized mortality rates were obtained from Statistics Canada for three years - 1995 to 1997. Health region characteristics were taken from the 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey, and the 1996 Canadian Census and the Labour Force Survey. Linear regression analyses and analyses of variance were employed to identify relationships between these health region characteristics and CVD and IHD mortality rates. RESULTS: Significant regional variations in CVD mortality rates per 100,000 population were observed. Newfoundland and Labrador had the highest CVD and IHD mortality rates, while Nunavut and the Northwest Territories had the lowest CVD and IHD mortality rates. Health region smoking and unemployment rates were identified as the most important factors associated with CVD and IHD mortality at the health region level. CONCLUSIONS: Significant regional variations in age-standardized CVD and IHD mortality were noted both at the provincial/territorial level and the health region level. Efforts to reduce CVD and IHD mortality in Canada require attention to both traditional risk factors (eg, smoking) and broader determinants of health (eg, unemployment rates).
19504364	0	a	OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine, with the use of Berry's acculturation concept (2003), personal self-esteem and collective esteem in the acculturation of young Turks in Germany. Further, it was aimed to examine whether ethnic identity is linked to better mental health. METHOD: Consecutive psychiatric primary care patients with Turkish background were screened with the 5-item Acculturation Questionnaire, adopted from the Latin American Validated Acculturation Scale. The interviewed patients were also assessed for psychiatric disorders according to ICD-10. RESULTS: By using the acculturation questionnaire among 220 patients included to this study, 154 (70%) patients, (88 male- 57,14%, mean age:22,1 sd. +/- 3,26 and 66 female- 42,85%, mean age: 21,73 sd. +/- 1,19) were found to be relatively good adjusted (group 1), and of 66 (30%) patients (44 male- 66,6%, mean age:26,3 sd. +/-3,39 and 22 female- 33,3%, mean age:25,88 sd. +/- 3,41) were found to be relatively poor adjusted (group 2) to the host community. The psychiatric co-morbidity showed in these two groups two distinct patterns (p< 0.001). Endogenous depression and the depression caused by the conflicts in the family-milieu are significantly more common in the group I. Unlike, the depression triggered by the psycho-social maladjustment is clearly more prevalent in the group II. The predictors of good adaptation were shown to be: bilingualism, bicultural identity and Germany as country of birth, whereas poor adaptation was related to: dominance of ethnic culture and language, and being born outside of Germany. CONCLUSION: The research presented provides firm evidence for a bicultural identity through assessments of several domains of acculturation: language spoken most of the time, language thought, ethnic identity, birthplace and the degree of adjustment to the host community. Cultural identity is one of the key determinants of mental health in evaluating adaptation to the host culture among immigrants. It is vital for the mental health professionals to understand the roles, context, and therapeutic consequences that originate from culture.
18631388	0	a	BACKGROUND: Health professionals, policy-makers and researchers need to be able to explore potential associations between prevalence rates and quality of care with a range of possible determinants including socio-economic deprivation and morbidity levels to determine the impact of commissioning and service delivery. In the UK, data in England are only available nationally at practice postcode level. In Scotland, such data are available based on an aggregate of the practices population's postcodes. The use of data assigned to the practice postcode may underestimate the association between ill health and income deprivation. Here, we report on the impact of using data assigned to the practice population by comparing analyses using English and Scottish data. RESULTS: Income deprivation based on data assigned to the practice postcode under-estimated deprivation compared to using income deprivation data assigned to the practice population for the five least deprived deciles, and over-estimated deprivation for the five most deprived deciles. The biggest differences were found for the most deprived decile. A similar trend was found for limiting long-term illness (LLTI). Differences between the QOF prevalence rates of the least and most deprived deciles using practice postcode data were similar (0.2% points or less) in England and Scotland for 8 out of 10 clinical domains. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences in the prevalence rate between the least and most deprived deciles increase for all clinical domains. A similar trend was again found for LLTI. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences for population achievement increase for all CHD quality indicators with the exception of beta-blockers (CHD10). With practice postcode assigned deprivation, significant differences between the least and most deprived deciles were found for 2 out 8 indicators, compared to 5 using practice population assigned deprivation. For LLTI differences between the lowest and most deprived deciles increased for all indicators when ill health assigned to the practice population was used. CONCLUSION: We have found, through comparing deprivation and ill health data assigned to either the practice postcode or the practice population postcode in Scotland, that analyses based on practice postcode assigned data under-estimated the relationship between deprivation and ill health for both prevalence and quality care. Given the importance of understanding the effect of deprivation and ill health on a range of determinants related to health care, policy makers should ensure that practice population data are available and used at national level in England and elsewhere where possible.
2487128	1	a	This report assesses current knowledge about the ecological determinants of child maltreatment and presents data from an aggregate study of co-variation between seven community characteristics and maltreatment rates. A review of these findings revealed literature in the early stages of development. Nothing is known about the ecology of sexual abuse, and studies of physical abuse and neglect have done little more than demonstrate co-variation between reported incidence and neighborhood population and housing characteristics. Study findings reveal that (a) five of the seven community characteristics are significant and independent correlates of neglect, and four are correlates of abuse; (b) the strongest predictors of both types of maltreatment are percentage of families with income less than 200% of poverty and percent of vacant housing; and (c) the pattern of co-variation between the two economic stress indicators and three inadequate social support indicators are consistent with the ecological hypothesis. Discussion focuses on interpretation of findings and recommendations for future research.
7145506	1	a	"The relationship between levels of moral reasoning and decisions in dilemmas of neonatal care was investigated in a sample of 452 pediatricians. Subjects included residents, faculty members, and practitioners recruited from a variety of university-affiliated and community hospitals. It was hypothesized that physicians whose moral reasoning was more fully developed would less actively treat particular cases. Such cases might include those where a patient's family requested such a limit (designated ""negative family attitude"") or the quality of life likely to be led after therapy was so low as to preclude even a minimal degree of human activity or social interaction (designated ""unsalvageable prognosis""). The hypothesis was tested through the use of two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, devised by Crane, assessed the physician's reported degree of activism in treating six cases of infants born with severe defects. The structure of moral reasoning was measured by a second questionnaire, Rest's Defining Issue Test. Subjects were scored by the degree to which they use universal, ethical principles in resolving a series of moral dilemmas. Results of the absolute level of activism (Table 1) showed that among both residents and postresidents, the degree to which cases are actively treated depends, for salvageable patients, on the type of damage and on the possibility for research. Results involving moral reasoning showed a different pattern among residents and postresidents. Among residents, a significant correlation exists between principled reasoning and the absence of active treatment (r = - 0.41, Form A; r = - 0.23, Form B). As predicted, such correlations were strongest for cases of negative family attitude or of unsalvageable prognosis. The pattern of correlations among postresidents showed either no relationship to moral reasoning or the reverse of the residency pattern (r = -0.08, Form A; r = 0.30, Form B). The influence of the type of institution a resident operates within was assessed by analysis of variance. Inasmuch as moral reasoning and institutional type both had significant main effects (Form A), their magnitude differed. Institutional type accounted for 43% of the variation in mean activism scores whereas moral reasoning accounted for only 4%; however, because one could, a priori, expect institutional norms and customs to be powerful determinants of behavior, any additional, identifiable influence deserves attention. The structure of individuals' moral reasoning seems to be such an influence."
15727964	0	a	Clinical medicine and health policy planning find common cause as they seek to define the determinants of health. There is substantial recent interest in the social ecology in which health is embedded. However, biology is where these contributing environmental factors are translated. I provide a new conceptual framework for the biological determinants of health. The old public health rubric of host, agent, and environment as the features that define the root elements of health is an impoverished scheme, because it does not represent our new appreciation of genetic and aging contributions to phenotypic health. I propose genes, external agency, internal agency, and aging as more operationally helpful determinants that effectively describe the biological experience of the organism. This scheme has the advantage of differentiating those agencies that are practically approachable, and therefore deserving of increased attention and investment, and those that are currently intractable.
6814269	1	a	"A statewide probability sample of 1,625 elders living in Massachusetts are studied prospectively to identify key determinants of long-term care (LTC) institutionalization. One-hundred forty-seven elders, 9 per cent of the original cohort, entered a LTC institution during the six-year investigation. Using logistic multiple regression, we examine the predictive power of 19 independent variables grouped into six categories: demographic characteristics, attitude, social context, long-term care needs, physical disability, and mental/emotional disability. Five variables are significantly related to institutionalization: advancing age, using ambulatory aids, mental disorientation, living alone, and using assistance to perform ""instrumental"" ADL (activities of daily living). These results may be helpful to those trying to target non-institutional services to elders for use as substitutes for institutional long-term care. They may also help explain why recent experimental tests of substituting non-institutional care for institutional services have been less than successful."
7076787	1	a	Mortality from ischemic heart disease has declined sharply since the mid 1960's in the United States and several other industrialized nations. The causes of this decline have thus far not been established. Six major strategies for investigating determinants of ischemic heart disease mortality trends are discussed in this review: (1) analyses of mortality data; (2) morbidity surveillance; (3) surveillance of change in medical care; (4) surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors; (5) social and ecological surveillance; (6) experimental and quasi-experimental community approaches. The rationale, problems and limitations of each are discussed.
15715914	0	a	BACKGROUND: About half of all newly presented episodes of shoulder complaints (SC) in general practice are reported to last for at least six months. Early interventions aimed at the psychological and social determinants of SC are not common in general practice, although such interventions might prevent the development of chronic SC. The Education and Activation Programme (EAP) consists of an educational part and a time-contingent activation part. The aim of the EAP is to provide patients with the proper cognitions by means of education, and to stimulate adequate behaviour through advice on activities of daily living. DESIGN: The article describes the design of a randomised clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an EAP in addition to usual care, compared to usual care only, in the prevention of chronic SC after six months. It also describes the analysis of the cost and effect balance. Patients suffering from SC for less than three months are recruited in general practice and through open recruitment. A trained general practitioner or a trained therapist administers the EAP.Primary outcome measures are patient-perceived recovery, measured by self-assessment on a seven-point scale, and functional limitations in activities of daily living. Questionnaires are used to study baseline measures, prognostic measures, process measures and outcome measures. DISCUSSION: The inclusion of patients in the study lasted until December 31st 2003. Data collection is to end in June 2004.
3867226	1	a	The cross-sectional study of 1980 for atherosclerosis precursors in Finnish children and adolescents aimed at a wide coverage of the relevant relationships of the smoking behaviour to socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. The initiation and establishment of the smoking habits were primarily viewed as a function of the youngsters' main socializing agents: the peer group and the family. A subpopulation comprising 1,790 children and adolescents aged 12, 15 and 18 years of the total sample was included in the study on smoking behaviour. The information on smoking habits was collected in connection with the medical examination in a solitary room where the youngsters could respond undisturbed. Data on the children's families were obtained by means of a general questionnaire filled out by the parents. The prevalence of daily smoking was 1% in the 12-year-old, 10% in the 15-year-old, and 30% in the 18-year-old subjects. The best friend's behaviour was the best predictor of an adolescent's smoking behaviour, although the family had retained its role as an important model as regards the learning of smoking behaviour. Quitting school turned out to be a major event leading to an increased risk of becoming a habitual smoker. No clear associations between socioeconomic status of the family and daily smoking were found, except that farmers' children had generally lower rates of daily smoking than children from other socioeconomic groups. First contacts with tobacco formed part of a normal behaviour pattern at a certain age, and this experimentation was unrelated to a later regular habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
19655628	0	a	Global warming, the depletion of the world'snatural resources, and excessive consumer consumption in developed countries are determinants reshaping the way we live our everyday lives. These factors are rapidly giving rise to new ecological paradigms of environmental stewardship and in healthcare environments that express sustainable theories and practices. This has given rise to a systematic system for promoting and assessing the energy performance and efficiency of healthcare facilities known as Leadership in Energy Efficient Environmental Design (LEED), and a parallel certification program, the Green Guide for Heath Care. These developments are examined in direct relation to the functions of managerial ethics. A series of ten sustainability-based ethical dilemmas are presented. Each is examined in relation to the need to inculcate in future healthcare administrators a critical understanding and appreciation of the need to reposition contemporary healthcare organizations at the center--as leading civic participants and role models in relation to the emerging movement towards carbon neutrality in the healthcare industry.

16510888	0	a	Affective factors are likely to play a major role in determining the extent to which offenders are able to engage with, and benefit from, treatment. In this article, it is argued that the relationship between affect and treatment engagement may be understood in three ways: the access the client has to emotional states, the ability to express such states, and the willingness of the client to do this in the therapeutic session. It is suggested that affective determinants of treatment readiness can be understood with reference to models of emotional regulation and that attention to these affective factors in the early stages of treatment is likely to promote engagement, reduce attrition, and consequently improve treatment outcomes for violent offenders.
7390022	1	a	"A series of experiments was performed to examine the determinants of the rat pups' 1st excursions from the maternal nest into the novel environment outside the burrow. A standardized, nidic environment consisting of a maternal nest and adjoining open field was studied under a variety of structured test conditions. When the mother was outside the nest, pups readily ventured into the field. The early excursions were not stimulated by the mother's absence from the nest because when the mother was removed from the nest but not placed in the field the pups remained nestbound. Anesthetized dams elicited few excursions, suggesting that olfactory cues are less potent in this situation than behaviorally transmitted signals. Nonlactating adults were not attractive to pups but after induction of ""maternal responsiveness"" concaveated males facilitated egression. The data from a final experiment suggest that when in the nest, the dam stimulates egression by providing additional ""permissive"" stimuli that render the weanling more responsive to approach cues outside the nest."
6501638	1	a	This study was concerned with the determinants of adults' beliefs in the economic socialization of children through the use of pocket money (allowances). Over 200 adults completed a questionnaire on their beliefs concerning, for instance, how much and how often children should be given pocket money, as well as such things as whether they should be encouraged to work for it, save it, etc. The independent variables included the subjects' age, sex, education, voting pattern, religion, occupation and whether or not they were parents. The results showed that whereas there were few age or sex differences, the socio-economic class of the adults, and the fact that they did or did not have children did discriminate between the responses of the subjects. Findings were discussed in terms of the literature of economic socialization.

2926632	1	a	Examined whether intrapersonal comparisons and social comparisons operate in similar ways to determine ratings of happiness. Events were varied to create positively and negatively skewed distributions. The events in each distribution were ascribed to either a single person or a group of people; Ss rated how happy they would feel if they experienced specific events within the distribution. Ratings for both intrapersonal and social comparisons were fit well by Parducci's (1984) range-frequency theory. Individual events received higher ratings when presented within the positively skewed context. Overall happiness, as measured by both the mean of the happiness ratings as well as direct ratings, was highest for the negatively skewed distributions. The effects of skewing were more pronounced for intrapersonal comparisons, but ratings were more closely defined by the range of experimental stimuli for social comparisons.
6656327	1	a	Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension.
2772105	1	a	Various epidemiologic studies have found that high scores on the Cook and Medley Hostility (Ho) scale are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), severity of atherosclerosis, and all-cause mortality. One plausible biological mechanism suspected of contributing to increased risk of CHD is sympathetic nervous system-mediated hyperresponsivity to environmental stressors. The present study evaluated cardiovascular reactivity among young men with high versus low Ho scores during performance of an anagram task with or without harassment. Compared to performing the task alone, harassment led to increased cardiovascular arousal that was more pronounced for the high Ho subjects than the low Ho subjects. Moreover, harassment produced increases in self-rated anger, irritation, and tension, but it was only among those subjects with high Ho scores that increased anger and irritation were associated with enhanced cardiovascular arousal. While suggesting a role for anger- and irritation-induced cardiovascular arousal in pathogenesis of CHD, these findings indicate that situation characteristics mediate the relationship between Ho scores and cardiovascular reactivity, and that there may be a differential biological link between anger/irritation and cardiovascular responses in men with high and low Ho scores.
17446148	0	a	Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the highest levels of teenage pregnancies in the world. In spite of that, there is paucity of empirical research on causes of teenage pregnancies in African countries. This paper investigates the determinants of teenage pregnancies based on a case study of Busia District in Kenya. The data are from a household survey conducted in 1998/1999. Empirical results indicate that girls' education level has significant influence on the probability of teenage birth, with non-schooling adolescents and those with primary school level education being more vulnerable. Among the variables used as proxies for access to sex education, availability of church forums that educate adolescents about sex and family life issues reduce probability of teenage pregnancy. Age is positively related to teenage pregnancies, with older adolescents being more predisposed to pregnancies. Though use of contraceptives is found to have a positive effect, only a small proportion of adolescents were using modern contraceptives and, supply side factors such as quality and availability were not accounted for. Other key factors as outlined by the adolescents themselves include peer pressure and social environment-related factors like inappropriate forms of recreation, which act as rendezvous for pre-marital sex, as well as lack of parental guidance and counselling. Overall, lack of access to education opportunities, sex education and information regarding contraceptives, as well the widespread poverty predispose girls to teenage pregnancies. The problem of teenage pregnancies should be viewed within the broader socio-economic and socio-cultural environment in which the adolescents operate. For instance, lack of parental guidance on issues of sexuality and sex education was reinforced by cultural taboos that inhibit such discussions. Adolescents should be equipped with the relevant knowledge to enable them make informed choices regarding sexual relationships. This should be complemented with broader programmes aimed at promoting girl education and poverty alleviation.
15370610	0	a	This study aimed to identify factors at diagnosis that are related to cancer patients' utilization of hospital care during the first 2 years after diagnosis, and thereby improve identification of patients with an increased need for close follow-up. Data from a prospective intervention study of psychosocial support and from a computerized patient administration system were used. A total of 393 newly diagnosed patients were included. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to determine whether the addition of information regarding age, comorbidity, functional status, symptoms, and socioeconomic variables improved the prediction of utilization of specialist inpatient care beyond that afforded by cancer-related factors. In addition to cancer diagnosis and treatment, comorbidity, physical function, and pain determined use of inpatient care. Patients living in rural areas and those with a low income utilized hospital care more often. The results suggest that thorough assessment can identify patients at diagnosis with an increased need for follow-up, e.g. intensified home care services.
3237851	1	a	The spontaneous food intake of 31 adult humans was investigated with diary self-reports of ingestive behaviors and subjective hunger over 7 consecutive days. Meals were identified, using five different definitions, and their composition of total calories, carbohydrate, fat, and protein was estimated from a computer file of the nutritive value of foods. These data were analyzed by intercorrelating meal sizes with intermeal intervals, estimated stomach contents and self-reported hunger with univariate and multiple correlation techniques. Human feeding was found to be regulated on the basis of preprandial factors; the premeal interval, estimated premeal stomach content, and self-reported hunger significantly correlating with the meal size. These correlations were significant regardless of whether the meal was evaluated as spontaneous or constrained by external factors, but were stronger when the meals occurred without other people being present. The postprandial relationship between the meal size and the duration of the postmeal interval, which is present in nonhuman species, was only present in humans when meals that were eaten alone were considered separately. This suggests that the species differences may be due to the social context of observation. The intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein was found to have a suppressive effect on subsequent intake and subjective hunger through their contributions to total food energy ingested. Protein, however, was found to suppress subsequent intake and subjective hunger independent of its contribution to total calories, suggesting that the macronutrients have differing satiating properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2797981	1	a	Height and weight data from the Mexican-American portion of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) are shown for children of ages 2 to 17 years and compared with data for non-Hispanic white children from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference curves. Differences in stature between the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the reference populations were minor prior to adolescence and could be entirely attributed to the greater poverty of Mexican-Americans. However, differences increased during adolescence (ie, median stature was less than the 25th percentile of the NCHS reference population at 17 years of age) and, in contrast with earlier ages, were independent of poverty. Similar growth patterns were observed in samples of upper-class subjects from Mexico and Guatemala. Nonetheless, the extent to which the short stature of Mexican-American adolescents is genetic is unclear because there is an apparent time trend toward greater stature in the Mexican-American population. In conclusion, the NCHS reference curves are appropriate growth standards for preadolescent Mexican-American children. Whether they are valid for Mexican-American adolescents remains unclear.
3965566	1	a	Data from two national longitudinal studies of older workers were examined in order to compare the determinants and consequences of retirement for white and black men, and for poverty, marginal, and upper economic level men. The number of categories important in determining retirement was greater for white men than for black men and increased with increase in economic level. Retirement was found to have few consequences, being important mainly with respect to health and economic matters. Blacks and poverty level men were minimally affected by retirement, the impact of retirement probably being somewhat ameliorated by age-determined income maintenance programs and subsidies. Men at the marginal economic level were affected most adversely.
2738317	1	a	This study examined the personal and environmental factors related to the activity involvement of older people living in congregate residential settings. A sample of 1,428 residents in 42 such settings provided information about their activities, functioning, and background. Measures of facility features were also available. These data show that individuals are more likely to participate in facility-organized activities in settings where overall resident participation is greater, the average functioning of residents is lower, staffing is higher, and the program more structured. Participation in facility activities is not related to personal characteristics. In contrast, involvement in resident-initiated activities, both in the facility and in the community, is related to personal characteristics (being functionally intact, female, and better educated) and to facility features (larger size, lower staffing, greater autonomy and cohesiveness). The impact of some features varies depending on the functional capacity of the individual resident.
7391772	1	a	The family imprints its members with selfhood in all cultures. Absence of family imprints can result in the development of deviant childhood behavior and loss of identity. In two black racial groups in dissimilar world areas and sampling (Kenya, Africa and Newark, N.J.), five familial determinants interfered with the development of culturally accepted family imprints and led to deviant and criminal behavior. It is suggested that if these deterrents, namely poverty, lack of family authority figures, rejection of of the individual child, absence of family cohesiveness, and loss of individual identity within the family, were altered in their development by family therapy techniques, then criminal and deviant behavior would be decreased.
16707074	0	a	OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different classes of antipsychotic drug treatment in people with schizophrenia responding inadequately to, or having unacceptable side-effects from, their current medication. DESIGN: Two pragmatic, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken. The first RCT (band 1) compared the class of older, inexpensive conventional drugs with the class of new atypical drugs in people with schizophrenic disorders, whose current antipsychotic drug treatment was being changed either because of inadequate clinical response or owing to side-effects. The second RCT (band 2) compared the new (non-clozapine) atypical drugs with clozapine in people whose medication was being changed because of poor clinical response to two or more antipsychotic drugs. Both RCTs were four-centre trials with concealed randomisation and three follow-up assessments over 1 year, blind to treatment. SETTING: Adult mental health settings in England. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 227 participants aged 18-65 years (40% of the planned sample) were randomised to band 1 and 136 (98% of the planned sample) to band 2. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to a class of drug. The managing clinician selected the individual drug within that class, except for the clozapine arm in band 2. The new atypical drugs included risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and amisulpride. The conventional drugs included older drugs, including depot preparations. As in routine practice, clinicians and participants were aware of the identity of the prescribed drug, but clinicians were asked to keep their participating patient on the randomised medication for at least the first 12 weeks. If the medication needed to be changed, the clinician was asked to prescribe another drug within the same class, if possible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Secondary clinical outcomes included symptoms [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)], side-effects and participant satisfaction. Economic outcomes were costs of health and social care and a utility measure. RESULTS: Recruitment to band 1 was less than anticipated (40%) and diminished over the trial. This appeared largely due to loss of perceived clinical equipoise (clinicians progressively becoming more convinced of the superiority of new atypicals). Good follow-up rates and a higher than expected correlation between QLS score at baseline and at follow-up meant that the sample as recruited had 75% power to detect a difference in QLS score of 5 points between the two treatment arms at 52 weeks. The recruitment to band 2 was approximately as planned. Follow-up assessments were completed at week 52 in 81% of band 1 and 87% of band 2 participants. Band 1 data showed that, on the QLS and symptom measures, those participants in the conventional arm tended towards greater improvements. This suggests that the failure to find the predicted advantage for new atypicals was not due to inadequate recruitment and statistical power in this sample. Participants reported no clear preference for either class of drug. There were no statistically significant differential outcomes for participants entering band 1 for reasons of treatment intolerance to those entering because of broadly defined treatment resistance. Net costs over the year varied widely, with a mean of 18,850 pounds sterling in the conventional drug group and 20,123 pounds sterling in the new atypical group, not a statistically significant difference. Of these costs, 2.1% and 3.8% were due to antipsychotic drug costs in the conventional and atypical group, respectively. There was a trend towards participants in the conventional drug group scoring more highly on the utility measure at 1 year. The results for band 2 showed an advantage for commencing clozapine in quality of life (QLS) at trend level (p = 0.08) and in symptoms (PANSS), which was statistically significant (p = 0.01), at 1 year. Clozapine showed approximately a 5-point advantage on PANSS total score and a trend towards having fewer total extrapyramidal side-effects. Participants reported at 12 weeks that their mental health was significantly better with clozapine than with new atypicals (p < 0.05). Net costs of care varied widely, but were higher than in band 1, with a mean of 33,800 pounds sterling in the clozapine group and 28,400 pounds sterling in the new atypical group. Of these costs, 4.0% and 3.3%, respectively, were due to antipsychotic drug costs. The increased costs in the clozapine group appeared to reflect the licensing requirement for inpatient admission for commencing the drug. There was a trend towards higher mean participant utility scores in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS: For band 1, there is no disadvantage in terms of quality of life and symptoms, or associated costs of care, over 1 year in commencing conventional antipsychotic drugs rather than new atypical drugs. Conventional drugs were associated with non-significantly better outcomes and lower costs. Drug costs represented a small proportion of the overall costs of care (<5%). For band 2, there is a statistically significant advantage in terms of symptoms but not quality of life over 1 year in commencing clozapine rather than new atypical drugs, but with increased associated costs of care. The results suggest that conventional antipsychotic drugs, which are substantially cheaper, still have a place in the treatment of patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, current medication. Further analyses of this data set are planned and further research is recommended into areas such as current antipsychotic treatment guidance, valid measures of utility in serious mental illness, low-dose 'conventional' treatment in first episode schizophrenia, QLS validity and determinants of QLS score in schizophrenia, and into the possible financial and other mechanisms of rewarding clinician participation in trials.
3811601	1	a	In the context of the first Swiss National Health Survey preventive health behaviour was tested in 3419 Swiss citizens aged over 20 years. A health behaviour index including favourable health attitudes and good utilization of preventive health services was correlated with different social indicators. Age, sex and a good self-rated health were the most important factors associated with a high preventive health behaviour score. Education showed a less strong but also significant influence on positive health behaviour. Overall utilization of health services decreased with high preventive health behavior index.

Mothers at high risk of adverse perinatal outcome in terms of perinatal mortality and low birthweight were found to be very young and grand multiparous mothers, old primiparas, unmarried mothers, those with multiple pregnancies and mothers born in Asia.
16188748	0	a	AIM: This study examines socio-demographic determinants of initiation and duration of breastfeeding in a community-based cohort in northwest Russia. METHODS: All infants born to women who were registered at the antenatal clinics in Severodvinsk in 1999 comprised the cohort (n=1399) and were followed up at 1 y. Data on maternal and infant characteristics as well as the duration of breastfeeding were obtained from medical records. Proportional hazard analysis was applied to quantify the effect of the selected factors on the risk of breastfeeding discontinuation adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Only 1.3% of infants were never breastfed. Breastfeeding rates were 75.0% and 47.2% at 3 and 6 mo, respectively. Maternal age and early initiation of prenatal care were positively associated with breastfeeding initiation rates. Increased risks of breastfeeding discontinuation were found in teenage mothers (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.06-1.99), in mothers with basic education (OR=1.68, 95% CI: 1.06-2.66) and in unmarried mothers (OR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.38). Women with no previous deliveries were more likely to breastfeed longer (OR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.62-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous studies in Russia, almost universal initiation and considerably higher rates of breastfeeding at specific time points were found. Social variations in initiation and duration of breastfeeding should raise concern of inequalities in breastfeeding practices in transitional Russia.
6656327	1	a	Predictors of dropping out of care were examined for 171 treated hypertensive patients enrolled in a randomized trial of social support strategies designed to improve compliance and blood pressure control. Control patients who continued to receive routine care were more than twice as likely to drop out as patients who received routine care and periodic home visits by nurses or pharmacists (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7). The combination of home visits and a second intervention, having family members monitor patients' blood pressure and compliance behavior, was no more effective than home visits alone (OR = 1.1). The home visits intervention was one of six variables identified by a stepwise regression as significant predictors of dropping out. Patients with four or more high-risk characteristics constituted 15% of the sample but contributed almost half (46%) of the dropouts. Targeting support strategies at high-risk patients may be a cost-effective means of reducing uncontrolled hypertension.
17135105	0	a	Using data from the Community Tracking Study Household Survey (1998-99), we estimate the relationship between Medigap premiums and senior Medicare beneficiaries' supplemental coverage decisions. All seniors are more likely to be enrolled in an HMO in markets with higher Medigap prices. Lower income seniors are particularly sensitive to Medigap premiums and are more likely to have no supplemental coverage when faced with higher Medigap premiums. As Medicare supplemental options evolve in response to the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, it is important to consider that lower income beneficiaries may respond to price changes and other factors differently than their higher income counterparts.
2807934	1	a	A national sample of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged was created by merging the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey and its counterpart, the National Health Interview Survey for the same year. A weighted logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might be useful in calculating home- and community-based long-term care clients' risk of institutionalization. A model containing patient characteristics, nursing home bed supply, and a climate variable correctly classified 98.2 percent of cases residing in nursing homes or the community. Physical dependency, mental disorder and degenerative disease, lack of spouse, being white, poverty, old age, unoccupied nursing home beds, and climate all appear to be determinants of institutional residency among the aged.
19573222	0	a	BACKGROUND: Identification of subpopulations at high risk of overweight and obesity is crucial for prevention and management of obesity in different socioeconomic status (SES) categories. The objective of the study was to describe disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity across socioeconomic status (SES) groups in 18-74 year-old French adults. METHODS: Analyses were based on a multistage stratified random sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18-74-years-old from the French Nutrition and Health Survey (ENNS), a cross-sectional national survey carried out in 2006/2007. Collected data included measured anthropometry (weight, height and waist circumference (WC)), demographic and SES data (occupation, education and frequency of holiday trips as a marker of family income). SES factors associated with overweight (BMI > or = 25) and central obesity (WC above gender-specific references) were identified using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Almost half (49.3%) of French adults were overweight or obese and 16.9% were obese. In men, the risk of overall overweight or obesity was associated with occupation (p < 0.05), whereas the risk of central obesity was independently associated with occupation (p < 0.05) and frequency of holiday trips (p < 0.01). In women, both overall and central overweight and obesity were independently associated with educational level (respectively p < 10(-3) and p < 10(-3)) and frequency of holiday trips (respectively p < 0.05 and p < 10-3). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was found to be similar to that of several neighbouring western European countries, and lower than the UK and eastern Europe. Risk of being overweight or obese varied across SES groups both in men and women, but associations were different between men and women, indicating differing determinants.
18805655	0	a	PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence and correlates of cocaine injection initiation and the impacts of daily cocaine injection among a cohort of injection drug users. METHODS: Among 1603 participants, from May 1996 to December 2005, risk factors for initiation of cocaine injection among baseline heroin users were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression and correlates of daily cocaine injection by generalized estimating equations. FINDINGS: Of the 238 individuals who had never injected cocaine, 200 (84%) had at least one follow-up visit and 121 (61%) consequently initiated into cocaine injection, yielding an incidence density of initiation into cocaine injection of 21.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.9-25.8) per 100 person-years. In a multivariate model, Downtown Eastside (DTES) residence (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=2.46, 95% CI: 1.68-3.60), incarceration (AHR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.01-2.24), requiring help injecting (AHR=1.57, 95% CI: 0.99-2.49), and binge drug use (AHR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.22-2.73) remained associated with initiation into cocaine injection. DTES residence (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.99, 95% CI: 1.62-2.46), unstable housing (AOR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), incarceration (AOR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.60), sex trade involvement (AOR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.15-1.85), requiring help injecting (AOR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.73-2.58)), borrowing syringes (AOR=1.81, 95% CI: 1.35-2.43) and binge drug use (AOR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.81-2.58) were independently associated with daily cocaine injection. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline prevalence and subsequent incidence of initiation into cocaine injection was high. Daily cocaine injection was independently associated with a number of health and social harms, including elevated HIV risk behavior.
15189215	0	a	Mating systems are important determinants of genetic structure in cooperative groups, and their effects can influence profoundly the interactions of group members. The primitively eusocial wasp, Ropalidia revolutionalis, has an interesting genetic and social structure that makes it an excellent model system for examining the evolution of more complex societies. In particular, its colonies sometimes have multiple queens, a key characteristic of more advanced wasp societies. In this study, we have characterized the mating system of the social wasp Ropalidia revolutionalis to understand better its colony genetic structure. R. revolutionalis females nearly always mate singly and they are unrelated to their mates. However, different females in the same colony do mate with males, on average, who are related as cousins. Single mating will help to maintain high relatedness, which should be important for continued cooperation in multiple queen societies, but it creates potential conflicts in single queen colonies over the production of males as well as over the timing of male production. We have also characterized the population structure of R. revolutionalis from Townsville, in tropical north Queensland, to Brisbane in the subtropics. Even at such a large scale, the population is remarkably unstructured with an average F(ST) of 0.0546. There is weak isolation by distance, and evidence for subtle differentiation between a southern region with no dry season, which extends as far north as Rockhampton, and a northern region with a severe to moderate dry season. This may reflect historical effects of extreme aridity on the population structure.
11029135	0	a	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to predict and explain nurses' adherence to Universal Precautions (UPs) when performing venipunctures. METHODS: Data were gathered from 156 registered nurses working at a regional hospital. A self-administered questionnaire assessing the psychosocial variables (intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived control, etc) was completed at baseline, and behavior was self-reported 3 months later. RESULTS: The regression of intention on the variables yielded an adjusted R(2) of 0.68, with perceived barriers (beta =.62, P <.001), social norm (beta =.17, P <.01), and personal normative belief (beta =.19, P <.01) being the significant variables. With respect to the 3-month follow-up, 28% of the variance associated with UPs adherence was explained by intention (beta =.37, P <.001) and perceived behavioral control (beta =.23, P <.05). Moreover, high (n = 116) and low intenders (n = 40) differed on several normative beliefs (P =.0003) and perceived barriers (P =.0001). CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that perception of control, assessed either globally or by means of a belief-based measure, is a key factor in adherence. Specifically, the perceived difficulties associated with adherence to UPs appear to be related to a nurse's training on UPs and to the existence of suboptimal working conditions.
25195529	1	a	With the increasing interest in comparative studies of the elderly, China has become the focus of research attention. This society, which has been inaccessible to most Western researchers, offers a special site for studies of aging because of its sheer size as a world power, its relationship to Third World countries, and its population problem-a growing segment of elderly people. Available data from a variety of social science sources are utilized to compare how the sociocultural context of China and the United States impact differentially upon the older population in each society. Three major determinants specify the theoretical context: economic development (the level of production an economic system achieves); traditional cultural patterns (norms, roles, relationships); and the social control mechanisms (regulatory processes based upon the legal and sanctioning systems). These determinants provide a theoretical orientation for analyzing the outcome variables involved in the behavior and adaptation of the old. In American society, cultural norms and values are advantageous for active older persons in good health, particularly those with a favorable economic situation. In contemporary Chinese society, which blends traditional customs with the values of a revolutionary and changing society, there are advantages for the frail elderly.
19288341	0	a	In this paper, we investigate the intersections of gender, health and human rights in sites of political exclusion. We apply the political theory of Giorgio Agamben on 'states of exception', seeking to better understand how the recent 'war on terror', that seemingly knows no limits of time or space, is driving health outcomes in refugee and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. Reproductive health, militarization, and gender-based violence in camps are explored in depth. The evidence presented reveals a number of contradictions of refugee and IDP camps, further highlighting the need for a more rights based humanitarianism. We conclude that foregrounding states of exception, as a way of understanding current gender dynamics in the social determinants of health, is both epidemiologically necessary and conceptually useful. We find that, in these sites of exclusion, the indispensability of a human rights approach to gender and health equity issues is revealed most directly. Furthermore, we are able to make new connections between the 'crisis of humanitarianism', gender, and health.
19827286	0	a	A short review of main results obtained in occupational stress research is presented. Stress activates the sympato-adrenal system with possible dangerous consequences on the cardiovascular apparatus. In field studies the relation between stress and coronary diseases is controversial. However, from a clinical and experimental perspective the relation between breakdown in adaptation and cardiovascular disorder is a fact. More consistent results on the psychosocial determinants of an increased cardiovascular risk are obtained when stress is studied in relation to the socio-economic condition of groups and individuals. To better embrace and describe such factors, a new theoretical contribution has been introduced: social capital. This is a more sophisticated version of social cohesion, social integration and social support. For the future, an interdisciplinary approach is recommended in health surveillance of life and work environment.
3775371	1	a	Epidemiology has evolved from its historic origins as the study of major epidemics and vital statistics to a contemporary focus on the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in humans. This evolution reflects changes in the patterns of diseases and deaths that have occurred in our time and has placed new emphasis on preventing avoidable, premature deaths. Advances in clinical medicine, laboratory science, statistical and data handling methods, and in our basic understanding of the pathogenesis of disease have enabled epidemiologists to better examine causes of disease and to propose more effective strategies for prevention and control.
19402801	0	a	A brief summary of key presentations at the 15th Annual International Society for Quality of Life conference is presented. Special highlights of this conference were its location (South America) and its aim to present current and potential contributions of the health-related quality of life (QoL) field to equity in healthcare at a clinical and population level, providing crucial inputs for decision-making in a person-centered health conception. Present and future utilization of health-related QoL measures, norms and bank items were introduced by David Cella, who also called for researchers' cooperation, stating that efforts towards a commonly shared language and metric are better than a relentless pursuit of perfection. Other central topics in the search of equity were stigma and poverty. The importance of negative attributes by others in stigma severity perception and low self-reported QoL was demonstrated by Donald Patrick, who suggested interventions for reducing stigma. Poverty impact on children's QoL and the importance of social determinants were demonstrated through a unique, longitudinal Brazilian study. Complementarily, the importance of a biological basis of oncologic symptoms, particularly cytokines, and the impact of their control on health-related QoL were addressed by Charles Cleeland. The meeting stressed the combined importance of social, psychological and biological factors in determining patient-reported outcomes.
2746717	1	a	The paper reviews approaches to relapse in the treatment of cocaine abusers. Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.
7376236	1	a	Survey data from women in pregnancy risk in Venezuela and Kenya are used to examine the determinants of contraceptive intention, use, and the intention/use consistency. The five ranking determinants of contraceptive use are: intention to contracept, social support, accessibility, conjugal communication, and desire for additional children. All five determinants have direct and additive effects on contraception, but their relative impacts vary significantly between the two cultures. Contraceptive intention and use are highly consistent, while level of consistency varies significantly between the two samples and within each by various combinations of ranking variables and by parity. Major research and policy implications of the results are reviewed.
4049019	1	a	This paper describes and analyses the reasons for variation in the treatment strategies used by arthritis sufferers. The research was undertaken among 103 people from the Australian city of Perth. Qualitative data was obtained from a clinical sample of 27 and, on the basis of that, an interview schedule was constructed and administered to a survey sample of 76 self-reported arthritis sufferers. Data collected included comprehensive case histories, knowledge and beliefs about arthritis, types of practitioners consulted and treatments used and a range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. On the basis of analysis, four basic treatment strategies were discerned. Named after their most salient characteristics and ranging from least to most inclusive these were 'general practitioner and/or self care', 'medical and paramedical care', 'medical and alternative care' and use of 'all sources of care'. The most important determinants of treatment strategy were characteristics of disease--severity, mode of onset and period since onset. The longer the period since onset, the wider the range of treatments utilized. When onset occurred at a relatively young age and when progression was rapid, the more frequently alternative services and treatments were employed. Disease characteristics were followed in importance by socioeconomic factors. Use of the less inclusive strategies was related to social class; with working class people relying primarily on 'general practitioner and/or self care' and middle class people using 'medical and paramedical care'. However, when onset and progression were rapid, the disease was severe and the person relatively young socioeconomic factors were of lesser importance and people from all classes made use of the more inclusive strategies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
3067531	1	a	The present paper will review and discuss research issues and findings of recent cross-cultural studies of severe mental disorders. The paper is divided into two main sections. The first section will discuss: (1) the concept of culture, (2) hierarchical levels of human behavior determinants, (3) the cultural variability continuum, and (4) the concept of self. The second section will discuss: (1) epidemiology, (2) culture and clinical phenomenology in severe disorders, and (3) culture as an etiological determinant. The paper closes with a discussion of some conclusions and suggestions for future research.
11866324	0	a	BACKGROUND: Recent major epidemiological studies have adopted increasingly multidimensional approaches to assessment. Several of these have included some assessment of perceived need for mental health care. The Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, conducted in 1997, included a particularly detailed examination of this construct, with an instrument with demonstrated reliability and validity. METHODS: A clustered probability sample of 10641 Australians responded to the field questionnaire for this survey, including questions on perceived need either where there had been service utilization, or where a disorder was detected by administration of sections of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The confidentialized unit record file generated from the survey was analysed for determinants of perceived need. RESULTS: Perceived need is increased in females, in people in the middle years of adulthood, and in those who have affective disorders or co-morbidity. Effects of diagnosis and disability can account for most of the differences in gender specific rates. With correction for these effects through regression, there is less perceived need for social interventions and possibly more for counselling in females; disability is confirmed as strongly positively associated with perceived need, as are the presence of affective disorders or co-morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study underscore the imperative for mental health services to be attentive and responsive to consumer perceived need. The substantial majority of people who are significantly disabled by mental health problems are among those who see themselves as having such needs.
10301136	1	a	The mid-1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe--and other parts of the world--a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time-span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy. The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the planning environment. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present-day economic circumstances. The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is 'best' under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs of problems; the attention to long-term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches.
18631388	0	a	BACKGROUND: Health professionals, policy-makers and researchers need to be able to explore potential associations between prevalence rates and quality of care with a range of possible determinants including socio-economic deprivation and morbidity levels to determine the impact of commissioning and service delivery. In the UK, data in England are only available nationally at practice postcode level. In Scotland, such data are available based on an aggregate of the practices population's postcodes. The use of data assigned to the practice postcode may underestimate the association between ill health and income deprivation. Here, we report on the impact of using data assigned to the practice population by comparing analyses using English and Scottish data. RESULTS: Income deprivation based on data assigned to the practice postcode under-estimated deprivation compared to using income deprivation data assigned to the practice population for the five least deprived deciles, and over-estimated deprivation for the five most deprived deciles. The biggest differences were found for the most deprived decile. A similar trend was found for limiting long-term illness (LLTI). Differences between the QOF prevalence rates of the least and most deprived deciles using practice postcode data were similar (0.2% points or less) in England and Scotland for 8 out of 10 clinical domains. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences in the prevalence rate between the least and most deprived deciles increase for all clinical domains. A similar trend was again found for LLTI. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences for population achievement increase for all CHD quality indicators with the exception of beta-blockers (CHD10). With practice postcode assigned deprivation, significant differences between the least and most deprived deciles were found for 2 out 8 indicators, compared to 5 using practice population assigned deprivation. For LLTI differences between the lowest and most deprived deciles increased for all indicators when ill health assigned to the practice population was used. CONCLUSION: We have found, through comparing deprivation and ill health data assigned to either the practice postcode or the practice population postcode in Scotland, that analyses based on practice postcode assigned data under-estimated the relationship between deprivation and ill health for both prevalence and quality care. Given the importance of understanding the effect of deprivation and ill health on a range of determinants related to health care, policy makers should ensure that practice population data are available and used at national level in England and elsewhere where possible.
6637901	1	a	We examine the causes and consequences of fatalism in a cross-cultural setting, focusing on the ways in which a fatalistic world view may mediate the effects of social class and Mexican ethnic identity on psychological distress. We find that persons in the lower social classes and Mexicans tend to be more fatalistic than persons in the upper classes and Anglos, and that fatalism, in turn, increases psychological distress. We attempt to integrate research on the social and cultural determinants of cognitive orientations with studies of the effects of social class and Mexican culture on distress.
18656859	0	a	OBJECTIVES: To estimate the umbilical cord blood lead levels (BLLs) of Pakistani neonates and to identify determinants for umbilical BLLs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of mothers and infants at one of the two obstetric units of two tertiary care hospitals in Karachi during January-August 2005. Information from 540 mothers selected randomly from those registered for delivery was obtained about their pregnancy, diet, and current and past lead exposures. We collected umbilical cord blood for lead levels analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. We computed geometric and arithmetic means. We performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify factors associated with log-transformed umbilical cord BLLs. We also performed logistic regression analysis to identify determinants of high lead cord BLLs (10 microg/dl). RESULTS: The geometric mean cord BLL of the neonates was 9.6 microg/dl; arithmetic mean (S.D.) was 10.8 microg/dl (5.7) with a median of 9.7 microg/dl and a range of 1.8-48.9 microg/dl. Women who reported intake of less than 58.5mg of elemental iron supplement per day during pregnancy had cord BLL of 10.0 microg/dl; in comparison those women who had higher iron intake had lower cord BLL (8.4 microg/dl). Those who used surma (an eye cosmetic) daily had higher cord BLL (11.5 microg/dl) as compared to those who used it less frequently (9.4 microg/dl). In multivariable linear regression model, higher iron intake, owning a car, and being in 2nd quartile of mid-arm circumference were associated with low lead levels while father's occupation in lead-based industry was associated with significantly higher umbilical cord BLLs. There was interaction of daily surma use and ethnicity. Geometric mean BLLs were varied among surma users by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical cord BLLs are high in Karachi, Pakistan, in comparison to those in developed countries such as United States. Measures are needed to reduce fetal lead exposure to prevent adverse affect on neurocognitive development. Association of low iron (below RDA of 60 mg per day) with high umbilical cord has implications for strengthening iron supplement intake during pregnancy. Umbilical cord BLLs differed among surma users by ethnicity.
20028669	0	a	In parallel with the neo-liberal retrenchment of the welfarist state, an increasing emphasis on the responsibility of individuals in managing their own affairs and their well-being has been evident. In the health arena for instance, this was a major theme permeating the UK government's White Paper Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier (2004), which appealed to an ethos of autonomy and self-actualization through activity and consumption which merited esteem. As a counterpoint to this growing trend of informed responsibilization, constrained choices (constrained agency) provides a useful framework for a judicious balance and sense of proportion between an individual behavioural focus and a focus on societal, systemic, and structural determinants of health and well-being. Constrained choices is also a conceptual bridge between responsibilization and population health which could be further developed within an integrative biosocial perspective one might refer to as the social ecology of health and disease.
14713671	0	a	Over the past two decades, public health research has emphasized the role of individual risk behaviors, primarily injection and sexual risk behaviors, in the spread of HIV infection. Much less emphasis has been given to understanding the determinants of these risk behaviors. Although individual characteristics are partly responsible for risky injection and sexual behaviors, they do not explain all the interpersonal variability in risk behavior. Contextual factors associated with HIV risk behavior may include structural factors (e.g., availability of services), social norms and attitudes (e.g., social trust), disadvantage (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic status), and features of the physical environment (e.g., housing quality). This article presents a conceptual framework that incorporates some of the key contextual domains that may affect drug use behavior. It also presents data from a study of street-recruited drug users as an example of the relations between social contextual factors and frequency of injecting drug use, and discusses some methodological challenges in the study of contextual determinants of drug use behavior.
10951443	0	a	We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population.
16162598	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Underweight, overweight, and obese women aged 18-34 years were compared with normal weight women of the corresponding age according to socioeconomic, psychosocial, health behaviour, self reported global and psychological health, and locus of control characteristics. METHODS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional study. A total 13,715 persons aged 18-80 years, of which 1967 were females of 18-34 years of age, were included in this study. They answered a postal questionnaire, which represents 59% of the random sample. A logistic regression model adjusted for age was used to investigate the association between socioeconomic, psychosocial, health behaviour, self reported global and psychological health, locus of control, and the BMI categories. RESULTS: A 17.5% proportion of the women, aged 18-34 years, were underweight (BMI < 20.0), 18.4% were overweight, and 7.0% obese. The prevalence of underweight according to the BMI < 18.5 definition was 5.8% among women aged 18-34 years. Women who were underweight had significantly higher odds ratios for overtime work, being students, low emotional support, and poor self reported global as well as poor psychological health than normal weight women. Women who were overweight/obese were unemployed, had low education, low social participation, low emotional and instrumental support, were daily smokers, had a sedentary lifestyle, had poor self reported global health, and had lack of internal locus of control compared with normal weight women. CONCLUSIONS: Underweight women are more likely to have poorer psychological health than normal weight women. In contrast, overweight and obese women are more likely to have poor health related behaviours and lack of internal locus of control compared with normal weight women. These differing patterns suggest both different etiology and different preventive strategies to deal with the health risks of people who are underweight as opposed to those who are overweight/obese.
12038742	0	a	The authors describe the use of a stress process model by the East Side Village Health Worker Partnership (ESVHWP), a project of the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center, as a framework for understanding social determinants of health. Specifically, the authors describe the development by the ESVHWP Steering Committee of a context-specific stress process model for east side Detroit residents. The authors examine data from in-depth interviews to illuminate actions taken by community members to reduce stressors or minimize their impact on health. Finally, the authors describe the use of this context-specific stress process model and data gathered regarding actions to address community stressors to inform the development of interventions by the ESVHWP to reduce stressors or strengthen the conditioning factors that reduce the impact of stress on health. On the basis of these results, the authors discuss opportunities and challenges for partnership approaches to addressing social determinants of health in urban communities.
11008088	0	a	PURPOSE: To investigate a broad range of social influence-related and global determinants of smoking to aid in the design of comprehensive multiethnic interventions by testing the most important factors of initiation and escalation of smoking across various subgroups. METHODS: Cross-sectional (N = 2546) and cohort (N = 736) samples of multiethnic middle school students near a large Southwestern metropolis were surveyed through self-report questionnaires. The confidential questionnaires included information on demographics, risk factors, and smoking behavior and were administered in class by trained data collectors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the statistical significance and strength of the factors. RESULTS: Those lower in self-esteem and higher in social assertiveness appeared to be most at risk for the onset of smoking, whereas those low in optimism appeared to be the most at risk for the escalation of smoking. Attitudes, friends' norms, parents' norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived prevalence were consistent predictors of all smoking status outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral-specific determinants of smoking appear to be important predictors of smoking status outcomes in all demographic subgroups. The relationships of the global determinants were more dependent on the smoking outcome variable and subgroup examined. The findings may serve to help facilitate the targeting of comprehensive interventions aimed at reducing adolescent smoking in multiethnic and ethnic group-specific populations.
17665843	0	a	In the first part of this paper, a secondary analysis of multiple data sources was done to identify how many nurses, physicians, dentists, pharmacists and other health workers have migrated from the Portuguese speaking African countries (PSAC) to Portugal between 1998 and 2002. In the second part, the results of a 2003 questionnaire based survey of 45 nurses, from Guinea-Bissau, residing in Portugal are reported. Health professionals are increasing as a proportion of total immigrants into Portugal. Relatively to the countries' of origin population, the PSAC contribute the most with foreign health professionals to the Portuguese healthcare system. Our study of Guinea-Bissau nurses in Portugal replicates the results of other studies and suggests that the decision to emigrate is multiply determined. The implication for policy makers is that the causal complexity among factors spurring emigration makes that the marginal effect of policy reforms addressing one or more of the multiple determinants of emigration may be sufficient to retain some proportion of health professionals, even when other determinants of emigration are present. The situation observed is also indicative of the need of programs for social integration of these professionals.
3068840	1	a	"A decade has elapsed since a project was launched in Matlab, Bangladesh to test the hypothesis that contraceptive services can induce and sustain fertility decline in a rural traditional population. The demographic impact of this project has been pronounced, lending support to the view that supply-side policies can succeed even where institutional supports for demand are weak. This paper reviews the relationship between the Bangladesh climate of demand and the Matlab system of supply with the aim of explaining how such effects arise. A sociologically appropriate system of supply can induce fertility change in a society where such change would not spontaneously arise. The study of programs and the ""sociology of the supply side"" thus deserve the same degree of rigor accorded to research on the ""sociology of demand."""
2723595	1	a	Data from the British Department of Health and Social Services Hypertension Care Computing Project were analyzed to study determinants of visit frequency in hypertension management. The 457 patients from five general practices made 7974 visits between 1971 and 1985 resulting in 7391 intervals on which evaluation could be based. The mean interval between visits was 113 days (SD = 110 days) with a median interval of 91 days. Visit interval was influenced by level of blood pressure and length of time in follow-up. For diastolic pressures less than 104 mmHg the mean visit interval was 4 months, contrasting with 2 months for diastolic pressures greater than 130 mmHg. Visit intervals became longer with increasing length of time in follow-up, independent of level of blood pressure. Shorter intervals reflected initial management and getting the blood pressure reduced; longer intervals may reflect patients' failure to keep scheduled appointments. Between practices, mean visit intervals ranged from 99 to 193 days (median 72 to 164 days). These differences were reduced after adjustment for length of time the patients had been in follow-up. Patient age, sex, body mass index, and the presence of angina pectoris were not associated with visit interval. The analyses illustrate how process and outcome may be linked in ambulatory care practice as a means of determining rational guidelines for optimal utilization of health services.
2558204	1	a	To identify factors associated with the decision to consult with dyspepsia, patients with dyspepsia were identified from a postal survey in the community. A random sample of 69 patients who had consulted their general practitioner and 66 patients with dyspepsia who had not consulted were interviewed in their homes. Differences in consultation behaviour were not explained by differences in self-reported severity or frequency of symptoms or by the presence of associated symptoms. The most striking difference between the two groups was concern among the consulters about the possible seriousness of symptoms. Consulters were also more likely to be worried about cancer and heart disease and to have experienced more disruptive or threatening life events than the non-consulters. These results emphasize the importance of looking beyond the presentation of common symptoms in general practice to patients' fears about the significance of the symptoms and to non-physical determinants of consultation behaviour.
24302171	1	a	Within our present health care system, there is a growing movement that argues that our perceptions of health and illness are in need of change. This change includes redefining what we mean by health in terms of the whole person-the emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of our being, as well as the physical. An increasing number of health professionals and social scientists believe our concepts of health and illness must consider all these aspects of life. It is believed that the quality of life may be enhanced by such perceptions of health, which include social and spiritual factors. Using data from the 1985 Akron Area Survey-The Subjective Quality of Life in the Akron Area-this study explores the effects of spiritual well-being and emotional well-being on health satisfaction. Results indicate that emotional and spiritual factors do significantly contribute to the subjective evaluation of health, especially for individuals who are physically limited.
7208724	1	a	A population of professional dance (N = 183) and modelling (N = 56) students, who by career choice must focus increased attention and control over their body shapes, was studied. Height and weight data were obtained on all subjects. In addition, a questionnaire that is useful in assessing the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), was administered. Results of these tests were compared with those of normal female university students (N = 59), patients with anorexia nervosa (N = 68), and music students (N = 35). Anorexia nervosa and excessive dieting concerns were overrepresented in the dance and modelling students. Twelve cases (6.5%) of primary anorexia nervosa were detected in the dance group. All but one case developed the disorder while studying dance. Within the dance group those from the most competitive environments had the greatest frequency of anorexia nervosa. These data suggest that both pressures to be slim and achievement expectations are risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa. The influence of socio-cultural determinants are discussed within the context of anorexia nervosa as a multidetermined disorder.
16380367	0	a	This paper reports on an exploratory study of nursing home bankruptcy. From state and industry data regarding nearly 1,000 California facilities, it was possible to identify 155 homes in five chains (multi-facility organizations) that were operating in bankruptcy in 2000. When compared with facilities in non-bankrupt chains, while the bankrupt chain facilities had significantly worse financial liquidity, higher administrative costs, and higher payables to related parties, they also had more Medicare residents, fewer Medicaid residents, better solvency, and were located in less competitive county markets and in areas with higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. These findings indicate that, rather than facility characteristics and local market factors, strategic decisions taken at the corporate (chain) level are the major determinants of nursing facility bankruptcy status.
3775371	1	a	Epidemiology has evolved from its historic origins as the study of major epidemics and vital statistics to a contemporary focus on the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in humans. This evolution reflects changes in the patterns of diseases and deaths that have occurred in our time and has placed new emphasis on preventing avoidable, premature deaths. Advances in clinical medicine, laboratory science, statistical and data handling methods, and in our basic understanding of the pathogenesis of disease have enabled epidemiologists to better examine causes of disease and to propose more effective strategies for prevention and control.
17855469	0	a	This article explores issues relating to the concept of social capital which has been become an important explanation for inequalities in health. It is based on an analysis of in-depth interviews with working class men living in two contrasting socio-economic areas--one relatively disadvantaged and one advantaged. It highlights the role of different community contexts in the nature and extent of local social capital. In particular, it demonstrates how de-industrialization and economic change as well as material deprivation and a perceived dis-investment in local communities impacted on the men's levels of social capital. Analysis also shows the ways in which gender mediates the processes through which social capital is developed and accessed as a personal and social resource, and how the norms and values associated with working class masculinities appeared to preclude the men from building supportive health-enhancing relationships with others in their community. The prominence of social capital has focused attention on the subjective dimensions of community life as potential determinants of health. This article has, therefore, sought to contribute to this field by widening our understanding about the relationship between social capital, gender and health.
12314072	1	a	"The factors affecting the modern decline in fertility in the Netherlands are explored using data from censuses from 1930 to 1971 and additional unpublished sources. Particular attention is paid to the influence of religion, socioeconomic status, and region. The author concludes that ""a theory formulated by Lesthaeghe and Wilson on the relation between modes of production and secularization and the pace of fertility decline in Western Europe offers--in combination with van Heek's views on the special position of Dutch Roman Catholicism--a starting point for an explanation of why the fertility decline of Roman Catholics, self-employed and agricultural labourers lagged behind.""

19225218	0	a	OBJECTIVES: Studies have shown that interpersonal relations at work are important for several health related outcomes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether low social support, serious conflict, exclusion by superiors or by co-workers at work may be determinants of depression. METHODS: In a representative Swedish cohort study data were obtained in two waves three years apart. 4,040 women and men who did not change their jobs between the waves were chosen for the study. Exposure and confounders were obtained at Time 1 and outcome, depression according to Bech's MDI at Time 2. Previous depression was controlled for by adjusting for depression at Time 1. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Odds-ratios adjusted for possible confounders and depression at base-line showed significant effects for all four exposures on depression (adjusted OR, low social support 1.5 CI 95% 1.1-2.0, serious conflict 1.4 CI 95% 1.1-1.9, exclusion by superiors 1.6 CI 95% 1.2-2.1 and exclusion by co-workers 1.7 CI 95% 1.2-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: The present results support the conclusion that problematic interpersonal relationships at work can be determinants of depression. These prospective findings may be of relevance for prevention and when rehabilitating depressed patients.
18477747	0	a	"BACKGROUND: This paper analyses gender inequalities in health status and in social determinants of health among the elderly in western Europe. METHODS: Data came from the first wave of the ""Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe"" (2004). For the purposes of this study a subsample of community-residing people aged 65-85 years with no paid work was selected (4218 men and 5007 women). Multiple logistic regression models separated by sex and adjusted for age and country were fitted. RESULTS: Women were more likely to report poor health status, limitations in mobility and poor mental health. Whereas in both sexes educational attainment was associated with the three health indicators, household income was only related to poor self-rated health among women. The relationship between living arrangements and health differed by gender and was primarily associated with poor mental health. In both sexes, not living with their partner but living with other people and being the household head was related to poor mental health status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.14; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.14 for men and aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.72 for women). In addition, women living with their partner and other(s) and those living alone were more likely to report poor mental health status (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.41 and aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities persist among the elderly. Women have poorer health status than men and in both sexes the risk of poor health status increases among those with low educational attainment. Living arrangements are primarily associated with poor mental health status with patterns that differ by gender."
3559184	1	a	Burnout among hospital-based nurses appears to be a serious problem affecting the delivery of health care. Findings from previous empirical research indicate that burnout among these nurses results from reactions to adversities inherent in the hospital work environment, and that burnout can lead nurses to change jobs and/or abandon the practice of nursing. This paper presents and discusses research findings on the effects of various aspects of the hospital work environment on burnout among nurses, and, in addition, evaluates the effects of social support in reducing and/or mitigating the relationship between negative aspects of the work environment and burnout. A multiple regression approach is employed to test the hypothesized model. The data were collected from a sample of nurses (n = 310) employed at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (FAMC), Aurora, Colorado. The major determinants of burnout were found to be low job enhancement (autonomy, task orientation, clarity, innovation, and physical comfort); work pressure; and lack of supervisor support, along with the interaction term involving the combined effects of job enhancement and supervisor support. These predictors, in conjunction with demographic and job-related variables explained 53% of the variance in emotional exhaustion, a central component of the burnout syndrome.
7362431	1	a	We present a cross-cultural exploration of the interrelationships among six concepts: achievement (ie, cultural attainment), aggression, psychological distress, competition, interpersonal intensity (strength of passionate attachments), and social synergy (patterned behavior that simultaneously benefits both individual and society). Of interest is the proposition that levels of achievement, aggression, and psychological distress are partly determined by corresponding levels of competition and interpersonal intensity; however, in the presence of high levels of social synergy, aggression and psychological distress are lowered without affecting the level of achievement. We have tested the implied linear relationships, using blind ratings (of five variables assessed from ethnographic extracts) obtained from ten cross-cultural scholars, and a Social Development Index (from Tatje and Naroll) to indicate achievement. A sample of 58 societies was employed in correlation and multivariate analysis of variance.
6699384	1	a	Data from an Australian survey of 1,050 elderly men and women were analyzed with regard to sex differences in life satisfaction and its determinants. Men and women had very similar levels of education, health, financial satisfaction, subjective social integration, and morale. Little difference between sexes was found in the causal process determining life satisfaction. There was little or no interaction between sex and the other variables examined.
3481909	1	a	Problems with current definitions of mental retardation were recognized. Classification systems based on the behavioral capabilities of retarded persons were criticized since there are so many noncognitive determinants of performance. It was proposed that mental retardation be defined solely by IQ scores at least 2 SDs below the population mean. This suggestion was predicated on the view that the behavioral sciences currently have no better way to assess intellectual functioning. Etiology was seen as such a significant predictor of group differences that the organic, familial, and undifferentiated categories would be used in classification. Social adaptation and expected performance were seen as correlates of class membership rather than defining features of retardation, since they have no reliable method of measurement. Problems of labeling were discussed, but the practice was deemed useful if it leads to beneficial services and interventions.
6887077	1	a	This report, which is one of a series, is concerned with socio-demographic correlates of self-referral, and the extent to which the observed associations can be explained by variations in symptom prevalence and severity. Social class, marital status, employment status, and distance from health centre, all show small but significant associations with self-referral. For social class the effect appears to be mediated by symptoms. People in social classes IV and V, women who are widowed, divorced or separated, and people who live near the health centre are more likely to visit their general practitioner.

15778630	0	a	This study examined the relationship between early childhood caries (ECC) and measures of socioeconomic status as environmental determinants of oral health inequalities. Dental caries and quality of oral hygiene were reported on 384 young inner-city children (24-35 months) by clinical examination. Early childhood caries was diagnosed in 18.5% of children. Ethnicity (P < 0.001) and neighborhood (P < 0.001) were the social variables significantly predictive of ECC in a logistic regression model. Living in a deprived neighborhood and the mother being of East European descent were the social variables with strongest association with ECC. These variables can be considered adequate criteria to identify groups at risk within the overall population.
3324357	1	a	Potential sociomedical research contributions to the understanding of genital chlamydial infections are outlined in a six-part sociomedical 'checklist'. Sociomedical research focuses on human behavior and its social, economic, cultural, and psychological determinants. Thus, the author urges sociomedical researchers--primarily medical sociologists, medical anthropologists, social psychologists, and public health economists--to explore the cultural, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors contributing to the current 'epidemic' of genital chlamydial infection, a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is found worldwide and has now supplanted gonorrhea as the most common STD in the industrialized nations. Control of this STD is particularly important because of its grave consequences for women's and maternal/child health; these include ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and neonatal morbidity. Before effective prevention and control programs can be realized, however, beliefs and behaviors surrounding such areas as sexuality, fertility, contraception, STDs, hygiene, and health care must be discerned for widely based populations in both industrialized and nonindustrialized nations.
11428201	0	a	OBJECTIVE: Data from two consecutive households surveys undertaken in mid-80s and mid-90s allow to characterize and analyse secular trends in infant and child anaemia in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The two surveys included random population samples aged from zero to 59 months (1,016 in the period of 1984-85 and 1,280 in 1995-96). Capillary blood samples, collected by digital puncture in the two surveys, were analysed regarding their haemoglobin concentration. The anaemic status was determined when haemoglobin concentration was below 11 g/dL. For each survey, the study of the social distribution of child anaemia took into account tertiles of the per capita family income. For the study of the determinants of secular trends, hierarchical causal models, multivariate regression analyses and calculations analogous to the ones used to assess population attributable risks were applied. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In the time span from the first to the second survey, there was a significant reduction in the average haemoglobin concentration (from 11.6 g/dl to 11.0 g/dl), as well as a considerable increase in anaemia prevalence (from 35.6% to 46.9%). Unfavourable trends were observed in both sexes, all age groups and all income strata. Trends were still less favourable among the poorest families, aggravating the social burden related to child anaemia. Changes in distal (family income and maternal schooling) and proximal determinants (breast or bottle-feeding) of child anaemia were positive in the study period and therefore they cannot explain the increase in the disease. A low iron diet could explain the high prevalence of anaemia in both surveys but could not explain its further increase.
11456342	0	a	The focus of this paper is caries in populations. Caries is assessed as a phenomenon and as it occurs in populations. It is observed that in recent literature the notion of causation of caries is restricted to the biological process on the tooth surface. This may be sufficient to explain caries as a phenomenon, but it is argued that a biological causation is insufficient in order to understand caries and its variation in populations. The understanding of the determinants of a population's oral health has been seriously impeded by the absence of a theoretical framework. A framework would be useful to the extent that it would bridge relevant categories for portraying complex causal patterns of caries in populations. An approach to a framework has therefore been outlined, and the idea of such a framework has been confronted with three critical comments. The framework is as yet pragmatic, incomplete, uncertain and fragmented. Yet, even such an approach may invite greater precision in epidemiological concepts about causes of caries than presently prevails. The framework directs attention to health effects of collective phenomena that cannot be reduced to individual attributes. The image proposed in this paper is intended to spur discussion about important aspects of the epidemiology of caries in populations.
