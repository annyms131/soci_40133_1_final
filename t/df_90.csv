12285890,[Determinants of mortality].,"""In this article determinants of mortality [in the Netherlands] are studied.... The main results are the following: For all ages women have lower mortality risks than men.... Married people live longer than those who are not. However, the cause is not certain.... In large cities mortality rates are higher than in small towns (especially due to diseases of the lungs and to narcotics, alcohol and violent causes of death). People with a high socio-economic status have lower mortality risks than those with a low status.""

10336022,The epidemiology of multiple births.,"On the basis of MEDLINE and manual searches, we examined the main papers in the English literature regarding risk factors for spontaneous (i.e. not related to fertility drug use) multiple births. The constant frequency of monozygotic (MZ) pregnancies over time and in different geographical areas suggests that the determination of MZ twins is largely unchanged over time, and that a genetic mechanism may have a role. In contrast, temporal and geographical trends observed in dizygotic (DZ) pregnancies suggest that environmental factors play a role in determining this condition. At present, maternal age and hereditary components are the best-defined determinants for spontaneous multiple births.",Human reproduction update,1999 Mar-Apr,England,1999,90
1653287,Alcohol and blood pressure and its interaction with smoking and other behavioural variables: results from the MONICA Augsburg Survey 1984-1985.,"Data from the Augsburg Survey 1984-1985 of the WHO-project Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA), a cross-sectional study on a two-stage cluster sample (n = 5312) of the 25-64-year-old population of the Augsburg study area, were analyzed with regard to alcohol consumption and blood pressure. Putative confounders such as age, body mass index, smoking, sporting activity and educational attainment were controlled for by multiple regression analyses. The main effect models showed that men aged 25-64 years consuming greater than or equal to 80 g alcohol per day had, on average, 3-11 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) values and 2-6 mmHg higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values compared with non-drinkers. Women consuming greater than or equal to 40 g alcohol per day showed consistently higher SBP (2-6 mmHg) and DBP (1-5 mmHg) values compared with non-drinkers. In the group aged 55-64 years, no clear relationship was seen for SBP or DBP in men or women. Multiple regression models, allowing for interactions between alcohol consumption and the four behavioural variables: smoking, sporting activity; coffee consumption; and type A/B behaviour, showed a consistent interaction between alcohol consumption and smoking in men and women. Smoking modified the effect of alcohol on SBP and DBP in men by 2-8 mmHg and in women by 1-14 mmHg. These findings confirm those obtained for women in previous studies in Munich and Lubeck. Interactions between alcohol and sporting activity, coffee consumption and type A/B behaviour are less consistent.",Journal of hypertension,1991 Jun,England,1991,90
2394919,Determinants of interpersonal support and self-direction in group residential facilities.,"This study examined the determinants of residents' and staff's judgments of interpersonal support and self-direction in group residential facilities for older people. The Multiphasic Environmental Assessment Procedure (MEAP) was used to assess social climate dimensions and their determinants in a national sample of 244 facilities. Residents saw more interpersonal support and self-direction in facilities with more physical resources (comfort and staff facilities) and policies providing more autonomy. A similar pattern was found for staff's perceptions of self-direction. Residents and staff also viewed facilities as providing more interpersonal support and self-direction when residents were more socially competent. Larger facility size was associated with residents' assessments of more conflict, and a higher staff-resident ratio was related to residents' judgments of having less independence and influence. These findings may help to improve residential facilities by suggesting factors that can be targeted in interventions to improve the social climate.",Journal of gerontology,1990 Sep,United States,1990,90
8126717,"Effects of environmental demands, stress, and mood on health practices.","The present study examined how environmental demands, stress, and positive and negative affect were related to health practices. College undergraduates (N = 79) completed measures of stress, mood, and health practices during periods of low and high academic demands. Positive affect was positively related to exercise, nutrition, self-care practices, and overall health practices at two measurement points. Levels of stress (daily hassles, perceived stress, academic stress) increased over time, but increases in daily hassles and perceived stress were unrelated to health practices. Increases in academic demands completed in the previous week were associated with improvements in nutrition and self-care practices, greater drug avoidance, and greater overall health practices. This pattern indicates that a ""rebound effect"" may occur after high demand periods, during which individuals engage in more health-promoting activities. The results also suggest that the determinants of positive health practices may differ from those of negative health practices.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1993 Dec,United States,1993,90
7949275,[Development of a perceived social support scale: for a Japanese population].,"Social support is increasingly attracting interest in as a factor in epidemiological research of disease risks. However, at present, few methods for measuring social support that can be credited as having reliability and validity exist in Japan. Therefore a perceived social support scale was developed in relation to a population study of a town in Fukuoka prefecture. A method for measuring functional support from several external sources was designed consisting of a self-administered test provided with only two available response options--yes & no. Pretests were conducted twice in order to evaluate content validity and adjust the number of determinants and resulted in spouse, family members, and friends being selected to be primary sources of support. A factor analysis was applied to select 10 conditions with high internal consistency for each of the sources. Responses were scored 0 or 1, for 'no' or 'yes,' respectively. Subsequently each set of 10 variables was summed into an index ranking social support conditions for each of the three sources. The three highest ranking indicators from each of the respective sources were then integrated into a single comprehensive total social support score of the individuals. The inquiry method was applied on 277 adults, aged from 40 to 69 years, in the town. Intercorrelation between the indicators of support derived from the three sources was low and coefficients of reliability ranged from 0.892 to 0.978. The score of each set of the 10 variables were incorporated into a principal components analysis in order to determine factorial validity. All of the first factor loadings of the items measuring support from both spouse and family were greater than 0.7 and high eigenvalues were obtained. Therefore the methods applied to spouse and family were considered adequate to measure a given construct. The items measuring support from friends were divided into two factors, emotional support and tangible support.",[Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health,1994 Oct,Japan,1994,90
8173825,Culture and schizophrenia: the DOSMD challenge.,"The World Health Organization's International Pilot Study on Schizophrenia (IPSS) and subsequent Determinants of Outcomes of Severe Mental Disorder (DOSMD) studies have reported that the course of schizophrenia is more favourable in 'developing' than 'developed' societies. The 1992 DOSMD study attributes this difference to culture. We review studies concerning the course of schizophrenia and conclude that the evidence for a more favourable course in developing societies is not conclusive. Indeed, a favourable course has also been reported in various industrialised societies. We also raise questions about the findings reported in the recent DOSMD study, including the conclusion that the putatively more favourable course is a product of culture. Finally, we argue that longitudinal, direct observation of patients in their natural environments must be carried out before variations in the course of schizophrenia can be adequately understood.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1994 Feb,England,1994,90
1558698,Framing the construct of life satisfaction in terms of older adults' personal goals.,"Older adults' life satisfaction can be better understood in light of their personal goals. This study of 179 elders examined (a) how goals correlate with satisfaction, (b) whether elders maintain satisfaction by accommodating goals to past losses, and (c) how correlations between satisfaction and key predictors differ among groups with different goals. Satisfaction was related positively to social maintenance and energetic life-style goals and negatively to concerns for improvement, disengagement, stability, and reduced activity. Past losses were correlated with current goals but not with satisfaction, consistent with the notion of accommodation. A cluster analysis identified 5 patterns of goals: high demand, age prescribed, self-focused, socially engaged, and low demand. Correlations between satisfaction and other predictors differed by cluster, suggesting that the determinants of elders' satisfaction depend on personal goals.",Psychology and aging,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90
9541065,"Wealth, equity and health care: a critique of a ""population health"" perspective on the determinants of health. Critical Social Science Group.","In this paper we examine the recent ascendancy of a ""population health"" perspective on the ""determinants of health"" in health policy circles as conceptualized by health economists and social epidemiologists such as Evans and Stoddart [Evans and Stoddart (1990) Producing health, consuming health care. Social Science & Medicine 31(12), 1347 1363]. Their view, that the financing of health care systems may actually be deleterious for the health status of populations by drawing attention away from the (economic) determinants of health, has arguably become the ""core"" of the discourse of ""population health"". While applauding the efforts of these and other members of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research for ""pushing the envelope"", we nevertheless have misgivings about their conceptualization of both the ""problem"" and its ""solutions"", as well as about the implications of their perspective for policy. From our critique, we build an alternative point of view based on a political economy perspective. We point out that Evans and Stoddart's evidence is open to alternative interpretations--and, in fact, that their conclusions regarding the importance of wealth creation do not directly reflect the evidence presented, and are indicative of an oversimplified link between wealth and health. Their view also lacks an explicit substantive theory of society and of social change, and provides convenient cover for those who wish to dismantle the welfare state in the name of deficit reduction. Our alternative to the ""provider dominance"" theory of Evans and Stoddart and colleagues stresses that the factors or forces producing health status, which Evans and Stoddart describe, are contained within a larger whole (advanced industrial capitalism) which gives the parts their character and shapes their interrelationships. We contend that this alternative view better explains both how we arrived at a situation in which health care systems are as costly or extensive as they are, and suggests different policy avenues to those enunciated by Evans, Stoddart and their confreres.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Apr,England,1998,90

9216030,Levels and determinants of gynecological morbidity in a district of south India.,"This article presents the results of an assessment of gynecological morbidity among 385 women with young children residing in a district of Karnataka State, South India. All three main modes of assessment (clinical examination, laboratory tests, and self-reports) reveal a high burden of reproductive tract infections. The two most common conditions, identified by laboratory tests, were bacterial vaginosis and mucopurulent cervicitis. Approximately one-fourth of the women had clinical evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical ectopy, and fistula. The contribution of sexually transmitted diseases to overall gynecological morbidity appears to be relatively modest; 10 percent were so diagnosed. Associated conditions of anemia and chronic energy deficiency were common. Severe anemia was found in 17 percent of cases and severe chronic energy deficiency in 12 percent. These results indicate that radical improvements in women's health in India will require far more than the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract infections.",Studies in family planning,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90
9446197,[Dependency: possible risk or inevitable outcome?].,"This is the burning issue of the hour. In attempting to resolve it within the context of advanced age, it is important to clarify the meaning of the words involved: Independence and autonomy are far from being synonyms. Independence refers to the ability to perform physical activities of daily living (bathing, eating, preparing meals, shopping, money management), whereas the second word, autonomy, refers more to the ability to make decisions, to reason, to express an appropriate opinion in a given situation. Hazard and inevitability are totally at variance. Hazard implies the likelihood of occurrence of an event harmful to health, or to the length or quality of life. Hazard is more or less predictable, whereas inevitability is the expression of a supernatural power controlling all events. To find out whether ""dependency is a hazard or an inevitability"", it is necessary to conduct a historical review of the extension in human longevity and in particular of the current ""weight"" of aging both on individuals and on society at large. In Geneva, the proportion of the over 65-year-olds grew from 5.1 percent in 1880 to 13.4 percent in 1990. During that time, the gain in life expectancy was 52.4 percent for Geneva males of 80 years of age and 93 percent for Geneva females of the same age. This drastic change in age groups was coupled with a noteworthy change in household sizes. In 1860, the number of persons per household was 4.5. In 1990, it was down to 2.2. Conversely, the number of inmates in Geneva's medico-social institutions went up from 649 to 1168 between 1982 and 1992. In this socio-economic and cultural perspective, the concept of ""globality of the individual"" throughout his lifetime explains: age-related physiological changes; the long-term repercussion of physical, professional or leisure activities; the consequences of the accumulation of such varied risk factors as overweight or its opposite, malnutrition, tobacco or stress. Such frailty caused by aging is an ideal breeding ground for disease. For now, what matters most is the functional consequence of disease. Is the disease acute or chronic? Two out of three deaths result from a chronic disease, which caused loss of function by organs (impairment), loss of function by the subject himself (disability) or loss of function by the individual in society (social handicap or disadvantage). Raising the question ""Dependency: a hazard or an inevitability?"" boils down to asking oneself about the place of disease in our society and its determinants, and about all aspects of medicine and especially of prevention. When detected, a susceptibility brings into play primary prevention, aimed at averting the onset of the disease. After a disease has set in, measures to prevent recurrence, or secondary prevention, are required. Lastly, prevention of dependency and of loss of autonomy is part of tertiary prevention. Except for violent traumatic accidents, the formulation of the above concepts proves that dependency is essentially ""a hazard"". Therefore, let us anticipate!",Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,1997 Oct 25,Switzerland,1997,90
9103325,Consumption of fruit and vegetables: how to motivate the population to change their behavior.,"This study reports the discrepancy between two methods to assess fruit and vegetable consumption in a Dutch adult population (N = 367). The consumption of fruit and vegetables was assessed by using a food frequency method (the number of grams of fruit and vegetables subjects ate every day) and by assessing subjects' own estimates of their fruit and vegetable intake. Besides the behavior, intention and determinants were measured using a theoretical model including attitude, self-efficacy and social influence to eat fruit and vegetables. Results showed that there were large differences between the self-rated and estimated objective consumption of fruit and vegetables. Subjects rated their own intake as much higher than their estimated actual intake. Furthermore, multiple regression analyses showed that the determinants predicted the self-rated consumption much better than the estimated consumption.",Cancer letters,1997 Mar 19,Ireland,1997,90

A fat consumption score (FCS) was constructed from the qualitative method, and it correlated significantly with the dietary polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids (P/S) ratio calculated from the quantitative method (r = -0.48; p less than 0.001). Differences in FCS were then studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. In both men and women, FCS was higher in Charleroi than in Ghent. In men, FCS was inversely related with educational level and with age. In women, significant correlations were observed with marital status. No differences were found in FCS by smoking behaviour. With the coronary risk factors, low-order relationships were found, but only in men. In the middle-aged group, significant correlations were found between FCS and the fatty acid composition of the serum cholesteryl esters, in particular with the linoleate/oleate ratio.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1990,France,1990,90
7920876,Determinants of body mass index: a study from northern Italy.,"Overweight and obesity are associated with increased mortality and morbidity, and human weight is influenced by multiple factors, both genetically and environmentally determined. We investigated the influence of some socioeconomic, behavioral, dietary and reproductive factors on body mass index (BMI). Data were obtained from a comparison group of a case-control study of gastrointestinal cancers from the four largest teaching and general hospitals in Milan, northern Italy. The subjects were 1,188 men and 832 women admitted between January 1985 and June 1992 to the hospitals under study for diseases other than malignant or digestive and not known or suspected to be related to alcohol or tobacco. The following were measured: BMI (Quetelet's index, weight, kg/height, m2) and the corresponding standard errors (s.e.) in strata of selected variables, linear regression coefficients (beta) and correlation coefficients between BMI and each variable. Mean BMI increased with age until 35-44 years in men and 45-54 years in women. In both sexes BMI was inversely associated with education and social class. Smokers tended to be leaner than non-smokers, but no consistent trend was observed with increasing numbers of cigarettes. Alcohol drinkers had mean BMI similar to non-drinkers, except heavy drinking women who were lighter. BMI was not significantly associated with coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, bread, vegetable and fruit consumption. No relation was observed between total estimated caloric intake and BMI. In women BMI was directly associated with marriage and number of children, and inversely with oral contraceptive use.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1994 Jul,England,1994,90
10605253,"[Socioeconomic inequalities in health in the Tuscany Longitudinal Study (SLTO): persistence and changes over time in overall mortality and selected causes (lung cancer, liver cirrhosis, AIDS and overdose)].","We evaluate the persistence of social inequalities in overall mortality or mortality by causes (lung cancer, liver cirrhosis; AIDS and overdose) in the Tuscany Longitudinal Study (SLTo), a record linkage-study on the census population identified at the 1981 and 1991 censuses in Leghorn (1981: 175,741 subjects; 1991: 167,512 subjects), and 1991 in Florence (403,294 subjects), Central Italy. The census data allow an evaluation of socio-economic status of each subject, using variables such as education or occupation, or constructing indexes inclusive of deprivation indexes. Follow-up is from the census up to 1995 and for specific causes of death from 1987 (Leghorn) or 1991 (Florence). Estimates of risk are computed comparing rates of mortality among socio-economic groups, by means of poisson regression models, or by means of Standardized Mortality Ratios using the indirect method. The causes of deaths have been selected mainly because explained by known and strong determinants. As far as overall mortality, the results suggest the persistence of gradients by social class, more often negative among males. Mortality from lung cancer has a strong negative social class gradient among males, and a divergent gradient among women in the two towns, which is interpreted as the effect of a different prevalence of smoking by period, social class and sex. High RRs among lower socio-economic groups have been detected for liver cirrhosis mortality. Excess mortality of AIDS and overdose, an expression of the recent drug crisis, concentrates on the lower social strata and in young adults. Whereas mortality from AIDS has been detected among both sexes, deaths from overdose are occurring among males only. Being AIDS and overdose recent diseases, they stress the persistence of social inequalities over time.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,1999 Jul-Sep,Italy,1999,90

2212095,Pre-diagnostic symptom recognition and help seeking among cancer patients.,"Failure to recognize symptoms which signal cancer may delay contact with the medical care system, thus decreasing the chances of diagnosis at an early stage of disease. We investigated the determinants of cancer symptom recognition and delay in seeking medical care in a population-based sample of 625 newly diagnosed lung, breast and colorectal cancer patients. Although the majority (79.5%) of patients reported noticing symptoms prior to diagnosis, one quarter of these patients (24.7%) delayed longer than three months in seeking medical care. Contrary to the findings of research based on clinic samples, logistic regression analysis revealed that no demographic or social support factors were predictive of symptom recognition or delay, with the exception that older colorectal cancer patients were less likely to notice symptoms, but also less likely to delay. Lung and colorectal patients diagnosed with advanced disease were more likely to notice symptoms than patients with local disease. Results of a content analysis of patients' remarks indicate that breast cancer patients were significantly more likely than lung or colorectal cancer patients to attribute their symptoms to cancer (p less than .001). Symptoms common to lung and colorectal cancer appear to be attributed to other, less serious causes. Given the lack of demographic predictors of symptom recognition and delay in seeking care, we suggest that education programs address risk groups for specific cancers, rather than the general public as a whole, grouping together all cancers and cancer symptomatology.",Journal of community health,1990 Aug,Netherlands,1990,90
7694219,Investigation of antigenic determinants in thyroid peroxidase by synthesis of possible sequential peptides.,"One way to locate antigenic determinants in thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is to evaluate the binding of chemically synthesized peptides to autoantibodies. A major epitope of TPO involved in thyroid autoimmunity has been reported to be at residues 590 to 675. Therefore, we synthesized three peptides (P1, residues 603-610; P2, 615-630; and P3, 654-665) in the most antigenic part of this range, as judged by antigenicity analysis, and measured their antigenicity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Amino groups protected with fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl were used in the synthesis. Sera from 42 untreated patients with Hashimoto's disease and 30 untreated patients with Graves' disease were tested for binding with each peptide. In addition, 6 sera with antibodies against denatured and reduced microsomal antigen were tested. Sera obtained from 22 normal subjects were used as a control. Binding of sera from the patients with autoimmune thyroid disease to the synthetic peptides was weak, about 1% of binding to thyroid microsomes prepared from Graves' thyroid. However, the ELISA index of a mixture of P1, P2, and P3 was significantly higher in the patients with Hashimoto's disease than in the healthy subjects. For both P2 and P3, the ELISA index of the sera with antibodies against denatured and reduced TPO was higher than that of the sera from normal subjects. These results suggested 1) that the antigenic epitopes of TPO recognized by autoantibodies may be conformational and discontinuous, and 2) that antibodies against these linear portions of TPO may exist in patients with Hashimoto's disease.",Osaka city medical journal,1993 Jun,Japan,1993,90
8500469,Job design and job stress in office workers.,"A model to look at various job components that affect individual well-being and health was developed drawing from the job design and job stress literature. Briefly stated, the model proposes job control to be a primary causal determinant of the stress outcomes. The effects of perceived demands, job content, and career/future concerns were hypothesized to influence the stress outcomes only to the extent of their influence on job control. This was tested in a population of government office employees in various clerical, professional, and managerial jobs all of which involve the use of computers. Results indicated that job control was not a crucial determinant of the stress outcomes, that job demands and career/future concerns were consistent determinants of the stress outcomes, and that job content, demands, and career/future concerns did not influence the stress outcomes through job control as described by the proposed model. The differentiation of job control levels to define specific relationships with stress outcomes and other job elements was shown to be useful because different levels of job control were associated with different stress outcomes and job elements.",Ergonomics,1993 May,England,1993,90
10681885,Epidemiology of socioeconomic status and health: are determinants within countries the same as between countries?,"Within societies, health and ill-health follow a social gradient: lower socioeconomic position, worse health. The slope of the gradient has varied over time. It is likely that social and economic circumstances play a role in this changing slope. Within Europe, differences in health between East and West have also varied in magnitude. The advantage in the West increased through the 1970s and 1980s. Although similar in their health trends up to 1989, the countries of central and eastern Europe have diverged quite sharply subsequently. It is again likely that changing social and economic fortunes account for these trends.

8115345,Determinants of exercise in children.,"BACKGROUND: The recognition that children are surprisingly inactive and that lifetime health beliefs and behavior patterns are formed in childhood has emphasized the need to examine the acquisition of exercise behavior in children. Although research has shown social learning theory variables to be relevant to the study of exercise determinants in an adult population, there has been little study done with child populations. The purpose of the present study was to explore the factors that may influence a child's level of physical activity. METHODS: Two hundred forty-two 5th- and 6th-grade children and their mothers were interviewed. It was hypothesized that several social learning variables would exert a particularly strong influence on level of physical activity of children. RESULTS: Regression analysis results indicated that salient predictor variables for boys included enjoyment of physical activity, friend and family support for physical activity, mother's perceived barriers to exercise, and mother's perceived family support for exercise. For girls, the salient predictor variables included enjoyment of physical activity, number of exercise-related items at home, mother's perceived family support for physical activity, mother's perceived barriers to exercise, and direct parental modeling of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that social learning variables may be important correlates of physical activity in children.",Preventive medicine,1993 Nov,United States,1993,90

A case-control study.,"This case-control study (n = 100 dental patients, matched for age and sex) investigated the role of life-events in periodontitis. Data collected included life events, tobacco use, oral health behaviours and socio-demographics. The results of conditional simple logistic regression analysis showed that periodontitis was associated with the negative impact of life-events (p < 0.01), the number of negative life-events (p < 0.05), high levels of dental plaque (p < 0.01), tobacco smoking (p < 0.01) and being unemployed (p < 0.05). These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for oral health behaviour and socio-demographic variables, but not tobacco smoking (p > 0.05). Marital status became statistically significant after adjusting for the other variables (p < 0.05). A model is suggested to explain the pathways through which life events may affect periodontal health. It was concluded that psychosocial factors and oral health risk behaviours cluster together as important determinants of periodontitis.",Journal of clinical periodontology,1997 Jan,United States,1997,90

METHOD: The study is based on an empirical analysis of all psychiatric in-patient completed episodes in England in 1991/92. Any index of need should be independent of the effect of variations in health care supply on the use of psychiatric services. In order to disentangle the influences of supply from social and clinical determinants of utilisation, two stage least squares regression and multilevel modelling techniques were used. RESULTS: The outcome was an index comprising six health and socio-economic variables. This is now being used by the NHS Executive to distribute about pound 2.2 billion of annual NHS expenditure for psychiatric services between English health authorities. CONCLUSION: It is shown that the index is much more sensitive to needs and therefore more redistributive than the previous index of need used in the NHS.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1996 Sep,England,1996,90

Deliveries took place in either a nursery (n = 58) or a rooming-in (n = 107) public hospital where formula supplementation was not allowed. Multivariate analyses indicated that at 1 week full breastfeeding was associated (P < or = 0.05) with early milk arrival, social support for full breastfeeding and planned breastfeeding duration. At 2 months, full breastfeeding was associated with social support for full breastfeeding and early milk arrival. Breastfeeding was positively associated with early milk arrival and inversely associated with early introduction of supplementary bottles, maternal employment, maternal body mass index and infant age. At 4 months, full breastfeeding was positively associated with social support for full breastfeeding and inversely associated with infant age. Breastfeeding was positively associated with planned breastfeeding duration and inversely associated with early introduction of a bottle and urban background. Rooming-in mothers reported that their milk came in earlier (P < or = 0.05) than did the nursery group. Milk arrival was later when a bottle was introduced in the first week; both of these variables might be important in explaining a positive effect of rooming-in on lactation performance.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Oct,England,1993,90

12319653,"Internal migration, earnings, and the importance of self-selection.","This paper analyzes the impact of internal migration on earnings within the human capital model framework. Since migrants constitute a non-random sample of population, the endogenous nature of migration decision warrants necessary correction for the selectivity bias in their earnings function. The Mincer-type earnings model is thus augmented to determine the extent of this bias. Besides estimating the standard Mincerian earnings model, the paper also attempts to verify the learn-as-you-go proposition by introducing migration duration variables in the earnings model. Based on the household level Population, Labor Force, and Migration (1979-80) survey data, the analysis yields the following important conclusions: (i) the data allowed a meaningful estimation of Mincerian earnings function for migrants and non-migrants; (ii) the level of schooling was one of the important determinants of the distribution of income both for migrants and nonmigrants--the four categorical variables of education were in general statistically significant with expected signs, implying that the hypothesis of a positive relationship between income and education was accepted; (iii) the rates of return to education improved systematically with higher levels of education, thus confirming the notion that education serves as a signalling device; (iv) the age-income profile was almost linear for migrants but showed concavity for nonmigrants; (v) the presence of sample-selection was observed for migrants; and (vi) even after controlling for the influence of personal characteristics, i.e., education and experience, the long-standing migrants earned relatively more at the destination than the more recent migrants.",Pakistan development review,1994 Autumn,Pakistan,1994,90
10429746,Gender differences in chronic disease risk behaviors through the transition out of high school.,"BACKGROUND: Major life transitions (e.g., graduation from high school) are times when many changes occur in a person's social and physical environment. Men and women likely experience aspects of these changes differently. As a result, health-related behaviors likely change at these times with possible differences in these changes by gender. METHODS: Gender differences in the performance of chronic disease risk-related behaviors (fruit, juice, and vegetable intake; physical activity; tobacco and alcohol use; and sexual practices) through the transition out of high school (HS) were assessed in a secondary analysis of a nationally representative sample from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey-Youth Risk Behavior Survey. The survey was completed by 5881 young people aged 14 to 21 years. Regression discontinuity analysis with piecewise regression was performed. RESULTS: Statistically significant gender by transition effects were obtained for exercise/physical activity (decreases at the transition point for males), snuff use (decrease for females in HS), binge drinking and number of days drinking alcohol (increases for males at the transition point), and use of alcohol or drugs before sexual intercourse (decrease for females post HS). Fruit intake decreased for males and females and daily and heavy cigarette smoking increased during the HS years. Effect sizes were small but promising, given that the data set was not designed to test this hypothesis. CONCLUSION: These data offer evidence of differences by gender in chronic disease risk behaviors through the HS transition. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess the true nature of these differences, the tracking of these risk behaviors and their personal, social, and environmental determinants, including gender-specific determinants, that may explain these changes and inform future intervention development.",American journal of preventive medicine,1999 Jul,Netherlands,1999,90
1458861,The chronic disease data bank model: a conceptual framework for the computer-based medical record.,"The principles underlying the chronic disease data bank model are straight-forward: (1) the purpose of medical care is to improve patient outcomes; (2) patient outcomes in contemporary developed societies are overwhelmingly linked to chronic illnesses and degenerative processes and will become increasingly so; (3) such outcomes have multiple determinants including the psychological and social, as well as the biologic; (4) outcome antecedents (risk factors) may precede clinical illness by years or decades; and (5) these complex characteristics require for their study (a) computer aid and (b) longitudinal data. The chronic disease data bank provides an important resource, available to many investigators, for examination of the complex set of clinical and policy questions arising with long-term illness and addressing the questions of lifetime health. The chronic disease data bank consecutively enrolls eligible subjects, follows them for life, and amasses time-oriented, multidisciplinary data including clinical findings, medical history, demographics, treatments, resource utilization and disease outcomes, and assessing both the quality of life and its duration. Analyses are longitudinal and time-series in type, examining changes in trends and tempo of the disease, and are focused upon long-term outcomes. Outcomes are regularly and carefully assessed, and include the outcome dimensions of death, disability, discomfort, iatrogenic toxicity, and dollar cost. Specific studies address the description of the disease from biologic, demographic, economic, and social viewpoints, identify the factors associated with good and bad outcomes, and assess the effects of treatment, both good and ill. The clinical and policy goals are focused upon delaying transitions from more benign disease states to more serious ones, thus improving both longevity and the quality of life. The time is appropriate to consider generalization of the chronic disease data bank model to the usual clinical care situation, with large rewards in improvement of the quality of care. The traditional medical record lacks systematic documentation of end results and of important covariates related to health risks. As such, it cannot readily be used to assess the ultimate quality of care and to establish a feedback loop to change behaviors and thereby improve outcomes. It is weak where the chronic disease data bank is strong. The technology is transferable.","Computers and biomedical research, an international journal",1992 Dec,United States,1992,90

7932483,Sexual promiscuity: knowledge of dangers in institutions of higher learning.,"Knowledge of dangers of sexual promiscuity was assessed in 2 institutions of higher learning. The objectives were to find out the knowledge of medical and social consequences as well as the factors responsible for sexual promiscuity among Nigerian youths. The study also assessed the discrepancies in societal concept of sex norms for males and females. The result was used as an index to determine the need for sex education for Nigerian youths. A total of 200 students (100 from each school) was assessed by random selection and use of a questionnaire. The result showed that students had a fair knowledge of sexual promiscuity, although in terms of medical consequences the knowledge was low for both groups. On social consequences, the knowledge was fair for both groups. Students agreed that lack of financial support and of supervision from parents and teachers were among the causes of sexual promiscuity. Recommendations were made for Health Education in these areas in institutions of higher learning. Also, recommendations were made for parental education on how to bring up, and care for, their adolescents to reduce the problems of sexual promiscuity. It was also recommended that a compulsory course on sexual promiscuity should be included in the syllabus in institutions of higher learning.",Journal of the Royal Society of Health,1994 Jun,England,1994,90
10080364,Hierarchies and cliques in the social networks of health care professionals: implications for the design of dissemination strategies.,"Interest in how best to influence the behaviour of clinicians in the interests of both clinical and cost effectiveness has rekindled concern with the social networks of health care professionals. Ever since the seminal work of Coleman et al. [Coleman, J.S., Katz, E., Menzel, H., 1966. Medical Innovation: A Diffusion Study. Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis.], networks have been seen as important in the process by which clinicians adopt (or fail to adopt) new innovations in clinical practice. Yet very little is actually known about the social networks of clinicians in modern health care settings. This paper describes the professional social networks of two groups of health care professionals, clinical directors of medicine and directors of nursing, in hospitals in England. We focus on network density, centrality and centralisation because these characteristics have been linked to access to information, social influence and social control processes. The results show that directors of nursing are more central to their networks than clinical directors of medicine and that their networks are more hierarchical. Clinical directors of medicine tend to be embedded in much more densely connected networks which we describe as cliques. The hypotheses that the networks of directors of nursing are better adapted to gathering and disseminating information than clinical directors of medicine, but that the latter could be more potent instruments for changing, or resisting changes, in clinical behaviour, follow from a number of sociological theories. We conclude that professional socialisation and structural location are important determinants of social networks and that these factors could usefully be considered in the design of strategies to inform and influence clinicians.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Mar,England,1999,90

8991242,Management of incomplete abortion with manual vacuum aspiration in comparison to sharp metallic curette in an Ethiopian setting.,"This institution based case control study emanated from the fact that manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) has been recently introduced in Ethiopia and Gandhi Memorial hospital is currently serving as the pioneering centre. Abortion is an important everyday medicolegal, social, political and public health issue. The objectives of the study were to focus on abortion issues, to show that MVA is alternative instrument applicable in our setting and to highlight some of the determinants that can influence the choice of instruments in the management of incomplete abortions of less than 12 weeks of gestation. A total of 1896 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria underwent evacuation and curettage with MVA and SMC during the study period. The main considered variables included socio-demographic characteristics, service-providers, complications in relation to operators and method of surgery, duration of the surgery, patient pain evaluation and uterine factors. MVA is found to be equally safe, effective, simple and fast set of instruments which can be employed in the management of incomplete abortions. Integration of MVA in the medical training is recommended as it is a measure which can greatly contribute towards the reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality especially in a developing country like ours where resources are scare and alternatives are quite limited.",East African medical journal,1996 Sep,Kenya,1996,90
12320037,An economic analysis of pregnancy resolution in Virginia: specific as to race and residence.,"This study analyses an economic model of pregnancy resolution; that is, a model of the choice by a pregnant woman to abort her fetus or carry it to term. This analysis, using an analytical model derived from the household utility framework, adds to previous research by presenting race- and residence-specific estimates of how individual characteristics, history of abortion, and the community-based factors determine women's choices of giving birth vs. aborting. The main data for estimating the model were drawn from the 1984 vital statistics of all induced abortions and live births in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The major findings indicate that low parental education, high maternal age, previous early abortions, and the availability of abortion providers all significantly reduce the probability of choosing the live birth option. Married status and the availability of family planning clinics significantly increase the probability of the live birth option. The findings also suggest that women's choices between abortion and live birth vary substantially with race (White vs. Black) and residential (urban vs. rural) location.",Journal of population economics,1995,Germany,1995,90
9224176,Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years.,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the long-term association between religious attendance and mortality to determine whether the association is explained by improvements in health practices and social connections for frequent attenders. METHODS: The association between frequent attendance and mortality over 28 years for 5286 Alameda Country Study respondents was examined. Logistic regression models analyzed associations between attendance and subsequent improvements in health practices and social connections. RESULTS: Frequent attenders had lower mortality rates than infrequent attenders (relative hazard [RH] = 0.64;95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53,0.77). Results were stronger for females. Health adjustments had little impact, but adjustments for social connections and health practices reduced the relationship (RH = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.64, 0.93). During follow-up, frequent attenders were more likely to stop smoking, increase exercising, increase social contacts, and stay married. CONCLUSIONS: Lower mortality rates for frequent religious attenders are partly explained by improved health practices, increased social contacts, and more stable marriages occurring in conjunction with attendance. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have broad intervention implications.",American journal of public health,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90

Results indicated that negative relationship qualities, such as rivalry, competition, and conflict, were more closely related to younger sisters engaging in problem delinquent-like behavior and sexual behavior than were positive relationship qualities, such as warmth and closeness. Additionally, a shared friendship network with the older sister was found to be associated with extensive younger sister problem behavior and sexual behavior.

9183339,Acute stroke care and rehabilitation: an analysis of the direct cost and its clinical and social determinants. The Copenhagen Stroke Study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke represents a major economic challenge to society. The direct cost of stroke is largely determined by the duration of hospital stay, but internationally applicable estimates of the direct cost of acute stroke care and rehabilitation on cost-efficient stroke units are not available. Information regarding social and medical factors influencing the length of hospital stay (LOHS) and thereby cost is needed to direct cost-reducing efforts. METHODS: We determined the direct cost of stroke in the prospective, consecutive, and community-based stroke population of the Copenhagen Stroke Study by measuring the total LOHS in the 1197 acute stroke patients included in the study. All patients had all their acute care and rehabilitation on a dedicated stroke unit. Neurological impairment was measured by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. Local nonmedical factors affecting the LOHS, such as waiting time for discharge to a nursing home after completed rehabilitation, were accounted for in the analysis. The influence of social and medical factors on the LOHS was analyzed in a multiple linear regression model. RESULTS: The average LOHS was 27.1 days (SD, 44.1; range, 1 to 193), corresponding to a direct cost of $12.150 per patient including all acute care and rehabilitation. The LOHS increased with increasing stroke severity (6 days per 10-point increase in severity; P < .0001) and single marital status (3.4 days; P = .02). Death reduced LOHS (22.0 days; P < .0001). Age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, claudication, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, former stroke, other disabling comorbidity, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, and the type of stroke (hemorrhage/infarct) had no independent influence on LOHS. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care and rehabilitation of unselected patients on a dedicated stroke unit takes on average 4 weeks. In general, comorbidity such as diabetes or heart disease does not increase LOHS. Efforts to reduce costs should therefore aim at reducing initial stroke severity or improving the rate of recovery.",Stroke,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90

METHODS: Forty-nine studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 1984 and 1994 were reviewed and their findings coded by two independent coders. RESULTS: Findings indicate that most of the studies emphasized quantitative methodologies, using cross-sectional designs and univariate statistical analyses. Many studies lacked a theoretical framework or conceptual model to guide their investigations. When evaluating empirical findings, 61% of the studies found environmental correlates and 47% found biological factors (e.g., age and pubertal development) to be significantly associated with early initiation of sexual intercourse. CONCLUSION: These findings raise important questions about the quality of research on adolescent sexuality, as well as its relationship to the development of risk-reduction programs which tend to focus mainly on intrapersonal factors (such as attitudes, knowledge, and expectancies.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1997 Sep,United States,1997,90

Students were surveyed in schools using a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire. Analysis was carried out using both the univariate and logistic methods, aiming at a precise quantification and description of the smoking habit, as well as an identification of predictors of smoking, separately for girls and boys, and also for triers only, occasional and regular smokers. Smoking regularly increases with age and from the age of 14 becomes slightly more prevalent among girls than boys.

From the situation of the Cote d'Ivoire as observed from the period 1987-1997].,"WHO is commissioned to create the World AIDS Program and to elaborate the strategy for the fight against the AIDS pandemic. The standardised strategy for African countries developed in Geneva in 1987 favours the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV without communicating the methods for such. The external and exclusive nature of the technical intervention of WHO and the lack of its adaptation to the dynamics of the epidemic in the 90s, (increase in seroprevalence among pregnant women, increase in the number of sick and HIV infected children, and economical and social consequences of the disease) explain in part the fact that the objectives haven't been reached on the continent a decade later. It seems important to us that the national authorities take responsibility concerning the development of an integrated strategy for AIDS prevention-care that takes into account the determinants of the propagation of the virus in Africa, advocates widespread access to testing-counselling for the general population and pregnant women, provides training for all health personnel concerning care for infected people, and promotes the implementation of social mechanisms for the future and financing for care, including symptomatic treatment for opportunistic infections.","Sante publique (Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France)",1998 Jun,France,1998,90

9635219,Social context in developmental psychopathology: recommendations for future research from the MacArthur Network on Psychopathology and Development. The MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Psychopathology and Development.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that social contexts in early life have important and complex effects on childhood psychopathology. Spurred by the lack of an explicit operational definition that could guide the study of such effects, we define a social context operationally as ""a set of interpersonal conditions, relevant to a particular behavior or disorder and external to, but shaped and interpreted by, the individual child."" Building on this definition, we offer a series of recommendations for future research, based on five theoretically derived propositions: (a) Contexts are nested and multidimensional; (b) contexts broaden, differentiate, and deepen with age, becoming more specific in their effects; (c) contexts and children are mutually determining; (d) a context's meaning to the child determines its effects on the child and arises from the context's ability to provide for fundamental needs; and (e) contexts should be selected for assessment in light of specific questions or outcomes. As reflected in an increasingly rich legacy of literature on child development and psychopathology, social contexts appear to influence emerging mental disorders through dynamic, bidirectional interactions with individual children. Future research will benefit from examining not only statistical interactions between child- and context-specific factors, but also the actual transactions between children and contexts and the transduction of contextual influences into pathways of biological mediation. Because adverse contexts exert powerful effects on the mental health of children, it is important for the field to generate new, more theoretically grounded research addressing the contextual determinants of psychological well-being and disorder.",Development and psychopathology,1998 Spring,United States,1998,90
7560850,"Stress, coping, and social support processes: where are we? What next?","I review existing knowledge, unanswered questions, and new directions in research on stress, coping resource, coping strategies, and social support processes. New directions in research on stressors include examining the differing impacts of stress across a range of physical and mental health outcomes, the ""carry-overs"" of stress from one role domain or stage of life into another, the benefits derived from negative experiences, and the determinants of the meaning of stressors. Although a sense of personal control and perceived social support influence health and mental health both directly and as stress buffers, the theoretical mechanisms through which they do so still require elaboration and testing. New work suggests that coping flexibility and structural constraints on individuals' coping efforts may be important to pursue. Promising new directions in social support research include studies of the negative effects of social relationships and of support giving, mutual coping and support-giving dynamics, optimal ""matches"" between individuals' needs and support received, and properties of groups which can provide a sense of social support. Qualitative comparative analysis, optimal matching analysis, and event-structure analysis are new techniques which may help advance research in these broad topic areas. To enhance the effectiveness of coping and social support interventions, intervening mechanisms need to be better understood. Nevertheless, the policy implications of stress research are clear and are important given current interest in health care reform in the United States.",Journal of health and social behavior,1995,United States,1995,90

We draw predictions from industrialism and dependency theories for the explanation of social security programs. The explanations are tested with data on seventy-five nations, representative of core, semipheripheral and peripheral nations. Industrialization variables such as the percentage of older adults and economic productivity have strong effects in models involving all nations, as does multinational corporate (MNC) penetration in extraction, particularly when region is controlled; such penetration is negatively associated with spending on social security. We then look at industrialism and dependency effects for peripheral and non-core nations alone. The effects of all industrialization variables, except economic productivity, appear insignificant for peripheral nations, while the effects of region and multinational corporate penetration in extractive and agricultural industries appears significant.

Referent power is defined, including methods that health care professionals may use to develop and apply referent power. Expert power is defined and addressed in the context of referent power, self-esteem and self-efficacy as a means of promoting adherence. Self-efficacy as a concept is defined and explored in the context of social power. The relationships between self-efficacy and social power (expert and referent) are shown as important determinants of adherence and compliance. The theory of the application of referent and expert power in relationship with self-efficacy has been compared with an effective programme, yielding high compliance, at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, showing the theory's relevance and applicability in determining compliance. Explored are the reasons for non-compliance in the elderly population and how the theory model can remedy these detriments for compliance.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial cross-sectional studies were conducted in 1987-1988 and 1990-1991 at a centralized STD clinic in Port of Spain. A case-control study was carried out to examine in greater detail the demographic and behavioral risk factors for HIV-1 among self-declared heterosexuals in this population. RESULTS: HIV-1 prevalence increased from 3.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-3.9] in 1987-1988 to 13.6% (95% CI, 11.8-15.6) in 1990-1991.

In the case-control analysis, significant independent risk factors for men included current genital ulcer disease (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.2-12.5), current genital warts (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-12.0), having ever had syphilis (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.6-6.1), and use of crack cocaine in the preceding 6 months (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.7-14.2). Corresponding risk factors for women were commercial sex work (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.3-25.7), initiation of sexual activity before age 14 years (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.5-16.0), and past non-gonococcal cervicitis (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.3-13.1). CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 in this setting is primarily heterosexually transmitted in a milieu of unprotected sexual activity fuelled by a crack cocaine epidemic. Targeted interventions to prevent, detect and treat STD and crack cocaine addiction, as well as disrupt their adverse synergism, may substantially reduce HIV-1 transmission in this population.","AIDS (London, England)",1995 Apr,England,1995,90
16203507,The interplay of drinking patterns and other determinants of health.,"The health effects of alcohol are determined not only by level of intake but also by patterns of alcohol use and many other health determinants. This study seeks to identify groups of individuals who share various features in terms of drinking styles and other health indicators. Data used are a subset of the 1990 Ontario Health Survey, corresponding to men and women aged 20-64 with complete data in four substantive areas: alcohol use; demographic characteristics; current health status; and various behavioural risk factors for chronic disease. Cluster analysis was used to groups of male and female respondents who were similar in terms of their style of alcohol use, along with other constructs relevant to health risk and health status. For both sexes, clusters were identified which matched expectation in terms of drinking patterns and other relevant variables. For both sexes, clusters were found with generally higher social class indicators, generally positive health behaviours and health status and drinking patterns which did not include drinking to excess. Clusters were also found for which high-volume drinking occasions corresponded with poor health status and high levels of risk factors for chronic disease. Other unanticipated patterns were also identified. This information may assist in identifying confounding effects in epidemiological studies as well as identifying the characteristics of unique sub-populations which are likely to be the focus of primary prevention efforts.",Drug and alcohol review,1998 Dec,Australia,1998,90
7664962,Racial and ethnic differences in birthweight: the role of income and financial assistance.,"This paper attempts to explain the differences in birthweight observed between blacks, white Anglos, Chicanos, and other racial and ethnic groups. The analysis focuses on the role of income and financial assistance from relatives and public programs. Using data from the NLS Youth Panel, I construct a casual model of birthweight containing exogenous social and demographic risk factors and intervening proximate determinants of birthweight. A substantial part of the gap in birthweight between white Anglos and other ethnic groups (especially blacks) can be explained by the unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the latter. On the other hand, blacks and other minorities smoke less and have other favorable proximate characteristics that depress differences in birthweight. When these proximate determinants are controlled, large ethic differences in birthweight remain unexplained by income and other sociodemographic factors.",Demography,1995 May,United States,1995,90
8738633,Determinants of speech-hearing disability in King-Kopetzky syndrome.,"King-Kopetzky syndrome is characterized by auditory disability with a clinically normal hearing threshold. The main reported disability is hearing speech in the presence of background noise. The degrees of speech-hearing disability in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome have been investigated with the use of the Social Hearing Handicap Index (SHHI), and the relationships between the SHHI scores and a number of physiological, psychoacoustical and psychological factors determined in 109 patients. The significantly higher (worse) SHHI scores in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome indicate that this group suffer a considerable degree of speech-hearing disability. In our study, the main findings are that some psychological factors, performance of the sentence in noise test and auditory thresholds are significantly correlated with the SHHI scores. We were unable to find any relationships between the SHHI and frequency resolution or EOAEs. In a multiple stepwise regression, somatic anxiety and the performance of the sentence in noise test are the significant predictors of SHHI scores. These two variables appear to be the main determinants of speech-hearing disability in King-Kopetzky syndrome.",Scandinavian audiology,1996,Denmark,1996,90

8399248,Weight gain attitudes among pregnant adolescents.,"Maternal weight gain is the most important, manageable determinant of infant birth weight among adolescents. Negative attitudes toward weight gain may adversely affect maternal weight gain. We hypothesized that (a) negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain are more common among younger pregnant adolescents, and (b) negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain adversely affect adolescent maternal weight gain. The study subjects, 99, radially diverse, pregnant 13 through 18 year olds, completed the 18-item, Likert-format, Pregnancy and Weight Gain Attitude Scale. Responses to the questionnaire indicated that most (83.8%) of the adolescents we interviewed had a positive attitude toward pregnancy weight gain when they entered prenatal care. Univariate analyses revealed that attitudes toward weight gain were unrelated to the respondents' ages but inversely related to their prepregnant weights (-0.16; p = 0.06) and the severity of their symptoms of depression (r = -0.26; p = 0.004). Attitudes toward weight gain were also directly related to their family support (r = 0.17; p = 0.06). Weight gain was significantly related to 4 of the 18 scale items but not to the total attitude scale score. We conclude that (a) the developmental task of formulating a positive body image does not foster more negative attitudes toward pregnancy weight gain among younger adolescents; (b) negative weight gain attitudes are most common among heavier adolescents, depressed adolescents, and adolescents who do not perceive their families as supportive; and (c) negative weight gain attitudes could adversely affect pregnancy weight gain.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1993 Jul,United States,1993,90

An instrument for measuring childbearing motivation, the Childbearing Questionnaire (CBQ), is presented. Using a sample of 401 married couples two main scales, nine subscales, and several independent items are described. Evidence for the reliability and validity of this instrument is presented. The versatility of the CBQ as a research instrument and the usefulness of the conceptualisation from which it is derived as a way of integrating social, behavioural, and biological science approaches to childbearing motivation are discussed.",Journal of biosocial science,1995 Oct,England,1995,90
9707406,Environmental stimulation of 129/SvJ mice causes increased cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus.,"New neurons are continuously born in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus, and regulation of adult neurogenesis is influenced by both genetic and environmental determinants. Mice of the 129/SvJ strain have significantly less hippocampal neurogenesis than other inbred mouse strains [1] and do not perform well in learning tasks. Here, the impact of environmental stimuli on brain plasticity during adulthood of 129/SvJ mice was studied using 'enriched environments' where mice receive complex inanimate and social stimulation [2,3]. In contrast to our earlier reports on mice of the C57BL/6 strain - which are competent in learning tasks and in which environmental stimulation did not influence cell proliferation [4,5] - environmentally stimulated 129/SvJ mice were found to have twice as many proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus compared with mice in standard housing. Environmental stimulation fostered the survival of newborn cells in 129/SvJ mice; this effect had also been seen in C57BL/6 mice. Phenotypic analysis of the surviving cells revealed that environmental stimulation resulted in 67% more new neurons. In combination with our earlier results, these data indicate a differential impact of inheritable traits on the environmental regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition, we observed behavioral changes in environmentally stimulated 129/SvJ mice.",Current biology : CB,1998 Jul 30-Aug 13,England,1998,90
7550767,Infant mortality time series are random walks with drift: are they cointegrated with socioeconomic variables?,"Previous time series analyses of infant mortality have failed to provide evidence to support their implicit assumption that infant mortality data used behaved as a stationary time series. The present study applies the augmented Dickey Fuller Test to infant mortality time series for Sweden (1800-1989), United Kingdom (1839-1989) and United States (1915-1989). The null hypothesis that each of these series is non-stationary is accepted at standard levels of significance. A conceptual framework of infant mortality which uses a combination of physical and social overhead capital as factors in a production function is developed to explain the finding of non-stationarity as derivative from the non-stationarity of a stock of health-enhancing capital. Estimation of econometric models of the socioeconomic determinants of infant mortality using differenced data with ARIMA estimation is inconclusive. Estimation of a bivariate cointegration model supports the hypothesis that infant survival and GNP/Capita are cointegrated for 19th century Sweden but not for 19th century UK. Bivariate analysis of 20th century Sweden, UK, and US data demonstrated no cointegration. This may be due to the onset of disequilibrium in the economic determination of infant mortality in the present era as technological advances and demographic shifts began to play a larger role. Supplementing the bivariate analysis with measures of unemployment, and crude birth rate in the 20th century permitted the detection of cointegration in US and UK. The multivariate results may suggest that improvements in 20th century UK GNP/capita have had greater impact on infant survival relative to US GNP/capita.",Health economics,1995 May-Jun,England,1995,90

A cross cultural background comparison of general practitioner attitudes towards contraceptive service provision for young adolescent females in Scotland.",No previous studies have examined the influences of cultural background on the provision of contraceptive services to females under 16 years of age. A research project was undertaken to investigate any differences between general practitioners trained in the United Kingdom and those trained in the Indian sub-continent in relation to contraceptive service provision to females under 16 years of age. A self-completion postal questionnaire survey was distributed to 230 unrestricted principal general practitioners across Scotland. Subjects were identified from the Medical Register. Half of the sample consisted of all those working in Scotland who had been trained in the Indian sub-continent. The other half were a comparable group that had been trained in the United Kingdom and were selected by quasi-random quota sampling. The response rate was 57 per cent (131/230). General practitioners in the study who had trained in the Indian sub-continent were found to be significantly less likely to provide contraceptive services to a female under 16 years of age than those who had trained in the United Kingdom. Cultural background may be influential in general practitioner provision of contraceptive services to females below the legal age of consent for sexual intercourse. In order to obtain more conclusive evidence a larger study is necessary. Such investigations must be undertaken with appropriate sensitivity and social awareness.,The British journal of family planning,1998 Jul,England,1998,90
2065639,Total and domestic consumption of salt and their determinants in three regions of Italy.,"Total and domestic (discretionary) consumption of salt was assessed in a sample of 91 households, which were randomly selected in three areas of Italy characterized by different dietary habits. Total salt intake was estimated by the mean urinary sodium in four 24 h collections. Discretionary salt, added during the preparation of the meals or at the table, was assessed using a simplified protocol of the lithium marker technique. Total sodium excretion was 191 mmol/d, 160 mmol/d and 132 mmol/d in adult males, adult females and children respectively. Dietary sodium density was 15 mmol per MJ of energy in children and 19 mmol/MJ in adults. It was significantly lower in the area where the traditional consumption of unsalted bread persists. Discretionary sodium intake was 67 mmol/d in adult males and females and 43 mmol/d in children; equivalent respectively to 36 per cent, 39 per cent and 34 per cent of total sodium intake. No difference was found between urban and rural environments, whereas discretionary use of salt was higher in the lower social class. These findings have important nutrition policy implications for the lowering of salt intake in the general population.",European journal of clinical nutrition,1991 Mar,England,1991,90

DESIGN: Two closely matched subsamples of spouse carers, husbands and wives respectively, were selected and the two groups compared. SETTING: An urban psychogeriatric service in the UK. SUBJECTS: 48 spouses of referred dementia cases. MEASURES: Mental health was rated by the General Health Questionnaire, the Strain Scale and the Life Satisfaction Index. Various factors related to caregiving were assessed by the Problem Checklist, and a specially devised instrument to record caregiving task involvement, formal/informal support, objective burden, satisfaction with supports and attitudes to the relationship and to caregiving. RESULTS: The wives' levels of strain and morale were significantly worse than husbands'. There were qualitative differences between husbands and wives in terms of caregiving tasks undertaken. Wives tolerated dementia sufferers depending on them less well. Wives were also more likely to wish to leave caregiving to someone else and cited more reasons for giving up. Subjects of both sexes displayed a strong tendency to view women as generally better suited to the caregiving role, and wives felt a greater obligation to care. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that such attitudinal or social factors are the chief determinants of wives' higher levels of strain and distress.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,1997 Dec,England,1997,90

According to the WHO, the annual deaths due to this disease amount to more than a million children in the world. The objectives of this paper are to estimate the seroprevalence of titer of antibodies to measles in the population of 12 to 59 months of age in Mexico and identify the determinants of the immunity state. From the National Seroepidemiology Survey, 5,232 blood samples of children between 12 and 59 months of age, were analyzed, their blood samples were considered positive when the antibody titers were greater or equal to 1:4, tested by hemagglutination inhibition using sensitized erythrocytes. The National seroprevalence was 76.2 per cent. By age group, an increment in positive level was observed age increased. The seroprevalence was 56 per cent in children of 12 to 24 month and 82 per cent for children 48 to 59 month of age. The history of vaccination was obtained verbally; 62.5 per cent of seropositive didn't have vaccination history and 82.5 per cent were of those vaccinated were positive. By place of residence, at rural level (populations less than 2,500 inhabitants) 74 per cent positives, compared to 79 per cent in children of urban areas. All risk factor were significant, based on a univariate analysis, being the one with greatest risk those with negative vaccine history and children of one year of age. The efficiency of the vaccine estimation was of 63.6 per cent. Risk factors related to the vinculation of immunity protection to measles or seropositives were age, and verbal history of vaccination.",Salud publica de Mexico,1992 Mar-Apr,Mexico,1992,90
9599943,Variability of birth-weight distributions by sex and ethnicity: analysis using mixture models.,"Birth weight is the most important proximate determinant of the level of infant mortality. However, the association between birth weight and infant mortality is not constant among populations. For example, the mortality of African American infants is lower at low birth weight but higher at high birth weight compared with European American infants. One possible explanation is that birth cohorts are heterogeneous even after controlling for birth weight, ethnicity, sex, and multiple births. The analyses presented here use Gaussian mixture models to explore the interpopulation variation in the shape of the birth-weight distribution for evidence of intrapopulation heterogeneity. The results suggest that a two-component mixture model provides an excellent description of human birth-weight distributions. Further statistical analyses of sex and ethnic differences indicate (1) that the birth-weight distributions and heterogeneity within the distribution vary between the sexes and among ethnic groups and (2) that one specific component is more closely associated with the overall level of infant mortality. The results support the hypothesis that birth cohorts can consist of two or more subpopulations at differential risk of mortality. Differences in the subpopulation composition of birth cohorts (i.e., differences in the level of heterogeneity among the various ethnic groups) might partially explain the interethnic variation in birth-weight-specific mortality. Further development of these mixture models should provide important additional information concerning the biological, environmental, and social determinants of birth weight and infant mortality.",Human biology,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
8500953,"How socioeconomic status affects birth and death rates in rural Kerala, India: results of a health study.","Data relating to birth and death were collected from throughout the state of Kerala, India, in a health survey conducted by the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad, a voluntary organization. In this study, the authors analyze birth and death rates as calculated from the sample of 9,940 households (57,665 persons), with respect to other variables such as region, religion, and socioeconomic status. In order to study the effect of socioeconomic factors on birth and death rates, a socioeconomic status rating (SES rating) was developed, taking into account such factors as income, education, housing conditions, and land ownership. Socioeconomic status was found to have a definite influence on birth and death rates, with higher socioeconomic status resulting in lower birth and death rates. This effect was independent of such confounding variables as age structure of the population, religion, and region. The higher risk of mortality among the poorer households can partly be explained by the material deprivation: the higher birth rates could be the result of poorer educational attainments.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1993,United States,1993,90
8310241,[Psychosocial determinants of massive obesity].,"Subjected to the reversed relationship between corpulence and socio-cultural level, massive obesity is, in Western countries, more frequent in the lowest social classes, and particularly in women. The influence on bodyweight of restricted food intake, physical activity and relative proportion of fats in daily diet has been demonstrated, and these 3 interacting factors vary with the social class. Although they are unanimously blamed for their enormous weight, subjects with massive obesity do not have a higher psychopathological index than other obese subjects or people with normal weight. On the other hand, the search of these massively obese subjects for a hypernormal presentation to compensate for the ""abnormality"" of their physical appearance (partially dependent on genetic factors) leads them to deny a great deal of the emotional and nutritional reality. This denial, overlooked by health institutions, could have been full of consequences. By generating wrong evaluations it would have contributed to the inadequacy of therapeutic responses which in turn would have made the obesity worse. Taking into account this phenomenon should improve the adequacy of therapeutic strategies and hence the prognosis.",La Revue du praticien,1993 Oct 1,France,1993,90
11660018,The limits of empirical studies on research ethics.,"The results of empirical research in psychology and psychiatry are increasingly being used to formulate as well as understand problems at the interface of law and psychiatry. There has been a proliferation of studies, such as the determinants of individual competence or threat to self or others, the results of which are influencing policy and legislative decisions as well as buttressing holdings in court cases. In this article, I explore the issues of interpretation of epidemiological studies, particularly the role of ideological positions on the design and results of empirical findings, the importance of the way data are interpreted, and the role of ideologies in the way research findings are presented to provide support for policy positions. Two levels of analysis are involved in determining the validity of a study. The first addresses the questions of whether the study meets the statistical and epidemiological requirements for reliable results. These include considerations such as the appropriateness of the study design and methods for gathering and interpreting data. The second focuses on the underlying framework of the study. This involves factors such as the perspectives and values of those conducting the study, the explicit and implicit dominating ideologies where they operate, and the extent to which the study is constructed to reaffirm specific ideologies. This level of analysis is essential for disclosing the influences of ideologies on the results of studies and the way in which data are interpreted. In this article, I try to demonstrate through critiques of selected studies that the first stage of analysis is insufficient without an examination of underlying preconceived values to establish the meaningfulness of results.",Ethics & behavior,1995,United States,1995,90

""It is shown that, in general, higher tax rates reduce distributive inequality as long as the rate of interest is exogenously given. In steady state, however, where the rate of interest is determined endogenously, increasing taxation and higher social security payments both diminish the capital labor ratio so that the rate of interest rises. If this interest effect is strong enough then it may outbalance the tendency toward more equality because higher interest rates enhance initial differences in the distribution of both income and wealth and, eventually, the inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in the society.""

1464153,Nutritional status of Brazilian children: trends from 1975 to 1989.,"The prevalence of malnutrition among under-5-year-olds in Brazil fell by more than 60% between 1975 and 1989. The benefits were smaller for population strata that were more affected by malnutrition in the 1970s, i.e., children from the North and North-east regions and those from poor families in general. Regional and socioeconomic differentials in the prevalence of malnutrition therefore increased between 1975 and 1989. Trends in family income indicate extraordinary economic gains in the 1970s, some losses in the 1980s, and a modest net gain over the period 1975-89. The availability of sanitation, health, and education services, and the provision of preschool supplementary feeding programmes increased markedly in the 1970s and 1980s. Demographic trends were also positive, reducing the demand for services and programmes, increasing the economic efficiency of families, and concentrating the population in urban areas, where incomes, job opportunities, and social and material infrastructures are better. The observed nutritional improvement was therefore probably due to a moderate increase in family income associated with a substantial expansion in the provision of services and programmes, both of which were facilitated by favourable demographic trends. Also, the nutritional improvement was probably concentrated during the 1970s, while little, if any, occurred after 1980; prospects for the 1990s point to a stagnant situation. This is a reason for great concern particularly in the North and North-east regions of the country, where high rates of child malnutrition are still found.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,1992,Switzerland,1992,90

8480234,Societal and ecological determinants of urban health: a case study of pre-reproductive mortality in 19th century Gibraltar.,"A historical based enquiry of colonial Gibraltar at the turn of the 19th century was conducted in order to assess what factors gave rise to residential variation of pre-reproductive mortality. Gibraltar's unusual configuration of a port city, garrison town, and commercial centre at the tip of the Iberian peninsula offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay of ecology, demographic and socio-economic factors on childhood mortality. Communal living under the patio system and the sharing of essential resources were characteristic features of life on the Rock. Using the residential district as the focus of enquiry, stepwise regression results for the period 1879-81, designated as a period of 'low ecological stress', indicated that the number of gallons of potable water per person captured a significant amount of variability in mortality. During the year 1878, a serious shortfall in rainfall was associated with lower life expectancy, a change in the seasonal pattern of mortality, and elevated rates of death attributable to the diarrhea complex. Under this period of 'high ecological stress', the percentage of servants in the household, a proxy for wealth/status, proved to be the single most important factor accounting for 46.6% of the variation in the death rate under 15. Analysis of mortality at the patio level revealed that residents of buildings of two household units had lower mortality than residents living in smaller or larger dwellings, particularly in the period of high ecological stress. The complex pattern of mortality at the district and patio level is explained in terms of the development of residential preferences and decentralized nature of vital resources, such as the water support system and food supply.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Apr,England,1993,90

This changes in the provider-client relationship marks a significant departure from practice models that relied on the professional giving the client expert health instructions. The literature that seeks to illuminate these more contemporary relationships with clients tends to ignore what practitioners bring to the health promotion encounter and, significantly, the social conditions that underlie the encounter. This paper, drawing on research gathered during an ethnographic study of practice in a public health clinic, critically analyzes health promotion with a view to challenging researchers, educators, and practitioners concerning the health-promoting possibilities in existing practice settings.",The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres,1997 Spring,United States,1997,90
2237325,"Work and ""lifestyle"" in occupational mortality in Denmark.","Using social class standardization Fox and Adelstein found that 18% of all mortality was attributed to work, while 82% was attributable to lifestyle. Fox and Adelstein had access to 25 occupational orders. We have made similar calculations on Danish mortality statistics including 146 occupational groups. Our results are very different: more than 50% of all mortality among Danish men seems to be related to work. Of 51,317 work-related deaths in 10 years, one third were due to cancer, and half due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The marked differences in results have lead to considerations on the applicability of the model and the underlying assumptions. One conclusion is that social differences and differences in mortality between social groups are so small in Denmark that a few subgroups with ""deviant"" mortality and/or lifestyle will be determinants of the results. Inclusion of more occupational groups increases the percentage of deaths associated with work.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1990 Sep,Sweden,1990,90
8744995,Determinants of variability among nations in child growth.,"This cross-national study aimed at understanding variability in growth among nations and its determinants. It examined the variability of growth among nations, the factors most important for explaining this variability, how these factors jointly determine growth, and the consistency of the patterns and relationships. A conceptual model was adapted from U. Jonsson. National data on height and weight of children, sex, ethnicity, and 15 social, economic, health, education, and political factors were combined from three secondary sources. A sequence of multiple linear regression models was used with three age groups: 1-2, 3-5, and 6-10 years. Substantial variability in growth among nations was seen in comparison to that within nations. Regression models with sex, ethnicity, food security, maternal and child care, and health services and environment explained a large percentage of this variability. Institutions, politics/ideology, economic structure, and potential resources contributed little additionally to the models. Ethnic differences among nations were observed and persisted even when models controlled for other factors, but should not necessarily be interpreted as genetic differences. Determinants for height, weight, and weight adjusted for height were somewhat different. Adjustment for only previous growth and sex explained about 90% of variability in growth, supporting the assumption that growth patterns are generally established early in life. As policy decisions and programmes addressing mild-to-moderate malnutrition are increasingly considered, the implications of cross-national variability in growth may assume greater importance. Future work should examine simultaneously the effects of national, community, family, and individual characteristics on growth using data from individuals in a number of nations.",Annals of human biology,1995 Sep-Oct,England,1995,90
7750377,Competence and memory: integrating psychosocial and cognitive correlates of child depression.,"Positive and negative peer nominations of multiple competencies and incidental recall of positive and negative self-referential adjectives were measured in relatively depressed and nondepressed fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-grade children (9 to 15 years old). Positive and negative peer evaluations related significantly to children's ability to recall positive and negative self-referential information (respectively), even after controlling for concurrent depressive symptoms. Positive and negative peer evaluations also related strongly to children's self-reported depressive symptoms. Incidental recall of positive and negative information significantly related to self-reported depression. In fact, the relation between recall of negative information and depression significantly increased in the eighth grade. Finally, preliminary support emerged that cognitive processes related to the incidental recall of negative self-descriptive information may mediate the relation between peer evaluations and depression. Implications for further research into the social determinants of cognitive processes and into the social and cognitive determinants of depression are discussed.",Child development,1995 Apr,United States,1995,90
1427741,Causes and consequences of increase in child survival rates: ethnoepidemiology among the Hmong of Thailand.,"The Hmong ""hill tribe"" minority in Thailand has much higher exposure to factors usually associated with risk of child mortality (high fertility, low status of women, low education, less use of modern medical care for births, exposure to warfare, economic and physical disruption, and poor hygienic conditions) than the rural ethnic Thai population. Nonetheless, infant mortality has declined from over 120 per 1000 to under 50 per 1000 live births among both these populations in the past 30 years. The reason for the rapid increase in child survival among the Hmong appears to be better access to and more use of modern curative and preventive medical care associated with road construction rather than major changes in social or hygienic conditions. Conventional wisdom suggests that high fertility is both a cause and a consequence of high infant and child mortality and that parents will not reduce fertility until they see that mortality has declined. Most Hmong parents recognize the decline in child mortality and attribute it to better access to modern medical care. Most Hmong parents also say that, if they were starting to have children now, they would want to have fewer children. Fear of child death is infrequently mentioned as a motive for having more children, and the perceived decline in child mortality is rarely mentioned as a reason for reduced fertility. Most Hmong parents explain their desired family size in terms of economic conditions rather than perceived risk of child mortality. Results of this study suggest that fertility and child mortality can vary independently of one another and that major reductions in child mortality can be accomplished without waiting for major social changes (e.g., improved education or status of women) or major reductions in fertility.",Human biology,1992 Dec,United States,1992,90
12291801,The demographic transition revisited: lessons for foreign aid and U.S. immigration policy.,"""The completed demographic transitions in industrialized countries inspired a model which underlies many well-meant policies affecting the Third World. However, the model's postulate--modernization and prosperity will lower fertility rates--has exacerbated rather than helped control worldwide population growth and the associated environmental degradation. Here we show that perceived economic opportunity leads to raising family size targets and to discarding elements of traditional cultures which formerly held fertility rates in check. Conversely, fertility rates fall when limits are recognized. These observations imply that a liberal immigration policy and large-scale foreign aid are counterproductive for restoring balance between population size and carrying capacity.""",Ecological economics : the journal of the International Society for Ecological Economics,1993 Dec,Netherlands,1993,90
10501712,Determinants of psychiatric inpatient admission to general hospital psychiatric wards: an epidemiological study in a region of central Italy.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which factors contribute to the decision to admit individuals to psychiatric wards in general hospitals. METHOD: Data on 1,379 individuals undergoing psychiatric evaluation in eight emergency rooms in a region of central Italy were collected. A logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the likelihood of psychiatric admission considering the independent effects of demographic, social, and clinical factors and of the history of psychiatric treatment. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for psychiatric admission significantly increased with the following variables: severity of symptoms; presence of paranoid states and schizophrenic psychoses, affective psychoses and acute psychotic conditions (with neurotic disorders used as reference); a history of outpatient treatment; the presence of a staff member of a community mental health facility upon presentation at the emergency room; and the availability of beds in the psychiatric ward. CONCLUSION: The independent effect played by the presence of a staff member of a community mental health facility is of particular interest, suggesting the existence of a collaborative relationship between inpatient and outpatient services.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1999 Aug,Germany,1999,90
8812822,The effects of the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health upon psychosocial determinants of diet and physical activity behavior.,"BACKGROUND: The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health is a multisite study of a school-based intervention to reduce or prevent the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this paper is to present the evaluation results of the 3-year intervention, focusing upon the psychosocial variables conceptualized as determinants of dietary and physical activity behaviors. METHODS: A total of 96 schools across four study sites (California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas) were randomized to two treatment conditions: intervention and control. Pre- and postmeasurements on the health behavior questionnaire were collected from over 6,000 students. The data analyses utilized a nested design approach in which schools served as the primary unit of analysis. Repeated-measures multivariate analyses were applied to investigate effect sizes for each determinant and to explore theoretical relationships among the determinants over time. RESULTS: The findings indicated sustained significant effects in improved knowledge, intentions, self-efficacy, usual behavior, and perceived social reinforcement for healthy food choices (P < 0.0001 for these five variables) after 3 years. Intermittent effects were observed for perceived support and self-efficacy for physical activity. No gender by determinant interaction effects were observed, and girls reported significantly greater perceived reinforcement for healthy eating than did boys. CONCLUSION: The CATCH program was effective in changing the psychosocial variables likely to influence a reduction in behavior for cardiovascular disease. The study is significant in that it demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of a sustained multifaceted intervention in a preadolescent population. The results point to a need for greater understanding of adolescent developmental issues and the role of community environment (particularly social support) in creating effective curricula.",Preventive medicine,1996 Jul-Aug,United States,1996,90
9561667,The influence of traditional religion on fertility regulation among the Kassena-Nankana of northern Ghana.,"This article presents findings from a study of the influence of traditional religion on reproductive preferences of Kassena-Nankana lineage heads in northern Ghana. Seven reproductive preference questions were administered to nine lineage heads who are primary practitioners of the cult of soothsaying. With the assistance of soothsayers, interviews were repeated in conjunction with the invocation of religious rites in order to determine the views of ancestral spirits on the seven questions. Pairs of lineage head and ancestral interviews are compared to determine the role of traditional religion in shaping male reproductive preferences. Interview pairs reflect a shared preference for sons, large compounds, and a growing lineage. Findings nonetheless show that some ancestral spirits want small families, some even wanting fewer children than corresponding lineage heads. Spiritual consultations are nondogmatic and open to external ideas and influences, suggesting that family planning introduction will not encounter systematic religious opposition among the Kassena-Nankana.",Studies in family planning,1998 Mar,United States,1998,90
7652124,Rethinking medicine: improving health outcomes with cost-effective psychosocial interventions.,"Thoughts, feelings, and moods can have a significant effect on the onset of some diseases, the course of many, and the management of nearly all. Many visits to the doctor are occasioned by psychosocial distress. Even in those patients with organic medical disorders, functional health status is strongly influenced by mood, coping skills, and social support, yet the predominant approach in medicine is to treat people with physical and chemical treatments that neglect the mental, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of illness. This critical mismatch between the psychosocial health needs of people and the usual medical response leads to frustration, ineffectiveness, and wasted health care resources. There is emerging evidence that empowering patients and addressing their psychosocial needs can be health and cost effective. By helping patients manage not just their disease but also common underlying needs for psychosocial support, coping skills, and sense of control, health outcomes can be significantly improved in a cost-effective manner. Rather than targeting specific diseases or behavioral risk factors, these psychosocial interventions may operate by influencing underlying, shared determinants of health such as attitudes, beliefs, and moods that predispose toward health in general. Although the health care system cannot be expected to address all the psychosocial needs of people, clinical interventions can be brought into better alignment with the emerging evidence on shared psychosocial determinants of health by providing services that address psychosocial needs and improve adaptation to illness.",Psychosomatic medicine,1995 May-Jun,United States,1995,90
1506998,Preventing relapse in the treatment of nicotine addiction: current issues and future directions.,"Although smoking-cessation rates have continued to increase, the vast majority of smokers who quit eventually relapse. Between 1974 and 1985, over 1.3 million smokers quit during each of those years. However, 75% to 80% of those individuals resumed smoking within six months. This article describes the dynamic phenomenon of smoking relapse within the context of cyclical episodes of smoking and quitting during an individual's lifetime. Theories of the determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed and methods designed to prevent relapse are described. Smoking relapse is discussed in terms of three aspects of tobacco addiction: (1) biological-addiction mechanisms, (2) conditioning processes, and (3) cognitive-social learning factors. The major determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed, including nicotine withdrawal, stress, weight gain, social influences, conditioning factors, causal attributions, and environmental variables. A transtheoretical-developmental model is explored in the longitudinal investigation of the natural history of slips (lapses) and relapse episodes. Relapse prevention interventions are described that emphasize self-awareness, self-regulation, self-efficacy, affect regulation, social support, and lifestyle balance. Recent developments in pharmacological adjuncts to treatment are also examined. It is concluded that innovative relapse prevention methods need to be designed for hard-core smokers with histories of cessation failures, substance abuse and/or psychiatric impairment. These and other recommendations for future research on smoking relapse and relapse prevention are discussed.",Journal of psychoactive drugs,1992 Apr-Jun,United States,1992,90
9250099,Determinants of body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in Dutch children and adolescents.,"Knowledge about body composition is important in metabolic and nutritional studies. In this cross-sectional study the body composition of 403 healthy white Dutch children and adolescents was evaluated by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Possible determinants of body composition were analyzed. In 85 subjects the results of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were compared with DXA. Fat mass, lean tissue mass, and bone mineral content were greater in older boys and girls. Percentage body fat was greater in older girls but not in boys and it was higher in girls than in boys at all ages. From the age of 14 y boys had higher lean tissue mass and bone mineral content than girls. Tanner stage had a significant relation with body composition in both sexes. Percentage body fat was lower in boys in stage 4 than in stage 3 and was higher in consecutive Tanner stages in girls. After adjustment for age, Tanner stage was significantly positively related to lean tissue mass and bone mineral content in boys and girls and to percentage body fat and fat mass in girls. The profession of the parents and the education of the father had a significant negative correlation with percentage body fat and fat mass in girls (P < 0.01). Physical activity was related to lean tissue mass (P = 0.001) but not to fat mass in boys after adjustment for age. A high correlation and a small difference was found between lean body mass by BIA and lean tissue mass by DXA. Body composition in healthy Dutch children and adolescents is related to age, sex, Tanner stage, socioeconomic status, and physical activity.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1997 Aug,United States,1997,90

The author notes that Italian society still largely conforms to traditional conjugal models and attitudes toward cohabitation and divorce. ""Women most exposed to the risk of marital disruption seem to be those who married very young, who have had no more than one child, who are better educated, who have full-time jobs and who reside in large towns in the north-west of Italy.

A study in pauper children attending schools in an urban strip in Lisbon].,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether race is a factor of blood pressure levels in school-age children of similar social status, and to investigate other potential determinants of the levels of blood pressure. DESIGN: Inquiry in schools of the suburbs of Lisbon. SETTING: Three schools, four medical observers (general practitioners with school-health functions). SUBJECTS: Three hundred ninety seven children, aged 6-14 years, both sexes, 296 being white and 101 non-white. INTERVENTIONS: Inquiry to the following individual characteristics--sex, age, race, birthplace, type of housing, house availability of water, electricity and waste water, type of transportation to school, number of cohabitans, family income, school marks. Individual determination of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), weight and height. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood pressure values were cross-analyzed with all the determined variables, and the virtual correlations were checked. Main results as follows: Race does not influence either SBP or DBP. In this age group, sex does not influence blood pressure values. The used markers of socioeconomical status have equally no influence on blood pressure. Age has only a significant repercussion on SBP. No significant correlation was found between height and blood pressure. Body weight, however, influence either SBP or DBP. SBP was found to be lower in the second of two successive measurements, and the difference increases with age. CONCLUSIONS: In this school-aged biracial population, body weight seems to be the major factor of blood pressure levels, in the sense-bigger weight, higher SBP and DBP.",Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,1991 Nov,Portugal,1991,90
9010510,Predictors of African American adolescents' condom use and HIV risk behavior.,"This study evaluated predictors of risky and safer behavior in a sample of low-income African American adolescents, assessed their perceptions of the risk associated with their sexual behavior, and examined differences between adolescents who used condoms consistently, inconsistently, or engaged only in unprotected intercourse. African American adolescents (N = 312) completed measures related to AIDS knowledge, frequency of condom use, attitudes toward condoms, and sexual behavior over the preceding 2 months. Multiple regression analyses for the sexually active youths (N = 114) revealed that lower self-efficacy, higher perceived risk, and male gender were associated with high-risk behavior. Positive attitudes toward condoms and younger age had the strongest association with condom use. Consistent condom users were more knowledgeable and held more positive attitudes toward condoms, and nonusers were older. Regardless of their behavior, the adolescents generally did not perceive themselves to be a risk for HIV infection. The findings suggest that precautionary practices (condom use) and high-risk behavior (unprotected sex with multiple partners) may have different correlates. In addition, the data indicate that theoretical models developed with homosexual male populations may also be generalizable to African American adolescents' sexual behavior.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90

Although less than 9 percent of interviewees had concrete plans to return, over 32 percent were positively disposed to returning in the future. Key background variables that affect that decision are people's age, sex, social background in China, and their views about returning when they first left China. Concern about children's future was not significant, but having a wife abroad greatly increased the desire to stay abroad. Why people chose not to return varied significantly between people [who had] children and those who didn't.""",Studies in comparative international development,1997 Spring,United States,1997,90

DESIGN: A logistic regression model was used for the analyses and included: education, marital status, socioeconomic group, social network, physical activities, cigarette consumption, and years spent smoking as independent variables. Men and women were analysed separately for smoking. A specific univariate analysis was also performed for men who used snuff. SETTING: Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: A panel of 5104 randomised people aged 16-84 years was interviewed in 1980-81 and followed up in 1988-89 in the survey of living conditions undertaken by Statistics Sweden. The participation rate was 86%. The panel included 1546 men and women who were daily smokers. There were 418 daily users of snuff among the men, and 129 men both smoked and used snuff. MAIN RESULTS: Together 26% of women and 23% of men had quit smoking. Five percent in both groups were new smokers. Among men, 26% had quit using snuff and 5% had begun smoking. New snuff users among men were 5%. In the multivariate analysis, unmarried men kept smoking at significantly higher rates (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2,3.6), as did those men who smoked 11-20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.5, 3.4), or more than 20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4,5.7). Among women, smoking 11-20 cigarettes/day was also a significant factor (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.1,5.0). Men and women aged 25-44 were significantly more likely to continue smoking (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.1,3.7, and 2.2; 95% CI 1.2,4.4) as were those who had smoked for 20 years or more (OR 4.7; 95% CI 2.0,10.8 and OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1,5.5, respectively). For women, low education (up to grade 9) was also a significant factor (OR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.2,5.1). Among men who had quit using snuff we did not find any values of significance. CONCLUSIONS: One in four smokers had quit during the 1980s and a few started smoking (5%). Some men quit smoking and started using snuff instead. For both sexes, the daily consumption of cigarettes, years spent smoking, and age were the most important determinants of successful quitting. In men, being married/ cohabiting was an important factor as was higher education in women.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1996 Dec,England,1996,90

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical decision making behavior, as measured using a subset of the Behavioral Pharmaceutical Care Scale. RESULTS: Response rate was 31.8%. Workload was not significantly related to clinical decision making. After controlling for social desirability and workload, perceived normative beliefs of significant others was highly significant; it accounted for 7.6% of the variance associated with clinical decision making behavior. CONCLUSION: Workload pressures did not appear to influence the provision of pharmaceutical care. Community pharmacists' perceived normative beliefs about their patients' and employer's approval or disapproval of the provision of pharmaceutical care should be further examined within the larger context of the pharmacy organization's climate.","Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association (Washington,D.C. : 1996)",1998 Jul-Aug,United States,1998,90

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In three medical rehabilitation centres, 173 consecutive patients (female/male = 62/111) after potentially curative total gastrectomy for gastric malignancy 206 days earlier (median, interquartile range = IQR 56-644) were evaluated for different pre- and post-operative parameters with potential influence on post-operative medico-social functioning as measured with the Edinburgh Rehabilitation Status Scale (ERSS). Parameters evaluated were: gender, age, time since operation, tumour stage, type of operation, clinical centre of admittance, haemoglobin, ferritin, albumin, presence of small bowel bacterial overgrowth, rapid oro-coecal transit, dyspepsia, early satiety, reflux, dysphagia, vomiting, a symptom based score, body mass index in health, at operation and on admission, weight loss since operation, calorie intake, bowel habits, and fat malassimilation. Independent influential factors for the ERSS were identified in a linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The median ERSS-score was 4 (IQR 2-6) on a scale from 0 (best) to 28 (worst). There was a significant difference in the ERSS-scores between the three different clinics. The ERSS-scores improved significantly with time since operation (ca. 22% per year). ERSS-scores were higher in patients with intestino-oesophageal reflux (+71%), with dyspepsia (+65%), or with dysphagia (+62%).

10150529,"Early-age mortality, socio-economic development and the health system in Mongolia.","Since the 1920s Mongolia has developed an extensive and well-staffed health care system that has made modern health technologies accessible to most of its population. In addition, the country experienced rapid economic and social development whose benefits were equitably distributed among the population. In spite of this progress, infant and child mortality levels are high by contemporary standards and during the past 20 years these rates have remained virtually constant. The modern health care delivery system, externally imposed, failed to take into account the specific characteristics of the Mongolian culture; this fact is identified as one of the major determinants of the unexpected levels of early-age mortality. The excessive orientation toward curative medicine, the lack of health prevention and promotion activities and the lack of community participation have resulted in the people continuing to believe in traditional therapeutic patterns and self-care. They perceive the modern system exclusively in curative terms and not with regard to health preservation and disease prevention. Most Mongolians do not fully understand the health care system, and use its services mainly because they have no alternative, or because of coercion rather than conviction based on the learning and internalization of its basic principles. In practices and ideas of child care, preservation of health and disease prevention, people seem to identify more with the traditional health care system. Like other former socialist countries, Mongolia is experiencing deep economic and social transformations, whose implications for the health care system are discussed. An economic crisis whose end is nowhere in sight, emergent social inequalities, a vague health insurance model with unclear financing sources, and lack of concern by most policy-makers in strengthening the preventive component of the health system, are not positive factors for substantial infant and child mortality decline in the near future. A clear advantage is, however, the fact that there is a wide space for major improvements with existing internal and external resources.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1995 Apr,Australia,1995,90

Estimates of a parametric discrete-time competing risks duration model show that wives of retired husbands go into full-time work, children under 3 years have a disincentive effect on part-time work and that part-time work is a state that German women prefer to stay in and not a first step to full-time employment, whereas foreign women living in West Germany prefer full-time jobs.""",Journal of population economics,1996,Germany,1996,90
2253992,Mortality determinants and prediction of outcome in high risk newborns.,"The aim of this study was to determine independent patient-related predictors of mortality in high risk newborns admitted at our centre. The study population comprised 100 consecutive newborns each, from the premature unit (PU) and sick baby care unit (SBCU), respectively. Thirteen high risk factors (variables) for each of the two units, were entered into a multivariate regression analysis. Variables with independent predictive value for poor outcome (i.e., death) in PU were, weight less than 1 kg, hyaline membrane disease, neurologic problems, and intravenous therapy. High risk factors in SBCU included, blood gas abnormality, bleeding phenomena, recurrent convulsions, apnea, and congenital anomalies. Identification of these factors guided us in defining priority areas for improvement in our system of neonatal care. Also, based on these variables a simple predictive score for outcome was constructed. The prediction equation and the score were cross-validated by applying them to a 'test-set' of 100 newborns each for PU and SBCU. Results showed a comparable sensitivity, specificity and error rate.",Indian pediatrics,1990 Jun,India,1990,90
8616465,Determinants of HIV infection and recent risk behaviour among injecting drug users in Berlin by site of recruitment.,"This study investigated differences in prevalence and determinants of HIV infection, and in recent risk behaviour (previous 6 months) among injecting drug users (IDUs) who are in contact with different types of services for IDUs in Berlin. Participants (n = 557) were recruited from drug-free long-term treatment centres, a storefront agency and a syringe exchange bus. HIV seroprevalence was lowest (3.9%) at the treatment centres, and highest among IDUs at the storefront agency (20.7%). In logistic regression, independent risk factors for HIV infection were duration of injecting drug use, borrowing syringes in prison, sex with HIV-positive partners, and prostitution. Syringe sharing in prison was the most important independent determinant of HIV infection among all three subpopulations of IDUs. Participants entering long-term treatment were most likely, and IDUs at the syringe exchange bus were least likely to have borrowed and passed on syringes in the previous 6 months. In logistic regression, site of recruitment was independently associated with recent borrowing of syringes, but not with condom use. Injection of drugs other than heroin only, and injecting in prisons, were also independent predictors of recent borrowing. The results indicate that IDUs entering treatment form an important target group for health education. There is a need for AIDS prevention measures in prisons. The comparatively low levels of recent injection risk behaviour among IDUs at the syringe exchange bus suggest that this type of intervention may be effective in harm reduction.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1995 Oct,England,1995,90
1560664,Factors associated with alcohol use in university students.,"A survey was conducted of drinking, drug use attitudes, beliefs, personality and demographic characteristics of students on a university campus. Gender, ethnic and social group differences were also examined. It was concluded that a biopsychosocial matrix of determinants influenced alcohol consumption and its excessive consumption. Two general factors emerged from analyses of the results. They may be interpreted as entering into a complex approach-avoidance conflict where the net approach tendency determines overall alcohol consumption. Personality characteristics and presumably their biological correlates, as well as set and setting, or attitudes, beliefs and environmental influences contribute to the approach-avoidance conflict that determines abstinence or varying amounts of alcohol consumption.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90

10168755,Household income and health care expenditures in Mexico.,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of household health expenditures in Mexico. Our analysis involves the estimation of household monetary health care expenditures, using the economic and demographic characteristics of the household as covariates. We pay particular attention to the impact of household income on health expenditures, estimating the elasticity of health care expenditures with respect to income for different income groups and according to health insurance status. For the empirical analysis, we use the Mexican National Survey of Income and Expenditures of 1989. Our principle findings show that monetary health expenditures by Mexican households are sensitive to changes in household income levels and that the group which is most responsive to changes in income levels in the lower-income uninsured group. This suggests that in times of economic crisis, these households reduce cash expenditures on health care by proportionately more than higher-income and insured households.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1997 Jun,Ireland,1997,90
8151324,"Evaluation of the neurobehavioral functioning of patients before, during, and after bone marrow transplantation.","PURPOSE: To evaluate the cognitive and emotional functioning of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the protected environment (PE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were given tests of cognition and mood before their hospitalization in the PE, after 2 weeks, at discharge, and at 8 months post-BMT. Locus of control, degree of social support, previous biotherapy, and on-treatment psychiatric consultation were also analyzed. RESULTS: Before BMT, 20% of patients had mild cognitive dysfunction, and nearly 40% had significant anxiety. Although few patients developed problems with cognition or mood during the study, short-term memory deficits nearly doubled at follow-up compared with baseline. Anxiety decreased significantly during hospitalization and remained low at follow-up. In contrast, depression increased throughout hospitalization, but decreased at follow-up. Pre-BMT emotional status and cognitive functioning were highly related to long-term outcome. Type of BMT, locus of control, and degree of social support were related to psychologic distress and cognitive functioning, both during and after BMT. Patient age was not a predictor of neurobehavioral symptoms during or after BMT. CONCLUSION: Pretransplant emotional and cognitive functioning are important determinants of long-term outcome and quality of life (QOL) in BMT patients. In addition, a few patients undergoing BMT develop short-term memory difficulties and mood disturbance that may persist. Pretransplant identification of patients at risk for neurobehavioral difficulties may guide early interventions during hospitalization. Posttransplant assessment may then be used to develop rehabilitation programs and other interventions for individuals with persisting complaints.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,1994 Apr,United States,1994,90

In particular, it reports on a study of Australian secondary students who completed an 80-item questionnaire which captures the range of adolescent coping behaviour by assessing eighteen strategies and three coping styles. When the relationship between coping behaviour and the respondents' gender, age and ethnicity was investigated, it was found that older students use more Self-blame and Tension-reduction techniques than do younger students; and younger students use more work related strategies than do older students; males report using more Physical Recreation than do females whilst females use more Seeking Social Support, Wishful Thinking and Tension-reduction strategies. In general, the pattern of usage of different coping strategies, for the students participating in this investigation, indicates that adolescents' foremost response to their general concerns comprises attempts to deal directly with the causes of concerns while attending to both their own physical and social well-being.",Journal of adolescence,1993 Sep,England,1993,90

Results based on home interviews (n = 605) of a 40% systematic sample of 70 year olds in the electoral register showed that around 46.3% of females and 21.3% of males reported being lonely. Persons of European/North American origin felt less lonely than those of Asian or African origin, probably due to the former's wider social support network, perceiving friends, neighbors or other relatives as being available to back up children in an emergency. The major factors associated with loneliness were: being depressed, having a poor self-assessed health status, not attending synagogue, and being widowed but not remarried. Factors that did not reduce loneliness included having paid employment, watching TV or listening to the radio. No association was found between cognitive status and loneliness. Our systems model suggests a strong reciprocal relationship between loneliness and depression.",Israel journal of medical sciences,1996 Aug,Israel,1996,90

It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar.

DESIGN: Systematic random sample design. SETTING: A large southeastern city. PARTICIPANTS: 450 independent and chain community pharmacists identified from the state board of pharmacy list of licensed community pharmacists. INTERVENTIONS: A mailed questionnaire asking about community pharmacists' workload pressures and the perceived beliefs of their patients and employers (significant others) approving or disapproving of them providing pharmaceutical care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical decision making behavior, as measured using a subset of the Behavioral Pharmaceutical Care Scale. RESULTS: Response rate was 31.8%. Workload was not significantly related to clinical decision making. After controlling for social desirability and workload, perceived normative beliefs of significant others was highly significant; it accounted for 7.6% of the variance associated with clinical decision making behavior. CONCLUSION: Workload pressures did not appear to influence the provision of pharmaceutical care. Community pharmacists' perceived normative beliefs about their patients' and employer's approval or disapproval of the provision of pharmaceutical care should be further examined within the larger context of the pharmacy organization's climate.","Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association (Washington,D.C. : 1996)",1998 Jul-Aug,United States,1998,90

Due to the school's pivotal role in our society, an emphasis is placed on how our schools contribute to antisocial behavior, and what educators can do to prevent anti-social behavior and related attendance problems. A variety of contextual factors and setting events within our schools appear to be major contributors to antisocial behavior, and some of the same factors identified within the schools also have been identified within the home. These setting events, rather than quick restrictive fixes, must be given more attention if we are to provide safe school environments-environments that durably prevent antisocial behavior and related attendance problems.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1995 Winter,United States,1995,90

9755368,Competence in discourse as a measure of social integration and quality of life in persons with traumatic brain injury.,"Persisting difficulties in communication are a serious handicap faced by many after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a major barrier to community reintegration. Conventional approaches to the study of communication problems after TBI have focused on the form of language production and expression, usually in terms of phonological, semantic, and syntactical features. Most TBI patients, however, perform overall within normal ranges on these conventional indicators. More recently, attention has focused on language in its naturally-occurring form, that is, discourse, which is heavily influenced by linguistic, cognitive and social skills. Because most TBI patients are left with residual deficits in these areas, study of discourse abilities seem to be particularly suited to understanding their problems in communication and facilitating eventual reintegration into the community. This study was designed to determine if and how the conversational discourse of TBI patients differs from a matched non-TBI group and whether any identified variables are related to measures of outcome as measured by community integration and quality of life. Additionally, the study was designed to explore the relationship between TBI and features of discourse across conversational, narrative, procedural genres. TBI patients (n = 30) from an out-patient brain injury programme were compared to matched controls (n = 10) in the three discourse genres. Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluated 23 measures of discourse efficiency, complexity, topic management, information and pragmatic behaviours in each genre as well as measures of psychosocial adjustment, particularly social integration and quality of life. Results indicated that TBIs were significantly different from controls on several measures of discourse and psychosocial adjustment. A number of other features of discourse were found to correlate significantly with social integration and quality of life. Interestingly, discourse variables appeared to correlate with social integration more strongly than age, gender, education, and other conventional psychosocial factors. Contrary to prediction, features of conversational discourse did not correlate more strongly than other types of discourse with social integration and quality of life. Discussion centred on the apparent comorbidity of features in everyday discourse and psychosocial determinants that were associated with quality of life and social integration.",Brain injury,1998 Sep,England,1998,90

We used the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) to generate DSM-III and RDC diagnoses to estimate lifetime depressive disorders, and established (via corroborative reports) the likely accuracy of those data. Despite lifetime depression being a relatively common experience, no significant sex differences in depressive episodes were demonstrated, suggesting the possible irrelevance of biological factors in determining any sex difference. As there was not major social role divergence over the five year study, we interpret the lack of a sex difference as a consequence, and suggest that findings support the view that social factors are of key relevance in determining any female preponderance in depression described in general population studies.""",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1991 May,England,1991,90
10346032,Ecological and geographic characteristics predict nutritional status of communities: rapid assessment for poor villages.,"The quality of poverty alleviation programmes relies heavily on appropriate targeting and priority setting. Major problems in assessing poverty include identification of the indicators of poverty and the methods used for its assessment. Nutritional status, expressed by anthropometric indices, has been proposed as a poverty indicator because of its validity, objectivity, reliability and feasibility. This study was conducted to explore the application of remote sensing to poverty mapping based on nutritional status at the community level. Relationships between the nutritional status within a community and the ecological characteristics of the community were investigated. Multiple linear regression tests were executed, and the resultant equations were tested for their validity in predicting communities with poor nutritional status. Among geographical and ecological indicators used, distance to the nearest market, main soil type, rice field area, and perennial cultivation area were found to be most useful predictors for the ranking of the communities by nutritional status. Among non-ecological determinants, food consumption, health service status and living conditions were also found as predictors. The highest correlation was found if total population was also taken into account in the regression model (R2 = 0.69; p < 0.0001). In the assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the eight models studied, 'undernutrition' was defined as a condition where a community belongs in the first quartile for nutritional status (highest prevalence of undernutrition), and the baseline nutritional survey was considered as a standard method for final diagnosis. Most models which included only ecological factors in the equations had lower sensitivity and specificity than models which included all determinant factors in the equations. All models which took into account the total population had higher sensitivity and specificity than those that did not take total population into account. The best model of those that took into account only the geographical and ecological characteristics of the community's living environment had similar sensitivity and specificity (80% and 94.1%, respectively) as the models that considered non-geographical and non-ecological variables in addition to geographical and ecological variables. In the case of West Sumatra, only four ecological and geographic characteristics were sufficient to predict poverty in village. Since these characteristics could be surveyed by remote sensing, it may well be possible to use remote sensing for a rapid method for poverty mapping.",Health policy and planning,1998 Dec,England,1998,90

A stepwise procedure of logistic regression analyses was utilized to get a final multivariate model of variables associated with the clinical finding of a laryngeal contact granuloma. The subjects consisted of 47 patients with contact granulomas and 110 patients with voice disorders due to other causes. Our analysis of 22 variables uncovered the following statistically significant factors for developing a contact granuloma: male gender (P = 0.0001), low achievement orientation (P = 0.0007), fear of physical lesions (P = 0.0038), impulsiveness (P = 0.0016), age > 60 years (P = 0.0012), low extraversion (P = 0.004), high achievement orientation (P = 0.0079), fear of appearing in public (P = 0.0216) and strain (P = 0.03). These results show that a variety of variables are important for predicting the development of a laryngeal contact granuloma. The usefulness of this set of risk variables for predicting a contact granuloma remains to be proved in a prospective study.

A new public health practice is emerging, apparent in initiatives like the international healthy cities/communities projects. This new public health practice must integrate the challenge of sustainable development, as defined by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development. The holosphere framework locates health as its central metaphor, and defines six interacting environmental spheres: a viable natural environment, a sustainable economic environment, a sufficient economy, an equitable social environment, a convivial community, and a livable built environment. There are five functional roles for local government: policy, legislation, education, partnerships and advocacy. Representative actions from each of the six environmental spheres of the holosphere framework are identified and discussed, using the five functional roles of local government.

METHODS: Unionized New York City health care workers (n = 1394) with comprehensive medical insurance were screened for hypertension. Union records documenting all physician visits and prescription medications for the year before screening provided the opportunity to relate patterns of treatment to blood pressure outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 409 employees found to have hypertension, 289 (71%) were aware of their condition and 201 (49%) had been treated, but only 51 (12%) had their blood pressure controlled at the recommended level (< 140/90 mm Hg). In a logistic regression model, the only variable of treatment associated with control was days of antihypertensive medication. The total number of physician visits was not associated with control. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in conventional community settings, even in the absence of financial barriers, treatment for hypertension continues to be characterized by poor outcomes.

To assess these potential impacts, there is a need to broaden the scope of health impact assessment. Eco-epidemiology is emerging as a response to this need. Eco-epidemiology entails a shift in focus: from direct (toxicological) to indirect (ecological) mechanisms; and from effects occurring at 'human' temporal and geographical scales to those at regional and geophysical scales. We discuss the potential health impacts of climate change on each scale. At the global scale, interactions and feedbacks between systems are critical determinants of long term outcomes. From an eco-epidemiological perspective, the study of climate change becomes inseparable from the study of global change more generally.",Reviews on environmental health,1997 Jul-Sep,Germany,1997,90

1945937,Determinants of health-promotive behavior. A review of current research.,"The determinants of health promotive-behavior are proposed by Pender in the HPM. The exact impact of the various variables on singular behaviors or a lifestyle index, however, is far from conclusive. All the proposed factors have been supported through research, at least in part, as either directly or indirectly influencing the intent to participate in different health behaviors. The difficulty in concluding which variables are most critical is perhaps due to the variety of definitions, theoretical approaches (from different disciplines), and research methods. Of primary concern to this author is the overlap of activities among different ""patterns"" of behavior and the various definitions of such behavioral patterns. Little evidence exists on how specific types of behaviors relate to one another. Thus, knowing the determinants of a lifestyle index, for example, may be insignificant if the goal of nursing is to target priority behaviors that may indeed be influenced by more significant variables. For example, a person's perception of control may be a significant predictor of lifestyle behaviors in general; however, this variable may not impact on the person's decision to engage in changes related to exercise or activity behavior. Hence, because the motives behind various behaviors may be different, it seems more prudent to invest our research efforts on the impact of various factors on singular behaviors rather than lifestyle patterns. Finally, the efforts of nursing research on health behavior have been directed primarily at explaining the impact of various individual perceptions on the likelihood of behavior. Such focus has revealed some evidence of the significance of these variables, yet much unexplained variance remains. Perhaps it would be more prudent to direct attention at those variables such as situational or environmental factors that may impede or act as a cue to healthy behavior. Because the explanation of behavior has been individually focused (perhaps due to an ""individualizing"" theme in nursing education), the impact of the ecological model of behavior tends to be dismissed or underrated in nursing research. Knowledge of the impact of societal factors on behavior may be more appropriate to planning strategies for various groups rather than the behavioristic approaches that separate people from their social, physical, and economic environments. Thus, personal lifestyles may not be a simple matter of informed choice, and attention to the complex processes of societal opportunities, cultural interpretations, and group-specific attitudes must be studied further.",The Nursing clinics of North America,1991 Dec,United States,1991,90

It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.",Journal of sex & marital therapy,1994 Fall,England,1994,90
9888372,Health promotion and health education: what role should the nurse adopt in practice?,"Health promotion is widely accepted as part of the role of the nurse, midwife and health visitor. Theoretical definitions of health promotion and health education are presented. The author suggests that a variety of different approaches to health promotion can be adopted by nurses in practice, including education, persuasion, manipulation and attempts to promote an environment where healthy decisions about lifestyle can be made. Each strategy is examined and the advantages and the ethical limitations are explored. It is suggested that nurses may theoretically accept the notion of being a health promoter, but that in the reality of practice, their role may be primarily that of the health educator. The importance of recognizing that there are a variety of determinants of health, including social and environmental factors, as well as individual lifestyle, is emphasized throughout the paper.",Journal of advanced nursing,1998 Dec,England,1998,90
10157222,Determinants of maternal mortality in rural China.,"A case-control study of maternal mortality was conducted in selected rural areas of two provinces in China: Henan province, which has a relatively lower socio-economic status and higher maternal mortality rates, and Jiangsu province with higher socio-economic status and lower maternal mortality rates. The major cause of maternal mortality in the two provinces was postpartum hemorrhage and the largest proportion of deaths occurred on the road between the women's home and the health care facility. Results indicate that the expectant mother's socio-economic status, knowledge of maternal care, and the nature and level of maternal care provided all influence rural maternal death rates. However, socio-economic factors were only significant predictors of mortality in the poorer province. Implications for health policy and future research are discussed.",Health services management research,1996 Feb,England,1996,90
9299888,"Nativity, race, and mortality: favorable impact of birth outside the United States on mortality in New York City.","To determine the association of birthplace (US-born vs. foreign-born) with mortality among blacks and whites in New York City, we examined death records for 5 years from 1988 to 1992 and the 1990 census data. Mortality rates by race and birthplace were compared for all causes of death and for specific causes. Although overall death rates for blacks generally exceeded those for whites (1224.8 per 100,000 inhabitants vs. 721.4 for males and 593.7 vs. 393.1 for females), foreign-born blacks had death rates (664.6 for males and 350.2 for females) slightly lower than those for whites. The most striking variation among blacks was among those aged 25 to 64 years. US-born black males were three times as likely (1588.9 vs. 525.2) and US-born black females were more than 2.5 times as likely (673.5 vs. 263.4) to die as were foreign-born blacks. Among US-born blacks AIDS, homicide, and cancer for males and AIDS, heart disease, and cancer for females were the most important determinants of excess deaths, defined as the difference between observed deaths and expected deaths; these causes of death account for about half of the excess deaths for each sex. Among whites natives generally had higher death rates than migrants, but less prominently and consistently so than for blacks. Excess mortality of blacks is largely explained by higher death rates of US-born compared with foreign-born Americans.",Human biology,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
8501482,Musculoskeletal disorders as determinants of disability in Finns aged 30 years or more.,"The relationship between disability and various musculoskeletal disorders was investigated in 7217 men and women representative of the Finnish population aged 30 years or more. They participated in the Mini-Finland Health Survey and were first screened by interview and questionnaire about limitations in daily activities. The outcome variables were reduced working capacity, an occasional need for assistance in daily activities, and a regular need for assistance in daily activities. In a two-phase medical examination, all cases fulfilling predetermined diagnostic criteria of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory and mental disorders and diabetes were recorded independently. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, inflammatory arthritis was the strongest determinant of all forms of disability. Osteoarthritis, especially in the hip, was a strong determinant of both occasional and regular need for assistance, and chronic low back pain was a strong determinant of reduced working capacity and occasional need for assistance among those aged 30-64 years. Other musculoskeletal disorders also determined the prevalence disability, but these relationships were reduced by taking comorbidity into account. A low level of education and a low (less than 20 kg/m2) or very high (at least 35 kg/m2) body mass index represented independent determinants of all forms of disability, and a history of physically strenuous work an independent determinant of reduced working capacity, when disabling illness was adjusted for. The proportion of all forms of disability attributable to musculoskeletal disorders, in models including, age, sex, other disabling illness and significant non-medical determinants of disability, was close to 20%. The disorders with the highest community impact were chronic low back pain among those aged 30-64, osteoarthritis of the hips and knees and inflammatory arthritis.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,1993 Jun,United States,1993,90
7977915,"The determinants of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in an insured population.","OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to identify the determinants of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in a population with full access to medical care. METHODS: Unionized New York City health care workers (n = 1394) with comprehensive medical insurance were screened for hypertension. Union records documenting all physician visits and prescription medications for the year before screening provided the opportunity to relate patterns of treatment to blood pressure outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 409 employees found to have hypertension, 289 (71%) were aware of their condition and 201 (49%) had been treated, but only 51 (12%) had their blood pressure controlled at the recommended level (< 140/90 mm Hg). In a logistic regression model, the only variable of treatment associated with control was days of antihypertensive medication. The total number of physician visits was not associated with control. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in conventional community settings, even in the absence of financial barriers, treatment for hypertension continues to be characterized by poor outcomes. Improving access to primary care, without changes in the nature of that care, may not substantially improve blood pressure control.",American journal of public health,1994 Nov,United States,1994,90
10346032,Ecological and geographic characteristics predict nutritional status of communities: rapid assessment for poor villages.,"The quality of poverty alleviation programmes relies heavily on appropriate targeting and priority setting. Major problems in assessing poverty include identification of the indicators of poverty and the methods used for its assessment. Nutritional status, expressed by anthropometric indices, has been proposed as a poverty indicator because of its validity, objectivity, reliability and feasibility. This study was conducted to explore the application of remote sensing to poverty mapping based on nutritional status at the community level. Relationships between the nutritional status within a community and the ecological characteristics of the community were investigated. Multiple linear regression tests were executed, and the resultant equations were tested for their validity in predicting communities with poor nutritional status. Among geographical and ecological indicators used, distance to the nearest market, main soil type, rice field area, and perennial cultivation area were found to be most useful predictors for the ranking of the communities by nutritional status. Among non-ecological determinants, food consumption, health service status and living conditions were also found as predictors. The highest correlation was found if total population was also taken into account in the regression model (R2 = 0.69; p < 0.0001). In the assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the eight models studied, 'undernutrition' was defined as a condition where a community belongs in the first quartile for nutritional status (highest prevalence of undernutrition), and the baseline nutritional survey was considered as a standard method for final diagnosis. Most models which included only ecological factors in the equations had lower sensitivity and specificity than models which included all determinant factors in the equations. All models which took into account the total population had higher sensitivity and specificity than those that did not take total population into account. The best model of those that took into account only the geographical and ecological characteristics of the community's living environment had similar sensitivity and specificity (80% and 94.1%, respectively) as the models that considered non-geographical and non-ecological variables in addition to geographical and ecological variables. In the case of West Sumatra, only four ecological and geographic characteristics were sufficient to predict poverty in village. Since these characteristics could be surveyed by remote sensing, it may well be possible to use remote sensing for a rapid method for poverty mapping.",Health policy and planning,1998 Dec,England,1998,90

This study reviewed the records of children and adolescents who received emergency mental health services in one New Jersey county during 6 months of 1990 (N = 226). Using a structured form to abstract data, information was obtained on demographics, precipitating problems, past mental health services, substance use, family problems, and disposition. While suicidal behavior was not a predictor of acute hospitalization, the interaction of assaultive and suicidal behavior was predictive. Other contributory factors identified in the multivariate analysis included: child's substance use, family member's substance use, and initial emergency screening site. Recognition of present utilization patterns will facilitate the development of intensive community-based options for those with acute mental health problems.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1993 Jan,United States,1993,90
9060780,Determinants of work satisfaction among Swedish dental hygienists.,"This study examines factors that contribute to work satisfaction among Swedish dental hygienists. A questionnaire was used to collect data on health, demographics, work-history, work characteristics, work satisfaction and social support at work. The questionnaire was mailed to 471 hygienists; 77.3% responded. 70% of the hygienists are highly or very satisfied with their work tasks. Active leisure and working in large cities were significantly related to high work satisfaction. The best linear regression model explained 48% of the variance in work satisfaction. Thirty percent of the variance was explained by work tasks perceived to be skills developing. Skills development in the profession appears low (median = 44%). After controlling work factors, work satisfaction increased with growing skills development for all hygienists, even for those less satisfied with their work. The findings suggest that the opportunities for developing professional skills should increase to improve satisfaction among dental hygienists. Measures should also be taken to improve the work climate, work stimulation, and job variation as well as reduce the collegial pressure at work.",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,1996,Sweden,1996,90

8454215,[Detection of psychosocial dysfunction in ob-gyn patients].,"The human behavior and its social determinants are critical variables for understanding the etiology, treatment, and prevention of many disorders previously attributed to biological substrates. Among the many categories of human behavior to receive special attention from health researchers and practitioners are life events, coping responses and emotional state. The relation between these categories constituted a particular field of investigation. This relationship rather than forcing to focus on disease, distress, disability, and other failures in human functioning, permits to address health, abilities, resources, and other positive aspects of human functioning. On the other hand, the re-organization of health services considers interdisciplinary work as an objective, as it is necessary to care for the patient in an integral manner, with the consequent benefit of a more efficient service. In addition it is known that patients with psychosocial dysfunctions who use general practice care facilities overutilize these services in an unnecessary manner. With this in mind it is clear that is necessary to balance the service's cost-benefit for a more efficient clinical attention. In this paper we present the results of the categories mentioned above: life events, coping responses and its relationship with emotional state in a representative sample of 399 female patients who in 1986 received services at the National Institute of Perinatology-INPer-. Of these patients, 297 were obstetrical patients -OBS- and 102 gynaecological ones -GINE-.

9659409,Environmental factors affecting nutritional status in urban areas of developing countries.,"The demographic and economic transition that many developing countries are undergoing is producing important changes in diet and lifestyle that greatly impact on disease risks. Among the risk behaviors associated with socioeconomic transition and urbanization are excessive dietary fat intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and environmental contamination. Combined with a reduced infant mortality and increased life expectancy, those risk factors lead to an increasing prevalence of chronic disease like non-insulin dependent diabetes and coronary heart disease. This disease. This disease profile is a relatively new phenomenon in developing countries, where health programs have traditionally focused on ""acute"" interventions such as immunization or oral rehydration. A new approach will be needed to address chronic diseases, which frequently demand a life-long and technically complex medical management, and may have significant impact on the quality of life and productivity of the population. Efforts to address this situation should focus on a) expanding the information base on diet, nutritional status and lifestyle changes in populations migrating to urban areas; b) developing and evaluating approaches for improving diet quality in urban populations, including fortification and community-based supplementation programs; c) understanding better the social and behavioral determinants of nutritional status in the urban poor; and d) defining the role of the food industry and of agricultural production for improving the quality of the food supply in urban areas.",Archivos latinoamericanos de nutricion,1997 Jun,Venezuela,1997,90

Mothers were first interviewed about their children when they were between the ages of 1 and 10 years old. Three subsequent interviews were conducted with the children when they reached adolescence and young adulthood. Results show support for the mediational model. In accordance with family interactional framework conceptions, there was a sequence in patterning: from parenting during early adolescence; to personality and peer factors, extending to smoking in late adolescence; and culminating in smoking in adulthood. With a developmental approach, a number of psychosocial measures were related in both younger and older children. Nevertheless, some interesting developmental differences emerged.

7694219,Investigation of antigenic determinants in thyroid peroxidase by synthesis of possible sequential peptides.,"One way to locate antigenic determinants in thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is to evaluate the binding of chemically synthesized peptides to autoantibodies. A major epitope of TPO involved in thyroid autoimmunity has been reported to be at residues 590 to 675. Therefore, we synthesized three peptides (P1, residues 603-610; P2, 615-630; and P3, 654-665) in the most antigenic part of this range, as judged by antigenicity analysis, and measured their antigenicity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Amino groups protected with fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl were used in the synthesis. Sera from 42 untreated patients with Hashimoto's disease and 30 untreated patients with Graves' disease were tested for binding with each peptide. In addition, 6 sera with antibodies against denatured and reduced microsomal antigen were tested. Sera obtained from 22 normal subjects were used as a control. Binding of sera from the patients with autoimmune thyroid disease to the synthetic peptides was weak, about 1% of binding to thyroid microsomes prepared from Graves' thyroid. However, the ELISA index of a mixture of P1, P2, and P3 was significantly higher in the patients with Hashimoto's disease than in the healthy subjects. For both P2 and P3, the ELISA index of the sera with antibodies against denatured and reduced TPO was higher than that of the sera from normal subjects. These results suggested 1) that the antigenic epitopes of TPO recognized by autoantibodies may be conformational and discontinuous, and 2) that antibodies against these linear portions of TPO may exist in patients with Hashimoto's disease.",Osaka city medical journal,1993 Jun,Japan,1993,90

9823996,The impact of comorbidity on mortality following in-hospital diagnosis of tuberculosis.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Despite the availability of curative chemotherapy, mortality remains high among patients hospitalized for tuberculosis. Although the elevated mortality rate is often attributed to the presence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) or concomitant infection with the HIV, other factors must be contributory, especially among the HIV-negative population. Therefore, we performed a study to define the factors associated with mortality following the in-hospital diagnosis of tuberculosis in a region with low levels of MDRTB and coinfection with HIV. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The eight hospitals in the Barnes-Jewish-Christian (BJC) Health System, which is a network of community and tertiary-care level facilities serving the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area. PATIENTS: All 203 patients hospitalized with culture-positive tuberculosis at one of the BJC system hospitals between 1988 and 1996. INTERVENTIONS: Follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview and review of medical and public health records. Death was verified through a search of the death certificate registry of Missouri and the records of the Social Security Administration. Mortality was defined as death from any cause during the 14 months following the initial date of hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The cumulative all-cause mortality rate for this cohort was 28.1%. The incidence of HIV positivity was 7.9% and of MDRTB was 1.5%. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.0 to 7.0; p < 0.001) and the presence of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (AOR = 7.0; 95% CI = 3.7 to 13.3; p = 0.002) were the largest contributors to mortality. Other variables independently associated with mortality included the presence of malnutrition (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.9; p = 0.007), age > 60 years (AOR = 3.5; 95% CI = 2.4 to 5.2; p < 0.001), drug-induced immunosuppression (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.6 to 5.2; p = 0.018), and dyspnea at the time of hospital presentation (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.1; p = 0.048). Overall, 45.3% of the patients had a > 7-day delay in the suspicion of the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the institution of antituberculosis therapy following hospital admission. There was no association between the presence of these delays and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the 14-month mortality rate is high among patients diagnosed as having tuberculosis during hospitalization, despite low incidences of HIV infection and multidrug resistant disease. The factors that appear to contribute to this elevated mortality rate are markers of disease chronicity and severity of not only the tuberculosis, but also of the patient's underlying health status. Thus, while HIV positivity and multidrug resistance can be important determinants of mortality in some populations, other demographic factors and comorbid conditions may play a role as well. These data also suggest that tuberculosis is often superimposed on chronic illnesses that are important determinants of patient outcomes.",Chest,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90

The content and extension of each hope, as well as the levels of internality, optimism and realization, were estimated from the answers. The results showed that a high level of family discussion increased interest in a future family. The influences of parental control and family discussion, however, change as adolescents grow older: the more 11-year-olds reported parental control, the less optimistic they were about the future but the more steps they had taken to realize their hopes. On the other hand, the higher the level of family discussion adolescents reported at the age of 15, the more optimistic they were and the more they had realized their hopes.

Benefits were identified in terms of three psychological well-being measures: self-esteem, depression and quality of life and in terms of one physical well-being measure: symptomatology. Data were obtained from one hundred and twenty Canadian women in managerial or professional occupations and in clerical-type occupations. Analyses consisted of correlations and hierarchical multiple regression. Intrinsic factors were generally related to psychological well-being while extrinsic factors were more closely associated with physical health. Findings with regard to the beneficial effects of social support in the workplace were not specific, however a cynical attitude can influence the value of the work role, with effects being particularly marked in the clerical group. Because of its relationship with health, it is recommended that cynicism is included in future women's studies.",Women & health,1993,United States,1993,90

Existing research and a newly completed 10-year survival study suggest that complex interrelations among biological factors, medical interventions, and specific dimensions of social differentiation determine survival differences. Patterns of interrelations among determinants of survival appear compatible with an ""economic"" model in some forms of cancer and a ""cognitive-behavioral"" model in others.

When the relationship between coping behaviour and the respondents' gender, age and ethnicity was investigated, it was found that older students use more Self-blame and Tension-reduction techniques than do younger students; and younger students use more work related strategies than do older students; males report using more Physical Recreation than do females whilst females use more Seeking Social Support, Wishful Thinking and Tension-reduction strategies. In general, the pattern of usage of different coping strategies, for the students participating in this investigation, indicates that adolescents' foremost response to their general concerns comprises attempts to deal directly with the causes of concerns while attending to both their own physical and social well-being.",Journal of adolescence,1993 Sep,England,1993,90

Teachers evaluated adaptive functioning, social withdrawal, and aggressive behavior at school for a carefully selected sample of 22 boys and 24 girls (ages 7-12) whose parents had been separated for two to 18 months. Regression analyses indicated that boys' overall school adjustment was associated with better maternal parenting skills, lower child fear of abandonment, less blaming of father for the separation, and positive parental verbal attributions toward the other parent. Girls with better overall school adjustment reported less blaming of their mothers and a higher rate of positive attributions by mother about father. These findings suggest concepts family physicians can use in working with families to minimize the effect of divorce on children.",Family medicine,1990 Mar-Apr,United States,1990,90
2056748,"Consequences of person-environment incongruence: absenteeism, frustration, and stress.","Two correlational studies using English nurses and working adults are reported that examined the relationship between the three measures of person-environment (P-E) fit as derived from Holland's (1973) theory and three dependent work-related variables. In the first study, the P-E fit measures of congruence, consistency, and differentiation were correlated with two measures of absenteeism, frustration, and various demographic variables. Contrary to predictions, two measures of absenteeism were positively correlated with congruence and consistency. In accordance with the hypothesis, however, frustration was highly negatively correlated with congruence and consistency. In the second study, consistency, but not congruence or differentiation, was significantly negatively correlated with stress, as predicted. These studies provide some support for Holland's theses, although not all hypotheses were supported, both for methodological and theoretical reasons. It is argued that P-E fit measures are useful predictors of occupational behavior in conjunction with other major determinants.",The Journal of social psychology,1991 Apr,United States,1991,90
10546963,"Determinants of aggression, and adaptive and maladaptive behaviour in older people with Down's syndrome with and without dementia.","In a cross-sectional study of aggression, and adaptive and maladaptive behaviour in 128 subjects with Down's syndrome (DS), 29 of whom had dementia, the current authors found that the presence of dementia was not predictive of aggression or maladaptive behaviour. However, the level of adaptive behaviour was shown to be lower in subjects with dementia, and in those with lower levels of cognitive functioning, as measured on a rating instrument, the Test for Severe Impairment. Although the presence of aggressive behaviours is not higher in subjects with dementia and DS on cross-sectional review, it remains to be seen whether aggression will increase in individual cases with the onset or progression of dementia. The decline in adaptive behaviour shown in the present study confirms the findings of previous studies and indicates a direction for service development for persons with the dual diagnosis of dementia and DS.",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,1999 Oct,England,1999,90

1458861,The chronic disease data bank model: a conceptual framework for the computer-based medical record.,"The principles underlying the chronic disease data bank model are straight-forward: (1) the purpose of medical care is to improve patient outcomes; (2) patient outcomes in contemporary developed societies are overwhelmingly linked to chronic illnesses and degenerative processes and will become increasingly so; (3) such outcomes have multiple determinants including the psychological and social, as well as the biologic; (4) outcome antecedents (risk factors) may precede clinical illness by years or decades; and (5) these complex characteristics require for their study (a) computer aid and (b) longitudinal data. The chronic disease data bank provides an important resource, available to many investigators, for examination of the complex set of clinical and policy questions arising with long-term illness and addressing the questions of lifetime health. The chronic disease data bank consecutively enrolls eligible subjects, follows them for life, and amasses time-oriented, multidisciplinary data including clinical findings, medical history, demographics, treatments, resource utilization and disease outcomes, and assessing both the quality of life and its duration. Analyses are longitudinal and time-series in type, examining changes in trends and tempo of the disease, and are focused upon long-term outcomes. Outcomes are regularly and carefully assessed, and include the outcome dimensions of death, disability, discomfort, iatrogenic toxicity, and dollar cost. Specific studies address the description of the disease from biologic, demographic, economic, and social viewpoints, identify the factors associated with good and bad outcomes, and assess the effects of treatment, both good and ill. The clinical and policy goals are focused upon delaying transitions from more benign disease states to more serious ones, thus improving both longevity and the quality of life. The time is appropriate to consider generalization of the chronic disease data bank model to the usual clinical care situation, with large rewards in improvement of the quality of care. The traditional medical record lacks systematic documentation of end results and of important covariates related to health risks. As such, it cannot readily be used to assess the ultimate quality of care and to establish a feedback loop to change behaviors and thereby improve outcomes. It is weak where the chronic disease data bank is strong. The technology is transferable.","Computers and biomedical research, an international journal",1992 Dec,United States,1992,90
2239359,Alcohol consumption in parents and offspring: a study of the family correlation structure in a general population.,"Alcohol consumption was recorded for 2390 spouses and 498 children of age 18 or above living with their parents. The spouse correlation was 0.67, whereas parent-offspring and sibling correlations were all close to 0.35. This family correlation structure implies an upper limit for heritability of 0.44. The design does not permit a separation of effect of cultural (environmental) and genetic transmission in families, but comparisons with previous heritability analyses suggest that heritability is in fact close to the upper limit, implying little or no cultural transmission. There were virtually no correlations between alcohol consumption and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Nor did consumption correlate substantially with symptoms in first-degree relatives. These results do not support hypotheses of common genetic nor even of common environmental determinants for alcohol consumption and mental disorders.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1990 Aug,United States,1990,90
8146138,Human ecology and behavior and sexually transmitted bacterial infections.,"The three direct determinants of the rate of spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are sexual behaviors, the mean duration of infectiousness, and the mean efficiency of sexual transmission of each STD. Underlying ecological and behavioral factors that operate through one or more of these direct determinants lie on a continuum, ranging from those most proximate back to those more remote (in time or mechanism) from the direct determinants. Most remote and least modifiable are the historical stages of economic development that even today conspicuously influence patterns of sexual behavior. Next are the distribution and changing patterns of climate, hygiene, and population density; the global population explosion and stages of the demographic transition; and ongoing changes in human physiology (e.g., menarche at younger age) and culture (e.g., later marriage). More proximate on the continuum are war, migration, and travel; and current policies for economic development and social welfare. Most recent or modifiable are technologic and commercial product development (e.g., oral contraceptives); circumcision, condom, spermicide, and contraception practices; patterns of illicit drug use that influence sexual behaviors; and the accessibility, quality, and use of STD health care. These underlying factors help explain why the curable bacterial STDs are epidemic in developing countries and why the United States is the only industrialized country that has failed to control bacterial STDs during the AIDS era.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994 Mar 29,United States,1994,90

1807070,Cognitive orientation and genital infections in young women.,"The purpose was to explore the psychological determinants of common genital infections in young women. The study was done in the framework of the cognitive orientation theory which assumes that cognition guides behavior and provides predictions of behaviors and psychophysiological phenomena. We expected that beliefs of four types (about self, norms, goals, and general) would predict the occurrence and/or frequency of 17 gynecological symptoms (e.g., itching, swelling, different vaginal discharges, abscesses). The subjects were 195 female volunteers, undergraduates, about 23 years old, without gross gynecological disorders, mostly (87.7%) unmarried, mostly (83.6%) having had intercourse. They were administered anonymously questionnaires about demographic variables, frequency and treatment of gynecological symptoms and 3 urological ones (for control), and about cognitive orientation that referred to pretested themes (e.g., assertiveness, hypochondriasis). Stepwise discriminant and regression analyses showed that the belief types enabled predicting the occurrence and frequency of all symptoms, with a mean 34.5% improvement over the 50% chance level, accounting for 45.7-67.2% of the variance. Also the urological symptoms were predicted although at a lower level. Discussion focuses on the specificity of cognitive-motivational determinants and their role in producing conditions favoring physical pathology.",Women & health,1991,United States,1991,90

The women had lost a child either by stillbirth (beyond the 20th week of gestation) or shortly after delivery. We assessed the long-term course of possible determinants of grief, a complicated grief response, as well as the patients' satisfaction with the treatment and their need for further psychotherapeutic support. The mourning response was complicated by a depressive reaction in 22%. Major risk factors were individual disposition, lack of partner and professional support. The findings reveal that the course of the grief response is positively influenced by: 1. open discussion (thematisation) with the skilled personnel and the patients' families, 2. direct or indirect contact with the deceased child (concretisation) and 3. the patients concerned being extensively informed as to place and circumstances of the funeral (whereabouts of the child).",Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde,1996 Jul,Germany,1996,90
9921324,Epidemiology and anthropology: an integrated approach dealing with bio-socio-cultural aspects as strategy for the control of endemic diseases.,"The control of endemic diseases has not attained the desired level of effectiveness in spite of the use of modern efficient technologies. The classic interventionist approach for the control of schistosomiasis is centered on systemic control of the snail hosts combined to large scale medical treatment and is usually carried out without social preoccupation due to the assisted communities. It is easy to understand the interest and the ethical compromise of public health research while producing studies in which the biological and social determinants as well as the cultural components should be considered and also encompass the historical dimensions and symbolic representations. In face of the recent political decision in favor of decentralizations of health administration to municipal level, we suggest, in the present paper, an integrated approach for the epidemiological diagnosis of an endemic situation at local level. Theoretical and methodological aspects from both, epidemiology and anthropology are discussed. Epidemiological methods can be used to detect the dependent variables (those related to the human infection) and the independent variables (demographic, economic, sanitary and social). Another methodological approach of anthropological/ethnographic nature can be conducted in order to make an articulation of the knowledge on the various dimensions or determinant levels of the disease. Mutual comprehension, between researchers and the people under investigation, on the dynamic transmission process would be relevant for a joint construction, at local level, of programmed actions for the control of endemic diseases. This would extend reflections on the health/disease process as a whole.",Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,1998,Brazil,1998,90

The dynamic interplay between network growth and individual migration labor, migration remittances, and local income distributions all create powerful feedback mechanisms that lead to the cumulative causation of migration.

A method to determine the contact patterns of adults that may lead to the spread of airborne infections.,"Although mixing patterns are thought to be important determinants of the spread of airborne infectious diseases, to our knowledge, there have been no attempts to directly quantify them for humans. We report on a preliminary study to identify such mixing patterns. A sample of 92 adults were asked to detail the individuals with whom they had conversed over the period of one, randomly assigned, day. Sixty-five (71%) completed the questionnaire, providing their age, the age of their contacts and the social context in which the contacts took place. The data were analysed using multilevel modelling. The study identified, and allowed the quantification of, contact patterns within this sample that may be of epidemiological significance. For example, the degree of assortativeness of mixing with respect to age was dependent not only on the age of participants but the number of contacts made. Estimates of the relative magnitude of contact rates between different social settings were made, with implications for outbreak potential. Simple questionnaire modifications are suggested which would yield information on the structure and dynamics of social networks and the intensity of contacts. Surveys of this nature may enable the quantification of who acquires infection from whom and from where.",Proceedings. Biological sciences,1997 Jul 22,England,1997,90

Detailed information gathered in interviews with 548 youths in 1989-90 and 1991-92, provide a history of change in condom use and HIV-related high-risk behaviors. Condom use as a whole increased with time and age. Positive beliefs concerning condoms and awareness of HIV transmission were determinants of increases in use, and negative beliefs were determinants of decreases. Nevertheless, those youths who engaged in the highest HIV-risk behaviors (prostitution, IV drug use, and male homosexuality) were no more likely than lower-risk youths to increase their condom use. Financial need, indicated by receipt of welfare, appeared to be a significant barrier to increasing condom use. Also noteworthy was the negative association between using health clinics and condom use. Although youths with high-risk behaviors make more clinic visits, those visits do not result in condom use.",Adolescence,1994 Winter,United States,1994,90

Low body mass index, high social class, high number of daily eating occasions, high day-to-day variation in energy intake, high number of urine tests and a long interval between insulin injection and eating were associated with good metabolic control. Many of these determinants reflect also the general compliance with the diabetic regimen. The results stress the importance of good coordination between insulin injections and eating habits.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1992 Mar,Norway,1992,90

In adolescence, early sexual initiation is associated with other ""problem behaviors"" (Jessor & Jessor, 1977). To explore an analogous association for the middle childhood years, we studied 126 boys aged 5 to 11 years at increased risk for the development of conduct-disorder-related behavior with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/4-18 (Achenbach, 1991) and reevaluated 112 of them 15 months later. At both time points, the boys scored higher on the Sex Problems scale as well as on the nonsexual CBCL scales than Achenbach's nonclinical norm sample. Within the at-risk sample, the Sex Problems scale was significantly related to externalizing problem behaviors, but also to the other CBCL scales of behavioral/emotional problems.

Cases were children admitted to hospital for 24 hours or more, between the ages of 28 and 364 days, with a diagnosis of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 5,304 children in the cohort, 152 (2.9%) were hospitalized with pneumonia. The positive predictive value of the clinical diagnosis compared to the radiological assessment was 76%. Analysis by conditional logistic regression showed that social class and maternal schooling were strongly inversely associated with pneumonia Children of adolescent mothers were twice as likely to be admitted. The relative risk for children whose mothers were of parity three or greater was 2.8 relative to primiparae. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy of less than 10 kg was associated with a 40% increase in risk. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic factors were important determinants of pneumonia admissions.

The Prevention Marketing Initiative is an application of marketing and consumer-oriented technologies that rely heavily on behavioral research and behavior change theories to bring the behavioral and social sciences to bear on practical program planning decisions. One objective of the Prevention Marketing Initiative is to encourage consistent and correct condom use among sexually active young adults. Qualitative formative research is being conducted in several segments of the population of heterosexually active, unmarried young adults between 18 and 25 using a semistructured elicitation procedure to identify and understand underlying behavioral determinants of consistent condom use. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the use of this type of qualitative research methodology in designing effective theory-based behavior change interventions. Issues of research design and data collection and analysis are discussed. To illustrate the methodology, results of content analyses of selected responses to open-ended questions on consistent condom use are presented by gender (male, female), ethnic group (white, African American), and consistency of condom use (always, sometimes). This type of formative research can be applied immediately to designing programs and is invaluable for valid and relevant larger-scale quantitative research.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1996,United States,1996,90

2020883,Measles control in the urbanising environment.,"The relationship between urbanisation and measles control is examined. In urban settings in developing regions measles is a disease of particular importance, since it tends to affect children at a younger age and with greater severity than in rural settings. A further finding in urban areas, especially peri-urban slums, is the lower measles vaccination coverage rates compared with rural regions. Factors identified as determinants of measles vaccination coverage among children under 2 years of age in urban areas include: home delivery; being born outside the urban setting; and length of stay in the city. These factors are probably related to the low socioeconomic status and lack of social integration experienced by new urban immigrants. A number of additional obstacles, such as distance, economic and cultural barriers, and inconvenient clinic hours all prevent parents from gaining easy access to vaccination services. In order to address the problems of measles control in expanding urban settings, a regional approach--with full integration of curative and preventive services--is called for. A more effective use of existing services will probably go a long way towards improving urban vaccination coverage with resultant measles control.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1991 Apr 20,South Africa,1991,90

The Social Readjustment Rating Scale of Holmes and Rahe was used to assign maternal stress scores established during an interview conducted within 36 hours of delivery. Only mothers without medical problems who had delivered liveborn infants were included. Maternal age, obstetric history, smoking history and stresses present during the 12 months preceding delivery were recorded. Of 535 Johannesburg and 662 Baragwanath mothers studied, 48% and 55% respectively reported significant stresses. Analysis of the two groups revealed that for the Johannesburg mothers, smoking, cumulative stress score and previous preterm birth were important determinants of birth weight. Of the stress factors studied, marital separation and death of a spouse were significantly associated with a lower birth weight. For Baragwanath mothers the major determinants of low birth weight were maternal age, loss of income through being dismissed from work, or having to leave school as a consequence of the pregnancy.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1991 Jan 5,South Africa,1991,90
10565506,Clinical determinants of suicidal ideation and behavior in geriatric depression.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to find clinical characteristics that can identify elderly patients with depression at risk for suicidal ideation and to determine their prognosis. METHOD: Suicidal ideation, past suicidal behavior, severity of depression, cognitive impairment, medical burden, disability, and social support were studied in 354 patients with depression aged 61 to 93 years. The patients had in-person evaluations every 6 months and telephone evaluations for a mean of 1.8 years (SD, 2.2). RESULTS: During the index episode, suicidal ideation was predicted by previous suicide attempts with serious intent (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-5.80), severity of depression (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16), and poor social support (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.18-2.65). Suicide attempts during the year prior to entry were reported by patients with a severe index episode (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00-1.11), impaired instrumental activities of daily living (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.93), and limited impairment in activities of daily living (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.14). At the initial evaluation, severity of depression, previous attempts, and seriousness of suicidal intent during previous attempts predicted the course of suicidal ideation (concordance correlation, 0.78). During follow-up, contemporaneous severity of depression was the most important determinant of suicidal ideation over time (concordance correlation, 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly individuals with severe depression, history of suicide attempts with serious intent, and poor social support are most likely to have suicidal ideation and should be targeted for appropriate interventions. Severity of depression is the strongest predictor of the course of suicidal ideation.",Archives of general psychiatry,1999 Nov,United States,1999,90
1506998,Preventing relapse in the treatment of nicotine addiction: current issues and future directions.,"Although smoking-cessation rates have continued to increase, the vast majority of smokers who quit eventually relapse. Between 1974 and 1985, over 1.3 million smokers quit during each of those years. However, 75% to 80% of those individuals resumed smoking within six months. This article describes the dynamic phenomenon of smoking relapse within the context of cyclical episodes of smoking and quitting during an individual's lifetime. Theories of the determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed and methods designed to prevent relapse are described. Smoking relapse is discussed in terms of three aspects of tobacco addiction: (1) biological-addiction mechanisms, (2) conditioning processes, and (3) cognitive-social learning factors. The major determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed, including nicotine withdrawal, stress, weight gain, social influences, conditioning factors, causal attributions, and environmental variables. A transtheoretical-developmental model is explored in the longitudinal investigation of the natural history of slips (lapses) and relapse episodes. Relapse prevention interventions are described that emphasize self-awareness, self-regulation, self-efficacy, affect regulation, social support, and lifestyle balance. Recent developments in pharmacological adjuncts to treatment are also examined. It is concluded that innovative relapse prevention methods need to be designed for hard-core smokers with histories of cessation failures, substance abuse and/or psychiatric impairment. These and other recommendations for future research on smoking relapse and relapse prevention are discussed.",Journal of psychoactive drugs,1992 Apr-Jun,United States,1992,90

These questions are explored using multiple regression analyses of data from the 1994 Canadian National Population Health Survey. Two measures of health are used: subjective health status and the Health Utilities Index (a measure of functional health status). By structural determinants we refer to age, family structure, main activity, education, occupation, income and social support. Behavioral determinants include lifestyle factors related to smoking, drinking, weight and physical activity. Findings indicate that the structures of social inequality are the most important determinants of health acting both independently and through their influence on the behavioral determinants of health. There are very real differences in the factors that predict women's and men's health. For women, social structural factors appear to play a more important role in determining health. Being in the highest income category, working full-time and caring for a family and having social support are more important predictors of good health for women than men. Smoking and alcohol consumption are more important determinants of health status for men than women, while body weight and being physically inactive are more important for women than men. Our findings suggest the value of models which include a wide range of structural and behavioral variables and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in the determinants of health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 May,England,1999,90
2378312,Objective and subjective dimensions of travel impedance as determinants of commuting stress.,"The stressful characteristics of commuting constraints are conceptualized in terms of both physical and perceptual conditions of travel impedance. This study develops and operationalizes the concept of subjective impedance, as a complement to our previously developed concept of impedance as a physically defined condition of commuting stress. The stress impacts of high-impedance commuting were examined in a study of 79 employees of two companies in the follow-up testing of a longitudinal study. Subjective impedance was overlapping but not isomorphic with physical impedance, and these two dimensions have differential relationships with health and well-being outcomes. The physical impedance construct received further confirmation in validational analyses and in predicted effects on various illness measures and job satisfaction. The newly constructed subjective impedance index was significantly related to evening home mood, residential satisfaction, and chest pain. Job change was also influenced primarily by commuting satisfaction. The results are discussed within an ecological framework emphasizing interdomain transfer effects and situational moderators of commuting stress.",American journal of community psychology,1990 Apr,England,1990,90
12320211,Continuity and change in Canada's unemployment-immigration linkage (1946-1993).,"""Between 1946 and 1976, variation in unemployment rates strongly affected the number of immigrants allowed into Canada. Implementation of the Immigration Act of 1976 should have weakened the effect of unemployment on immigration, for the Act requires that immigration levels be set after consideration of demographic as well as labour market conditions. Our analysis shows the unemployment-immigration linkage actually strengthened after 1978, and only weakened significantly after 1989. Since the government's annual immigration projections are excellent predictors of immigration landings, we conclude the Canadian state is highly capable of controlling immigration levels and thus the tightening of the unemployment-immigration linkage from 1978 to 1989 reflected the choice of regulators. Discussing future research in this area, we argue that if the immigration policymaking process was not restructured in the late 1980s, an adequate model of state-society relations in this area must account for both continuity and change. However, if the process was restructured, a revised or new theoretical framework is needed.""

Cluster analysis identified eight health-related behavior patterns in the Munich sample which were also found in the Bern sample. Predictors of health-relevant behavior patterns were analysed via multiple logistic regressions. Most results showed different effects on cluster membership between the two samples. Gender, professional status, social support from friends, and paying attention to regular meals were identified as predictor variables in both samples. Other variables identified as predictors occurred either in only one of the two samples or differed in the direction of their effect.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1999,Switzerland,1999,90

8909658,Determinants of functional health of low-income black women with osteoarthritis.,"This study examines 10 culturally relevant indices of physical, psychological, and social function in order to specify and quantify their influence on the multidimensional functional health of low-income Black older women who have a medical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and no known history of coexisting medical conditions that would cause severe debilitation. Using a non-experimental, correlational design, cross-sectional data were obtained in individual face-to-face interviews. A nonprobability sample of 100 low-income, community-living Black older female participants of two local senior centers were interviewed for analysis. Functional health was measured with the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2; physical function by body mass index, number of arthritic joints, and a timed 8-foot walk score; psychological function with scores for the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale, and Spiritual Perspective Scale; and social function by the sociodemographics of age, income, years of education, and household size. Multiple regression analysis data indicated that functional health was best explained by three interrelated variables: depression, timed 8-foot walk score, and number of arthritic joints. This combination of variables explained 45% of the variance in functional health. Depression was highly correlated with other predictors and explained the largest amount of variance. Findings emphasize the need for enhanced education of providers to stimulate development of health promotion/disease prevention programs that will decrease the occurrence and effects of depression, joint pathology, and physical immobility, thereby improving health-related outcomes for Black older women who have osteoarthritis.",American journal of preventive medicine,1996 Sep-Oct,Netherlands,1996,90

Critical disciplines for public health.,"The mission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Fifty years ago, CDC's efforts were focused on epidemiologic and laboratory studies of malaria, typhus, and plague. Today, CDC's activities cover a broad range of diseases and conditions, and a broader range of disciplines are required to address these diverse public health problems. The behavioral and social sciences have a critical role to play in helping the public understand risk group characteristics and the frequency, context, and determinants of risky behaviors and in developing, implementing, and assessing prevention programs. CDC is taking steps to foster an environment in which behavioral and social sciences can flourish and to integrate these sciences into all of CDC's prevention activities.

Both men and women in employment had lower overall mortality compared with that of all men, while those seeking work had higher mortality. The social class distribution of the unemployed did not explain all their excess deaths.

7785474,Evaluating multiple outcomes and gender differences in alcoholism treatment.,"This study followed 592 alcoholics (180 women and 412 men) after discharge from inpatient treatment. Multiple measures of treatment outcome were used to broaden our understanding of the process of recovery from alcohol abuse, and how that process differs for men and women. Patients were interviewed by telephone between 3 and 15 months after discharge to gather information about post-treatment experiences including: relationship with family, role performance, psychological impairment, and effort toward recovery. Additionally, if any alcohol use took place after treatment, information was collected about the pattern of alcohol consumption. Results indicated being married is consistently related to less drinking for men, while for women, being married contributes to relapse in the short term. The determinants of each measure of outcome were different for women and men, indicating that the process of recovery is not the same for both genders. The study confirms that drinking is related to other adverse outcomes for men, but not necessarily for women. It is evidence that women and men have different post-treatment functioning, and that different characteristics are predictive of these outcomes.",Addictive behaviors,1995 Jan-Feb,England,1995,90
1959514,Determinants of weight gain and overweight in adult Finns.,"We studied sociodemographic and behavioural factors as predictors of weight gain in 12,669 adult Finns examined twice with a median interval of 5.7 years. The association of these factors with the prevalence of obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) was also studied in a subsequent cross-sectional survey of 5673 Finns. In uni- and multivariate analyses, the risk of substantial weight gain (greater than or equal to 5 kg/5 years) was greatest for persons with a low level of education, chronic diseases, little physical activity at leisure or heavy alcohol consumption, and for those who got married or quit smoking between the examinations. Parity and energy intake predicted weight gain in women. The prevalence of obesity was inversely associated with the level of education and physical activity, and positively associated with alcohol consumption in men and parity in women. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of obesity by smoking or marital status. The recognition of socioeconomic and behavioural factors as important determinants of weight gain and overweight helps the planning of effective treatment and preventive programmes tailored for subjects at highest risk of obesity.",European journal of clinical nutrition,1991 Sep,England,1991,90
2046352,Following up on treated stutterers: studies of perceptions of fluency and job status.,"The present research aimed to investigate perceptions of fluency of persons treated with a fluency shaping technique called smooth speech. Four separate studies were conducted. The first showed that virtually all those treated were satisfied with their fluency following treatment. However, this satisfaction decreased to under half in the long term. The second study showed considerable opportunity in the long term for job promotion and upgrade in occupation for persons successfully completing a smooth-speech program. The third study compared employer perceptions of their employees' speech between a group who had received treatment for stuttering and a nontreatment control. The employers' perceptions of the treatment group were significantly enhanced, whereas no significant change occurred in employers' perceptions for the control group. The last study explored possible determinants of relapse in a population of treated stutterers. Results showed that most had experienced some degree of relapse, but had subsequently recovered. Few believed their relapse was associated with being embarrassed about using smooth speech. The majority believed their relapses were related to feeling pressured to speak faster. Investigating perceptions of fluency following treatment for stuttering seems an important goal for research in order to enhance treatment effectiveness. Directions for further research into this area are discussed.",Journal of speech and hearing research,1991 Apr,United States,1991,90
9422828,Toward an integrated framework for understanding child physical abuse.,"OBJECTIVES: The article constructed an integrated conceptual framework for understanding child physical abuse based on a content analysis of different theories. Three major determinants of physical abuse were identified: exposure to aggression, exposure to stressors, and access to resources. To test the framework, we included variables from all three major categories in the analyses. METHODOLOGY: Data from a case-comparison study that included 81 physically abusive and 148 nonabusive mothers was used. Logistic regression determined the relative importance of the predictors. RESULTS: The probability of child physical abuse varied in the expected direction with the number of emotional resources received (listening, help with decision-making, companionship), the number of stressors experienced, and the mothers exposure to physical abuse by their own mothers, current partners, and former partners. The estimation results showed that exposure to aggression in one's own childhood (abused by one's own mother) and exposure to domestic violence in one's adult life (abused by one's previous and current partners) were the most potent factors for predicting whether a mother physically abused her child. CONCLUSION: The results suggest further research on the interdependencies between domestic violence and child physical abuse.",Child abuse & neglect,1997 Nov,England,1997,90
9526726,Problems in search of solutions: health and Canadian aboriginals.,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the health status of Canadian Aboriginals, along with their perceived community health problems and proposed solutions to these issues. Data are drawn from the 1991 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS), which is a weighted random sample of the Aboriginal population. Comparisons were made with respect to group identity (North American Indian, Metis and Inuit) and geographic location (reserve, urban, rural and North) and across a series of health status and health care use indicators. Analysis reveals that geographic location, as compared with Aboriginal identity, appears to have a large impact with respect to health status and use of physician services. On-reserve Aboriginals, for example, reported a lower likelihood of having seen a physician and were more likely to rank their health as fair or poor. Location also influenced perceived community health problems and solutions. Self-identified problems included drugs, cancer and arthritis, while corresponding solutions included education, counseling and service access. Although the problems and solutions were relatively consistent across space, they too varied in their importance. In general, the results tend to reinforce the determinants of health framework, suggesting that the provision of health services is insufficient to remove health disparities on its own. Instead, broader social-welfare provisions must be considered.",Journal of community health,1998 Feb,Netherlands,1998,90

We examined 1) the general QOL of patients with diabetes, 2) the significance of the individual QOL aspects for the overall assessment of QOL, and 3) the modulating function of coping mechanism and particular personality traits. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 116 diabetes patients under intensified insulin therapy were studied, as were 107 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 66 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 229 students who served as control subjects. The examination was based on eight standardized QOL and personality questionnaires (354 items) and assessed by means of linear structural regression models (AMOS 3.6). RESULTS: The QOL of diabetes patients appears to be higher than the QOL of other chronically ill patients. Social, psychological, and physical aspects contribute to the overall QOL, although physical complaints receive a comparatively low weighting. Coping behavior and particular personality traits covary with all QOL aspects, giving these variables greater significance for the QOL than the existence of secondary illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that the various factors involved in the multidimensional construct QOL receive different weightings was confirmed, making a simple summary score for the general QOL appear unjustifiable. In addition, all aspects that are commonly understood as parameters of QOL are influenced by external factors, such as coping behavior, based on individual personality characteristics.",Diabetes care,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90

DESIGN: A survey design was used. SETTING: Emilia Romagna, Northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four healthy community-dwelling subjects aged 90 to 106 years. MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic variables, health behavior, anthropometric indices, and serum DHEAS levels were recorded. Functional assessment was performed by instruments currently used in geriatric practice: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: GDS scores correlated directly with MMSE scores and inversely with ADL severity scores. Poor education, institutionalization, sensory impairment, muscular mass loss, and lower DHEAS levels were the variables with the highest correlation to functional impairment. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and marital status were relatively unimportant. An inverse association was found between DHEAS levels and dependency scores of single ADLs (continence, mobility). CONCLUSION: Impaired cognitive and physical ability with no increase in depression prevalence was found in a sample of subjects more than 90 years of age free of major age-related disease. Muscular mass and DHEAS levels seem to play a role in maintaining physical independence. In turn, physical independence, as well as social and cultural factors, strongly affect the compliance of long-lived subjects with psychocognitive tests currently used in the clinical evaluation of younger old people, suggesting that these instruments are not reliable for screening for cognitive impairment and depression in the oldest old subjects.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
8475428,"Health needs, demand for health services and expenditure across social groups in Italy: an empirical investigation.","The shortage of empirical studies on socio-economic factors influencing demand for health care and inequalities across social groups is dramatic in the case of Italy. The present study aims at discussing these issues, although its results are to be considered mainly methodological, given the small dimension of the sample (n = 807). A survey was carried out in a 'qualitative' sample of 9 Local Health Units of different Italian regions. Attention was paid to report every 'illness episode', considered as a cause of demand for health services, within the reference period (4 weeks) in order to properly link health needs with utilization of health services and relative expenditure. The assessment of health status across social groups, using 4 different indicators, shows the weakest social groups as the most vulnerable. The same groups report higher per capita health services uses and expenditures than their morbidity conditions would require. Assuming equity to be defined as 'equal use for equal need' a particular use-need ratio is developed (i.e. health services used per illness episode) able to capture the 'intensity' of health services use and expenditure per need. The 'over-equity' towards the less favoured groups is interpreted as a possible accomplishment of the N.H.S. fundative goals. A structural model of determinants of health services utilization, carried out through the LISREL technique (R2 = 0.36), confirms the irrelevance of the social variables with respect to need variables.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Apr,England,1993,90
10558403,The law and the public's health: a study of infectious disease law in the United States.,"Law plays crucial roles in the field of public health, from defining the power and jurisdiction of health agencies, to influencing the social norms that shape individual behavior. Despite its importance, public health law has been neglected. Over a decade ago, the Institute of Medicine issued a report lamenting the state of public health administration, generally, and calling, in particular, for a revision of public health statutes. The Article examines the current state of public health law. To help create the conditions in which people can be healthy, public health law must reflect an understanding of how public health agencies work to promote health, as well as the political and social contexts in which these agencies operate. The authors first discuss three prevailing ways in which the determinants of health are conceptualized, and the political and social problems each model tends to create for public health efforts. The analysis then turns to the core functions of public health, emphasizing how law furthers public health work. The Article reports the results of a fifty-state survey of communicable disease control law, revealing that few states have systematically reformed their laws to reflect contemporary medical and legal developments. The Article concludes with specific guidelines for law reform.",Columbia law review,1999 Jan,United States,1999,90

The 1992 DOSMD study attributes this difference to culture. We review studies concerning the course of schizophrenia and conclude that the evidence for a more favourable course in developing societies is not conclusive. Indeed, a favourable course has also been reported in various industrialised societies. We also raise questions about the findings reported in the recent DOSMD study, including the conclusion that the putatively more favourable course is a product of culture.

8997789,Lest taxonomy become taxidermy: a comment on the relapse replication and extension project.,"In this commentary on the Relapse Replication and Extension Project, several points are addressed. First, the selection of the pretreatment ""baseline relapse"" as the key predictor variable for post-treatment relapse in the predictive and construct validity studies is questioned. It is doubtful whether retrospective accounts of drinking episodes after 4 days of abstinence qualify as relapse episodes for the following reasons: clients may not have been committed to abstinence (e.g. weekend binge drinkers); treatment may have included coping skill training for pretreatment high-risk situations (i.e. treatment intervention is viewed as a ""nuisance variable""). By assuming that a client's retrospective report of a poorly defined pretreatment ""relapse"" is predictive of the type of relapse episode experienced during the post-treatment follow-up assessment is to commit an error of ""taxidermy"" in evaluating the reliability and validity of the taxonomy; i.e. the tendency for researchers to ""stuff and permanently mount"" distal baseline episodes as static predictor variables, thereby depriving them of their dynamic and fluid role as proximal determinants in the relapse process. The difference between researchers who assess distal trait predictors of relapse and clinicians who focus more on proximal state predictors in conducting relapse prevention therapy is discussed and illustrated by means of a case study. Finally, the metaphor of relapse as ""falling off the wagon"" is described as an example of a systems approach to relapse prevention.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1996 Dec,England,1996,90
8567618,Impact of parent monitoring on initiation of drug use through late childhood.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether parental supervision and monitoring in middle childhood might have a sustained impact on risk of drug use later in childhood and adolescence. METHOD: An epidemiological sample of 926 urban-dwelling youths were individually interviewed annually, beginning in 1989 when the children were 8 to 10 years old, continuing through 1992. Standardized questions measured drug use, parenting behaviors, and other suspected determinants of drug use. RESULTS: Survival analysis estimates indicated that children in the lowest quartile of parent monitoring initiated drug use at earlier ages. The contrast in risk of initiating alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use across levels of parent monitoring was greatest when children were under 11 years old; at older ages there was no difference in risk. However, in analyses focused specifically on marijuana, cocaine, and inhalant drugs, we observed a sustained higher risk of starting to use these drugs among youths who had been monitored at the lowest levels in middle childhood. CONCLUSION: These results add to the chain of inference that effective supervision and monitoring in middle childhood by parents or guardians might induce a delay or prevent onset of drug use among youths living in urban areas, a hypothesis that now ought to be tested in rigorous field experiments.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1996 Jan,United States,1996,90

This study examines the thesis that the social organization of work in hospitals is an important determinant of the voluntary turnover rate among registered nurses. This perspective differs from previous work in this area in that both turnover and its determinants are conceptualized at the organizational rather than individual level, thus opening the way for administrative intervention to reduce turnover. The conceptual model is tested using multiple regression techniques on a sample of 435 hospitals. Results suggest that organizational characteristics and environmental conditions are important contributors to turnover. Organizational characteristics are stronger predictors of turnover than are economic factors.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Jun,England,1992,90

Variables examined as possible predictors of problems included circumstances under which people drink, feelings of alienation, and religious affiliation. Data for this study were collected continually from 1984 to 1989 using a random telephone survey of 2094 New York State residents aged 18 or older; the study sample was comprised of the 1076 who had consumed alcohol in the previous 30 days. Stepwise regression analyses examined the main effects of all possible predictors of problems while controlling for alcohol consumption. Forced-entry regressions examined interaction effects of problem predictors while controlling for basic demographics. Drinking with breakfast, smoking marijuana, and drinking in bars alone were all significant predictors of more problems. This suggests that problems are associated with an aberrant lifestyle (i.e., different from a typical lifestyle), although it makes no assumption about motivations. Further investigation of this subject area is warranted to ascertain which population subgroups are the most vulnerable to alcohol-related problems and to guide the design of prevention programs.",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,1999 Nov,England,1999,90

In this study, we developed and tested a model of alcohol etiology with 624 African-American and Hispanic 7th graders residing in public housing developments. The students completed questionnaires concerning their alcohol use, social influences on their drinking, their drinking attitudes and knowledge, their psychosocial skills, and demographic and behavioral control information. Logistic regression analyses indicated that social influences from adults, friends, and family members predicted alcohol use. Individual psychosocial characteristics, e.g., drinking refusal, lowered the odds of drinking. These findings imply that effective prevention approaches targeting minority urban youths residing in public housing developments should provide them with an awareness of social influences to drink, correct misperceptions concerning the prevalence of drinking, and train them in relevant psychosocial skills.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
10377661,[A study of experience and consequences of diabetes. Increased psychosocial support in the care of diabetes is needed].,"Having diabetes affects life in many ways. The achievement of well-functioning self-care is highly dependent on the patient's ability to come to terms with the disease as an integral part of life, an integration which in turn is crucially dependent on the patient's emotional experience of the disease and trustful relationships with the health care professionals involved. Thus, the caregiver's professional expertise must include knowledge of the medical, psychological and social aspects of the disease. The article consists in a review of the results and conclusions of a population study designed to examine insulin-dependent diabetics' experience of living with their disease, their use of, and attitudes to, diabetes care, and the social and psychosocial impact of the disease on their lifestyle. The principal determinants of the patients' relationship both to the disease itself and to diabetes care appeared to be gender and the presence or absence of chronic complications. Another finding was the need of increased psychosocial support expressed by many patients, which suggests medical social workers to be important members of the diabetes care team.",Lakartidningen,1999 May 5,Sweden,1999,90
8990587,The burden of aging: a theoretical framework for understanding the shifting balance of caregiving and care receiving as cohorts age.,"Unless changes occur in the way cohorts age, the future aging of the population will make the burden of caring for older persons an increasingly salient political issue in American society. There is no reason, however, why aging in the future should replicate the pattern of aging that currently exists. A helpful step toward understanding what social changes would reduce the burden that aging cohorts place on society is the development of aging theory. This article develops a theoretical framework that explicates factors determining the level of care given and care received by cohorts moving through different stages of later life. Four proximate determinants of caregiving and three proximate determinants of care receiving are specified. Once the proximate determinants are identified, attention is focused on social changes that could reduce the burden of aging produced by cohorts aging through later life in the future.",The Gerontologist,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90
1763283,Concepts of health and disease and caries prediction: a literature review.,"Biomedical determinants of dental caries have been more extensively investigated than psychosocial factors and their impact on caries prevalence and incidence seems to be greater. However, a majority of these investigations relate to children and adolescents. An implementation of social and psychologic variables may be more relevant regarding dental caries in adults. In addition, a multidisciplinary approach might improve our understanding of dental caries as a multifactorial disease and bridge the gap between a biomedical concept and a more holistic approach to dental health.",Scandinavian journal of dental research,1991 Dec,Denmark,1991,90
8172115,Vegetarian diets and colon cancer: the German experience.,"The study assessed mortality and morbidity risks as related to nutritional status of moderate and strict vegetarians in Germany. The total cohort of 1904 self-identified persons was followed up for 11 y. Compared with national mortality rates for Federal Republic of Germany, the observed deaths for all causes were below expectation by a factor of 0.44 for men and 0.53 for women. The mortality for colon cancer was reduced [standardized mortality ration (SMR 44.1 for men and 77.9 for women]. No deaths were observed from rectal cancer. A vegetarian lifestyle of long duration (> or = 20 y) was associated with decreased overall and cancer mortality. Other determinants of decreased cause-specific mortality were physical activity, body weight, and strictness of adherence to the life-style. The relationship between a vegetarian and fiber-rich diet and a decreased risk for colon cancer has been reported in many studies. In this study, the influence of other factors such as health-conscious behavior and a healthy lifestyle seem to indicate partly stronger effects than nutrition itself. This may explain the generally better health of moderate vegetarians.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1994 May,United States,1994,90
2236366,Genetic and environmental determinants of the lability of trait neuroticism and the symptoms of anxiety and depression.,"A genetic analysis was conducted on trait neuroticism and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a five-wave study of 462 twin pairs. Models that assessed the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors to the lability (within-individual variability over time) of these measures were fitted to the data. Previous results concerning the substantial genetic involvement in the level of neuroticism and symptoms were confirmed. However, it was found that neither genes nor the shared environment of the twins was a significant cause of lability of these measures. An attempt was therefore made to identify aspects of individuals' environments that might be responsible for lability of neuroticism and symptoms. Adverse life events were found to predict variability of symptoms, but not of neuroticism. The availability of close social ties or having affectionless control in childhood did not contribute to lability.",Psychological medicine,1990 Aug,England,1990,90
10405078,Antecedents of the risk of recovery from DSM-III-R social phobia.,"BACKGROUND: This study reports antecedents of recovery from DSM-III-R social phobia. METHODS: Retrospective data were obtained from 1116 individuals age 15 to 64 participating in a large population health survey in the province of Ontario, Canada RESULTS: Approximately 50% of the sample recovered from their illness. Survival analysis revealed a median length of illness of 25 years with peak periods of risk of recovery occurring between 30 and 45 years duration. Using discrete time multivariate hazard regression analysis, statistically significant predictors of recovery from social phobia included: childhood social contextual factors (one or no childhood siblings, a small town childhood place of residence), characteristics of the disorder (onset past the age of 7, less than three disorder symptoms), an absence of co-morbid health-related conditions and psychiatric disorders (chronic health problems and major depression), and the occurrence of co-morbid chronic health problems and major depression prior to the onset of the disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that social phobia in the general population is a chronic and unremittent disorder. Determinants of recovery are rooted in distal childhood circumstances, disorder attributes, and the physical and mental health status of individuals over the life course.",Psychological medicine,1999 May,England,1999,90

8180289,Effects on Navajo birthrate from loss of the intrauterine device.,"The concerns of relatively powerless groups may not be adequately addressed by health-care decisions based on market forces and on considerations of the general population. Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal. Available data are limited in their ability to assess impacts on small groups of health-policy decisions made for the population as a whole. A mechanism for surveilling such effects needs to be established to protect the interests of such groups, particularly when they have restricted alternatives.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,1994,United States,1994,90
8747497,Familial resemblances in alcohol use: genetic or cultural transmission?,"OBJECTIVE: Resemblances between parents and children for alcohol use can be due both to cultural transmission and genetic inheritance. We examined the genetic and environmental determinants of the familial resemblances in alcohol use. METHOD: With a parent-twin design a distinction was made between the contribution of genetic effects, the environmental influences shared by siblings and the effects of cultural transmission from parents to offspring. By questionnaire data on whether subjects had ever used alcohol were obtained from 403 Dutch families with a twin aged 15-16 years old and from 805 families with a twin aged 17 years and older. RESULTS: For 15-16 year olds, the resemblance between parents and offspring could be explained either by genetic inheritance or cultural transmission. Shared environment explained between 58% and 88% of the individual differences in adolescent alcohol use. For twins aged 17 years and older, 43% of the individual differences in alcohol use could be attributed to genetic factors and 37% to shared environment. There was no evidence for cultural transmission in this age group. CONCLUSIONS: For adolescents aged 17 years and older parental alcohol use did not create an environment that stimulated alcohol use in children. The resemblance for alcohol use between parents and their children aged 17 years and older could be explained by their genetic relatedness. For 15-16 year old adolescents, shared environmental influences were more important than for older adolescents. Only 10% of this shared environmental variance might be influenced by parental alcohol use due to cultural transmission.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1996 Jan,United States,1996,90

Migration of family groups is essentially characteristic of international migrants, although all the members of the family do not always move to the same place. Besides pendular and incomplete migrations, settlement in Dakar can be observed, probably corresponding to a progressive [severance] from the village of origin.

While much of the literature focuses on the physical and functional consequences of chronic and acute illness, we emphasize the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of physical frailty. The underlying assumption of our approach is that the psychological representation of illness and disability, as well as the social contexts in which they occur, are important determinants of their impact on patients and family members. We focus on both patients and their primary support persons and on the comparative analysis of different disabling conditions. A patient and family caregiver impact model is used to summarize major findings of our research program and to make recommendations for intervention research.",Journal of gerontology,1993 Sep,United States,1993,90
1458861,The chronic disease data bank model: a conceptual framework for the computer-based medical record.,"The principles underlying the chronic disease data bank model are straight-forward: (1) the purpose of medical care is to improve patient outcomes; (2) patient outcomes in contemporary developed societies are overwhelmingly linked to chronic illnesses and degenerative processes and will become increasingly so; (3) such outcomes have multiple determinants including the psychological and social, as well as the biologic; (4) outcome antecedents (risk factors) may precede clinical illness by years or decades; and (5) these complex characteristics require for their study (a) computer aid and (b) longitudinal data. The chronic disease data bank provides an important resource, available to many investigators, for examination of the complex set of clinical and policy questions arising with long-term illness and addressing the questions of lifetime health. The chronic disease data bank consecutively enrolls eligible subjects, follows them for life, and amasses time-oriented, multidisciplinary data including clinical findings, medical history, demographics, treatments, resource utilization and disease outcomes, and assessing both the quality of life and its duration. Analyses are longitudinal and time-series in type, examining changes in trends and tempo of the disease, and are focused upon long-term outcomes. Outcomes are regularly and carefully assessed, and include the outcome dimensions of death, disability, discomfort, iatrogenic toxicity, and dollar cost. Specific studies address the description of the disease from biologic, demographic, economic, and social viewpoints, identify the factors associated with good and bad outcomes, and assess the effects of treatment, both good and ill. The clinical and policy goals are focused upon delaying transitions from more benign disease states to more serious ones, thus improving both longevity and the quality of life. The time is appropriate to consider generalization of the chronic disease data bank model to the usual clinical care situation, with large rewards in improvement of the quality of care. The traditional medical record lacks systematic documentation of end results and of important covariates related to health risks. As such, it cannot readily be used to assess the ultimate quality of care and to establish a feedback loop to change behaviors and thereby improve outcomes. It is weak where the chronic disease data bank is strong. The technology is transferable.","Computers and biomedical research, an international journal",1992 Dec,United States,1992,90
8240431,A Canadian study of the total medical costs for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and the predictors of costs.,"OBJECTIVE: We conducted a cost identification analysis on 164 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who entered the Montreal General Hospital Lupus Registry between January 1977 and January 1990, compared their costs to the population of Quebec, and determined the predictors of cost. METHODS: In January 1990 and 1991, participants completed questionnaires on health services utilization and on employment history over the preceding 6 months, as well as on functional, psychological, and social well-being. The societal burden of SLE was determined in terms of direct costs (all resources consumed in patient care) and indirect costs (wages lost due to lack of work force participation because of morbidity). RESULTS: The mean total annual cost for 1989, as assessed in January 1990 and expressed in 1990 Canadian dollars, was $13,094. Although only 44% of the patients were fully employed, indirect costs were responsible for 54% of this total ($7,071). Ambulatory costs, primarily diagnostic procedures, medications, and visits to health care professionals, comprised 55% of direct costs ($3,331). The results of the 1990 cost determination were similar. On average, hospitalizations among SLE patients were 4 times more frequent than among the general population of Quebec (matched for age and sex), and the number of ambulatory visits to physicians was double that for the average resident of Quebec. Higher 1989 values of creatinine and a poorer level of physical functioning were the best predictors of higher 1990 direct costs (R2 = 0.29). A poorer SLE well-being score, a combination of education and employment status, and a weaker level of social support were the best predictors of higher indirect costs (R2 = 0.29). CONCLUSION: The direct and indirect costs for patients with SLE are substantial, and their respective predictors are distinct. Direct costs arise from organic complications which induce functional disability. Predictors of indirect costs are potentially amenable to psychological or social interventions and may be more easily modified than the determinants of direct costs, thereby improving patient outcome while simultaneously reducing disease costs.",Arthritis and rheumatism,1993 Nov,United States,1993,90
9427096,Care services for dementia patients: predictors for service utilization.,"AIM: The objective of this study was to examine service utilization figures among a representative sample of demented patients and to determine whether sociodemographic and health-related variables are associated with care utilization. METHOD: The study population was derived from a population-based, two-stage cross-sectional study in The Netherlands and consisted of 102 demented subjects. Four levels of care intensity were used: level 1, no use of professional care; level 2, use of one or more types of professional care by community-dwelling subjects; level 3, residential living in homes for the aged; level 4, long-term care in specialized nursing homes. Sociodemographic variables and variables related to mental and physical health, functional dependency and severity of dementia were studied as determinants of levels of care. RESULTS: Eighty-two per cent of the study subjects used one or more types of formal care and 55% were institutionalized. Multivariate analysis yielded age, severity of dementia, somatic disorders, dependency in terms of ADL and martial status as predictors of higher levels of care. Sets of predictors differed across different care levels. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the importance of the social network and the relevance of general medical treatment and an active approach towards decreasing the impact of ADL dependency in demented subjects.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,1997 Nov,England,1997,90
2311906,[Coping behavior and supplying medical information--a study of mothers having delivered a child with a lip-jaw-palate cleft].,"To be delivered of a child with cleft lip and palate is an extreme psychic stress factor for the mother. In coping with this, she is left to the support of the caring medical staff. Therefore, the aim of the present study was 1. to ascertain, to what extent mothers of children with cleft lip and palate are given information on the malformation, and receive emotional support by the medical staff; and 2. to determine the effect such experiences have on their ability to cope. For this purpose we developed a special questionnaire, which was completed by 154 mothers of such children. Retrospectively, a relevant part of them criticised not only the communication and the contents of information, but also the emotional support as deficient. A correlation between these determinants and largely insufficient coping was statistically confirmed. Our results should be taken into account in respect of the practical requirements when caring for mothers of children with a cleft lip and palate.",Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde,1990 Jan,Germany,1990,90
10157065,Health care provider choice: the North West Province of Cameroon.,"Health care is provided in many developing countries free of any charge at the point of delivery. This is attributed to the fact that health care is one of the basic human rights. While modern health care in public health units is free, patients in rural areas continue to use either self-care, traditional healers or both. In Cameroon, the idea of integrating traditional and modern medical practices is discussed by both traditional and medical practitioners. However, it is not very clear what influences the household's choice of one or the other. Within a health district, where there are many providers, the question as to whether or not there is a possibility of choice open to all is posed. This article reports on a study undertaken in a rural health district that shows that there are many factors that influence the choice of health care. Among these factors is quality of care which is the most important factor influencing the choice of health care provider. As quality of care increases in governmental health centres, their choice probability also increases. Other factors include: the time spent seeking treatment; household income and size; distance; and, cost of health care. Those with higher incomes tend to choose private health units and those with larger families tend to choose government health units. Other socio-cultural factors, difficult to model, appear to also influence the choice of providers. It is concluded that since household income influences the choice of private health units, policies targeting poverty alleviation should be instituted in the rural areas to provide households with income. This will enable them widened access to private health care and enable government to redeploy its scarce resources to maintain and extend services to needy areas.",The International journal of health planning and management,1996 Jan-Mar,England,1996,90

Physical independence and dependence are presented as two separate, continuous, and multiply determined constructs, and illustrations are provided of situations where people can be independent, dependent, not independent, or experience imposed dependence. The paper also discusses potential determinants of physical independence and dependence, including different domains of disability, the role of subjective perceptions, demographics, the physical and social/political environments, personal resources, attitudes and coping resources, illness and efficacy appraisals, and the nature of the assistive relationship. The paper extends work on physical independence and dependence by synthesizing the findings from previous studies and incorporating the findings from other relevant areas of research into the area. It also expands on the concepts of physical independence and dependence, as well as their determinants, and relates independence and dependence to other outcomes of interest such as service delivery.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Sep,England,1998,90
9406337,Factors influencing priorities in hospital social work departments: a director's perspective.,"This study compares the perceived influence of several factors, each representing a popular perspective, on priority setting in hospital social work departments: (1) leader characteristics of the director; (2) organizational characteristics of the department and hospital; and (3) the preferences of constituency groups. The authors surveyed the views of directors to ascertain influences on their allocation of resources. We find that organizational factors and the preferences of constituents are the strongest determinants of departmental priorities, with leader attributes playing a less influential role. An interesting discovery is that each factor's influence varies depending on the nature of the priority area. We conclude that all three explanations for how performance priorities are shaped-a political model, a leader influence model and an institutional model-find support. The authors interpret and assess the significance of these findings to the practice of social work administration in hospitals.",Social work in health care,1997,United States,1997,90
7851280,Suspected determinants of enrollment into detoxification and methadone maintenance treatment among injecting drug users.,"Our primary aim in this study has been to evaluate selected conditions thought to influence the entry of injecting drug users (IDU) into detoxification and methadone maintenance programs, making use of a prospective study design to strengthen a cross-sectional investigation of these conditions. To begin our investigation, we analyzed cross-sectionally gathered data on 2879 IDUs who had been recruited through extensive community outreach efforts and who were interviewed at the time of recruitment. We then tested our hypotheses about suspected determinants of entry into treatment by analyzing prospectively gathered data on 1039 active drug users who had no recent history of being treated for drug problems. Among these 1039 IDUs (a subset of the initial cross-sectional sample), 144 entered a detoxification program between their recruitment interview and their next follow-up interview, conducted about six months after recruitment (range: 3.5-9.5 months) and 64 entered a methadone maintenance program during that observation interval. Using multiple logistic regression analyses, we found that a recent drug overdose, relatively higher frequency of injecting drugs, and a history of prior arrest or treatment were independent predictors of entry into detoxification. Being married or living with a partner, being female, a lengthy duration of drug use (> 10 years), and a history of prior treatment were independent predictors of entry into methadone maintenance. These findings shed light on what appears to be a different profile of suspected determinants of entry into a detoxification treatment versus methadone maintenance treatment, and help to clarify some potential differences between treated and untreated drug users that ought to be considered when evaluating results of investigations with IDU participants recruited solely from treatment settings.",Drug and alcohol dependence,1994 Oct,Ireland,1994,90
10186847,Bearing the costs of our eldercare policies: work constraints among employed caregivers.,"For many caregivers, rendering aid to frail parents, grandparents, siblings, and spouses comes at a high price: compromised physical and mental health, disturbed relationships with spouse and children, truncated opportunities for social life, and, for caregivers who are employed, declining job performance. Using the 1982 National Long Term Care Survey's ""Survey of Informal Care-givers,"" this study investigates how the sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers, care requirements, the availability of backup caregivers, and conditions of employment affect the likelihood that caregivers will suffer work constraints. Estimations of both the probability of work constraints and hours of work reveal that proxies for work conditions figure prominently, as do care requirements. In the model of constrained work, ill health, financial burdens, and primary responsibility for care are significant determinants; the estimation of hours of work revealed that low income and competing care demands wielded major influence. Women and white caregivers are employed fewer hours, while spouses are more likely than other informal caregivers to face constrained work. Occupation, as an indicator of work conditions, is shown to be an important addition to the factors considered in investigations of circumstances that affect caregivers' experiencing work constraints.",Journal of aging & social policy,1993,England,1993,90
10163302,The effects of the child and adolescent trial for cardiovascular health intervention on psychosocial determinants of cardiovascular disease risk behavior among third-grade students.,"PURPOSE: The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health is a multi-site study of a school-based intervention designed to reduce or prevent the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The goal was to change (or prevent) related risk behaviors and the psychosocial variables that theoretically influence those behaviors. DESIGN: A nested design was used in which schools served as the primary unit of analysis. Twenty-four schools participated at each of four sites (Austin, San Diego, Minneapolis, and New Orleans). Each site had 10 control and 14 intervention schools. SETTING AND SUBJECT: Ninety-six schools (with more than 6000 students) in the four sites were randomized to three treatment conditions: control, school-based interventions, and school-plus-family interventions. The sample included approximately equal numbers of males and females and was 67.5% white, 13.9% African-American, 13.9% Hispanic, and 4.7% other. MEASURES: The psychosocial determinants included improvements in dietary knowledge, intentions, self-efficacy, usual behavior, perceived social reinforcement for healthy food choices, and perceived reinforcement and self-efficacy for physical activity. RESULTS: The findings indicated significant improvements in all the psychosocial determinants measured (p < .0001). The results revealed a greater impact in the school-plus-family intervention schools for two determinants, usual dietary behavior and intentions to eat heart-healthy foods. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support theory-based interventions for changing selected psychosocial determinants of cardiovascular disease risk behavior among children.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,1996 Jan-Feb,United States,1996,90

9881127,Interacting factors affecting illegitimacy in preindustrial northern England.,"Illegitimacy in a historic, single community at Penrith, Cumbria (1557-1812), has been studied using aggregative analysis, family reconstitution and time series analysis. This population was living under extreme conditions of hardship. Long, medium and short wavelength cycles in the rate of illegitimacy have been identified by time series analysis; each represents a different response to social and economic pressures. In a complex interaction of events, the peaks of the cycles in wheat prices were associated with rises in adult mortality which promoted an influx of migrants and a concomitant rise in illegitimacy. The association between immigration and illegitimacy was particularly noticeable after the mortality crises of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Children of immigrant families also tended to produce illegitimate offspring. Native and immigrant families responded differently to extrinsic fluctuations, and variations in their reproductive behaviour were probably related to access to resources.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Apr,England,1997,90
12320211,Continuity and change in Canada's unemployment-immigration linkage (1946-1993).,"""Between 1946 and 1976, variation in unemployment rates strongly affected the number of immigrants allowed into Canada. Implementation of the Immigration Act of 1976 should have weakened the effect of unemployment on immigration, for the Act requires that immigration levels be set after consideration of demographic as well as labour market conditions. Our analysis shows the unemployment-immigration linkage actually strengthened after 1978, and only weakened significantly after 1989. Since the government's annual immigration projections are excellent predictors of immigration landings, we conclude the Canadian state is highly capable of controlling immigration levels and thus the tightening of the unemployment-immigration linkage from 1978 to 1989 reflected the choice of regulators. Discussing future research in this area, we argue that if the immigration policymaking process was not restructured in the late 1980s, an adequate model of state-society relations in this area must account for both continuity and change. However, if the process was restructured, a revised or new theoretical framework is needed.""

It provides data on health status and health determinants not available from vital statistics and health service utilization. The Keewatin Health Assessment Study (KHAS), which was designed in collaboration with the Keewatin Regional Health Board (KRHB), surveyed a representative sample of the predominantly Inuit population in 8 communities in the central Canadian Arctic. The entire survey included 874 individuals in all age groups, of whom 440 were children and adolescents under 18 years of age, and consisted of questionnaires, clinical examination and laboratory tests. Of the large number of variables on which data were collected, some were of particular relevance to the health of children and the well-being of the family, including: (1) Child growth and development; (2) Nutrition and diet; (3) Social pathologies: suicide attempts and sexual abuse; (4) Oral health; and (5) Audiologic health. In addition to providing cross-sectional data, survey participants constitute a cohort which, if followed up longitudinally, can be used to determine the incidence of specific conditions and identify risk factors which promote or prevent their occurrence. An example of such a cohort study is one on acute respiratory infection. Surveys serve many functions--providing data for planning and evaluation, promoting community awareness of health issues, and addressing basic research questions.

1411704,Maternal health and the measurement trap.,"This paper focuses on the contribution of measurement-related factors to the neglect of maternal health in resource allocation for programmes and in public health research. As the recent interest in maternal health has now progressed beyond the need for information primarily for the purpose of advocacy, measurement-related factors have emerged as powerful constraints on programme action. Three outstanding needs for information can be identified: first, to establish the levels and trends of specific maternal health outcomes; secondly, to identify the characteristics and determinants of health outcomes; and thirdly, to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of programmes designed to influence health outcomes. In order to meet these needs, the emphasis placed on operational research by the current major initiatives in maternal health must be complemented by an equivalent emphasis on methodological studies. The call for improved information by international and national agencies should be made in unison with the call for action. Inadequate information is a reality that has to be faced throughout the world, but particularly in developing countries. The quality, quantity and scope of health-related data are the elements of this inadequacy and may be discussed in terms of four factors: the indicators, the data sources, the measurement techniques, and the conceptual framework. In this paper, the neglect of maternal health and the lack of information are shown to be self-reinforcing and constitute a measurement trap sprung by these four factors. Dismantling this trap has revealed a weak conceptual framework to lie at the very centre. Maternal health has tended to be conceptualized as a discrete, negative state, characterized by physical rather than social or mental manifestations, and by a narrow time-perspective focusing on pregnancy, delivery and the puerperium. The need to broaden this perspective and to develop equally broad operational definitions represent important steps forward that must be taken.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Oct,England,1992,90

The last data (1995) were analyzed in order to evaluate present smoking behaviour and to measure the influence of the social environment. RESULTS: In 1995 more than one out of three (35.1%) young people smoked at least once in a while; this smoking prevalence was nearly the same among boys (34.7%) as among girls (35.5%). Since 1977, the long-term trend of the rates showed a decrease and the monitoring of the starting age proved that adolescents began to smoke more and more later. The influence of peer and parents smoking was strong. The socioeconomic status of the family and also the amount of pocket money were other determinants of smoking. The family and school atmosphere played an important role as well. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of all these environmental variables on the young person's smoking behaviour underlines the necessity of developing simultaneously campaigns aimed at young people and actions among different populations. The emergence of a positive status for the non-smoker supports the choice of the strategies for the latest campaigns.",Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,1997 Nov,France,1997,90
2068599,Determinants of subject compliance within an experimental anti-HIV drug protocol.,"A study of subject compliance within an experimental anti-HIV drug protocol was conducted with 40 asymptomatic HIV seropositive persons participating in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of the effectiveness of ZDV. Subject compliance was assessed through the use of study nurse independent ratings. The 20 most compliant and 20 least compliant subjects were surveyed at a 6-month interval using a self-report instrument designed to assess perceived social support and other psychosocial factors thought to effect compliance. Results indicated that more adherent subjects lived further from their treatment site, did not live alone, saw their study nurse as supportive, and were more likely to depend on a significant other for a wide range of social, economic, and emotional support. Implications for the practical use of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are proposed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
8172115,Vegetarian diets and colon cancer: the German experience.,"The study assessed mortality and morbidity risks as related to nutritional status of moderate and strict vegetarians in Germany. The total cohort of 1904 self-identified persons was followed up for 11 y. Compared with national mortality rates for Federal Republic of Germany, the observed deaths for all causes were below expectation by a factor of 0.44 for men and 0.53 for women. The mortality for colon cancer was reduced [standardized mortality ration (SMR 44.1 for men and 77.9 for women]. No deaths were observed from rectal cancer. A vegetarian lifestyle of long duration (> or = 20 y) was associated with decreased overall and cancer mortality. Other determinants of decreased cause-specific mortality were physical activity, body weight, and strictness of adherence to the life-style. The relationship between a vegetarian and fiber-rich diet and a decreased risk for colon cancer has been reported in many studies. In this study, the influence of other factors such as health-conscious behavior and a healthy lifestyle seem to indicate partly stronger effects than nutrition itself. This may explain the generally better health of moderate vegetarians.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1994 May,United States,1994,90
8036985,Teenage motherhood: its relationship to undetected learning problems.,"This study describes characteristics of a group of 64 adolescent mothers and their infants who participated in a program for teenage mothers run by a local health department. A majority of the girls for whom California Achievement Test (CAT) scores were available scored one or more years below grade level in reading and in language skills. Relative delays in infant development (language and social domains) were also documented. High levels of self-esteem as well as general social acceptance (by adults and peers) of early out-of-wedlock parenting suggest that early motherhood may represent an alternative avenue to experiencing success for girls who are having academic difficulties. These findings, which suggest the likelihood of a high incidence of undetected learning problems in this population, indicate that these difficulties may have a significant relationship to the high rate of school dropout associated with adolescent motherhood. The findings bring into question the notion of ""unintended pregnancies"" and the wisdom of current federal policies for preventing adolescent parenthood that rely on the promotion of abstinence.",Adolescence,1994 Spring,United States,1994,90

Results of sociologic studies].,"This article intends to describe the present state and development of the psychophysical state of health of GDR graduates. Special attention is given to various quantities influencing the state of health, above all job-related determinants. The empirical basis is an interval study, carried out by the Zentralinstitut fur Jugendforschung Leipzig; this study registered and attended hundred of people from the beginning of their studies in 1970 during the following 15 years in seven intervals. Preferably social factors and determinants were studied empirically and partly problematical interrelations between health and working conditions and contents as well as critical development trends of health were pointed out. In this way important starting points for taking measures to influence exogene health determinants were fixed: especially questions of working contents, of correct appointment of graduates corresponding to their profession and qualification, of a permanent training of psycho-physical capabilities.",Arztliche Jugendkunde,1990,Germany,1990,90
8211537,Patterns of condom use and sexual behavior among never-married women.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Use of condoms is one of the main methods sexually active persons may choose to prevent infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Little is known about patterns of condom use among women in the United States. We provide a conceptualization of patterns of condom use and factors associated with these patterns. GOAL OF THIS STUDY: To examine patterns of condom use and associated characteristics among sexually active, never-married women in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth, which is a nationally representative sample of women in their childbearing years. RESULTS: Only a minority of sexually active, never-married women report using condoms, and even fewer report using them consistently. Women with characteristics traditionally associated with increased risk of infection with STD and HIV appear to be less likely to report using condoms and to report using them consistently. Women who report use of condoms to prevent STDs are more likely to report consistent condom use; less likely to cease using condoms; and more likely to initiate consistent condom use. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the need for innovative programming targeted for specific sexually active populations to promote both initiation and maintenance of use of condoms.",Sexually transmitted diseases,1993 Jul-Aug,United States,1993,90

DESIGN: This was a case-control study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia between 1991 and 1993. Altogether 100 injured and 400 uninjured child pedestrians aged 1 to 14 years were studied. Aspects of the child's social and physical environments, measures of his or her behaviour, cognitive skills, and ""habitual"" exposure to the road environment, as well as his or her knowledge of road safety, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: The likelihood of injury increased by 12% with each 10,000 vehicles per day increase in the volume of traffic (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05, 1.19) on roads most frequently crossed. In addition, the presence of visual obstacles on the verge of the child's street of residence increased the likelihood of injury by more than 2.6 times (OR 2.68, 95% CI = 1.42, 5.02). In contrast, the absence of footpaths was associated with a 52% reduction in the likelihood of injury compared with the presence of footpaths on the child's street of residence (OR 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.87). CONCLUSION: The amount of exposure to the road environment and the nature of the road environment to which the child pedestrian was exposed partly influenced the likelihood of injury in children from low socioeconomic areas, male children, and children aged 13 to 14 years. Until now, the excess incidence of childhood pedestrian injuries in these subgroups of the population had not been explained because the child's exposure per se had not been examined.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1996 Jun,England,1996,90
10430008,The prevalence and determinants of health care-seeking behavior for urinary incontinence in United Arab Emirates women.,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and sociodemographics of urinary incontinence (UI) in women in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Women at risk, such as multiparous and climacteric women, were selected from the community (n = 200) and health-care centers (n = 200) and interviewed about inappropriate urine loss in the past 12 months, using a structured and pretested questionnaire. Of these, 81 (20.3%) admitted UI; only 25 of these (30.9%) had sought medical advice. The reasons were embarrassment (38.2%), choice of self-treatment because of low expectations from medical care (38.2%), and preferring to discuss the matter with friends, assuming that UI is normal (23.3%). Sufferers were troubled by their inability to pray (90%) and to have sexual intercourse (33.3%). Perceived causes of UI were paralysis (45%), childbirth (35.4%) and old age or menopause (33.7%). UI is common yet underreported by UAE women because of cultural attitudes and inadequate public knowledge.",International urogynecology journal and pelvic floor dysfunction,1999,England,1999,90

Cultural and behavioural factors influence community prevalence of sexually transmitted disease (STD), illegal abortion, puerperal sepsis and contraceptive usage--all of which influence risk of PID. The relative importance of these factors will vary by region. Individual risk factors for the ascent of a lower genital tract infection are still poorly understood but are thought to be behavioural and immunological. Prevention of PID must be undertaken at several levels. At primary level, it requires a reduction in community risk. At secondary level, individual risk can be modified by ensuring diagnosis and treatment of STD before damage of the upper genital tract occurs. More attention to cultural factors should increase the potential for prevention at both levels.",Annals of tropical medicine and parasitology,1992 Aug,England,1992,90
10363349,Parent-child mediated learning interactions as determinants of cognitive modifiability: recent research and future directions.,"The main objectives of this article are to describe the effects of mediated learning experience (MLE) strategies in mother-child interactions on the child's cognitive modifiability, the effects of distal factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, mother's intelligence, child's personality) on MLE interactions, and the effects of situational variables on MLE processes. Methodological aspects of measurement of MLE interactions and of cognitive modifiability, using a dynamic assessment approach, are discussed. Studies with infants showed that the quality of mother-infant MLE interactions predict later cognitive functioning and that MLE patterns and children's cognitive performance change as a result of intervention programs. Studies with preschool and school-aged children showed that MLE interactions predict cognitive modifiability and that distal factors predict MLE interactions but not the child's cognitive modifiability. The child's cognitive modifiability was predicted by MLE interactions in a structured but not in a free-play situation. Mediation for transcendence (e.g., teaching rules and generalizations) appeared to be the strongest predictor of children's cognitive modifiability. Discussion of future research includes the consideration of a holistic transactional approach, which refers to MLE processes, personality, and motivational-affective factors, the cultural context of mediation, perception of the whole family as a mediational unit, and the ""mediational normative scripts.""","Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs",1999 May,United States,1999,90
10419794,Counseling youth in tobacco-use prevention: determinants of clinician compliance.,"OBJECTIVE: The rate and determinants of tobacco prevention and cessation counseling to youth were examined for orthodontists participating in a controlled trial to decrease the incidence of tobacco use among adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional interview design in private practice offices throughout Southern California was used. The survey was completed with 126 (82%) orthodontists. Clinicians randomly assigned to the experimental group (N = 77) received a 1.5 h workshop, anti-tobacco materials, reimbursement for provision of anti-tobacco prescriptions, and quarterly checkup visits. Control group clinicians (N = 77) did not receive training, materials, or visits. RESULTS: Experimental group clinicians talked to more adolescent nonsmokers about never beginning tobacco use than did control group clinicians (P < 0.05). Experimental group clinicians talked to more adolescent tobacco users than did control group clinicians; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Content and determinants of counseling were affected by participation in the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Though training and support increased prevention and cessation counseling, absolute rates remained less than optimal. Social learning factors were associated with prevention and cessation counseling.",Preventive medicine,1999 Jul,United States,1999,90
9493751,"State-level infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality: the contribution of selected structural socioeconomic variables.","Reducing infant mortality in the United States is a national priority. States' infant mortality rates vary substantially. Public health researchers, practitioners, and leaders have long argued that social and other structural factors must be addressed if health outcomes are to be improved. A knowledge of which structural variables are most strongly related to state-level infant mortality is needed to guide the development of policies and programs to reduce this mortality. The authors examine the importance of several structural (social, economic, and political) variables for state-level infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality. With the state as the unit of analysis, data for all 50 states were analyzed using multiple regression. Together, the structural variables accounted for two-thirds of the variance in infant and neonatal mortality rates and over half of the variance in postneonatal mortality rates. States with proportionately larger black populations had higher infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality rates. States with greater percentages of high school graduates had lower neonatal mortality rates but higher postneonatal mortality rates. The findings suggest that a better understanding of the relationship between states' social structure and infant health outcomes is needed if state-level infant mortality is to be reduced.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1998,United States,1998,90
10536390,The importance of social science research in protecting adolescents' sexual and reproductive choice.,"This paper reviews the ways in which social science research findings can influence action in the areas of reproductive health and rights. Essentially, social science research: (a) establishes the levels and patterns of behaviours, attitudes or perceptions; (b) explores factors underlying these behaviours, attitudes and perceptions; (c) explains programme and organisational impediments constraining, in practice, the exercise of informed choices or the acquisition of preventive and curative services; (d) monitors the extent to which interventions have been successful in modifying behaviours, attitudes or perceptions, and (e) facilitates an understanding of the policy, social and legal arenas that impinge on the determinants and consequences of reproductive choice. Findings highlight possible courses for legal, policy or programmatic interventions. Such research has enormous relevance for our understanding of reproductive and sexual health, and the health-seeking choices that women and men--from adolescent to adult--make in various settings, the constraints they face in making these choices, and the kinds of interventions that might enhance choices given the prevailing sociocultural context. Focusing on adolescent sexual and reproductive health and choice, the paper concludes that social science research findings are fundamental for informing efforts to protect reproductive rights.",Medicine and law,1999,United States,1999,90
7755702,Incidence of psychotic illness in London: comparison of ethnic groups.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare annual incidences of psychosis in people from different ethnic groups as defined in the 1991 census. SETTING: Catchment area of district psychiatric hospital. DESIGN: All people aged 16 to 54 years who made contact with a wide range of community and hospital services between 1 July 1991 and 30 June 1992 were screened for psychotic symptoms. Patients with such symptoms were interviewed face to face to collect information on demography, ethnic group, psychiatric history and symptoms, drug use, and how care had been sought. A key informant, usually a close relative, was also interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age standardised incidence of schizophrenia and non-affective psychosis according to the ninth edition of the International Classification of Diseases in each ethnic group. RESULTS: Ninety three patients took part, of whom 38 were assigned a certain or very likely diagnosis of schizophrenia (15 in white population, 14 in black, seven in Asian, and two in others). The age standardised annual incidence of schizophrenia was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.9) per 10,000 of the population. The incidence ratio for schizophrenia in all ethnic minority groups compared with the white population was 3.6 (1.9 to 7.1); the corresponding figure for non-affective psychosis was 3.7 (2.2 to 6.2). CONCLUSIONS: Raised incidences of schizophrenia were not specific to the African Caribbeans, which suggests that the current focus on schizophrenia in this population is misleading. Members of all ethnic minority groups were more likely to develop a psychosis but not necessarily schizophrenia. The personal and social pressures of belonging to any ethnic minority group in Britain are important determinants in the excess of psychotic disorders found.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1994 Oct 29,England,1994,90
12348291,A multi-level perspective on small-area health and mortality: a case study of England and Wales.,"""This paper considers morbidity and mortality variations at the small-area level in England and Wales and their relation to socio-economic factors. Separate affluence and deprivation effects on illness and mortality are identified from a single-level analysis, both exceeding the influence of social class, urbanity or ethnicity. A multi-level perspective is then adopted to explore ecological associations operating both at micro-area and higher level spatial scales. Contextual effects (higher level variability in the impacts of ward level variables) are identified in the effects of small area deprivation on mortality and illness, as well as cross-level interactions; thus the impact of small area social structure on health is partly defined by the wider regional and district setting.""",International journal of population geography : IJPG,1997 Sep,England,1997,90
7503131,Perspectives of public health and prevention.,"The average life expectancy at birth of Americans has increased 30 years since the turn of the century and is mostly attributable to public health measures. Although death rates for cardiovascular diseases have declined in the past two decades, cardiovascular diseases still cause more deaths in the United States than all other causes combined. The major etiologies of heart disease, atherosclerosis and hypertension, are associated with modifiable risk factors--high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diet, and inactivity. Social status and access to medical care are also important contributors. Consequently, the greatest potential for reducing heart disease mortality and morbidity rests with prevention and public health practice. Recent directions in health-care reform emphasize fiscal management, medical care, and clinical medicine, and not general health. This emphasis exacerbates policy and financing imbalances between preventive and curative medicine. Consequently, the concept of a health system needs to be designed more rationally to allocate resources that include prevention and health promotion. The Bogalusa Heart Study provides understanding of the early origin of cardiovascular problems and the environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to development of adult heart disease. To apply this information, public health models of intervention, like the school Health Ahead/Heart Smart program, are needed to address heart disease in the population. Changes in the true determinants of poor health, such as environmental factors and unhealthy behaviors, are the directions for prevention and future improvement in quality of life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The American journal of the medical sciences,1995 Dec,United States,1995,90

First cousin marriages were encountered in 32.03%, second cousin in 6.8%, distant relation in 10.5%, and no relation in 50% of all marriages, respectively. Inbreeding coefficients were compared with those of other countries. The most important variables affecting inbreeding were social tradition, religion, education, and place of residence--urban vs. rural. Secular trends appear rather stable since the early decades of the twentieth century, especially for first cousin marriages. Jordan society showed a deeply rooted traditional behavioral pattern when inbreeding is considered.",American journal of medical genetics,1992 Jul 15,United States,1992,90
10157065,Health care provider choice: the North West Province of Cameroon.,"Health care is provided in many developing countries free of any charge at the point of delivery. This is attributed to the fact that health care is one of the basic human rights. While modern health care in public health units is free, patients in rural areas continue to use either self-care, traditional healers or both. In Cameroon, the idea of integrating traditional and modern medical practices is discussed by both traditional and medical practitioners. However, it is not very clear what influences the household's choice of one or the other. Within a health district, where there are many providers, the question as to whether or not there is a possibility of choice open to all is posed. This article reports on a study undertaken in a rural health district that shows that there are many factors that influence the choice of health care. Among these factors is quality of care which is the most important factor influencing the choice of health care provider. As quality of care increases in governmental health centres, their choice probability also increases. Other factors include: the time spent seeking treatment; household income and size; distance; and, cost of health care. Those with higher incomes tend to choose private health units and those with larger families tend to choose government health units. Other socio-cultural factors, difficult to model, appear to also influence the choice of providers. It is concluded that since household income influences the choice of private health units, policies targeting poverty alleviation should be instituted in the rural areas to provide households with income. This will enable them widened access to private health care and enable government to redeploy its scarce resources to maintain and extend services to needy areas.",The International journal of health planning and management,1996 Jan-Mar,England,1996,90
7818975,HIV-infected women and sexual risk reduction: the relevance of existing models of behavior change.,"This article utilizes constructs of the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM) to examine condom use in a sample of 215 HIV-infected women in New Jersey. We find evidence that processes affecting condom use in HIV-infected individuals are similar to those found in HIV-negative individuals. Results suggest that partner-related factors are important to consistent condom use in HIV-infected women. Women are more likely to use condoms consistently if they have high perceived power to influence their partner's condom use, have partners who are HIV seronegative, and have partners who do not want more children. Conflicts with the partner decrease the probability of consistent condom use. Also negatively associated with condom use are the woman's use of drugs and/or alcohol and her belief that condoms reduce sexual enjoyment. Implications of these findings for designing interventions for HIV-infected women are considered.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1994 Oct,United States,1994,90

In the case of [Soviet] Central Asia, neither the various steps to bring down labour intensity in the farm sector, nor the falling standard of living in rural areas, could bring about migration from rural to urban areas. This was because in traditional societies economic mechanisms are not effective unless they are complemented by appropriate social and cultural policies. All policies were oriented towards the state's goal of vertical integration of regions with the central economy. In Central Asia in particular this policy resulted in serious distortions in the social and economic spheres.""",Europe-Asia studies,1995,England,1995,90

Data were obtained from parents by mailed questionnaires in two cross-sectional studies in 1991 (n = 3,330) and 1995 (n = 3,124). Prevalence of prone sleeping decreased from 37.6% to 8.7% (p < 0.05) in the German population and from 44.1% to 32.0% (p < 0.05) in the Turkish immigrant population. Parents who laid their infants prone in 1995 were less likely to follow advice from physicians, public media, and other parents (relative risks < 0.5, p < 0.05) and were more likely to have a low educational level, to be <20 years old, to be single parents, to have two or more children, to be raised in West Germany, or to be of Turkish ethnicity. Although the information on prone sleeping being a risk factor for SIDS became known among the population, these data suggest that subgroup-specific public intervention campaigns may be needed to reduce the prevalence of prone sleeping even further in those countries where no nationwide campaign has been initiated.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 Jul 1,United States,1999,90
8613659,Determinants of body size perceptions and dieting behavior in a multiethnic group of hospital staff women.,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to identify determinants of body size perceptions and their relationship to dietary behavior in a multiethnic group of women. DESIGN: A single interview consisting of the Massara and Stunkard body image cards (1979) and questionnaires on sociocultural background, anthropometry, and dieting history were administered to volunteers from the staff of a hospital. SUBJECTS: The sample was a convenience sample of 186 women representing a range of staff positions recruited from Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, NY; 174 completed the study. Data on 150 women are presented in this article. RESULTS: Height and weight-for-height were stronger predictors of accuracy of perceived body size than ethnicity. Tall, slight women were more likely to overestimate and short, heavy women were more likely to underestimate actual body size. Ethnicity had an interactive effect with height as taller European Americans were more likely to perceive their body size as larger than actual compared with Afro-Caribbeans and African Americans. Women with a history of dieting were more likely to overestimate their size and to view it as different from what is perceived as attractive to others. APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we conclude that body size is a stronger predictor of accuracy of perceived body size than ethnicity; and dieters overestimate their body size and believe it to be heavier than their social group would prefer.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1996 Mar,United States,1996,90

Theoretical definitions of health promotion and health education are presented. The author suggests that a variety of different approaches to health promotion can be adopted by nurses in practice, including education, persuasion, manipulation and attempts to promote an environment where healthy decisions about lifestyle can be made. Each strategy is examined and the advantages and the ethical limitations are explored. It is suggested that nurses may theoretically accept the notion of being a health promoter, but that in the reality of practice, their role may be primarily that of the health educator.

[The authors] assembled a new data set based on annual INS records of all new, legal immigrants over the period 1972 through 1995.... Inspection of our new data indicates that since the mid 1980s the average skill of new, U.S. legal immigrants has been rising relative to that of the U.S. population. An econometric analysis of a panel of country-specific measures of the skill of immigrants based on these data over the period 1972-1992 indicates that these changes are due in part to changes in immigration law and to the overall rise in the real purchasing power of countries outside the United States.""",Working paper series (National Bureau of Economic Research),1998 Oct,United States,1998,90

This analysis assesses the determinants of successful aging--whether or not an individual will live to an advanced age, continue to function well at home, and remain mentally alert. Over 100 separate indicators of demographic and socio-economic status, social supports, health and mental status in 1971 were available as potential predictors of successful aging. Indicators of access to health care over the period 1970-82 and indicators of diseases over this period were also available as predictors. Those who aged successfully were shown to have greater satisfaction with life in 1983 and to have made fewer demands on the health care system than those who aged less well. Despite the large number of potential predictors of successful aging which were examined, only age, four measures of health status, two measures of mental status, and not having one's spouse die or enter a nursing home were shown to be predictive of successful aging.",American journal of public health,1991 Jan,United States,1991,90

First of them is formed by biological determinants, forcing human sociates to function in the environment in a way which would maximize both--ability to survive and multioly, and the result of these strifes in expressed by the guarantees of population existence.

DESIGN: Community coronary event register from 1985 to 1991. SETTING: City of Glasgow north of the River Clyde, population 196,000. SUBJECTS: 3991 men and 1551 women aged 25-64 years on the Glasgow MONICA coronary event register with definite or fatal possible or unclassifiable events according to the criteria of the World Health Organisation's MONICA project (monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of coronary events; proportion of subjects reaching hospital alive; case fatality in admitted patients and in community overall. RESULTS: Event rates increased with age for both sexes and were greater in men than women at all ages. The rate increased 1.7-fold in men and 2.4-fold in women from the least (Q1) to the most (Q4) deprived socioeconomic quarter. The socioeconomic gradient decreased with age and was steeper for women than men. The proportion treated in hospital (66%) decreased with age, was greater in women than men, and decreased in both sexes with increasing deprivation (age standardised odds ratio 0.82 for Q4 v Q1) Case fatality in hospital (20%) increased with age, was greater for women than men when age was standardised, and showed no strong socioeconomic pattern. Overall case fatality in the community (50%) increased with age, was similar between the sexes, and increased from Q1 to Q4 (age standardised odds ratio 1.12 in men, 1.18 in women). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic group affects not only death rates from myocardial infarction but also event rates and chance of admission. This should be taken into account when different groups of patients are compared. Because social deprivation is associated with so many more deaths outside hospital, primary and secondary prevention are more likely than acute hospital care to reduce the socioeconomic variation in mortality.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1997 Feb 22,England,1997,90

First cousin marriages were encountered in 32.03%, second cousin in 6.8%, distant relation in 10.5%, and no relation in 50% of all marriages, respectively. Inbreeding coefficients were compared with those of other countries. The most important variables affecting inbreeding were social tradition, religion, education, and place of residence--urban vs. rural. Secular trends appear rather stable since the early decades of the twentieth century, especially for first cousin marriages. Jordan society showed a deeply rooted traditional behavioral pattern when inbreeding is considered.",American journal of medical genetics,1992 Jul 15,United States,1992,90
9467703,(Dis)respect and black mortality.,"OBJECTIVES: A growing number of studies have documented the deleterious health consequences of the experience of racial discrimination in African Americans. The present study examined the association of racial prejudice--measured at a collective level--to black and white mortality across the United States. METHODS: Cross-sectional ecologic study, based on data from 39 states. Collective disrespect was measured by weighted responses to a question on a national survey, which asked: ""On the average blacks have worse jobs, income, and housing than white people. Do you think the differences are: (A) Mainly due to discrimination? (yes/no); (b) Because most blacks have less in-born ability to learn? (yes/no); (c) Because most blacks don't have the chance for education that it takes to rise out of poverty? (yes/no); and (d) Because most blacks just don't have the motivation or will power to pull themselves up out of poverty? (yes/no)."" For each state, we calculated the percentage of respondents who answered in the affirmative to the above statements. Age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates in 1990 were obtained for each state. RESULTS: Both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). A 1 percent increase in the prevalence of those who believed that blacks lacked innate ability was associated with an increase in age-adjusted black mortality rate of 359.8 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval: 187.5 to 532.1 deaths per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites.",Ethnicity & disease,1997 Autumn,United States,1997,90

Population and Housing Censuses have been replaced by register based statistics since 1981. The key of the system is the unique Person Number used in all public administrations. A large number of registers is used as sources and is linked together in order to compile the best estimates of the statistical concepts. This allows for high quality statistics that are timely, consistent and well-suited for longitudinal studies. Problems of quality may arise from changes in the legislation or in the registers. A strong data protection policy is necessary in order to preserve the system.""",Statistical journal of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe,1995,Netherlands,1995,90
9060780,Determinants of work satisfaction among Swedish dental hygienists.,"This study examines factors that contribute to work satisfaction among Swedish dental hygienists. A questionnaire was used to collect data on health, demographics, work-history, work characteristics, work satisfaction and social support at work. The questionnaire was mailed to 471 hygienists; 77.3% responded. 70% of the hygienists are highly or very satisfied with their work tasks. Active leisure and working in large cities were significantly related to high work satisfaction. The best linear regression model explained 48% of the variance in work satisfaction. Thirty percent of the variance was explained by work tasks perceived to be skills developing. Skills development in the profession appears low (median = 44%). After controlling work factors, work satisfaction increased with growing skills development for all hygienists, even for those less satisfied with their work. The findings suggest that the opportunities for developing professional skills should increase to improve satisfaction among dental hygienists. Measures should also be taken to improve the work climate, work stimulation, and job variation as well as reduce the collegial pressure at work.",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,1996,Sweden,1996,90
8900703,The development and evaluation of a computer-aided diabetes education program.,"This paper describes the development and evaluation of a computer-aided learning (CAL) program. The program was tested in a trial that involved 36 people with diabetes; 20 received CAL lessons in diabetes management and 16 attended conventional diabetes classes conducted by diabetes educators. When measurements taken before and three months after the education were compared, both groups showed significant improvement in their knowledge; the blood glucose levels of the CAL group were significantly lower but those of the conventional education group were higher. This means that the CAL program was as effective as conventional education in imparting knowledge but it was more likely to motivate people to control their glucose levels. The CAL program allows diabetes educators to spend less time on education in basic knowledge and to concentrate more on motivational and social factors that are important determinants of patient compliance. It can also benefit people with diabetes whose access to health professionals and/or conventional diabetes education is restricted.",The Australian journal of advanced nursing : a quarterly publication of the Royal Australian Nursing Federation,1996 Winter,Australia,1996,90

1514126,"Violent and accidental mortality among four immigrant groups in Canada, 1970-1972.","For most people immigration to a new country such as Canada entails a positive move and an improvement in life. The many challenges associated with resettlement may, however, lead to insurmountable difficulties, stresses and conflict for a significant number of newcomers. The mortality experience of immigrants, as reflected in cause-of-death statistics, may provide indication of the extent of stress and conflict in their migration experience. This situation is most clearly exhibited in mortality from suicide, homicide, and motor vehicle accidents. In this study, hypotheses concerning immigrant mortality in Canada are developed and tested with a log-linear model for rates pertaining to rare events. Overall, the results give support for the importance of country-of-origin effects in explaining suicide propensities, but not for homicide and motor vehicle accidents mortality. Income discrepancies are a significant determinant of variability in death rates overall, but discrepancies between the immigrants in this study and the Canadian-born are not of much significance. The strongest net effect on the cause-specific death rate is associated with group membership. This effect likely reflects a number of residual unmeasured sources of variation including the influence of the immigrant ethnic community as a source of social support, and the potential confounding effects of migration selectivity.",Social biology,1992 Spring-Summer,United States,1992,90
10703183,Innovative multidisciplinary research in environmental epidemiology: the challenges and needs.,"The ability of epidemiology to determine the relationships between health and environmental insults has become exceedingly difficult. The multifactorial nature of disease and the diversity of the insults, which include biologic, physical, social and cultural factors, combined with genetic susceptibility, suggest the need to develop better models of multidisciplinary epidemiologic investigation. This paper highlights the needs of an environmental epidemiologic team, discusses ways to incorporate new ideas across disciplines and to integrate constructs and paradigms of social, ecological, cultural and population determinants with individual-based exposure assessments. Innovation will be the key to the survival and increasing importance of epidemiology in addressing the public health needs of the future, but what are the ways to enhance and encourage creativity in environmental epidemiology? The process of self-renewal and continuing education will be highlighted. Additionally, the complexity of the problems and the need for clear supervision and control of multidisciplinary research efforts require a forum of communication and an 'information-processing approach' beyond those in traditional epidemiologic studies. New approaches in data management and medical informatics must be incorporated into the epidemiologic investigative framework. Methods to be included should focus on opportunities for computer-supported sharing of ideas. Such capabilities minimise the geographic distances and the disparate knowledge and training of the investigators and bring the team closer to the objectives and functions inherent in multidisciplinary investigation.",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,1999,Poland,1999,90
2299337,Psychosocial predictors of survival in end-stage renal disease.,"Several psychosocial variables were investigated as predictors of 4-year survival in a sample of 97 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing treatment by hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, or renal transplantation. Hypothesized psychosocial predictors included depression, mood disturbance, life happiness, affect, pessimism, self-esteem, knowledge of renal disease and its treatment, perceived control over important life domains, perceived intrusiveness of ESRD into important life domains, illness-related concerns, difficulties in daily activities, number of regular leisure activities, somatic symptoms of distress, social networks, recent negative life events, and defensive response styles. Methodological controls were incorporated to test the prognostic significance of these variables and included a) exclusion of deaths attributable to ""unnatural"" causes; b) multivariate statistical controls for physical and demographic determinants of survival; c) widely used standardized psychosocial instruments; and d) temporally aggregated psychosocial measurements to enhance reliability. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses identified four variables as significant and independent predictors of increased survival times in ESRD: a) comparatively fewer serious nonrenal comorbid illnesses; b) younger age; c) regular involvement in an increased number of leisure activities; and d) overall life happiness described as ""an even mixture of unhappiness and happiness"" (as compared with ""very happy""). However, no evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that increased depressive symptoms and/or moods contribute to compromised survival in ESRD.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1990 Feb,United States,1990,90

It is argued that the demographic deficits of an aging population can only be corrected to a limited extent through immigration. Any solution, in order to be effective, must include a simultaneous increase in the birthrates of Germany and other European Community countries. With particular regard to future social development in Germany and the EC, it would be advisable for governments to effect measures that will provide both for controlled admissions of immigrants from outside the EC and an increase in local reproductive capabilities.""",The International migration review,1995 Fall,United States,1995,90
8570803,Health education campaign on population control: lessons from Iran.,"A descriptive study was carried out in Tehran, the capital of Iran, to investigate a health education campaign on population control. A sample of 68 adults aged 20 to 40 years participated in the study. Each respondent was shown a picture of the campaign. They then filled in a short questionnaire. The main objectives of the study were to measure recall rates and to assess attitude of the subjects. The study results show that recall rates were high (78%), 68% of respondents claimed that the campaign is likely to change their attitudes towards population control, and 87% of participants perceived the main idea of the campaign correctly. The study findings show that there are some significant associations between demographic variables (marital status, having child or not) and perception of the campaign. These may lead health educators and health promoters to communicate more effectively and efficiently in the context of family planning. In countries with a large number of young people, health education campaigns on population control with respect to social values of each society and moral considerations are recommended.",Public health,1995 Nov,Netherlands,1995,90

A sample of 128 African-American women, 18-29 years of age completed a baseline interview and 3 months later completed a similar follow-up interview (n = 100). Compared to women who were inconsistent condom users, women who were consistent condom users were more likely to: have high assertive communication skills (OR=13), desire not becoming pregnant (OR=8.6), have high sexual self-control over condom use (OR=7.6), perceive having control over their partners' use of condoms (OR=6.6), be younger (OR=5.8), and report having a partner that was not committed to the relationship (OR=3.3). Prospective analyses identified baseline level of condom use as the best predictor of condom use at 3-month follow-up. Women who were consistent condom users at baseline were 6.3 times as likely to be consistent condom users at 3-month follow-up. In conclusion, HIV prevention programmes for women need to be gender specific and need to be implemented before high-risk behaviours are established and may be more difficult to modify.",International journal of STD & AIDS,1998 Mar,England,1998,90
1749959,Seasonality of vital events in a Pacific Island population.,"Analyses of vital data derived from a family record register for the native population of Guam reveal significant variations in births, deaths, and marriages over the period 1901-41. Although lacking marked photoperiod or temperature changes of temperate zones, the tropical island is subject to marked seasonal differences in rainfall characteristic of western Pacific islands. Marital patterns exhibit troughs associated respectively with the Lenten period and with Christmas celebrations. Infant and childhood deaths show close correspondence with rainfall patterns, consistently exceeding expected values during the rainy season (July-November) when conditions are optimal for the spread of communicable and gastrointestinal diseases. Births attain a peak in November, or at the beginning of the more advantageous season for infant health and survival. Seasonality in vital events, reported for many Euroamerican and some African and Asian populations of modern and historical periods, has rarely been documented for native populations of the tropical Pacific. Comparisons of differences in these patterns among different populations in varied environments provide unique opportunities to evaluate causal models of interactions among biological, sociocultural, and physioenvironmental factors.",Social biology,1991 Spring-Summer,United States,1991,90
1745950,Early life nutrition in the Gelukspan Health Ward.,"Breast-feeding, supplementary feeding and weaning practices as well as nutrition during the second year of life were studied in 210 black primiparas, who had cared for their own children through the first year, in a poor, one-crop (maize) rural area in Bophuthatswana. The sampling strategy was similar to the one recommended by UNICEF for assessment of vaccination coverage. Only 1 child had never been breast-fed and 60% were still breast-fed at the time of the interview during the second year of life. A number of factors were detected that seem important determinants of breast-feeding behaviour, e.g. marital status and level of formal education. Early supplementary feeding and early weaning were identified as major problems. Children were weaned onto commercial feeds or low-energy-dense staples, and there was also an obvious lack of energy-dense foods (e.g. butter, coconut oil) during the second year of life. Some determinants of these practices were recorded. The data have implications for the health services and should influence social and educational policy for the area. If properly implemented, the recommendations could result in significant financial saving for the study population. The health services should promote appropriate nutritional education, starting with antenatal care, early and frequent attendance at child health services should be encouraged and education concerning nutrition should be strengthened, and health education should encourage prolonged breast-feeding, discourage the use of commercial weaning foods, and encourage the use of natural multimixes (e.g. bananas, beans, cooking oil) for weaning. The importance of energy-dense foods should be emphasised to mothers and to health workers.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1991 Dec 7,South Africa,1991,90
8794456,Women for women's health: Uganda.,"The primary health care model targets social, political, and economic environments as key determinants of health for populations, as well as for individuals. If nursing in Uganda is to make a difference in health care outcomes and in the health of all Ugandans, nurses must look broadly at situations and be educated to practice primary health care nursing. After 14 years of civil war, Uganda is finally experiencing a period of reconstruction and rehabilitation: the whole infrastructure is undergoing a face-lift. Ugandan nurses recognize that their educational preparation has stagnated for many years and that it was not only the political unrest in their country that put them behind professionally. They realize that, given the new directions set by the government, they must become prepared to implement primary health care. They are demanding a university education so they may take their place alongside other health care providers prepared at the university level. Some of the most convincing arguments for a university program for nurses came from doctors at the university who spoke about the need to raise the standards of nursing practice, the quality of teachers, and the morale of practitioners. One nurse said: ""If we lose hope for a BScN program, I think all the nurses will quit and we won't have any new students going into the profession."" This program is designed to improve the health and well-being of all Ugandans, especially the most vulnerable groups of women and children in rural areas, through strengthening and expanding health services by targeting the educational preparation of nurses. Health planners in Uganda envision the professional nurse as key to the implementation of the national health policy of primary health care. University-educated nurses should be able to assess problems, make clinically sound decisions, and act appropriately within the scope of nursing practice. They should be able to interact and consult collegially with other health care professionals. Placed in rural community sites, nurses should function independently as community leaders, health education facilitators, primary health care practitioners, and educators for nursing students. Such intervention in community health care by BScN nurses should improve health care utilization and decrease mortality and morbidity from preventable causes. BScN nurses should make an impact on health care policy, nursing education, and primary health care. The evaluation of this project needs to be as comprehensive as its development and implementation. It will focus on health outcomes, particularly for women and children in rural areas of Uganda. Measurement of the effects of the process of nursing education (the BScN curriculum) in terms of output (nurses educated and placed in rural practice, nursing education, or government policy posts), outcomes (change in health status of rural communities), and broader impacts (changes in the status of women and in government policy toward women, nurses, or health at the local, regional, and national levels) is planned. An element of sustainability is present, as an operations research structure will be left in place at the community level. Timing, as the saying goes, is everything, and this project has had good timing. Our belief in the efforts and the goals of the project also gave us the strength to get support from various funding agencies for ""small"" things. For example, we got support from churches in the United States for building schools in Uganda; we persisted with the women's income-generating project when other support was pulled; we got books for the library in Uganda and got clothes, books, and furnishings for the students who came to this country. The motivation for project personnel has been altruism. The services that the two consultants provided to their Ugandan colleagues have extended far beyond the scope of the project.",Nursing outlook,1996 May-Jun,United States,1996,90

8922084,Is breastfeeding beneficial and maternal smoking harmful to the cognitive development of children?,"The effects of breastfeeding on cognitive, visuomotor and language development were examined in healthy children born at full term, after they had reached 56 months of age. Three hundred and sixty-three children were breastfed for less than 5 months, and 363 for 5 months or more. The groups were matched pairwise having regard to maternal education and sex of the child. Significant differences were found in relation to scores reflecting general cognitive capacity, and the results of the visuomotor integration test between children breastfed for less than 5 months and those breastfed for 5 months or more, and between children of mothers who had smoked during pregnancy and non-smoking mothers. In multiple linear regression analysis prolonged breastfeeding was significantly related to scores reflecting general cognitive capacity and results of the visuomotor integration test. However, smoking by mothers during pregnancy was not significantly related to scores in cognitive tests. Biological factors, and factors such as lifestyle and social background, may be more important determinants of a child's development than breastfeeding.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1996 Oct,Norway,1996,90
8334668,Community intervention. Creating opportunities and support for cancer control behaviors.,"Much of the potential for reducing cancer mortality is dependent on the adoption of new behavioral patterns. Such changes demand application of the behavioral-social sciences. A shift from univariate reductionist models of causation toward multivariate systems models is needed. Decisions (and behavior) are the focus of much of the behavioral-social sciences. Determinants of decisions are delimited by controlling systems. Health care is only one of many possible influences on controlling systems, and its influence is only marginal for the behavior of the general public. Thus, community interventions that address multiple determinants within controlling systems are needed to influence most behaviors. Belief saliency hierarchies appear to psychologically mediate controlling systems. Changes in these saliency hierarchies lead to changes in behaviors. Person-valued beliefs, social-valued beliefs, and feasibility beliefs serve as the informational basis for the hierarchies. Needs activation is a primary means by which hierarchies shift. Changing environmental cues and signals also impart such shifts. Experience, persuasive communication, and value extracted from the environment also change hierarchies. Needs activation, community presence, persuasive communication, facilitation, inhibition, and experience-based interventions are discussed for tobacco use control, dietary change, and breast and cervical cancer screening behavior. Emphasis is given to how the health care system can become a part of the controlling system that influences community behavior. Issues concerning successful implementation of community education programs are raised.",Cancer,1993 Aug 1,United States,1993,90
7770318,Comparison of HIV+ and HIV- adolescents: risk factors and psychosocial determinants.,"According to the World Health Organization, half of the 14 million people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide were infected between the ages of 15 and 24 years. However, details about HIV-positive (HIV+) youths' risk-related behavior and social context have not been previously reported. OBJECTIVES. To outline detailed sexual and drug use practices, social and psychological status of HIV+ youth compared with a cohort of HIV-negative (HIV-) youth; and to examine the ability of the health belief and risk-taking models to predict sexual and drug use acts of HIV+ youth. METHODS. HIV testing was conducted on and a 207-item structured interview covering HIV risk-related acts, protective factors and background information was administered to 72 HIV+ and 1142 HIV- adolescents aged 13 through 21 years receiving care in an adolescent clinical care unit of a large medical center in New York City. Data were analyzed for adolescents reporting sexual intercourse (71 HIV+ and 722 HIV-) by logistic regression analysis of five domains to identify variables significantly associated with HIV seropositivity. RESULTS. Logistic regressions indicated significant differences in sexual risk acts based on serostatus and gender. Anonymous, blinded seroprevalence testing identified 11% more HIV+ adolescents than would have been identified by current counseling and testing practices. HIV+ adolescents were significantly more likely to be sexually abused (33 vs 21%, P < .05), engage in anal sex and survival sex (32 vs 4%, P < .01), unprotected sex with casual partners (42 vs 23%, P < .05), have had sex under the influence of drugs (52 vs 27%, P < .01), have a sexually transmitted disease (59 vs 28%, P < .01), use multiple drugs (43 vs 9%, P < .01) and engage in multiple problem behaviors (72 vs 30%, P < .01) than HIV- young people. HIV+ females reported more oral (69 vs 45%, P < .01) and/or anal (42 vs 12%, P < .01) intercourse compared to HIV- females. HIV+ males reported significantly higher rates of both insertive (82 vs 46%, P < .05) and receptive (51 vs 4%, P < .01) oral and anal (53 vs 13%, P < .01) intercourse than HIV- males. Protective factors were not significantly different for HIV+ and HIV- young people. CONCLUSIONS. Routine, confidential HIV counseling and testing should be considered for adolescents having unprotected sexual intercourse when age-specific services are available for HIV+ youth. Prevention programs should consider adolescents' history of abuse, homelessness, and other social as well as psychological dimensions in designing comprehensive care strategies to address HIV+ adolescents' multiple problem behaviors and living situations. Current theoretical models of health behaviors should be reconsidered, given the lack of their association to HIV risk acts of HIV+ youth. Age-specific services and interventions for HIV+ youth are urgently needed as HIV is spreading among youth worldwide.",Pediatrics,1995 Jan,United States,1995,90

The time and number of ejaculations associated with loss of sperm motility and loss of sperm eosin vital staining were also evaluated. ""Azoospermia"" was defined on the basis of two consecutive azoospermic semen samples collected at least 3 days apart. The single decrement life table method was used to calculate weekly gross cumulative life table rates for the time to azoospermia, zero motility, and zero viability. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the product-limit estimates of the cumulative rates for the total number of ejaculations to azoospermia, 0% motility and 0% viability. The median time to azoospermia was 10 weeks and at the end of week 20, the life table rate (+/- standard error) was 93.0 (+/- 6.30) weeks/100 men. The median number of ejaculations to azoospermia was between 25 and 30, and the cumulative rate (+/- standard error) at 60 ejaculations reached 94.5 (+/- 5.16)/100 men.",Contraception,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
9415853,Social determinants of experienced anger.,"We investigated two social determinants (i.e., availability of social support and status differentials of the provocateur) for the degree of perceived anger in two populations. Because no suitable tool was available, the conceptual and psychometric development and validation of a new vignette-based measure for anger level (STandardized Experience of Anger Measure, STEAM) is described first. Two versions of STEAM were developed: one for students and one for community-living adults. Through a series of four studies, two sets of a 12-item vignette-based questionnaire were developed and validated. The resulting test had excellent test-retest stability and high internal consistency. Using the new STEAM measure, a variety of analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized influence of social determinants of anger. In the student sample, presence of social support was associated with lessened anger, and in both samples decreasing status of the provocateur also led to lessened anger arousal. In addition, findings in both samples revealed that social support reduced anger when the provocateur was of higher status relative to situations of equal and lesser status. In the community sample, the availability of support was associated with greater intensity of the anger experience in the lesser status condition than in the equal or greater status condition. No gender main effects or interactions were noted.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90

Comparatively little attention has been given to the growth of Adolescent Psychiatry, a sub-discipline that has achieved definition in the last two decades. Its dependence on cultural and political economic transformations is unique insofar as it first required construction of its clientele, namely adolescence itself.

10351466,"The effect of delivery mechanisms on the uptake of bed net re-impregnation in Kilifi District, Kenya.","The results of recently completed trials in Africa of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITBN) offer new possibilities for malaria control. These experimental trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates. Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used to deliver the intervention provide few indications of what coverage of net re-treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and financing strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and re-treatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controlled trial on the Kenyan coast, a series of suitable delivery strategies were used to continue net re-treatment in the area. The trial adopted a bi-annual, house-to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge using research project staff and resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued to children. During the year following the trial, sentinel dipping stations were situated throughout the community and household members informed of their position and opening times. This free re-treatment service achieved between 61-67% coverage of nets used by children for three years. In 1997 a social marketing approach, that introduced cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net re-treatment services. The immediate result of this transition was that significantly fewer of the mothers who had used the previous re-treatment services adopted this revised approach and coverage declined to 7%. The future of new delivery services and their financing are discussed in the context of their likely impact upon previously defined protective efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimates.",Health policy and planning,1999 Mar,England,1999,90
2292740,Why doctors do what they do: determinants of physician behavior.,"Direct payments to physicians account for about 20% of the medical care dollar, but physician decisions cause over 80% of the costs of medical care. Decision making can be viewed in a number of ways: as pure information processing, as an interaction with various stimuli, including financial penalties and incentives, and as social behavior, interacting with and reacting to peer and leadership influence. The model that accounts for the greatest amount of the available data is a multifactorial one that takes all of these views into account. The most successful behavior change efforts use a variety of mutually reinforcing approaches, and must be present constantly or behaviors revert to highly variable (lower quality) actions and decisions. This appears to be a behavioral version of the second law of thermodynamics (entropy increases spontaneously). The best practice model to manage costs and quality appears to be one in which physicians and administrators have adequate up to date information available, make group decisions, develop and continuously improve agreed upon methods of practice, interact and think before acting, and have rewards for such behavior.",Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,1990 Dec,United States,1990,90
8240210,Familiality of female and male homosexuality.,"We examined data from a large cohort of homosexual and heterosexual females and males concerning their siblings' sexual orientations. As in previous studies, both male and female homosexuality were familial. Homosexual females had an excess of homosexual brothers compared to heterosexual subjects, thus providing evidence that similar familial factors influence both male and female homosexuality. Furthermore, despite the large sample size, homosexual females and males did not differ significantly from each other in their proportions of either homosexual sisters or homosexual brothers. Thus, results were most consistent with the possibility that similar familial factors influence male and female sexual orientation. However, because results conflicted with those of some other studies, and because siblings' sexual orientations were obtained in a manner likely to yield more errors than in these other, smaller studies, further work is needed using large samples and more careful methods before the degree of cofamiliality of male and female homosexuality can be resolved definitively. We also examined whether some parental influences comprised shared environmental effects on sexual orientation.

Focusing mostly on the recent US and European experiences, I suggest that lay world views legitimating social inequalities are often in conflict with explanations arising from social epidemiology and medical sociology. The dominance of medicine in public health, through its often implicit assumptions about the biological determinants of human behaviour, is also identified as a barrier to teaching social inequalities in health. Educational elitism, which restricts higher education to members of the upper middle class, is identified as another barrier to teaching social inequalities in health. On the other hand, teachers in this field can benefit from a recent growth of empirical studies during the last decade aimed at understanding the social determinants of health inequalities. Finally, I suggest that familiarity with current critical scholarship within public health, as well as the use of techniques developed by sociologists to teach social stratification, can be valuable resources for teaching social inequalities in health.",Scandinavian journal of public health,1999 Sep,Sweden,1999,90
10073194,Hypertension in community-dwelling elders from a statewide study: implications for nonpharmacologic therapy.,"This study used multivariate analysis to determine the sociodemographic variables that predict whether hypertensive elders who are aware of their disease deliberately make lifestyle modifications aimed at controlling their hypertension. The data are from the 1990 Panel Study of Older South Carolinians (n = 6,473). The researchers performed five separate logistic regressions, each to predict the odds that the elders made specific lifestyle changes to reduce their hypertension. The dependent variable in the first regression was 1 = quite smoking to reduce hypertension and 0 = did not quite smoking to reduce hypertension. Changing diet, exercising, taking medication, and using stress management techniques were the dependent variables in the second, third, fourth, and fifth regressions, respectively. Significant determinants included age, gender, marital status, socioeconomic status, previous medical history, and social participation. This paper discussed implications for prevention programs.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90

8935459,"A case-control study of childhood pedestrian injuries in Perth, Western Australia.","STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify the determinants of childhood pedestrian injuries, taking the child's exposure to the road environment into account. DESIGN: This was a case-control study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia between 1991 and 1993. Altogether 100 injured and 400 uninjured child pedestrians aged 1 to 14 years were studied. Aspects of the child's social and physical environments, measures of his or her behaviour, cognitive skills, and ""habitual"" exposure to the road environment, as well as his or her knowledge of road safety, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: The likelihood of injury increased by 12% with each 10,000 vehicles per day increase in the volume of traffic (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05, 1.19) on roads most frequently crossed. In addition, the presence of visual obstacles on the verge of the child's street of residence increased the likelihood of injury by more than 2.6 times (OR 2.68, 95% CI = 1.42, 5.02). In contrast, the absence of footpaths was associated with a 52% reduction in the likelihood of injury compared with the presence of footpaths on the child's street of residence (OR 0.48, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.87). CONCLUSION: The amount of exposure to the road environment and the nature of the road environment to which the child pedestrian was exposed partly influenced the likelihood of injury in children from low socioeconomic areas, male children, and children aged 13 to 14 years. Until now, the excess incidence of childhood pedestrian injuries in these subgroups of the population had not been explained because the child's exposure per se had not been examined.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1996 Jun,England,1996,90
8463634,Determinants of social support among gay men: the context of AIDS.,"In this study, the determinants of social support are examined among a probability sample of gay men residing in San Francisco. Using two waves of data (collected in 1985 and 1987), cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses focused on the effects of five sets of factors (demographic, community integration/network, AIDS-related loss, individual, and health) on satisfaction with three types of support (emotional, informational, and practical). Personal acceptance of one's gay identity and talking to family members about AIDS showed the strongest positive associations with concurrent measures of support and changes in support satisfaction over the two-year period. Conversely, depression and number of HIV symptoms were negatively associated with cross-sectional support and support changes. Family knowledge of respondents' homosexuality interacted with HIV symptoms, such that knowledge was negatively associated with support among those experiencing greater numbers of HIV symptoms. Findings suggest that those most in need of support may be the least satisfied with the support they receive. Family appear to have the potential to be particularly helpful or especially harmful to gay men trying to cope with the AIDS crisis.",Journal of health and social behavior,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90

This data was used to characterize the clinical and epidemiological profiles of the endemic desease in the population, allowing for the determination of the efficacy of the potable water supply and the specific treatment of those infected with S. mansoni. The district contains three locations, Ravenopolis, Ravena and Lavapes, where the prevalence of the endemic disease was, 20.1%, 42.6% and 63.9%, respectively. The prevalence in the district was statistically higher in men. The age brackets that displayed differences by gender were 10-14 and 15-19 years. Severity of infection was statistically different among individuals within the 10-14 year bracket in ali three locations, and in the 15-19 year bracket among individuals from Ravenopolis and Ravena. The hepatointestinal form was associated with age, and individuals under 15 years of age presented risk of infection 8.85 times higher than adults. Multivariable analysis of the factors involved in transmission of the disease showed that Lavapes was independently associated with infection. In that area, poor sanitary conditions and the proximity of houses to streams infested with S. marsoni cercariae facilitated infection of neighborhood women while performing domestic activities, as well as men digging sand from the streams for construction. These results show the focal nature of transmission of the endemic requiring specific intervention for effective control of disease.",Cadernos de saude publica,1995 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1995,90

A sample of 294 men in treatment at a Department of Veterans Affairs Alcohol Treatment Unit was assessed during treatment and 3 months after discharge. Results of the cross-sectional structural equation analyses indicated that the personality characteristics of extraversion and neuroticism were related to both social network properties and perceived social support. Characteristics of the alcoholic's social network were also related to perceived availability of support. Longitudinal analyses of perceived social support after treatment indicated that two social network properties (size of the network and the proportion of confidants) were predictive net of initial levels of social support. Extraversion and neuroticism were found to be indirectly related to perceived social support at Time 2 through their effects on social network properties and perceived social support during treatment. Implications of these findings for models of the nature and determinants of perceived social support are discussed.",Journal of personality,1997 Sep,United States,1997,90
10146560,The determinants of four cancer-related risk behaviours.,"This paper reports research into the determinants of four cancer-related risk behaviours: smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, high fat consumption and exposure to artificial sunlight. The results indicate that the four types of risk behaviour are determined by several factors: the perceived behaviour of the social environment, individual's attitudes towards the risk behaviour and self-efficacy perceptions on changing the risk behaviour. High fat consumption differs from the other risk behaviours in that people tend not to be aware of their high fat consumption. No significant relationships were found among the risk behaviours apart from small correlations between smoking and heavy alcohol consumption, and between high fat consumption and heavy alcohol consumption. The implications of these results for the development of behaviour change programs are discussed.",Health education research,1993 Dec,England,1993,90
8189347,Self-stereotyping and social context: the effects of relative in-group size and in-group status.,"In 2 laboratory experiments, the tendency to stereotype oneself in terms of one's group membership as a function of the social context was examined. Experiment 1 examined the effects of relative in-group size on self-stereotyping. The results confirmed the prediction that minority members are more likely than majority members to stereotype themselves. Experiment 2 examined the interactive impact of relative in-group size and in-group status. As predicted, a high (relative to a low) status of the in-group increased self-stereotyping primarily for minority members, but not for majority members. Moreover, analyses of the differences in perceived in-group and out-group homogeneity suggest that the in-group homogeneity effect should also be interpreted in terms of self-stereotyping processes. Finally, the interplay between cognitive and motivational determinants of self-stereotyping is discussed as well as a possible distinction between self-stereotyping effects on individual level versus group level self-representations.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1994 Apr,United States,1994,90
8172115,Vegetarian diets and colon cancer: the German experience.,"The study assessed mortality and morbidity risks as related to nutritional status of moderate and strict vegetarians in Germany. The total cohort of 1904 self-identified persons was followed up for 11 y. Compared with national mortality rates for Federal Republic of Germany, the observed deaths for all causes were below expectation by a factor of 0.44 for men and 0.53 for women. The mortality for colon cancer was reduced [standardized mortality ration (SMR 44.1 for men and 77.9 for women]. No deaths were observed from rectal cancer. A vegetarian lifestyle of long duration (> or = 20 y) was associated with decreased overall and cancer mortality. Other determinants of decreased cause-specific mortality were physical activity, body weight, and strictness of adherence to the life-style. The relationship between a vegetarian and fiber-rich diet and a decreased risk for colon cancer has been reported in many studies. In this study, the influence of other factors such as health-conscious behavior and a healthy lifestyle seem to indicate partly stronger effects than nutrition itself. This may explain the generally better health of moderate vegetarians.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,1994 May,United States,1994,90
8078862,"Results of the Dutch community project ""Healthy Bergeyk"".","BACKGROUND: This article reports on the results of a community health project that was implemented in the Dutch municipality of Bergeyk. The major goal was to reduce four cancer-related risk behaviors: smoking, high fat consumption, excessive alcohol use, and exposure to artificial sunlight. A control community received no new intervention. Intervention methods included mass media messages, self-help materials, small group activities, lectures, and structural activities. Community organization principles such as a social network approach, community participation, and intersectoral cooperation were applied in the project. METHODS: Data were collected from both communities among cohort research samples on three occasions using telephone interviews. RESULTS: The results indicate a significant reduction in fat intake in the experimental community. No other significant behavioral effects were found. Further analysis among respondents in the experimental condition showed that those personally exposed to the project as indicated by familiarity with and discussion about the project, had a greater decrease in fat consumption between baseline survey and second post-test than those who were not. Also, the percentage of smokers who quit between baseline survey and second post-test was greater among those who knew about the project than among those who did not. Finally, discriminant analysis was used to further examine the determinants of project exposure. Community involvement, marital status, education, and sex were related to project exposure.

9533742,Unionisation in a comparative neural network model: a trade union membership prediction in 12 states.,"The sociometric and theoretical models traditionally associated with the determinants of unionisation and based on international comparisons, generally use linear analysis of a restricted number of complex variables. The effectiveness of such models often have an unsatisfactory result. In this study a different theoretical and methodological approach has been used. It is based on a integrated scheme made by transposing the principles of the ""Squashing Theory"" (Buscema, 1994) into the social field, by the connectionist paradigm, and by the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This has permitted the carrying out of a larger data base (49 variables, 12 Nations, 12 Years maximum time interval), the adjusting of a model that has an elevated explanatory capacity (in terms of open variance) an ulterior capacity of generalization (in terms of a one-year span) and of metageneralization (in terms of generalization to nonprocessed nations). What emerges is surely the need for more and greater in-depth study of socializing facts which follow such aspects.",Substance use & misuse,1998 Feb,England,1998,90
10176378,"Does maternal employment augment spending for children's health care? A test from Haryana, India.","Evidence that women's employment and earnings foster increased allocations of household resources to children's well-being have led to advocacy of investment in women's employment as a method for targeting the social benefits of enhanced economic opportunity. Work and associated earnings are hypothesized to empower women, who can then exercise their individual preferences for spending on child well-being as well as influence household spending patterns. This paper presents results from a small detailed household and community study of maternal employment and child health in northern India (one of six studies in a research network), which sought to show that such effects did indeed occur and that they could be linked to work characteristics. Careful analysis of employment and earnings showed that they are multidimensional and highly variable over occupations and seasons. Contrary to expectations, spending on health care for children's illness episodes was negatively associated with maternal employment and earnings variables in econometric analysis. The expected individual effects on women of work and earnings, if they did occur, were not sufficient to alter the general spending pattern. We conclude that the attributes of work as well as the social and cultural environment are important mediators of such effects, suggesting a confluence of 'individual' and 'collective' behavioural determinants meeting in the locus of the household.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1997 Oct,Australia,1997,90

Conditional logistic regression models were employed to estimate the effects of macro- and micro-level factors (such as socioeconomic conditions, familial relationships, as well as biosocial determinants) on the survivorship of neonatal and post-neonatal infants in China. The study yielded two findings: (1) Social changes in Chinese society had a strong positive effect on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship; and (2) the magnitude of such social changes differed across regions which, in turn, led to the differential effects on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship across provinces in China.",Social biology,1996 Spring-Summer,United States,1996,90

Different levels of use may have different determinants and these determinants may differ across drug types. Approximately 3200 male-male twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry were interviewed by telephone. Data were obtained regarding exposure to six categories of illicit drugs, initiation of use, continuation of use, regular usage, and diagnosis of drug abuse/dependence. Genetic, common environmental, and unique environmental influences on transitions of drug involvement, defined as movement from one level of drug use to the next, were investigated. Marijuana had the highest conditional probability for the transition from exposure to use, from use to use more than five times, and from use more than five times to regular use. The rate of transition to regular use of heroin was higher than the rate for amphetamine, cocaine, sedatives, and psychedelics. Cocaine had the highest conditional probability for the transition from regular use to abuse/dependence. Significant genetic influences were observed for a number of transitions in marijuana, amphetamine, and cocaine usage.",Behavior genetics,1999 Nov,United States,1999,90
9110829,Effectiveness of health education and health promotion: meta-analyses of effect studies and determinants of effectiveness.,"Interventions to promote health that have been developed over the last 20 years in the relatively new scientific health education tradition, have often been evaluated for their effectiveness. Meta-analyses of effect studies on various subfields, show that these interventions generally have quite substantial effects (mean effect sizes, ES, of 0.46 for primary prevention and 0.49 for secondary prevention and patient education). A planned and systematic application of social science theory in intervention development is a strong determinant of effectiveness. However, learning principles such as rewards and feedback, that have been shown to increase effectiveness, are often not or not adequately applied. Also, too few interventions focus on possibilities to facilitate the desired behavior (such as reminders, financial stimuli, and skills improvement). The potential effectiveness of interventions in practice may be increased by systematic development of adoption and implementation strategies, including the creation of 'linkage systems' between intervention developers and representatives of the target and user systems.",Patient education and counseling,1997 Jan,Ireland,1997,90
8240210,Familiality of female and male homosexuality.,"We examined data from a large cohort of homosexual and heterosexual females and males concerning their siblings' sexual orientations. As in previous studies, both male and female homosexuality were familial. Homosexual females had an excess of homosexual brothers compared to heterosexual subjects, thus providing evidence that similar familial factors influence both male and female homosexuality. Furthermore, despite the large sample size, homosexual females and males did not differ significantly from each other in their proportions of either homosexual sisters or homosexual brothers. Thus, results were most consistent with the possibility that similar familial factors influence male and female sexual orientation. However, because results conflicted with those of some other studies, and because siblings' sexual orientations were obtained in a manner likely to yield more errors than in these other, smaller studies, further work is needed using large samples and more careful methods before the degree of cofamiliality of male and female homosexuality can be resolved definitively. We also examined whether some parental influences comprised shared environmental effects on sexual orientation. Scales attempting to measure such influences failed to distinguish subjects with homosexual siblings from subjects with only heterosexual siblings and, thus, did not appear to measure shared environmental determinants of sexual orientation.",Behavior genetics,1993 Jul,United States,1993,90
9567529,A prospective cohort study on the survival experience of under five children in rural western India.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the role of birth weight, nutrition, immunization and other medical as well as social factors in determining child survival. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: 45 villages in Shirur Development Block in Pune District in Maharashtra. METHODS: A cohort of 4129 children were followed from birth till 5 years of age. Weight and length/height of the child was measured at birth and at 3 monthly home visits. Information was also obtained on common childhood morbidities, immunization status and other bio-medical factors. Cause of death was ascertained by verbal autopsy. RESULTS: The neonatal, infant and underfive mortality was rates were estimated to be 37, 60 and 79 per 1000 live births, respectively. Diarrhea and ARI contributed to the major mortality burden. The Kaplan Meier Survival curve showed a sharp fall in the neonatal period, a less rapid decline in the post-neonatal period followed by a marginal fall in the post-infancy period till 5 years age. Girls had a better survival in the early neonatal period but the trend reversed in the late neonatal period. Normal birth weight children had better survival curves compared to low birth weight children. Survival improved with increasing birth order. Multivariate analysis revealed that birth weight, immunization status, and mother's and child's nutritional status influenced infant and under five mortality. CONCLUSION: Birth weight continues to exert its influence not only on survival/mortality in early life but even as late as 5 years of age. Strategies to improve child survival should include immunization and breastfeeding.",Indian pediatrics,1997 Nov,India,1997,90

Ratings of patients' behaviors and independent assessments of patients' symptomatology were used to predict the negativity of relatives in the videotaped interaction. The results indicated that severity of symptomatology was not related to relatives' negativity. Patients' social skill, as independently assessed by a role-play test, also was not associated with relatives' negativity. The regression results suggest that with both members of a patient-relative dyad, the quality of communication in a discussion is related to the other participant's level of negativity.",Psychiatry research,1995 Mar 27,Ireland,1995,90

Analyses are based on a representative sample of 730 physically disabled adults from ten countries of southwestern Ontario, Canada. Results indicate life-course related differences in the levels of both family support and family conflict, with the oldest group perceiving the greatest support and the least conflict from family members. While level of disability was not significantly related to perceived family support, findings indicate that individuals with greater functional limitations experience less frequent negative or conflictive interactions with family. A number of additional socio-demographic and psycho-social factors were also associated with perceived family support and conflict. However, the determinants of support and conflict were not equivalent and varied considerably by age group. In general, the results of this study support the notion that support and conflict represent independent dimensions of experience. Moreover, the factors that influence family support and conflict appear to change across the life course.",International journal of aging & human development,1996,United States,1996,90
12290730,The determinants and patterns of married women's labor force participation in Korea.,"The present study investigates the determinants and patterns of married women's labor force participation in Korea. Married women's employment in Korea is largely determined by age, urban residence, household characteristics of the husband's socioeconomic status, family income, fertility, and the lagged effect of work. Older age, rural residence, inferior household economic condition, and recent work experience are the major positive causes of married women's participation in the market work. On the other hand, younger women with preschool children, who currently reside in urban areas, enjoying better household economic conditions (due to higher socioeconomic status of husbands and/or higher family income) are the groups of women with the smallest probability of working in the market. Married women's employment pattern in Korea shows a pattern typical of less-developed and low-income countries in two aspects: married women working and characterized by a low level of education; the difference between urban and rural areas in terms of work participation pattern is remarkable. Although Korea belongs to the advanced group of currently industrializing countries, she lags behind with other developing countries in terms of married women's employment. Moreover, it is difficult to predict in advance that Korea would have similar experiences as those of contemporary advanced countries.",Korea journal of population and development,1995 Jul,Korea (South),1995,90

Among 339 alcoholics, 111 (33%) had a history of major depression. Depressed, compared with never-depressed alcoholics, had a higher daily alcohol intake, more lifetime diagnoses of other anxiety and affective disorders and drug abuse, more had attempted suicide, and more reported alcoholism in both parents. Depressed alcoholics also had significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid and of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Among subgroups of depressed alcoholics, secondary compared with primary depressives were more often divorced, of lower social status, with an earlier onset of alcoholism, and higher Michigan Alcohol Screening Test scores. Secondary depressives also had significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of homovanillic acid than never depressed alcoholics.

Multivariate analysis shows that preceding birth interval length, followed by survival status of the immediately preceding child, are the most important factors associated with differential infant and child mortality risks; sex of the index child and mother's and father's education are also significant. Demographic factors are influential during infancy as well as childhood, but social factors, particularly mother's and father's education, now emerge as significant predictors of infant mortality risks.

7550767,Infant mortality time series are random walks with drift: are they cointegrated with socioeconomic variables?,"Previous time series analyses of infant mortality have failed to provide evidence to support their implicit assumption that infant mortality data used behaved as a stationary time series. The present study applies the augmented Dickey Fuller Test to infant mortality time series for Sweden (1800-1989), United Kingdom (1839-1989) and United States (1915-1989). The null hypothesis that each of these series is non-stationary is accepted at standard levels of significance. A conceptual framework of infant mortality which uses a combination of physical and social overhead capital as factors in a production function is developed to explain the finding of non-stationarity as derivative from the non-stationarity of a stock of health-enhancing capital. Estimation of econometric models of the socioeconomic determinants of infant mortality using differenced data with ARIMA estimation is inconclusive. Estimation of a bivariate cointegration model supports the hypothesis that infant survival and GNP/Capita are cointegrated for 19th century Sweden but not for 19th century UK. Bivariate analysis of 20th century Sweden, UK, and US data demonstrated no cointegration. This may be due to the onset of disequilibrium in the economic determination of infant mortality in the present era as technological advances and demographic shifts began to play a larger role. Supplementing the bivariate analysis with measures of unemployment, and crude birth rate in the 20th century permitted the detection of cointegration in US and UK. The multivariate results may suggest that improvements in 20th century UK GNP/capita have had greater impact on infant survival relative to US GNP/capita.",Health economics,1995 May-Jun,England,1995,90

Risk factors for intravenous drug use among drug users, according to the multivariate model, included having had premarital/extramarital sex [odds ratio (OR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.3], having a family member who used drugs in 1991 (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9), and currently not married (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.98-2.7). Being Buddhist protected against intravenous drug use (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). The population attributable fraction was 30% for not being currently married, 17% for having had premarital/extramarital sex and 14% for having a family member who used drugs. The risk factor for sharing of equipment was being of Jingpo ethnicity (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.5-13.8). The average incidence of sharing equipment was 19.6% per year. The population attributable fraction for sharing equipment was 58.5% for being Jingpo. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of intravenous drug use and sharing equipment is increasing. Therefore, it is urgent that vigorous, effective intervention programs be initiated in southern Yunnan. Unmarried, sexually promiscuous Jingpo drug users with a family history of drug use should be especially targeted. Given the problems of transport and communication in this remote area of China, intervention programs which use existing social, governmental and community networks should be implemented.","AIDS (London, England)",1996 Aug,England,1996,90
7787957,Prognostic factors for preoperative consultation of women desiring sterilization: findings of a retrospective analysis.,"In this exploratory study, 37 sterilized women applying for sterilization reversal were questioned thoroughly to establish why they had decided to undergo sterilization and why they now wished for it to be reversed. Taking an interactive behavioral model as our starting point, we concentrated on the psychosocial circumstances leading to the definitive decision to be sterilized. A relationship crisis at the time of sterilization was found to be a prognostically unfavorable factor. Furthermore, 20 of the 37 patients cited new partnerships as their main reason for seeking reversal. Those who felt pressurized by their gynecologist or partner into undergoing sterilization had significantly more problems in overcoming the psychological stress accompanying such an operation than those who, through a series of consultations on contraception, had had sufficient time and opportunity to make their own decisions. Sterilization performed for medical reasons was found to have particularly problematical consequences, especially where the doctor had made the decision largely on his own, failing to give an adequate explanation for the medical necessity of the operation. Regarding the time chosen for sterilization, the study revealed that the patient's postoperative psychological condition was significantly worse when sterilization was carried out immediately after a delivery, after abortion or after Caesarean section, rather than in the interval between pregnancies. The resulting increase in the incidence of psychosomatic complaints and depressive states is also confirmed in the literature. The findings of this study offer practical suggestions for improved preoperative consultation and should help to determine the course of action to be taken when a patient wishes to be sterilized.",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,1995 Mar,England,1995,90
7660042,[Reliability of the declaration of underlying cause of infant deaths in the metropolitan region of southeastern Brazil].,"The quality of official information on underlying causes of infant deaths was studied on the basis of data collected for a population-based study of the surveillance of infant mortality in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil in 1989. The survey included the analysis of a sample of infant deaths carried out by comparing the underlying causes of death as coded on death certificates to those recorded by a group of doctors who abstracted information from hospital records. We verified that 11.7% of neonatal deaths did not have the underlying cause of death confirmed by the investigation (kappa = 0.61), and neither did 44.0% of post-neonatal deaths (kappa = 0.47). It is believed that this major disagreement among post-neonatal deaths is due to the close correlation observed among the major causes of death within this group (pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition). For example, associated malnutrition was observed in 76.9% of those cases in which diarrhoea was coded as the underlying cause of death. It was concluded that the quality of the death certificates is not satisfactory. However, the composition of the main groups of causes presented no significant alteration after investigation and may be used in public health surveillance, especially if we regard pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition as a group with the same determinants. Unfortunately, this group still accounts for a great number of otherwise avoidable deaths in Brazil.",Revista de saude publica,1994 Oct,Brazil,1994,90

Existing research and a newly completed 10-year survival study suggest that complex interrelations among biological factors, medical interventions, and specific dimensions of social differentiation determine survival differences. Patterns of interrelations among determinants of survival appear compatible with an ""economic"" model in some forms of cancer and a ""cognitive-behavioral"" model in others. Findings presented here suggest that improved access to health care will reduce mortality risk among the disadvantaged in at least some malignancies, but will not alone make their survival chances equal to those of the advantaged.",The Milbank quarterly,1996,United States,1996,90

Substantial increases in condom use were observed, and these changes were unrelated to attrition and cohort bias. In terms of predictors of condom use, men who always used condoms had higher levels of social support from informal sources of help, had more positive expectations that condoms would have positive interpersonal and personal consequences, and were more likely to be HIV positive than men who used condoms occasionally or never. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for HIV-prevention research.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1991,United States,1991,90
8096106,Social and economic factors and the control of lymphatic filariasis: a review.,"Formal control programmes do not exist for lymphatic filariasis in much of the endemic world. The literature on the social, economic and clinical impacts of the disease is so sparse as to provide virtually no guidance on whether the disease should be accorded more importance in national or local public health programmes. This type of research is a major priority. Putting together what little is known about the socioeconomic determinants of filariasis with the fairly extensive experience in control leads to a finding that control programmes must be undertaken at the community level to be effective. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is a readily available and apparently safe drug that can be deployed successfully for community control. While research currently is exploring the potential for individuals to protect themselves with DEC or a newer drug, ivermectin, community-wide control is unlikely to be achieved in that way. Under some special circumstances, controlling the mosquito vectors may be sufficient to control the disease, and in other cases, it may complement chemotherapy, but in general, it cannot be relied upon as a primary measure. DEC may be used in a variety of regimens which vary in their cost, duration, incidence of side effects and degree of community participation. Some, including DEC-medicated salt, are particularly attractive alternatives for many filariasis-endemic areas. The search for less expensive, yet effective, control options must continue, and this requires research not only into the costs of the various options, but also into the determinants of community acceptance, compliance and participation.",Acta tropica,1993 Mar,Netherlands,1993,90
1946862,The prevalence of depression among Australian nursing home residents: results using draft ICD-10 and DSM-III-R criteria.,"The aims of this study were, first, to estimate the prevalence of depressive disorders in Australian nursing home residents using international diagnostic criteria, and second, to explore environmental determinants of such disorders. Residents of 24 nursing homes were surveyed using the Canberra Interview for the Elderly (CIE) and a range of environmental measures was also taken. Of 323 residents who were screened for cognitive impairment, 165 (51%) scored 18 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al. 1975), and were interviewed with the CIE. According to DSM-III-R criteria and the CIE, the prevalence of major depressive episode was 9.7%. Using ICD-10 criteria, 6.1% of residents suffered from a severe depressive episode, 6.7% from a moderate depressive episode and 6.7% from a mild depressive episode. Some measures of the social environment were significantly related to depressive symptoms.",Psychological medicine,1991 Aug,England,1991,90
10320501,A socio-ecological approach to understanding barriers to prenatal care for women of low income.,"This paper critically examines the notion of barriers as conceptualized in the literature and suggests an expanded orientation to more fully appreciate its complexity. This alternative approach not only takes into account factors and processes relevant to the individual that create constraints to utilization, but also acknowledges influences on the design and delivery of health care. These latter considerations determine the availability and characteristics of programmes and services that may or may not encourage or enable participation by persons of low income. A socio-ecological model is proposed that compels health care practitioners and researchers to acknowledge the many influences on utilization behaviour. The literature on barriers to prenatal care is subsequently reviewed and evaluated, with consideration given to the range of behavioural determinants suggested by the model. Finally, a case is made for qualitative methods for inquiry to further enhance knowledge about factors and processes influencing use of the health care system, including prenatal care. It is argued that these approaches lead to enhanced appreciation of behaviour as a social product and are consistent with the ideology of health promotion.",Journal of advanced nursing,1999 May,England,1999,90

8909379,Fetal growth and coronary heart disease in south India.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease is predicted to become the commonest cause of death in india within 15 years People from India living overseas already have high rates of the disease that are not explained by known coronary risk factors. Small size at birth is a newly described risk factor for coronary heart disease, but associations between size at birth and the disease have not been examined in India. METHODS: We studied 517 men and women who were born between 1934 and 1954 in a mission hospital in Mysore, South India, and who still lived near to the hospital. We related the prevalence of coronary heart disease, defined by standard criteria, to their birth size. FINDINGS: 25 (9%) men and 27 (11%) women had coronary heart disease. Low birthweight, short birth length, and small head circumference at birth were associated with a raised prevalence of the disease. Prevalence fell from 11% in people whose birthweights were 5.5 lb (2.5 kg) or less to 3% in those whose birthweights were more than 7 lb (3.1 kg), p for trend = 0.09. The trends were stronger and statistically significant among people aged 45 years and over (p = 0.03 for birthweight, 0.04 for length, and 0.02 for head circumference). High rates of disease were also found in those whose mothers had a low body weight during pregnancy. The highest prevalence of the disease (20%) was in people who weighted 5.5 lb (2.5 kg) or less at birth and whose mothers weighted less than 100 lb (45 kg) in pregnancy. These associations were largely independent of known coronary risk factors. INTERPRETATION: In India, as in the UK, coronary heart disease is associated with small size at birth, suggesting that its pathogenesis is influenced by events in utero. The association with low maternal bodyweight is further evidence that the disease originates through fetal undernutrition. Prevention of the rising epidemic of the disease in India may require improvements in the nutrition and health of young women.","Lancet (London, England)",1996 Nov 9,England,1996,90

9472279,An investigation into the causes of absconding among black African breast cancer patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To discuss the complexities facing the researcher in attempting to determine reasons for the high rate of absconding from biomedical treatments by black African women diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: Qualitative study based on in-depth interviews and participant observations of the informants, to ascertain attitudes, beliefs and practices of black African breast cancer patients with regard to the choice of healer. PARTICIPANTS: 10 black breast cancer patients, 4 African indigenous healers, 4 black lay persons, and 8 Groote Schuur Hospital members. SETTING: Radiation Oncology Department, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. RESULTS: The study revealed that various determinants affect black women's decision to abscond from biomedical breast cancer treatments. These determinants were based on social and cultural peculiarities. However, these findings did not explain the difference in absconding rates between black cervical (30%) and breast cancer (80%) patients. Although the two patient groups shared social, economic, and cultural backgrounds, their decisions with regard to biomedical treatments of cancer were remarkably different. CONCLUSIONS: The methods chosen for the research project provided a framework for a qualitative study of one ethnic group of breast cancer patients. However, the research framework failed to allow comparisons between breast and cervical cancer patients from the same ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, although the research findings revealed determinants affecting black breast cancer treatments, they do not explain the discrepancy between absconding rates of black cervical and breast cancer patients.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1997 Nov,South Africa,1997,90

Heart Health Think Tank Group.,"The issue of practice skills arose in the course of a process evaluation of the Heart Smart North Shore (HSNS) project in British Columbia. We created a Think Tank of researchers and community practitioners to make recommendations for improvement of our skills. These recommendations differed according to different values for health and opinions on how to create health in the community. Because the site reviewers of the HSNS project were clear this was a disease prevention project and not a community development initiative, HSNS's orientation to skill development after the Think Tank moved toward the Precede/Proceed model, the Transtheoretical model and social marketing approaches. The Health Unit has now been restructured into multidisciplinary service teams which must focus on population health, evidence-based practice and the social determinants of health, and thus need to consider health promotion from a community development perspective and empowerment model.

8738633,Determinants of speech-hearing disability in King-Kopetzky syndrome.,"King-Kopetzky syndrome is characterized by auditory disability with a clinically normal hearing threshold. The main reported disability is hearing speech in the presence of background noise. The degrees of speech-hearing disability in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome have been investigated with the use of the Social Hearing Handicap Index (SHHI), and the relationships between the SHHI scores and a number of physiological, psychoacoustical and psychological factors determined in 109 patients. The significantly higher (worse) SHHI scores in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome indicate that this group suffer a considerable degree of speech-hearing disability. In our study, the main findings are that some psychological factors, performance of the sentence in noise test and auditory thresholds are significantly correlated with the SHHI scores. We were unable to find any relationships between the SHHI and frequency resolution or EOAEs. In a multiple stepwise regression, somatic anxiety and the performance of the sentence in noise test are the significant predictors of SHHI scores. These two variables appear to be the main determinants of speech-hearing disability in King-Kopetzky syndrome.",Scandinavian audiology,1996,Denmark,1996,90

The results demonstrate that sociodemographic factors--age, sex, marital status, family size, and income--profoundly affect black and white mortality. Indeed, the racial gap in overall mortality could close completely with increased standards of living and improved lifestyles. Moreover, examining cause-specific mortality while adjusting for social factors shows that compared to whites, blacks have a lower mortality risk from respiratory diseases, accidents, and suicide; the same risk from circulatory diseases and cancer; and higher risks from infectious diseases, homicide, and diabetes. These results underscore the importance of examining social characteristics to understand more clearly the race differences in overall and cause-specific mortality.",Demography,1992 May,United States,1992,90
7612128,Determinants of primary care specialty choice: a non-statistical meta-analysis of the literature.,"This paper analyzes and synthesizes the literature on primary care specialty choice from 1987 through 1993. To improve the validity and usefulness of the conclusions drawn from the literature, the authors developed a model of medical student specialty choice to guide the synthesis, and used only high-quality research (a final total of 73 articles). They found that students predominantly enter medical school with a preference for primary care careers, but that this preference diminishes over time (particularly over the clinical clerkship years). Student characteristics associated with primary care career choice are: being female, older, and married; having a broad undergraduate background; having non-physician parents; having relatively low income expectations; being interested in diverse patients and health problems; and having less interest in prestige, high technology, and surgery. Other traits, such as value orientation, personality, or life situation, yet to be reliably measured, may actually be responsible for some of these associations. Two curricular experiences are associated with increases in the numbers of students choosing primary care: required family practice clerkships and longitudinal primary care experiences. Overall, the number of required weeks in family practice shows the strongest association. Students are influenced by the cultures of the institutions in which they train, and an important factor in this influence is the relative representation of academically credible, full-time primary care faculty within each institution's governance and everyday operation. In turn, the institutional culture and faculty composition are largely determined by each school's mission and funding sources--explaining, perhaps, the strong and consistent association frequently found between public schools and a greater output of primary care physicians. Factors that do not influence primary care specialty choice include early exposure to family practice faculty or to family practitioners in their own clinics, having a high family medicine faculty-to-student ratio, and student debt level, unless exceptionally high. Also, students view a lack of understanding of the specialties as a major impediment to their career decisions, and it appears they acquire distorted images of the primary care specialties as they learn within major academic settings. Strikingly few schools produce a majority of primary care graduates who enter family practice, general internal medicine, or general practice residencies or who actually practice as generalists. Even specially designed tracks seldom produce more than 60% primary care graduates. Twelve recommendations for strategies to increase the proportion of primary care physicians are provided.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

The research presented in this article was funded as part of the ""Europe against Cancer"" programme, and follows the evolution over a five year period, of representations and behaviours of 1500 children from cities in France, Belgium, Spain, Greece, and Portugal. In each city, three different groups were followed and evaluated: Children in the first groups participated in a year-long tobacco prevention programme conducted by specially trained teachers; those in the second groups only participated in sporadic activities designed around World Tobacco Day; those in the third group did not participate in any particular tobacco prevention activities. The evaluation concentrated on analysing the changes in participants' social representations regarding tobacco and smoking related behaviour throughout the five year period.

1585843,"Alcohol expectancies, social and environmental cues as determinants of drinking and perceived reinforcement.","Increasing evidence suggests that outcome expectancies and environmental cues interact to influence post-drinking behaviors. Using an experimental methodology in a simulated social drinking setting, this research tested the potential influence of expectations for the effects of drinking, environmental cues, and beverage content on ad lib consumption and post-drinking self-perception. Eighty-eight moderate to heavy-drinking males were randomly assigned to one of eight experimental conditions in which beverage content (alcohol or placebo), social environment (friendly or unfriendly), and physical environment (simulated bar or residence) were varied. Subjects were further divided into high and low groups on three outcome expectancy factors. Unaffected by environmental cues, beverage self-administration increased when subjects strongly expected behavioral impairment from drinking but received placebo beverage. Post-drinking reports of disinhibition increased in response to friendly social cues but were not affected by beverage content or amount. Results therefore suggest that individual's beliefs about the effects of drinking influence the amounts of beverage they consume, whereas social cues more greatly affect post-drinking self-perception.",Addictive behaviors,1992,England,1992,90

8222993,Global epidemiology.,"Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in human populations. Epidemiology on a global scale is severely constrained by the lack of data. In many countries, there are no comprehensive data on mortality or basic demographic data. Where data are available, findings on the relationship of environment to health across countries need to be interpreted with caution. For example, there is well-known variation in standards of medical practice and diagnosis, and in certification and coding, but there are also large differences in diet, the social environment and lifestyle--all of which strongly predict disease incidence. Inappropriate inference concerning aetiology made from such broad-scale studies may result in what has been termed the 'ecological fallacy'. A complementary approach is to collect and analyse data in standardized fashion as part of international collaborative studies. These can offer some important advantages over the more conventional single-centre design. Recent advances have meant that studies of environment and health can now--in some countries--be carried out using routine data at the small area level. Although problems of interpretation remain, they are generally less severe than in broad-scale studies. Examples of this approach are given.",Ciba Foundation symposium,1993,Netherlands,1993,90

SUBJECTS: A subsample of men at work, aged 40-54 y extracted from the base-line data from four independent prospective studies, each representing a period (Physical Fitness Study (1977-1978), Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health (BIRNH) (1979-1984), Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) (1986-1991) and ORCA (1992-1993)). DESIGN: Linear regression of the average body mass index (kg/m2) and logistic regression of the prevalence of obesity (BMI > or = 30kg/m2). Independent variables taken into account in multivariate analysis were: age, educational level, marital status and region. RESULTS: In this subsample of Belgian men at work, aged 40-54 y, prevalence of obesity increased from 9.2% in 1977-1978 to 14.5% in 1992-1993. This rise was present in each five-year age group, in both regions and in all educational groups, but strongest in the lowest educated. After adjustment for sociodemographic covariables, it was estimated that with regard to 1977-1978, the proportion of men with a BMI > or = 30 kg/m2 doubled over the 15-year period (odds ratio OR (95% confidence intervals, 95% CI)): 1.98 (1.40; 2.80). CONCLUSION: Keeping in mind that the trends have been calculated from data from four different studies, presenting some shortcomings, prevalence of obesity has increased between 1977-1992 in men aged 40-54 y at work.

10081240,Marriage structure and contraception in Niger.,"Analysis of the 1992 Niger Demographic and Health Survey showed that although roughly two-thirds of both polygamous and monogamous women approve of birth control, polygamous wives are less likely than monogamous wives to discuss family size or birth control with their husband or to plan on using birth control. The study suggests that characteristics of polygamous couples have caused polygamous women to be more resistant to birth control use than monogamous women. The polygamous women tended to be married to older men who had not gone to primary school and who desired more children than monogamous husbands. The influence of marital structure is not significantly associated with intention to use birth control when the husband's age and the wife's ideal number of children were controlled for in the multivariate logistic regression model suggesting that background social factors may be more influential. In fact, educational level and age at first marriage were significantly associated with attitudes towards birth control and also with marital structure.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Jan,England,1999,90

8909379,Fetal growth and coronary heart disease in south India.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease is predicted to become the commonest cause of death in india within 15 years People from India living overseas already have high rates of the disease that are not explained by known coronary risk factors. Small size at birth is a newly described risk factor for coronary heart disease, but associations between size at birth and the disease have not been examined in India. METHODS: We studied 517 men and women who were born between 1934 and 1954 in a mission hospital in Mysore, South India, and who still lived near to the hospital. We related the prevalence of coronary heart disease, defined by standard criteria, to their birth size. FINDINGS: 25 (9%) men and 27 (11%) women had coronary heart disease. Low birthweight, short birth length, and small head circumference at birth were associated with a raised prevalence of the disease. Prevalence fell from 11% in people whose birthweights were 5.5 lb (2.5 kg) or less to 3% in those whose birthweights were more than 7 lb (3.1 kg), p for trend = 0.09. The trends were stronger and statistically significant among people aged 45 years and over (p = 0.03 for birthweight, 0.04 for length, and 0.02 for head circumference). High rates of disease were also found in those whose mothers had a low body weight during pregnancy. The highest prevalence of the disease (20%) was in people who weighted 5.5 lb (2.5 kg) or less at birth and whose mothers weighted less than 100 lb (45 kg) in pregnancy. These associations were largely independent of known coronary risk factors. INTERPRETATION: In India, as in the UK, coronary heart disease is associated with small size at birth, suggesting that its pathogenesis is influenced by events in utero. The association with low maternal bodyweight is further evidence that the disease originates through fetal undernutrition. Prevention of the rising epidemic of the disease in India may require improvements in the nutrition and health of young women.","Lancet (London, England)",1996 Nov 9,England,1996,90
9576126,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices on hypertension in a country in epidemiological transition.","Assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) is a crucial element of hypertension control, but little information is available from developing countries where hypertension has lately been recognized as a major health problem. Therefore, we examined KAP on hypertension in a random sample of 1067 adults aged 25 to 64 years from the Seychelles Islands (Indian Ocean). KAP were assessed from an administered structured questionnaire. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension (screening blood pressure [BP] > or = 160/95 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive medication) was 36% in men and 25% in women aged 25 to 64 years. Among hypertensive persons, 50% were aware of the condition, 34% were treated, and 10% had controlled BP (ie, BP <160/95 mm Hg). Most persons, whether nonhypertensive, unaware hypertensive, or aware hypertensive, had good basic knowledge related to hypertension determinants and consequences, possibly an effect of a nationwide cardiovascular disease prevention program over the last years. However, favorable outcome expectation, positive attitudes, and appropriate practices for hypertension and relevant healthy lifestyles were found in smaller proportions of participants, with little difference between aware hypertensives, unaware hypertensives, and nonhypertensives. Furthermore, hypertensive persons with other concurrent cardiovascular risk factors affecting the overall heart risk knew well the detrimental effects of these other factors but reported making little actual change to control them (particularly regarding overweight and sedentary habits). These data point to the need to maximize the efficiency of hypertension prevention and control programs so that delay in achieving effective hypertension control is minimized in countries experiencing recent emergence of hypertension as a major public health problem.","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",1998 May,United States,1998,90
10214405,"The condom conundrum: barriers to condom use among commercial sex workers in Durban, South Africa.","We examined socio-cultural and economic determinants of condom use among 100 female South African commercial sex workers. The symbolism and dynamics of condom use between sex workers and their clientele were explored. These issues were also investigated when sex workers negotiated sex with their personal partners. An additional focus was the extent to which HIV/AIDS influences women's condom use in these situations. Results demonstrate considerable contrast between factors influencing condom use in professional versus private sex situations. With clients, practical issues such as financial strain were the major obstacles to condom use. With personal sex partners, sex workers avoided condoms due to their negative symbolism. Condoms were seen as suggestive of filth, disease, infidelity, and mistrust. HIV/AIDS awareness had minimal impact on condom use. HIV/AIDS was viewed as a remote threat, overridden by immediate practical and emotional concerns. The intervention implications of condom symbolism and differential barriers to condom use are discussed.",African journal of reproductive health,1997 Mar,Nigeria,1997,90

10369442,Demograghic and socio-economic determinants of community and hospital services costs for people with HIV/AIDS in London.,"We examined the influence of demographic, social and economic background of people with HIV/AIDS in London on total community and hospital services costs. This was a retrospective study of community and hospital service use, needs and costs based on structured questionnaires administered by trained interviewers and costing information obtained from the service purchasers and providers, based on two Genito-urinary Medicine clinics in London: the Jefferiss Wing at St. Mary's Hospital and Patric Clements at the Central Middlesex Hospital, London, England. The subjects were 225 HIV infected patients (105 asymptomatic, 59 symptomatic non-AIDS and 61 AIDS). We found that over and above well established determinants of health care costs for HIV infected people such as disease stage and transmission category, social and economic factors such as employment and support of a living-in partner significantly reduced community services costs. Private health insurance had a similar effect, though only a small proportion of HIV people had such cover. The cost of community services for HIV infected non-European Union nationals, mainly of African origin, was one quarter that for the European Union nationals. Community services costs were highest for heterosexually infected women and lowest for heterosexually infected men after adjusting for other factors. Hospital services costs were significantly higher for HIV infected people lacking educational qualifications and employment. We conclude that access to community care for HIV infected non-EU nationals appears to be very poor as the cost of their community services was one quarter that for the EU nationals after adjusting for the effects of transmission category, disease stage, living with a partner, employment and having a private health insurance. Additional incentives for informal care for HIV infected people could be a cost-effective way to improve their community health service provisions.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 May,England,1999,90
1949098,The contribution of the World Fertility Surveys to an understanding of the relationship between women's work and fertility.,"A consistent negative association between women's paid work and fertility in developed countries has emerged from many years of research. Results from research in developing countries are more ambiguous, with as many examples of a positive association as of a negative one. Lack of data comparability has often hampered interpretation of results. The World Fertility Surveys (WFS)--undertaken in 40 developing countries between 1974-81, using a common core questionnaire that included numerous questions on women's work--have created a unique opportunity to evaluate this association in a comparative framework. This article reviews and interprets the major findings on the work-fertility relationship from this and other published research on women's work and fertility, and assesses the data limitations. The article concludes with recommendations for the treatment of women's work in the design of future fertility and family planning surveys.",Studies in family planning,1991 May-Jun,United States,1991,90

Accompanying this growth, we can expect that challenges associated with a large bilingual and non-English speaking older population may become more pronounced. The purpose of this research was to examine the level and determinants of English proficiency among older Hispanics in the United States. Data from the 1990 Census indicate that a third of the older Hispanic population in the United States speaks English poorly or not at all. This group includes a sizable number who are ""linguistically isolated"" in that they either live alone or with other nonproficient speakers of English. Using multivariate logistic regression techniques, it is shown that immigrant status and timing, socioeconomic status, geographic concentration, and national origin are key determinants of English proficiency.",The Gerontologist,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
9752284,[Influence of knowledge relative to cancer on prevention behavior in the population of Bas-Rhin].,"The tendency today is to make the population more aware of health in order to encourage their use of prevention activities. The aim of our telephone survey which was performed on a representative sample of the population (1,010) in the Bas-Rhin department in France, was to study the relationship between the level of knowledge of cancer and the use of screening techniques to prevent it. Eighty-two percent of the males and 78% of the females surveyed, show a profound understanding of cancer in general, the associated risk factors and its prevention. The level of awareness of males did not influence a specific behaviour (p = 0.68) towards cancer prevention. It was shown that in smokers, the more they smoke, the more they underestimate the chances of cure from all categories of cancer (p = 0.01). They both overestimate the number of cigarettes needed daily before smoking becomes toxic (p < 0.01) and are less active physically than nonsmokers (p < 0.007). Heavy smokers live in larger communities (p < 0.02) and smokers are younger than non-smokers (p < 0.0001). In the female population, the level of awareness did indeed influence their behaviour towards cancer prevention (p < 0.04). The level of knowledge was higher in both those who consciously attend cancer screening clinics (cervical Papanicolaou smears and faecal tests) and those who are opposed to faecal tests. Younger females are significantly less aware than those who are older (p = 0.0001) and more than two-thirds of these would not consider a cervical Papanicolaou smear as a preventative diagnostic tool. Females who conscientiously attend cancer screening clinics and who are very much aware of cancer, are generally older in age (p < 0.05). The occurrence of mammography as a preventative measure is both high and dependent on age. In conclusion, the level of knowledge of cancer cannot explain alone human behaviour towards the prevention of this disease. Other determinants responsible for influencing human behaviour towards cancer prevention will be better understood once the social sciences, epidemiology and anthropology units work together and combine resources to achieve a common goal.",Bulletin du cancer,1998 Jun,France,1998,90
1492502,[Health behavior of young adults: empirical analysis of complex behavior patterns and their determinants].,"Complex associations between alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, eating habits and physical exercise are explored. Data from the 1985 German Cardiovascular Prevention Study are used to explore associations between these behaviours, separate for young men (n = 561) and young women (n = 509) between 25 to 34 years of age. Analyses concern three forms of associations: 1. associations between different categories of single health behaviours; 2. associations between various health behaviours, and 3. associations between health behaviours, and their social determinants. Contingency tables, cluster analyses and logistic regression analyses are applied. Cluster analyses identified subgroups with particular health behaviour patterns. One distinct pattern, similarly among men and women, was typified by increased physical exercise, less smoking and increased beer consumption. For young men, results from regression analyses showed significant effects of higher income and positive health attitudes on belonging to this distinct cluster. For young women cluster membership was significantly correlated with higher education and positive health attitudes. Results of the statistical analyses demonstrate the usefulness of a multi-methods approach in studying complex behaviour patterns. Finally the relevance of the present findings for future studies and applications is indicated.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1992,Switzerland,1992,90

The main finding is that experience of unemployment during the first year in Israel does not, on the whole, help predict subsequent remigration. The propensity to remigrate varies inversely with age for most groups, and it increases if the immigrant has not acquired permanent housing. Immigrants on temporary resident visas are naturally more prone to remigrate in the short run. The well-educated and the young are more likely to be temporary residents.""",The International migration review,1996 Winter,United States,1996,90
1796339,Predicting elderly cardiac patients at risk for readmission.,"Elder patients with cardiac disease are at high risk for physical deterioration during post hospital recovery and suffer frequent early readmission. It is important to identify such patients who frequently need help with discharge planning from social workers during their first admission. This study utilized computerized data on 628 patients, 238 of whom were readmissions. Question was raised as to what factors (functional, psychological, social and environmental), differentiated patients who were readmitted from those who were not. Using logistic regression, three variables: marital status, presence of coping difficulty and age of patients were identified as predictors of readmission within three months. Those who were married were less likely to be readmitted. Those with coping difficulties and older individuals were more likely to be readmitted. The accuracy of prediction, using these three factors, was 61 percent. Of those patients predicted as not being readmitted, sixty-nine percent were correctly predicted, while 39 percent were readmitted. Of patients predicted as readmissions, 49 percent were correctly predicted, while 51 percent were not. The major limitation of this study was that key physiological determinants of readmission were not collected. It is imperative that a valid screening device for predicting who is at risk for readmission should include physiological preconditions as well as functional and psychosocial data.",Social work in health care,1991,United States,1991,90
9725113,Hyperbolic temporal discounting in social drinkers and problem drinkers.,"Two studies compared participants, distinguished by their typical alcohol consumption, on the degree to which they discounted the value of delayed, hypothetical amounts of money. Heavy social drinkers in Study 1 and problem drinkers in Study 2 both showed greater temporal discounting than light social drinkers; this difference was stronger in Study 2. Both studies found that a hyperbolic function described temporal discounting more accurately than an exponential function. These results are consistent with extending behavioral theories of intertemporal choice to characterize the determinants of alcohol consumption. The discounting differences also are consistent with more general behavioral economic and economic theories of addiction, although the hyperbolic functional form is inconsistent with the exponential discounting function in economic theory. The drinker groups also differed on impulsiveness and time orientation questionnaires, with light drinkers being less impulsive and more future oriented; however, these measures were not strongly correlated with the measure of temporal discounting.",Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology,1998 Aug,United States,1998,90
10724741,Predictors of demand for emergency prehospital care: an Australian study.,"INTRODUCTION: Determining the predictors of demand for emergency prehospital care can assist ambulance services in undertaking policy and planning activities. HYPOTHESIS: Demand for prehospital care can be explained by demographic, health status, and economic determinants. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design to investigate the association of demographic, health status, and insurance factors with the use of prehospital, ambulance care. Core data items including age, gender, marital status, country of origin, triage score, diagnosis, time of presentation, method of arrival, and patient disposition were collected for every patient who presented at the Emergency Department of the study hospital over a four-month period. Ambulance usage was analysed using Poisson regression. RESULTS: For the 10,229 patients surveyed, only a small number were triaged as having the highest level of urgent medical need (0.8%), but the majority of these used prehospital emergency medical care (90.2%). Predictors of ambulance use included age > 65 years (Prevalence Ratio [PR] = 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.35-3.63), being married or in a de-facto relationship (PR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.60-0.79) or divorced, separated, or widowed (PR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70-0.98), triage score level 1 or 2 (PR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.68-2.28), or triage score level 3 (PR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.38-1.72), diagnosis involving either mental (PR = 4.29; 95% CI: 1.84-10.01), nervous (PR = 2.74; 95% CI: 1.19-6.31) or trauma (PR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.03-5.27) conditions, and insurance status (PR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.40-1.71). Ethnicity, gender, and time of day were not associated with usage. CONCLUSION: Demand for ambulance services can be predicted by a number of demographic, medical status, and insurance variables. Age and triage levels are key influences on demand for ambulance services. Ambulance insurance status provides an economic incentive to use ambulance services regardless of the urgency of the medical condition.",Prehospital and disaster medicine,1999 Jul-Sep,United States,1999,90
10116946,"Residential attitudes and knowledge, use, and future use of home support agencies.","Critical review of the health and social service use literature reveals a need to elaborate on the dynamics of factors identified in the behavioral models applied to this field. In particular, research has tended to omit direct measures of attitudes and awareness of social services, including their interrelationships. This study examines determinants of knowledge, use, and future use of local home support agencies among a sample of community-dwelling elderly over the age of 74 living in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. Measures of domestic self-reliance, independent living and perceptions of futurity are incorporated into the analysis. Logistic regression is used to test the models. The results show that attitudes regarding domestic self-reliance and independent living influence use of home support agencies largely through their impact on service awareness. Interestingly, these relationships are opposite to those hypothesized. Education is also found to be a predictor of knowledge of home support, and living arrangement, health status measures, and knowledge arise as important predictors of use and future use. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the underlying behavioral models, and for service providers and policymakers.",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90

DESIGN: A single interview consisting of the Massara and Stunkard body image cards (1979) and questionnaires on sociocultural background, anthropometry, and dieting history were administered to volunteers from the staff of a hospital. SUBJECTS: The sample was a convenience sample of 186 women representing a range of staff positions recruited from Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, NY; 174 completed the study. Data on 150 women are presented in this article. RESULTS: Height and weight-for-height were stronger predictors of accuracy of perceived body size than ethnicity. Tall, slight women were more likely to overestimate and short, heavy women were more likely to underestimate actual body size. Ethnicity had an interactive effect with height as taller European Americans were more likely to perceive their body size as larger than actual compared with Afro-Caribbeans and African Americans. Women with a history of dieting were more likely to overestimate their size and to view it as different from what is perceived as attractive to others. APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we conclude that body size is a stronger predictor of accuracy of perceived body size than ethnicity; and dieters overestimate their body size and believe it to be heavier than their social group would prefer.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1996 Mar,United States,1996,90

Individuals who had sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months were included in the analysis (n=400). Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression were used to analyse condom use in the previous 12 months. Eight per cent always, 31% sometimes, and 61% never used condoms. Rates of condom use differed with the number of sex partners in the last year, age, gender, having a steady sex partner, and marital status. Multiple logistic regression revealed that people most likely to use condoms were under the age of 30, male, did not have a long-term steady sex partner, had more than one sex partner, worried about pregnancy, were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS, and were not embarrassed to obtain condoms. Condom users who were knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and who knew someone with HIV/AIDS were more likely to always use condoms. The most common reason for not using a condom was 'I was with my steady sex partner'.

According to ""self-assessment"" view, individuals choose tasks that are diagnostic about themselves, regardless of self-esteem implications. On the other hand, according to ""self-enhancement"" view, individuals choose tasks that are diagnostic only when they have positive self-esteem implications. Present research tested these predictions in Japanese college students, using for tasks with high or low diagnosticity of success and failure. In subjects with low uncertainty of self-esteem, task preference increased with diagnosticity of success and diagnosticity of failure. This was consistent with self-assessment view. However, in subjects with high uncertainty of self-esteem, task preference didn't increase with diagnosticity of failure. In subjects with high self-esteem, task preference is high with high diagnosticity of failure than that of subjects with low self-esteem. The results suggest large individual differences in gathering information about self.

Five hundred forty-four ninth-grade urban high school students were surveyed regarding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to STDs and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Results of multiple regression analyses indicate that higher levels of STD and AIDS knowledge were associated with lower levels of STD and AIDS anxiety (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), fewer negative attitudes toward people with AIDS (R2 delta = 0.09; p less than 0.001), stronger perceptions of self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.03; p less than 0.01), and stronger peer affiliation (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.05). Negative attitudes toward people with AIDS were inversely related to knowledge (R2 delta = 0.08; p less than 0.001), social support (R2 delta = 0.02; p less than 0.01), and perceived self-efficacy (R2 delta = 0.01; p less than 0.05).

1506998,Preventing relapse in the treatment of nicotine addiction: current issues and future directions.,"Although smoking-cessation rates have continued to increase, the vast majority of smokers who quit eventually relapse. Between 1974 and 1985, over 1.3 million smokers quit during each of those years. However, 75% to 80% of those individuals resumed smoking within six months. This article describes the dynamic phenomenon of smoking relapse within the context of cyclical episodes of smoking and quitting during an individual's lifetime. Theories of the determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed and methods designed to prevent relapse are described. Smoking relapse is discussed in terms of three aspects of tobacco addiction: (1) biological-addiction mechanisms, (2) conditioning processes, and (3) cognitive-social learning factors. The major determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed, including nicotine withdrawal, stress, weight gain, social influences, conditioning factors, causal attributions, and environmental variables. A transtheoretical-developmental model is explored in the longitudinal investigation of the natural history of slips (lapses) and relapse episodes. Relapse prevention interventions are described that emphasize self-awareness, self-regulation, self-efficacy, affect regulation, social support, and lifestyle balance. Recent developments in pharmacological adjuncts to treatment are also examined. It is concluded that innovative relapse prevention methods need to be designed for hard-core smokers with histories of cessation failures, substance abuse and/or psychiatric impairment. These and other recommendations for future research on smoking relapse and relapse prevention are discussed.",Journal of psychoactive drugs,1992 Apr-Jun,United States,1992,90

Although only few studies deal with this issue explicitly, the review reveals that four ways to study the relationship between coping and social support can be distinguished: (a) seeking social support as a coping strategy; (b) social support as a coping resource; (c) social support as dependent on the way individual patients cope; and (d) coping by a social system. It is argued that all four ways of integrating coping and social support contribute to a better understanding of adaptation to chronic diseases. However, exploring the interrelatedness of both concepts by studying social support as a coping resource and social support as dependent on the patient's own coping behavior appear to be especially fruitful in the short term, as they: (a) provide a better insight in the social determinants of coping, and (b) may help to clarify the way social support affects health and well-being.",Clinical psychology review,1997,United States,1997,90

RESULTS: Attendance at the rehabilitation course was significantly related to a stronger belief during admission that the illness could be cured or controlled (t = 2.08, P = 0.04). Return to work within six weeks was significantly predicted by the perception that the illness would last a short time (t = 2.52, P = 0.01) and have less grave consequences for the patient (t = 2.87, P = 0.005). Patients' belief that their heart disease would have serious consequences was significantly related to later disability in work around the house, recreational activities, and social interaction. A strong illness identity was significantly related to greater sexual dysfunction at both three and six months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' initial perceptions of illness are important determinants of different aspects of recovery after myocardial infarction. Specific illness perceptions need to be identified at an early stage as a basis for optimising outcomes from rehabilitation programmes.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 May 11,England,1996,90
9806086,Psychiatry and the burden of mental illness.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the morbidity produced by mental disorders, to project changes in morbidity likely to be produced by demographic and economic change, and to review the possible role of psychiatry in the health care system. METHODS: Using prevalence data for psychiatric disorders and population projections, this paper presents the likely changes in morbidity over the next 20 years. A review of social and economic information indicates changes in social attitudes and their effects on mental health. This paper examines the determinants of health and how they are likely to change and explores some possible directions for changes in health care delivery. RESULTS: Psychiatric disorders have been greatly underestimated as a cause of disability but account for 5 of the 10 leading causes of disability and 47.2% of all years lived with a disability (YLD) in developed countries. By 2016, there will be significant changes in the distribution and type of psychiatric disorders seen in the population, with cases of dementia almost doubling. Most of the population growth will be in the older age-groups, who will be well informed and will demand high standards of service. The gap between rich and poor will increase, and the results of childhood poverty and abuse will become more apparent. The disadvantaged, including many mentally ill, will suffer deprivation as disability payments decline, but youth unemployment will improve, possibly reducing crime rates. Forced early retirements will decline. Alternative medicine will make inroads into health care. A crisis in subsidized accommodation for the elderly can be anticipated, which perhaps will lead to reopening institutions that are currently being closed or to developing new forms of care. As the baby boomers pass 50 years of age and begin consuming health care services, governments will revise plans and eligibility for services; users will pay for services more directly. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatry is very vulnerable to minor changes in health care schemes and will increasingly be called on to show economic arguments to justify its services. Pressure to support a primary care model by changing practice styles, developing new skills, and training practitioners will probably occur. The major growth area likely will be geriatric psychiatry.",Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie,1998 Oct,United States,1998,90
1736023,Measuring physician mental workload: reliability and validity assessment of a brief instrument.,"This study examined the reliability and validity of a brief six-item instrument to measure the mental workload experienced by residents for specific patient visits to an ambulatory care clinic. Participating in the study were twenty-two residents in postgraduate years 1 through 3 who were working in the general outpatient clinic of an inner city, private, nonprofit community hospital. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the instrument was 0.80. Findings supported several theory-based hypotheses on determinants and performance consequences of mental workload. Mental workload was positively correlated with fatigue (r = 0.42, P = 0.03) and inversely correlated with residents' self-rated experience with patients' problems (r = -0.65, P less than 0.001). Residents' performance was measured through self-ratings and faculty physicians' ratings. Mental workload was inversely correlated with self-rated performance (r = -0.67, P less than 0.001). The correlation of mental workload with faculty physician ratings that reflected the technical dimension of patient care (physician examination, medications, and procedures) was r = -0.38 (P = 0.04). With mental workload squared, the correlation was r = -0.45 (P = 0.02) and the form of the relationship, consistent with the hypothesis, was a slightly downward sloping curve. Limitations of this research are discussed as well as suggestions for further research.",Medical care,1992 Feb,United States,1992,90
8194917,Comparison of serum lipoprotein(a) distribution and its correlates among black and white populations.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on serum lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), a presumably strong risk factor for coronary artery disease in White populations, has mostly been derived, in Black populations, from small samples. This study compares the distribution and the determinants of serum Lp(a) in Blacks and in Whites using large representative samples and the same methods in both populations. METHODS: The distribution and the correlates of serum Lp(a) were investigated in population-based samples of 701 Blacks in the Seychelles and 634 Whites in Switzerland, aged 25-64 years. Serum Lp(a) was quantified using a commercial immunoradiometric assay. RESULTS: The distribution of serum Lp(a) was similarly skewed in both ethnic groups, but median Lp(a) concentration was about twofold higher in Blacks (210 mg/l) compared to Whites (100 mg/l). The proportions of individuals with elevated serum Lp(a) (> 300 mg/l) was about 50% higher in Blacks (37.5%) than in Whites (25.2%). In both ethnic groups, serum Lp(a) was found to correlate with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apoprotein B but not with HDL-cholesterol, alcohol intake, smoking, and body mass index. The variance in serum Lp(a) concentration explained by any combination of these factors was smaller than 5.3% in the two populations. CONCLUSIONS: The measured factors did not explain the higher levels of serum Lp(a) found in Blacks compared to Whites. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors account for much of the variation of serum Lp(a) in both populations.",International journal of epidemiology,1994 Feb,England,1994,90

10185693,Elective admission policies in New South Wales public hospitals.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the existence and content of elective admission policies in New South Wales acute public hospitals. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to managers of all acute public hospitals (n = 76). Copies of elective admission policies were sought from respondents. Results were analysed with EpiInfo 5.01b and policy content by thematic analysis. RESULTS: Survey response was 91% (69/76). Policies existed in 71% (49/69) of hospitals. Of these, 96% (47/49) disseminated their policy, with 23% (11/47) disseminating it at least annually, 41% (19/47) only when updated, and 32% (15/47) infrequently, with one policy being new (2%) and one hospital not stating its frequency (2%). Policy compliance was assessed in 86% (42/49) of hospitals and guidelines reviewed periodically in 92% (45/49) of hospitals. Twenty per cent (10/49) of the policies had been developed since a departmental instruction of May 1994. Of the 20 acute hospitals with no policy, 75% (15/20) were rural and 85% (17/20) thought they should have a policy. Analysis of policy content revealed emphases on resource availability and clinical need as determinants of elective admission, an institutional rather than a patient focus, and a high level of senior nurse manager involvement in admission decisions in rural hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a specific departmental instruction, nearly one-third of hospitals still had no admission policy 18 months later. This could be indicative of miscommunication between hospitals and NSW Health or perceived irrelevance of department guidelines by hospital managers. Existing policies were mostly institutionally focused and dominated by perceived resource limitations. NSW Health might consider other medico-social factors and manager involvement in future policy development.",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,1998,Australia,1998,90
9090699,The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model.,"PURPOSE: Study purpose was to develop a theoretical framework that will explain pharmacists' behavior relative to the provision of pharmaceutical care. The model was developed from four attitude models by testing their predictive validity relative to pharmaceutical care implementation. Four hypotheses and one research question were investigated to identify determinants of behavioral intention and behavior. METHODS: 617 community pharmacists in the state of Florida, U.S.A., were surveyed twice using mail survey methodology to collect data. The first survey assessed community pharmacists' attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, past behavior recency, self-efficacies, instrumental beliefs and affect. The second survey assessed pharmacists' behavior relative to the implementation of pharmaceutical care. After establishing reliability and validity of measures, regression analysis was used to test hypotheses and research question investigated. RESULTS: The Pharmacists' Implementation of Pharmaceutical Care (PIPC) model developed postulates that (i) behavior is directly determined by past behavior recency, behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control; (ii) psychological appraisal processes-instrumental beliefs, self-efficacies, and affect toward means-influence behavior through past behavior recency; and (iii) behavioral intention is determined by attitude, social norm and perceived behavioral control. CONCLUSIONS: The PIPC model provides a formal scientifically validated theoretical framework which can be used to design successful intervention for pharmaceutical care implementation.",Pharmaceutical research,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90
24263849,"Perceived vs. actual friends' use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and cocaine: Which has the most influence?","Determinants of the use of alcohol, alcohol without parental knowledge, cigarettes, marijuana, and crack were assessed in predominantly black, urban, fourth- and fifth-grade students. Each subject identified three best friends. Logistic and least-square regression analyses indicated that children's perceptions of friends' use, perceptions of family use, and actual use of classmates were better predictors of substance use than friends' actual use. The pattern of predictors suggested that peer behaviors and attitudes are more influential for children's socially censured behaviors such as using alcohol without parental permission than for more socially approved behaviors such as using alcohol with parental permission. The importance of perceived friends' use vs. friends' actual use supports Behavioral Intention Theory and Cognitive Developmental Theory, while the importance of classroom use supports Social Learning Theory or may reflect social and environmental conditions including neighborhood availability of drugs and neighborhood values regarding substance use.",Journal of youth and adolescence,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90
9825421,"Psychosocial, behavioural, and health determinants of successful smoking cessation: a longitudinal study of Danish adults.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors that determine whether or not smokers become long-term quitters, and to study whether determinants of successful cessation differ with levels of motivation to stop. DESIGN: In a cohort of men and women, aged 30-60 years at first examination in 1982/1984, smoking behaviour was evaluated from questionnaires at baseline and at follow up 10 years later. SETTING: County of Copenhagen, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 2554 subjects from the original sample of 4581 were successfully followed. This study deals with the 1365 subjects who were smokers at the first examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Smoking status (abstinent for one year or more) at follow up. RESULTS: At follow up 15% of the baseline smokers had been abstinent for one year or more. In multivariate analysis, successful smoking cessation was associated with older age, high social status, low prior tobacco consumption, baseline motivation to stop smoking, and having a non-smoking spouse/cohabitant. The same result was obtained when the analyses were repeated separately for smokers with and without motivation to stop. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers motivated to stop are more likely to quit and remain abstinent than smokers with no such motivation. Age, social status, spouse/cohabitant's smoking behaviour, and the daily consumption of tobacco predict success in smoking cessation, irrespective of smokers' former motivation to stop.",Tobacco control,1998 Autumn,England,1998,90

Several sociocultural, economic, and demographic variables were selected for the study. These independent variables were regressed against three proxy measures of malnutrition: height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height. The results show that the nutritional status of a child is determined by a variety of factors that are biological, social, cultural, and economic in nature, namely, birth status, birth weight, diarrhoeal status, duration of breastfeeding, and residence. The study concludes that most of the factors that account for malnutrition in children in Zimbabwe are preventable.",Social biology,1995 Fall-Winter,United States,1995,90
2347833,Determinants of maternal child-rearing attitudes.,"This study investigated the correlates of negative attitudes toward child-rearing among low-income urban black and Hispanic mothers. Using a randomized block procedure, 144 adolescents and 139 adults giving birth to healthy infants at a large metropolitan hospital were recruited. All consenting women were interviewed in the hospital within 2 days after delivery, using standardized measures of child-rearing attitudes, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social support, and cognitive ability. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms, cognitive ability, and two demographic characteristics (maternal age and spoken language) accounted for 42.4% of the variance in negative childrearing attitudes during the postpartum period. The contributions of social support and self-esteem were no longer significant when the effects of the other psychosocial factors were taken into consideration simultaneously. The utility of early assessment of maternal attitudes as a marker for maternal risk status is addressed. The adaptive function of maternal attitudes and the implications for child-rearing practices are discussed in relation to the process of acculturation.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1990 May,United States,1990,90
8363189,Cultural and psychosocial determinants of weight concerns.,"Several sociocultural and psychological factors underlie Western society's intense preoccupation with the body. These factors include the social value of attractiveness, the strong correlation between attractiveness and perceived fitness, the interrelation among attractiveness, a good body image, and feelings of self-worth, and the relation between pressures to succeed in both the appearance- and work-related domains. The strong societal emphasis on appearance and slimness has translated to both intense body preoccupation and a willingness to try almost any weight-loss strategy. Thus, dieting occurs across all weight categories in response to these powerful social and psychological motivators.",Annals of internal medicine,1993 Oct 1,United States,1993,90
1374257,[Determinants of lead concentration in the umbilical cord blood of 9189 newborns of a birth cohort in the government district of Braunschweig].,"From September 1985 until August 1986 the possibility of lead concentration determination in umbilical cord blood was offered to all neonates in the district of Braunschweig by the Ministry of Social Affairs of Lower Saxony. A geometric mean concentration of 3.76 +/- 1.69 micrograms Pb/dl was found in 9189 neonates, being 64% of the total birth cohort. The median concentration was 3.59 micrograms/dl. 4.7% of the children showed concentrations of above 10 micrograms/dl. Lead concentrations of twins showed a strong linear correlation (r = + 0.94). They were higher than those of singleton births (p = 0.02). Lead concentrations in neonates were significantly associated with the age of the mother and with the birthweight of the newborn. Seasonal differentials were significant with higher values in summer (4.39 +/- 1.8 micrograms Pb/dl) compared to winter (3.25 +/- 1.5 micrograms/dl). Duration of daily participation in road traffic was independent of blood lead concentrations. Potential occupational lead exposure of a member of the household was also no significant risk factor for higher lead concentration in the newborn. Family homes constructed before 1955 and those with lead water pipes were associated with significant increases of lead concentrations in neonates. Neighborhood was also significantly associated, with higher values in those living by main roads. In the southern part of the district lead concentrations were about 10% higher than in the northern part. Concentrations in neonates coming from cities were the same as in those coming from rural areas. Newborns from old lead mining and processing areas in the Harz mountains, in particular those coming from Oker-Harlingerode, had low lead concentrations in umbilical cord blood.",Zentralblatt fur Hygiene und Umweltmedizin = International journal of hygiene and environmental medicine,1992 Mar,Germany,1992,90
1342501,[Gender and health in Brazil: considerations based on the National Household Sampling Survey].,"As in the principal industrial countries, Brazilian women have lived longer than men. However, paradoxically, women present higher morbidity indicators than men. Knowledge of the Brazilian pattern regarding this matter could be a useful contribution to an understanding of their determinants in our specific reality, as well as enabling us to foresee future trends that would make it possible to plan adjustment in the health system. A morbidity study based on data from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD/IBGE), was undertaken in ten Brazilian states in 1986 with this in view. Coefficients of the prevalence of perceived morbidity, demand for and utilization of health services according to sex, standardized by age and using the direct method, were built up. As a measurement of the differentials, sex ratios were calculated. The excess of perceived morbidity in women was constant in all the regions. The sex differential in the utilization of health services showed regional variations, suggesting a relationship with the health services supply. Sex differentials were not observed in childhood; the highest values were found during the woman's reproductive period, decreasing sharply after 60 years of age. The pattern is very similar in all regions. In the present study, the findings could be partially explained by the methodology adopted, but they are similar to the findings reported in other countries. The intense transformations in the reproductive pattern and in the social status of Brazilian women probably have a considerable impact on the health status and on the recourse to health services, not as yet evaluated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Revista de saude publica,1992 Jun,Brazil,1992,90
1512443,"Educational attainment, occupational history, and stratification: determinants of later-life economic outcomes.","Determinants of economic well-being among men 25-44, 45-64, and 65+ were examined using data from the 1984 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation. A path analysis explored race, education, and occupational history effects on income adjusted for annuitized assets, household composition, and underreporting of unearned income. Direct and total education effects were undiminished among elderly persons, whose income derived mainly from benefits and assets, as compared with the nonelderly subjects whose income was dominated by earnings; education explained more of the variance in adjusted income for the elderly group than for the nonelderly. While Social Security income exerts an equalizing effect across educational attainment groups, private pensions and other important retirement income sources were highly education-dependent, producing a high overall degree of stratification on early-established socioeconomic characteristics.",Journal of gerontology,1992 Sep,United States,1992,90
2014415,Determinants of mental illness in a rural Ethiopian adult population.,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 2000 adult Ethiopians living in rural communities to determine firstly the prevalence of mental illness and secondly its association with stress and demographic variables. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire developed by WHO experts was used as the measure of mental illness. A modified version of the Holmes-Rahe Social Readjustment Scale was the measure of stress. Respondents were interviewed in their homes. Those experiencing 11 or more of the 20 neurotic symptoms and 3 or more of the 4 psychotic symptoms were considered mentally ill. Despite the use of high cut-off points for identifying potential cases, the prevalence of mental illness was 17.2%--neurotic 11.2% and psychotic 6.0%. This is higher than earlier reports for Ethiopia, but comparable to rates found in other African countries. Mental illness scores were most strongly associated with stress in that the odds of experiencing 6 or more stressful life events in the past year were 2.7 times greater for neurotics and 2.1 times greater for psychotics. In addition, neuroses and psychoses were significantly associated with a family history of mental illness and with being divorced, separated or widowed. Neurosis alone was also associated with chronic illness, females, those between the ages of 35 and 44, and illiteracy. These findings were discussed in terms of their relevance for identifying high stress groups and thus for preventing mental illness through community activities.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90

7522432,Patient requests to hasten death. Evaluation and management in terminal care.,"Terminally ill patients often hope that death will come quickly. They may broach this wish with their physicians, and even request assistance in hastening death. Thoughts about accelerating death usually do not reflect a sustained desire for suicide or euthanasia, but have other important meanings that require exploration. When patients ask for death to be hastened, the following areas should be explored: the adequacy of symptom control; difficulties in the patient's relationships with family, friends, and health workers; psychological disturbances, especially grief, depression, anxiety, organic mental disorders, and personality disorders; and the patient's personal orientation to the meaning of life and suffering. Appreciation of the clinical determinants and meanings of requests to hasten death can broaden therapeutic options. In all cases, patient requests for accelerated death require ongoing discussion and active efforts to palliate physical and psychological distress. In those infrequent instances when a patient with persistent, irremediable suffering seeks a prompt and comfortable death, the physician must confront the moral, legal, and professional ramifications of his or her response. Rarely, acceding to the patient's request for hastening death may be the least terrible therapeutic alternative.",Archives of internal medicine,1994 Sep 26,United States,1994,90

Inter-specialty variation in the frequency of malpractice claims is almost entirely related to the differential performance of major surgery. Various legal doctrines concerning both compensation and liability appear responsible for approximately half of the upward trend in the propensity to initiate malpractice litigation. We believe that the remaining explanations for growth in claims frequency are changes in social attitudes toward risk-bearing, increasing social distance between patients and physicians, and innovations in medical technology.",Journal of health economics,1991 Jul,Netherlands,1991,90
10597987,Risk factors for the incidence of hyperuricaemia: a 6-year longitudinal study of middle-aged Japanese men.,"BACKGROUND: Few longitudinal studies on the determinants of increase in serum uric acid (SUA) have been completed. METHODS: In all, 1445 hyperuricaemia-free (<7.5 mg/dl SUA, no medication for and no past history of hyperuricaemia) male office workers aged 30-54 years of T Corporation in Osaka, Japan were re-examined for six successive years. Subjects who were found to be hyperuricaemic or had started medication for hyperuricaemia during repeat surveys were defined as incident cases. RESULTS: Among the subjects (n = 1365) not receiving medication for hypertension, diabetes mellitus or renal disease, multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model indicated that the incidence of hyperuricaemia had significant relationships with body mass index (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.13 for a 2 kg/m2 increase; 95% CI: 1.02-1.26), mean blood pressure (HR = 1.07 for a 5 mmHg increase; 95% CI: 1.00-1.13), log triglyceride level (HR = 2.21 for a 10 mg/dl increase; 95% CI: 1.12-4.37), alcohol intake (HR = 2.33 for drinking 46.0 g of ethanol per day or more relative to non-drinking; 95% CI: 1.55-3.50) and smoking (HR = 0.65 for current-smoking relative to non-smoking; 95% CI: 0.46-0.92). Age (HR = 0.89 for a 5-year increase; 95% CI: 0.78-1.00) and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (HR = 0.89 for a 0.5% increase; 95% CI: 0.78-1.00) achieved marginal significance. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, high blood pressure, high triglyceride level, and alcohol intake are contributory factors for the development of hyperuricaemia among middle-aged Japanese men.

1283031,[Are sex differences in schizophrenia stable on a transnational basis?].,"The ABC-Schizophrenia-Study (Hafner et al. 1991), investigating a large, representative sample of 267 first admissions, did not find any gender differences in the lifetime morbidity risk for this disorder or in the frequency of nuclear symptoms in male and female schizophrenic patients. Marked gender differences, however, could be detected regarding the age at onset and its distribution and regarding illness behavior and certain secondary symptoms. The transnational stability of these findings was tested with data from the WHO studies ""On Assessment and Reduction of Psychiatric Disability"" (including 510 patients from 7 centres) and on ""Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders"" (with 1,292 patients from 11 centres). Studying pooled data sets from the studies minimized centre-specific selection effects on sampling. Major results of the ABC-Schizophrenia-Study were validated: the lack of a gender difference in the morbidity risk (cumulative lifetime incidence rates) for schizophrenia; lower mean age at first admission in males; an early, marked peak in the distribution of the age at onset in males; a later and broader peak in this distribution in females with a second peak after age 40-45; equal frequency of nuclear symptoms in both sexes; gender differences in some specific contents of delusions, secondary affective symptoms, social adjustment and illness behavior.","Schweizer Archiv fur Neurologie und Psychiatrie (Zurich, Switzerland : 1985)",1992,Switzerland,1992,90

8606317,The evaluation of changes in functional health status in patients with abdominal complaints.,"Measuring functional status changes in various patient subgroups is important in stratifying risk, assessing disease severity, and predicting and defining clinically relevant outcomes. Data from a multi-centered study of 980 primary care patients presenting with nonspecific abdominal complaints were studied to demonstrate the importance of such an assessment procedure. Patients were prospectively followed for 6 months. Five diagnostic categories based on illness duration and seriousness were derived from the clinical course of these patients. The functional status of each patient was determined at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). Intraclass correlation coefficients accounted for two aspects of the reliability of the SIP regarding the measurement of change over time: differences between patients which are stable over time (reproducibility) and different effects of treatment between subsets (responsiveness). A priori formulated expectations about the degree of health status change in patient subgroups were evaluated with the help of effect-size calculations. Patient impairment only partially depended on the final diagnosis and was also influenced by the presence of co-morbidity, psycho-social determinants, and other complaints. The health status change in the patient subgroups agreed with a priori formulated expectations. Standardized effect-size calculations revealed that the degree of change over time in SIP scores was in accordance with these expectations. We conclude: (a) the SIP appeared to be a reliable clinimetric instrument in detecting change over time resulting from different clinical courses, (b) clinical studies that use clinimetric instruments to assess the effects of clinical interventions must adequately control for the influence of baseline ""functional status"" as well as traditional demographic features such as gender and age, and (c) evaluating a priori formulated clinical expectations concerning functional change with statistics such as intraclass correlation and effect sizes can lead to a clearer understanding of the clinical relevance of statistically significant changes.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,1996 Feb,United States,1996,90
10214405,"The condom conundrum: barriers to condom use among commercial sex workers in Durban, South Africa.","We examined socio-cultural and economic determinants of condom use among 100 female South African commercial sex workers. The symbolism and dynamics of condom use between sex workers and their clientele were explored. These issues were also investigated when sex workers negotiated sex with their personal partners. An additional focus was the extent to which HIV/AIDS influences women's condom use in these situations. Results demonstrate considerable contrast between factors influencing condom use in professional versus private sex situations. With clients, practical issues such as financial strain were the major obstacles to condom use. With personal sex partners, sex workers avoided condoms due to their negative symbolism. Condoms were seen as suggestive of filth, disease, infidelity, and mistrust. HIV/AIDS awareness had minimal impact on condom use. HIV/AIDS was viewed as a remote threat, overridden by immediate practical and emotional concerns. The intervention implications of condom symbolism and differential barriers to condom use are discussed.",African journal of reproductive health,1997 Mar,Nigeria,1997,90
1590666,Maintenance of behaviour change in patients with coronary artery disease.,"This paper comments upon patterns of behavioural change after acute cardiac illness and discusses determinants of longterm compliance with advice. The importance of comprehensive rehabilitation during convalescence is emphasised. Education, motivation and support of the patients are essential for the adoption of healthier lifestyles. Despite comprehensive rehabilitation, however, recidivism to former habits is common, particularly with smoking and physical inactivity. This is partly determined by premorbid social and personality characteristics of patients. Social and behavioural support at the workplace and within the community may well be of significant benefit in supporting patients to maintain their necessary health behaviour changes. Some of the evidence related to these issues is discussed and recommendations are made regarding future directions for patient support.","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",1992 Jan,Singapore,1992,90
2068599,Determinants of subject compliance within an experimental anti-HIV drug protocol.,"A study of subject compliance within an experimental anti-HIV drug protocol was conducted with 40 asymptomatic HIV seropositive persons participating in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of the effectiveness of ZDV. Subject compliance was assessed through the use of study nurse independent ratings. The 20 most compliant and 20 least compliant subjects were surveyed at a 6-month interval using a self-report instrument designed to assess perceived social support and other psychosocial factors thought to effect compliance. Results indicated that more adherent subjects lived further from their treatment site, did not live alone, saw their study nurse as supportive, and were more likely to depend on a significant other for a wide range of social, economic, and emotional support. Implications for the practical use of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are proposed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1991,England,1991,90
8698265,Psychic and social consequences of women in relation to memories of a stillborn child: a pilot study.,"Prevalence and determinants of long-term psychosocial morbidity among women giving birth to a stillborn child are largely unknown. Few, if any, systematic epidemiologic studies are available. In this pilot study we investigated one alternative way to collect data from relevant patient populations and formulated some hypotheses. Moreover, questions found unhelpful in this context were identified, e.g., whether the mother had bathed her dead child or not. Fruitful hypotheses found worthwhile testing were, among others: the risk of long-term anxiety-related symptoms is reduced if (1) the woman has seen her stillborn child, (2) she has an ultrasonic or photographic picture of the child, and (3) she has gone through a ritual, primarily burial of the child; moreover, (4) divorce may be a social consequence of the intrauterine loss of a child.",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,1996,Switzerland,1996,90
9406290,Public health impacts of global climate change.,"The potential health impacts of climate change are wide-ranging, from direct impacts at familiar local scales, through indirect effects occurring at the regional or ecosystem level, to long term effects on the sustainability of global systems. To assess these potential impacts, there is a need to broaden the scope of health impact assessment. Eco-epidemiology is emerging as a response to this need. Eco-epidemiology entails a shift in focus: from direct (toxicological) to indirect (ecological) mechanisms; and from effects occurring at 'human' temporal and geographical scales to those at regional and geophysical scales. We discuss the potential health impacts of climate change on each scale. At the global scale, interactions and feedbacks between systems are critical determinants of long term outcomes. From an eco-epidemiological perspective, the study of climate change becomes inseparable from the study of global change more generally.",Reviews on environmental health,1997 Jul-Sep,Germany,1997,90

Cluster analysis identified eight health-related behavior patterns in the Munich sample which were also found in the Bern sample. Predictors of health-relevant behavior patterns were analysed via multiple logistic regressions. Most results showed different effects on cluster membership between the two samples. Gender, professional status, social support from friends, and paying attention to regular meals were identified as predictor variables in both samples. Other variables identified as predictors occurred either in only one of the two samples or differed in the direction of their effect.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1999,Switzerland,1999,90

8284696,Children's nutritional status in female-headed households in the Dominican Republic.,"A national representative household survey of food consumption, income, and expenditure was conducted in the Dominican Republic in 1986 by Tufts University School of Nutrition in cooperation with USAID Office of Nutrition [1: Rogers B. L. and Swindale A. Determinants of Food Consumption in the Dominican Republic. USAID/S & T/Nutrition, Washington, DC, 1988]. Out of 1440 families surveyed 706 had children under 6 years of age. Anthropometric indicators of height and weight were collected for all 1251 children in the sample in a follow-up study conducted from December 1986 to January 1987 by Tufts with USAID/Santo Domingo Mission funding. Anthropometric measurements were converted to standard deviation scores using NCHS standards; nutritional status was thus measured by height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ). Earnings in families with children having males as heads-of-household were roughly one-third greater than in those with females as household head; total income was also greater in these families, though not significantly. More calories and protein per adult equivalent were available in male-headed families as well. In spite of this superior economic and dietary situation, there was a trend throughout the entire sample for children of female-headed households to be taller and heavier for their age than those of two parent homes; all three anthropometric measures showed differences in the same direction. In the lowest expenditure quartile, WAZ and WHZ were significantly greater for children in female-headed households than their counterparts in male-headed households (WAZ: P = 0.01, WHZ: P = 0.00).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Dec,England,1993,90

After adjustment has been made (through logistic regression) for covariates, five factors had significant association with diarrhoeal disease. These are the age of the child, parity, mother's education, availability of household kitchen and the feeding of semi-solid food to the infants. The lowest diarrhoeal rate occurred in infants aged 0-3 months while the highest rate occurred among infants seven to nine months old (Odds Ratio = 4.2). Children who were of the fifth or higher birth order had significantly higher risk of diarrhoea when compared with those who were of the first or second birth order (OR = 1.62; P < 0.05). Children of mothers with secondary education had significantly higher risk of diarrhoea compared with children of illiterates (OR = 1.9; P < 0.05). Households that had no kitchen had significantly higher risk of infantile diarrhoea than households with kitchen facilities (P < 0.01). Finally, infants receiving semi-solid food had higher risk of diarrhoea compared to those children not receiving semi-solid food (P < 0.05).

To a lesser or greater extent, this social gradient affects all socioeconomic groups below the top, not simply those at the bottom. The contribution of factors related to health care systems in explaining this gradient is of limited importance. Health-related lifestyle factors and stressful conditions resulting from relative social deprivation both within and outside working life were shown to be relevant determinants.

2020883,Measles control in the urbanising environment.,"The relationship between urbanisation and measles control is examined. In urban settings in developing regions measles is a disease of particular importance, since it tends to affect children at a younger age and with greater severity than in rural settings. A further finding in urban areas, especially peri-urban slums, is the lower measles vaccination coverage rates compared with rural regions. Factors identified as determinants of measles vaccination coverage among children under 2 years of age in urban areas include: home delivery; being born outside the urban setting; and length of stay in the city. These factors are probably related to the low socioeconomic status and lack of social integration experienced by new urban immigrants. A number of additional obstacles, such as distance, economic and cultural barriers, and inconvenient clinic hours all prevent parents from gaining easy access to vaccination services. In order to address the problems of measles control in expanding urban settings, a regional approach--with full integration of curative and preventive services--is called for. A more effective use of existing services will probably go a long way towards improving urban vaccination coverage with resultant measles control.",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,1991 Apr 20,South Africa,1991,90

In order to explore the sometimes subtle influence of racial determinants in decisions about resource allocation, we present the case of a 53-year-old Australian Aboriginal woman with end-stage renal failure. The epidemiology of renal failure in the Australian Aboriginal population and amongst other indigenous peoples is discussed. We show that the use of utilitarian outcome criteria for resource allocation may embody subtle racial discrimination where consideration is not given to issues of justice, race, culture and gender. It is only where the processes by which resources are allocated are transparent, clearly defined and based upon consultation with individual patients that issues and justice are likely to be adequately addressed.",Journal of medical ethics,1995 Dec,England,1995,90

7735729,Family support and coping with cancer: some determinants and adaptive correlates.,"This paper studies the interrelationships between the coping behaviours of cancer patients and perceived amount and adequacy of family support, as well as the issue of how these predict psychosocial adjustment to cancer. Based on questionnaire data from a sample of 169 patients with cancers of various sites, three questions were considered in detail: (1) How might cognitive and behavioural modes of coping with cancer affect perceptions of support provided by one's family in terms of the amount as well as adequacy of various supportive acts? (2) Are coping modes to be considered when explaining inter-individual differences in perceived support adequacy, or can these differences be reduced to differences in amount of support? (3) Can distinct patterns of family support and coping preferences be identified and, if so, how do these patterns differ in indicators of psychosocial adjustment to cancer? Results suggest that cognitive strategies of coping may be more effective in 'mobilizing' family support than behavioural strategies. Moreover, the perceived adequacy of various support modes proves to be influenced by cognitive coping preferences independent of perceived amounts of support. Finally, results from cluster analyses point to a particular coping-support pattern identified as 'highly risky'. This pattern is characterized by generalized support deficits, strong tendencies towards rumination, and weak tendencies towards minimizing disease-related threat. The findings are discussed from an interactional perspective on support processes and with regard to implications for psychological intervention in cancer patients.",The British journal of social psychology,1995 Mar,England,1995,90
8265756,Advertising health: the case for counter-ads.,"Public service advertisements have been used by many in hopes of ""selling"" good health behaviors. But selling good behavior--even if it could be done more effectively--is not the best goal for using mass media to prevent health problems. Personal behavior is only part of what determines health status. Social conditions and the physical environment are important determinants of health that are usually ignored by health promotion advertising. Public service advertising may be doing more harm than good if it is diverting attention from more effective socially based health promotion strategies. Counter-ads are one communications strategy that could be used to promote a broader responsibility for rectifying health problems. In the tradition of advocacy advertising directly promoting policy rather than products, counter-ads promote views consistent with a public health perspective. Counter-ads set the agenda for health issues, conferring status on policy-oriented strategies for addressing health problems. The primary purpose of counter-ads is to challenge the dominant view that public health problems reflect personal health habits. They are controversial because they place health issues in a social and political context. Advertising strategies for health promotion range over a spectrum from individually oriented public service advertising to socially oriented counter-advertising. The recent anti-tobacco campaign from the California Department of Health Services represents advertisements across the spectrum. Counter-ads that focus on a politically controversial definition for health problems are an appropriate and necessary alternative to public service advertising.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1993 Nov-Dec,United States,1993,90
8735376,"Self-perceptions, motivation, and school functioning of low-income maltreated and comparison children.","Maltreated children are at risk for disturbances and delays in their socioemotional and scholastic functioning. This study examined the impact of child maltreatment and age on perceptions of competence, and the relations among perceived competence, motivation, and school functioning. The sample included 76 school children living in poverty, approximately two-thirds of whom had been victims of child maltreatment. Results indicated that both maltreated and nonmaltreated children exhibited maladaptive motivational orientations toward scholastic tasks and poor academic performance, supporting the idea that threats to scholastic functioning reside as much within the ecology of poverty as in that of maltreatment. Over and above the general effects of poverty, maltreatment was found to disrupt the psychological processes accounting for children's scholastic performance. Results revealed that younger maltreated children (6- and 7-year-olds) reported more inflated self-perceptions of competence and social acceptance than nonmaltreated children. In contrast, older maltreated children (8- through 11-year-olds) reported lower perceived social acceptance than nonmaltreated children. Among older nonmaltreated children, perceived competence was positively related to teacher's ratings of their effort, intrinsic motivation, and grades. For older maltreated children, these relations among self-perceptions and school functioning were in the opposite direction from those of nonmaltreated children, suggesting that the determinants of academic engagement are different for maltreated and nonmaltreated children.",Child abuse & neglect,1996 May,England,1996,90
8194917,Comparison of serum lipoprotein(a) distribution and its correlates among black and white populations.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data on serum lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), a presumably strong risk factor for coronary artery disease in White populations, has mostly been derived, in Black populations, from small samples. This study compares the distribution and the determinants of serum Lp(a) in Blacks and in Whites using large representative samples and the same methods in both populations. METHODS: The distribution and the correlates of serum Lp(a) were investigated in population-based samples of 701 Blacks in the Seychelles and 634 Whites in Switzerland, aged 25-64 years. Serum Lp(a) was quantified using a commercial immunoradiometric assay. RESULTS: The distribution of serum Lp(a) was similarly skewed in both ethnic groups, but median Lp(a) concentration was about twofold higher in Blacks (210 mg/l) compared to Whites (100 mg/l). The proportions of individuals with elevated serum Lp(a) (> 300 mg/l) was about 50% higher in Blacks (37.5%) than in Whites (25.2%). In both ethnic groups, serum Lp(a) was found to correlate with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apoprotein B but not with HDL-cholesterol, alcohol intake, smoking, and body mass index. The variance in serum Lp(a) concentration explained by any combination of these factors was smaller than 5.3% in the two populations. CONCLUSIONS: The measured factors did not explain the higher levels of serum Lp(a) found in Blacks compared to Whites. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors account for much of the variation of serum Lp(a) in both populations.",International journal of epidemiology,1994 Feb,England,1994,90
9226686,Increased frequency of HLA-DR3 and complotype SCO1 in Mexican mestizo children with amoebic abscess of the liver.,"The increase of HLA-DR3 and complotype SCO1 previously found in Mexican mestizo adults with E. histolytica amoebic abscess of the liver, was also found in Mexican mestizo children of either sex with the same disease, when compared to the healthy control population (adults and/or children) of the same ethnic and socioeconomic background. This HLA and complotype pattern was not found in Mexican Mestizo patients with amoebic rectocolitis. No linkage disequilibrium was found between these and the other MHC determinants tested in this survey. Thus, HLA-DR3 and SCO1 may constitute primary, independent risk factors, not for any kind of amoebic tissue invasion (i.e. amoebic rectocolitis), but specifically for amoebic liver abscess, irrespective of age or sex. The possibility of linkage disequilibrium with other factors (i.e. the TNF family) within or close to the MHC that were not tested in this study, is discussed. Children with amoebic liver abscess revealed a significant increase in HLA-DR5, and the absence of HLA-DR6 when compared to adults with amoebic liver abscess, suggesting that at least in this ethnic group these class II HLA traits may contribute to some of the peculiarities of pediatric amoebic liver abscess as opposed to the adult version of this disease. HLA-DR3, SCO1, but also HLA-DR5 and HLA-DR6 have all been associated with certain forms of immune-dysfunction, and may thus contribute to some of the clinical and immunological features of this parasitic disease.",Parasite immunology,1996 Oct,England,1996,90

The study sample (2100 men and 534 women) represented 57% of the original volunteers, or 75% of those eligible after exclusion criteria were met. Data on perceived stress were obtained by questionnaire, and a principal component analysis produced six components: qualitative demands, quantitative demands, job control, future control, work support, and outside stress. Multiple linear regression, which controlled for determinants of blood pressure, tested the main effects and specific two-way interaction effects of the chronicity scores of the six components and 30 items. Many items but only some components were associated with blood pressure change. Sex and age differences were observed. The observed interactions between job demands and control provided equivocal support for the Karasek job-strain model.

1769402,Gender and changing generational relations: spouse choice in Indonesia.,"Many Asian societies are undergoing a nuptiality transition that is not only tied integrally to other aspects of family organization, but is also often more complex than standard studies of female age at marriage can reveal. To comprehend some of this complexity, we focus on the patterns of spouse choice for both men and women in central Java. The extent of parental control over mate selection is examined for change over time, gender differences, and likely determinants, including family class, education, premarital work, and residence. It is argued that the current marriage transition in Indonesia reflects both gender and generational hierarchies in the Javanese family system. The analysis is conducted using a multinomial logit model; in general, it yields results strongly supportive of the argument that the determinants of spouse selection differ by gender. The results also show that although there is a dramatic shift towards self-choice marriages, it is occurring within the context of historical and institutional factors specific to Javanese society.",Demography,1991 Nov,United States,1991,90

In this paper, we discuss the impact of the recent economic crisis on the health sector in Indonesia, and analyze the potential for implementing effective reform following the managed care model. The health sector is discussed, highlighting pre-existing problems in the health care supply environment. The determinants of the economic crisis are summarized, and the broad impacts of the crisis to date on the health sector are assessed. Next the prospects for success of current managed-care reform proposals are examined in some detail: viability of expanded managed care reform measures are assessed in light of the continuing crisis and its likely impacts on the consumers and suppliers of health care. Analysis of the potential impact of the continuing crisis focuses on key participants in health care reform: households, the government, and private health care providers. In conclusion the potential viability of managed care appears poor, given the current economic, political, and institutional conditions and likely future impacts, and suggest some alternative reform measures.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1999 Mar,Ireland,1999,90
12291801,The demographic transition revisited: lessons for foreign aid and U.S. immigration policy.,"""The completed demographic transitions in industrialized countries inspired a model which underlies many well-meant policies affecting the Third World. However, the model's postulate--modernization and prosperity will lower fertility rates--has exacerbated rather than helped control worldwide population growth and the associated environmental degradation. Here we show that perceived economic opportunity leads to raising family size targets and to discarding elements of traditional cultures which formerly held fertility rates in check. Conversely, fertility rates fall when limits are recognized. These observations imply that a liberal immigration policy and large-scale foreign aid are counterproductive for restoring balance between population size and carrying capacity.""",Ecological economics : the journal of the International Society for Ecological Economics,1993 Dec,Netherlands,1993,90

12317957,The demand for water in rural areas: determinants and policy implications.,"Improving the adequacy and quality of water supplies is a priority for rural development in developing countries. So far, the strategies of governments and international donors for tackling the problem have been supply-driven; the fundamental importance of demand in the selection of appropriate policies has been virtually ignored. The realization that effective policy and planning must take into account what the rural clients want and are prepared to pay for was the impetus for the World Bank's multicountry study of households' demand for improved water services. This article summarizes the findings of the 1987-90 investigation of determinants of rural demand in selected regions of Latin America, Africa, and South Asia. The research team used both direct (contingent valuation) surveys and indirect (revealed preference) methods to estimate households willingness to pay for different levels and types of improvement. The methodology produced some illuminating insights into how to decide what level of service is appropriate for a particular community and how the improved services should be paid for. The team identified 4 broad categories of village situations, with appropriate policies ranging from the provision of house connections at full cost of one extreme, to no improvement in traditional supplies at the other extreme.",The World Bank research observer,1993 Jan,United States,1993,90
8868380,"Trends in HIV-1 and HIV-2 prevalence and risk factors in pregnant women in Harare, Zimbabwe.","The spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the resulting morbidity and mortality are major public health challenges with adverse social and economic implications. The pregnant population serves as an important marker of the extent of the problem in the sexually active low risk categorized population. Furthermore, a high HIV prevalence among women of childbearing age contributes to neonatal and infant mortality through perinatal transmission and also a large number of uninfected children become orphans. The objective of the present study was to determine the HIV prevalence rate and the risk factors in pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in the Greater Harare area of Zimbabwe. Women presenting for antenatal care in four maternity clinics between May 1994 and June 1995 were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies following informed consent, counselling and completion of a questionnaire. Of the 1.168 women, 30.4 pc tested HIV-1 positive, with prevalence rates ranging from 23.6 pc at a lower density clinic, 28.6 pc in a medium density clinic, 30.7 pc in a higher density clinic and 33.2 pc at the referral maternity hospital. HIV-2 was present in 7.6 pc of the women. The 20 to 29 years age group had the highest HIV prevalence of 35 pc, (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.4; 95 pc CI-1.33 to 4.32). Single pregnant women were more likely to test positive, (OR = 2.1; 95 pc CI = 1.2 to 3.7). Thirty five pc of the women reported previous use of condoms and in those where condom use was reported in casual relationships, there was a higher risk of HIV (OR 6.1; 95 pc CI = 2.1 to 17.3). Reported use of intravaginal herbs was associated with HIV risk (OR 1.4; 95 pc CI = 1.1 to 1.8; p < 0.03). History of genital ulcer (OR = 2.3), discharge (OR = 2.4), rash (OR = 2.7), genital ulcer with PID (OR = 5.8) was significantly associated with HIV infection. Present findings indicate a 30.4 pc HIV prevalence rate for a sample of 1,168 pregnant women in Harare. This rate is much higher than the 18 pc HIV prevalence rate reported for 1,008 pregnant women in the same Greater Harare area in 1990. We conclude that there is need for further innovative and aggressive community based as well as institutional interventions aimed at reducing HIV risk. Prevention strategies should include a wide range of socially contextualized initiatives.",The Central African journal of medicine,1996 Jan,Zimbabwe,1996,90
8490895,Treatment compliance in childhood and adolescence.,"Experience reveals that there is significant noncompliance with self-administered medication, especially in chronic conditions such as cancer. Noncompliance transcends the boundary of disease categories and age group. However, this is most prevalent during the adolescent years when the process of transition from parental dependency to autonomy produces confusion as to who is responsible for administration of medication. Noncompliance can result in the misjudgment of efficacy of a drug or regimen that may necessitate additional tests, alteration of dose, treatment course, and hospitalization. Currently in the United States, a large percentage of pediatric cancer patients are treated according to research protocols. In a research setting, noncompliance can result in erroneous or inconsistent findings, potentially affecting investigational results. With the availability of venous access ports and sophisticated, yet easy-to-operate pumps, increasingly, it is possible to administer parenteral medications at home. This adds a new dimension to the self-administration of medication that previously concerned mainly oral therapy. Various factors concerning the patient, disease, health providers, and treatment characteristics determine how well a given regimen is adhered to. Because a significant number of determinants are involved, it is often not possible, with any degree of certainty, to identify noncompliers or to predict the level of patient adherence to the treatment. Major factors in any successful therapy include the availability of effective medications and compliance with therapy regimen. With the advent of more successful treatments for childhood and adolescent cancer, the compliance factor is gaining greater importance because therapy currently is given with curative, rather than palliative intent. The availability of questionnaires, tests, and devices can help, to some extent, examine the degree of patient compliance. Family and social support, individualized programs, reminders to reduce forgetfulness, personalized needs assessment, and education can reduce noncompliance. Compliance is a complex and multifaceted issue that is still poorly understood and requires further investigation.",Cancer,1993 May 15,United States,1993,90

The VA Dental Longitudinal Study (DLS) provided information on the restorative treatment received by 593 healthy adult males during a 10-year period. Utilization of restorative services was measured by calculating the percentage of surfaces that needed and received treatment, as identified by the DLS examiners by clinical and radiographic examination. Oral examinations were initiated in 1969 with subsequent examinations occurring at approximately 3-year intervals. Personality measures for these individuals were obtained using the EPI-Q, a shortened form of the Eysenck Personality Inventory. A plot of neuroticism versus the utilization measure yielded a curvilinear relationship suggesting that participants seeking the most dental care scored moderately on the neuroticism scale while those scoring lowest and highest on this scale sought less treatment. In contrast, the introversion/extraversion scale showed no apparent relationship with dental care utilization. Results from the regression analysis suggest that dentition and socioeconomic status are strong determinants of utilization and that need for restorative treatment influences utilization.","Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",1990 Jul-Aug,United States,1990,90

To investigate the determinants of the diffusion in Denmark of five laparoscopic technologies (cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, surgery for colon cancer, surgery for inguinal hernia and fundoplication), questionnaires on seventeen factors' influence on the adoption (stimulating or impeding) were sent to fifty-nine hospitals. Fifty hospitals (85%) responded. Overall, 98% adopted laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Denmark between 1991 and 1995, whereas the remainder of the technologies were adopted by 7-65% of hospitals performing these operations. Large and specialized hospitals were the earliest adopters. The factors, nature of technology (minimally invasive versus conventional), training (appropriate training courses), competition (between specialties and between hospitals) and media attention have stimulated the diffusion, whereas three budget factors (budget for investment, budget for operation and public regulation) usually had an impeding effect. Stimulating factors prevail for all laparoscopic technologies indicating that some guidance of the adoption and use of new health technologies might be necessary. In Denmark, one of the suggested health policies to secure timely guidance is the establishment of an early warning system.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",1998 Aug,Ireland,1998,90
9231287,Adherence: a matter of self-efficacy and power.,"This paper examines the relationship between self-efficacy and social power (expert and referent) and how the application of this relationship, leads to client adherence and compliance. Referent power is defined, including methods that health care professionals may use to develop and apply referent power. Expert power is defined and addressed in the context of referent power, self-esteem and self-efficacy as a means of promoting adherence. Self-efficacy as a concept is defined and explored in the context of social power. The relationships between self-efficacy and social power (expert and referent) are shown as important determinants of adherence and compliance. The theory of the application of referent and expert power in relationship with self-efficacy has been compared with an effective programme, yielding high compliance, at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, showing the theory's relevance and applicability in determining compliance. Explored are the reasons for non-compliance in the elderly population and how the theory model can remedy these detriments for compliance. The empowerment of elderly patients through the application of this theory to medication compliance is examined. The determination of adherence and compliance is shown by the application of the relationship between self-efficacy and both expert and referent power.",Journal of advanced nursing,1997 Jul,England,1997,90
9648039,Psychosocial determinants of alcohol use among minority youth living in public housing developments.,"Youth residing in low income, inner city, public housing developments might be extremely vulnerable to psychosocial risk factors associated with alcohol use. In this study, we developed and tested a model of alcohol etiology with 624 African-American and Hispanic 7th graders residing in public housing developments. The students completed questionnaires concerning their alcohol use, social influences on their drinking, their drinking attitudes and knowledge, their psychosocial skills, and demographic and behavioral control information. Logistic regression analyses indicated that social influences from adults, friends, and family members predicted alcohol use. Individual psychosocial characteristics, e.g., drinking refusal, lowered the odds of drinking. These findings imply that effective prevention approaches targeting minority urban youths residing in public housing developments should provide them with an awareness of social influences to drink, correct misperceptions concerning the prevalence of drinking, and train them in relevant psychosocial skills.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
8350037,"Diagnostic delay, clinical stage, and social class: a hospital based study.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To measure delay in admission to a large hospital and to study the role of social class and other potential determinants of delay. DESIGN: Interview of a 10% sample of newly diagnosed patients admitted to medical or surgical wards, and all those admitted for external hernia or colon cancer between June 1989 and May 1990. SETTING: The largest hospital in an Italian region of five million inhabitants. SUBJECTS: The study population consisted of 330 patients with a range of different medical and surgical conditions, 83 patients with external hernias, and 97 patients with colon cancers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After patient interview and discharge from hospital, the clinical record was consulted for information on the length of stay and the diagnosis, and in particular for the staging of hernia or colon cancer (according to the protocol of the Jefferson Medical College). Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. There was an association between advanced disease at hospital admission and the patient's educational level. In each of the three groups of patients, those with the highest educational level had a 30% or lower probability of being admitted to hospital with advanced disease compared with those with the lowest education level (after allowance for sex, age, area of residence, and marital status). CONCLUSION: Lower social class was associated with a more advanced clinical stage of hernia or colon cancer, and with a higher probability of urgent admission to the hospital for a newly diagnosed disease. Delay in seeking care, did not however, seem to explain the social class differentials for disease stage.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1993 Jun,England,1993,90
2359306,"Beverage preference, beverage type and subject gender as determinants of alcohol consumption in the laboratory.","Effects of beverage preference, beverage type and subject gender on ad libitum consumption of alcoholic beverages in the laboratory were evaluated. Undergraduate social drinkers (18 male, 18 female), with equal numbers of each gender stating a preference for beer, wine or mixed drinks, were selected. Subjects participated in three separate 30-minute ad lib drinking sessions and were presented with one of the three types of alcoholic beverage at each session. Data on total volume of beverage and of absolute ethanol consumed as well as blood alcohol concentration (BAC) attained were collected in each session. Subjects preferring wine or mixed drinks drank more alcohol and reached higher BACs when imbibing their beverage of choice than when drinking non-preferred beverages. Subjects preferring beer, however, showed no differences on these drinking measures as a function of beverage type. Men's reports of routine alcohol use had a high positive correlation with actual alcohol consumption observed in the laboratory, whereas for female subjects the correlation was near zero. Implications for interpretation of past ad lib drinking studies and the planning of future ones are discussed.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1990 Jul,United States,1990,90
8398220,Predicting physical activity change in men and women in two New England communities.,"We describe the predictors of change in physical activity in a population-derived sample of residents of two New England communities. In 1986-1987 and again in 1990-1991, we assessed the self-reported physical activity of 1,081 survey respondents using a single question concerning the frequency of exercise-induced sweating. We measured and analyzed sociodemographic variables, cardiovascular disease risk factors, health knowledge and beliefs, social support variables, and exercise performance variables at baseline as potential predictors of physical activity change. We defined physical activity change in subjects as follows: maintainers (12.2%) persisted with > or = 3 times per week of activity, adopters (16.0%) increased activity to > or = 3 times per week, quitters (11.9%) decreased activity to < 3 times per week, and sedentary (59.9%) individuals persisted with < 3 times per week of activity. Using polychotomous multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that short-term success with exercise and weight loss, school children's recommendation of exercise, and work outside the home predicted adoption or maintenance of increased physical activity in women. For men, short-term success with exercise and weight loss and health beliefs regarding the role of exercise in preventing heart attacks and stroke were the major determinants of maintaining or adopting increased physical activity. This identification of the predictors of physical activity change provides the rationale for future sex-specific strategies aimed at increasing regular physical activity and long-term adherence to an active lifestyle.",American journal of preventive medicine,1993 Jul-Aug,Netherlands,1993,90

The acute effects of psychosocial processes on cardiovascular activity during daily life were examined by random-effects regression. Healthy adults (N = 120) were monitored over a 6-day period with ABP monitors and computer-assisted self-report assessments. Task strain, social conflict, and emotional activation were rated following each ABP measurement, as were activity, posture, and other covariates. Results show that blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were elevated during periods of emotional activation (high negative affect or high arousal). Diastolic BP was lower during periods involving high decisional control, and HR was lower during high-control, low-demand activities. There were substantial individual differences in the effects of psychosocial influences on ambulatory cardiovascular activity. Psychological factors are reliable determinants of ABP, which may account in part for the unique predictive value of ABP.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1998 Jan,United States,1998,90

Eighty patients with HD were assessed with the Huntington's Disease-Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (HD-ADL). Sixty-seven patients also completed a comprehensive assessment of cognitive and voluntary motor functioning and chorea. The latter measures were correlated with HD-ADL total score and with most HD-ADL items, but not with those items dealing with marital and family relationship adjustment. Findings suggest that psychomotor speed and the ability to regulate attention may be particularly important determinants of everyday functioning in mild HD. Consistent with previously reported observations, this appears to be true even after accounting for individual differences in the severity of chorea and voluntary motor impairment.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90

A study in pauper children attending schools in an urban strip in Lisbon].,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether race is a factor of blood pressure levels in school-age children of similar social status, and to investigate other potential determinants of the levels of blood pressure. DESIGN: Inquiry in schools of the suburbs of Lisbon. SETTING: Three schools, four medical observers (general practitioners with school-health functions). SUBJECTS: Three hundred ninety seven children, aged 6-14 years, both sexes, 296 being white and 101 non-white. INTERVENTIONS: Inquiry to the following individual characteristics--sex, age, race, birthplace, type of housing, house availability of water, electricity and waste water, type of transportation to school, number of cohabitans, family income, school marks. Individual determination of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), weight and height. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood pressure values were cross-analyzed with all the determined variables, and the virtual correlations were checked. Main results as follows: Race does not influence either SBP or DBP. In this age group, sex does not influence blood pressure values. The used markers of socioeconomical status have equally no influence on blood pressure. Age has only a significant repercussion on SBP. No significant correlation was found between height and blood pressure. Body weight, however, influence either SBP or DBP. SBP was found to be lower in the second of two successive measurements, and the difference increases with age. CONCLUSIONS: In this school-aged biracial population, body weight seems to be the major factor of blood pressure levels, in the sense-bigger weight, higher SBP and DBP.",Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,1991 Nov,Portugal,1991,90
10196044,Contextual determinants of female-female mounting in laboratory rats.,"Female-female mounting is widespread among mammalian species, but little is known about the proximal function of this behaviour. While such mounting is often regarded as a 'masculine' trait, its widespread occurrence may indicate that it serves specific functions within the context of female-female social behaviour. We valuated female mounting behaviour in Long-Evans rats in standard observation chambers and in a seminatural enclosure. Under these conditions, we examined a number of potential factors that might influence mounting, including the oestrous cycle, social hierarchy, familiarity and male presence. The female's mounting was not influenced by her own oestrous cycle, but did vary with the oestrous cycle of the stimulus female. Socially dominant females mounted significantly more than subordinate females, and mounting by the dominant female was most frequent when the subordinate female was sexually receptive. Females mounted (and fought with) unfamiliar females significantly more than they did with familiar cagemates. Female-female mounting was dramatically reduced when males were present. Further testing showed that female mounting did not affect the induction of the progestational state of pregnancy, suggesting that female mounting does not function as a pseudomale behaviour that can substitute for genital stimulation provided by the male. Based on these data, female mounting does not appear to function as a sexual behaviour per se, but may serve as a form of female social behaviour related to maintenance of the female's social status within female groups. In this regard, the results of this study suggest that female mounting is part of the normal female's complex behavioural repertoire and does not necessarily reflect masculinization of some underlying neural substrate.

9403607,Population versus clinical view of case fatality from acute coronary heart disease: results from the WHO MONICA Project 1985-1990. Multinational MONItoring of Trends and Determinants in CArdiovascular Disease.,"BACKGROUND: The clinical view of case fatality (CF) from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in those reaching the hospital alive is different from the population view. Registration of both hospitalized AMI cases and out-of-hospital coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths in the WHO MONICA Project allows both views to be reconciled. The WHO MONICA Project provides the largest data set worldwide to explore the relationship between CHD CF and age, sex, coronary event rate, and first versus recurrent event. METHODS AND RESULTS: All 79,669 events of definite AMI or possible coronary death, occurring from 1985 to 90 among 5,725,762 people, 35 to 64 years of age, in 29 MONICA populations are the basis for CF calculations. Age-adjusted CF (percentage of CHD events that were fatal) was calculated across populations, stratified for different time periods, and related to age, sex, and CHD event rate. Median 28-day population CF was 49% (range, 35% to 60%) in men and 51% (range, 34% to 70%) in women and was particularly higher in women than men in populations in which CHD event rates were low. Median 28-day CF for hospitalized events was much lower: in men 22% (range, 15% to 36%) and in women 27% (range, 19% to 46%). Among hospitalized events CF was twice as high for recurrent as for first events. CONCLUSIONS: Overall 28-day CF is halved for hospitalized events compared with all events and again nearly halved for hospitalized 24-hour survivors. Because approximately two thirds of 28-day CHD deaths in men and women occurred before reaching the hospital, opportunities for reducing CF through improved care in the acute event are limited. Major emphasis should be on primary and secondary prevention.",Circulation,1997 Dec 2,United States,1997,90
2253992,Mortality determinants and prediction of outcome in high risk newborns.,"The aim of this study was to determine independent patient-related predictors of mortality in high risk newborns admitted at our centre. The study population comprised 100 consecutive newborns each, from the premature unit (PU) and sick baby care unit (SBCU), respectively. Thirteen high risk factors (variables) for each of the two units, were entered into a multivariate regression analysis. Variables with independent predictive value for poor outcome (i.e., death) in PU were, weight less than 1 kg, hyaline membrane disease, neurologic problems, and intravenous therapy. High risk factors in SBCU included, blood gas abnormality, bleeding phenomena, recurrent convulsions, apnea, and congenital anomalies. Identification of these factors guided us in defining priority areas for improvement in our system of neonatal care. Also, based on these variables a simple predictive score for outcome was constructed. The prediction equation and the score were cross-validated by applying them to a 'test-set' of 100 newborns each for PU and SBCU. Results showed a comparable sensitivity, specificity and error rate.",Indian pediatrics,1990 Jun,India,1990,90
12320114,Marital status and earnings in developed countries.,"""When estimating earnings equations for men in the United States, a dichotomous variable for whether or not the man is currently married is often included as a regressor. The coefficient estimate for this variable is most usually large and significant. However, there is rarely much discussion of the marriage effect. This effect is central to this study, which contributes to the understanding of this statistical association in two ways. First, it shows that the relationship exists in almost all of the fourteen developed countries examined and across several different time periods. Controlling for age, and, when available, education, race/ethnicity, hours worked, and location, marriage differences in annual earnings in favor of currently married males range from 0% to 30%. Second, it finds that there are important differences between those who are separated, divorced, widowed, and never married.""",Journal of population economics,1995 Nov,Germany,1995,90
8968626,Women's self-esteem: a community study of women who report and do not report childhood sexual abuse.,"BACKGROUND: The determinants of self-esteem have been little studied in non-clinic samples. It has been suggested recently that child sexual abuse (CSA) may be a major determinant of low self-esteem in adulthood. METHOD: The psychosocial circumstances associated with low self-esteem in two random samples of women, one reporting CSA, the other not, were compared, with particular emphasis on characteristics of family of origin. A two-phase (postal-then-interview) random community study assessed self-esteem and related variables. RESULTS: Psychosocial variables predicting low self-esteem were the same in the two groups. They included being a follower or a loner, having an overcontrolling mother, being poorly qualified, giving a history of depressive disorder and displaying current psychiatric disorder. In addition, the subject's CSA status led to low self-esteem but only when it was of the most intrusive type. The CSA women had substantially lower mean total self-esteem score. However, not all aspects of self-esteem were diminished equally; 12/30 items differed between the two groups, and two of the five generated self-esteem factors, which we named Pessimism and Fatalism, which differed between the control group and the whole CSA group. There were no differences for Likeability and Determination. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of low self-esteem for women include childhood temperament, a poor relationship with the mother, low qualification attainment, psychiatric morbidity, both previous and current, and, only when it is the most intrusive, CSA.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1996 Dec,England,1996,90
2239359,Alcohol consumption in parents and offspring: a study of the family correlation structure in a general population.,"Alcohol consumption was recorded for 2390 spouses and 498 children of age 18 or above living with their parents. The spouse correlation was 0.67, whereas parent-offspring and sibling correlations were all close to 0.35. This family correlation structure implies an upper limit for heritability of 0.44. The design does not permit a separation of effect of cultural (environmental) and genetic transmission in families, but comparisons with previous heritability analyses suggest that heritability is in fact close to the upper limit, implying little or no cultural transmission. There were virtually no correlations between alcohol consumption and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Nor did consumption correlate substantially with symptoms in first-degree relatives. These results do not support hypotheses of common genetic nor even of common environmental determinants for alcohol consumption and mental disorders.",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,1990 Aug,United States,1990,90
9916298,Educational status and resources for child care as predictors of TBE vaccination coverage in schoolchildren of an endemic area in Austria.,"Since the introduction of the Austrian tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination program in 1981 vaccination coverage of children has not been investigated sufficiently. Numerous socioeconomic and demographic factors have been identified as being associated with low vaccination coverage in childhood for most vaccinations. This study focuses on parental educational status and on resources for child care as determinants of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination coverage of schoolchildren in an endemic TBE area of Austria. The target population were children in the first, fourth and seventh year of school education in Styria, Austria. Therefore, the sample consisting of 2470 children was divided into three age groups, children aged 7, 10 and 13 years. We performed a representative cross-sectional study. The information concerning the vaccination status of each child was recorded by means of an anonymous questionnaire given to the parents by the classroom teachers. This procedure ensured a high overall response rate of 79.8%. The prevalence of at least one TBE vaccination was 93.9% for the 7 year old, 97.8% for the 10 and 97.9% for the 13 year old. The lowest vaccination rates were found in families with four or more children (94.0%) and for those children who had unemployed parents (92.9%). The multivariate analysis indicates that TBE vaccination coverage is affected by a large number of children in the family (p = 0.0003), an urban place of residence (p = 0.0001) and by a low level of education of the mother (p = 0.013). The results suggest that, though overall high coverage in schoolchildren, vaccination programmes should be focused on large and socially deprived families.",Zentralblatt fur Hygiene und Umweltmedizin = International journal of hygiene and environmental medicine,1998 Dec,Germany,1998,90
7789476,Prospective study of risk factors for early and persistent wheezing in childhood.,"The object of this study was to determine the relative importance of low birth weight, preterm birth, low maternal age, household size, exposure to maternal smoking, personal smoking at 16 yrs of age, early termination of breastfeeding and socioeconomic status in the aetiology of wheezing illness in the first 5 yrs of life, and on the persistence of this illness at 16 yrs of age. In 15,712 children born in Britain during one week of April 1970, the occurrence of wheezing by 5 yrs of age, and of wheezing in the past year at 16 yrs of age within this group were analysed in multivariate logistic regression against each potential risk factor. The independent determinants of wheezing by 5 yrs of age were male sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) for 15+ cigarettes.day-1 = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.22-1.58) and low birthweight (OR for birthweight < 2.5 kg = 1.26; 95% Cl 1.07-1.50). Of children who had wheezed by 5 yrs of age, 15% reported wheezing in the past 12 months at 16 yrs of age. The persistence of symptoms at 16 yrs of age was independently related to low maternal age (OR for 20 vs 40 yrs of age = 1.96; 95% CI 1.08-3.45) and to high social status (OR for most vs least advantaged = 1.95; 95% CI 1.13-3.38). We conclude that low birth weight and maternal smoking in pregnancy are independent risk factors for early childhood wheezing, but in 85% of children with early wheezing it resolves by 16 yrs of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The European respiratory journal,1995 Mar,England,1995,90
8819574,The effectiveness of barrier methods of contraception in preventing the spread of HIV.,"Because barrier methods provide protection against bacterial sexually transmitted diseases, these methods are valuable public health adjuncts irrespective of their effect on HIV. Male latex condoms offer substantial protection against HIV infection. Women at risk of sexual acquisition of HIV infection need one or more prophylactic methods that they can control. While the available spermicide products may serve this purpose, current data do not allow firm casual inferences. Large and well designed epidemiologic studies are required to examine the association between female use of barrier methods and HIV infection. These are difficult and costly to perform, however, and to date have yielded conflicting results. Finally, prospective studies in high-incidence cohorts are necessary, and the relationships between spermicide use, local irritation, the vaginal flora and HIV incidence rates must be clarified.","AIDS (London, England)",1995,England,1995,90

The six-month cumulative life-table discontinuation rate was 7.6%. Menstrual side effects were the most common reasons given for early implant removal, although women who discontinued use were no more likely than those who continued with the method to report menstrual irregularities. Women who opted for early removal were more likely than those who continued with the method to experience headaches, hair loss, weight gain and arm infection. Logistic regression analysis indicates that dissatisfaction with prior contraceptive methods, a partner who wants a child within the next two years, perceived pressure from health care providers to choose the implant, exposure to negative media coverage and the number of implant side effects significantly predict early implant discontinuation. Women's social and demographic characteristics, Medicaid status and motivation to avoid an unplanned pregnancy were not significantly related to early removal.",Family planning perspectives,1996 Nov-Dec,United States,1996,90

No differences in menarcheal age were found with respect to geographic origin. The reasons for the earlier pubertal maturation are not clear. Factors associated with the rapid transition from an underprivileged to a privileged environment are probably involved, besides genetic determinants.

The Swiss Tropical Institute Field Laboratory was founded in Ifakara in the Kilombero District in southeastern Tanzania in 1957. It has evolved into the Ifakara Centre, a national but peripherally located research centre involved in applied, operational and health systems research, training, and direct health sector support activities. Since 1991, the centre has been an affiliate of the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania. It has achieved an autonomous status and attracts frontline priority research and high quality research teams; the ongoing phase 3 malaria vaccine trial is a recent major activity. Starting from biomedical priorities in research and training, the centre has broadened its spectrum to include social science disciplines including economics. The major determinants for this development were (i) the long-term partnership between the executing agency in the north and the partners in the south at the national level, (ii) the support of this partnership by a long-term commitment of the major funding partners, (iii) the concept that local priorities form the basis of all activities, and (iv) the linking of research and training to public health action. The last two elements are considered to be crucial for the centre's multidisciplinary approach to health research and the support of public health in Tanzania and in eastern and southern Africa.",Acta tropica,1994 Aug,Netherlands,1994,90

However, the personal values or ""guiding principles"" of generalist physicians have not been identified scientifically. To establish a benchmark, we measured the personal values of exemplary family physicians because they serve as role models for current and future physicians. We also explored the relationship between personal values and practice satisfaction. METHODS: We obtained a list of 330 family physicians nominated for the American Academy of Family Physicians' (AAFP) Family Doctor of the Year award for the years 1988 through 1993. We asked them to complete the Schwartz Values Questionnaire, a 56-item instrument for measuring personal values. They also answered three questions concerning practice satisfaction. RESULTS: The return rate was 83%. The physicians' mean age was 63 years. They had been in practice an average of 34 years, 93% were male, and 52% practiced in rural areas. Honesty was rated as the most important of the 56 values, and social power as the least important. Of the 10 value types (groups of common values), the responding physicians rated ""Benevolence"" as most important and ""Power"" as least important. Practice satisfaction correlated positively with the Benevolence value type (r = .21, P = .001) and negatively with the Power value type (r = -.15, P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Of the 10 value types, Benevolence was rated the most important and Power the least important by exemplary family physicians, and both value types also correlated, positively and negatively, respectively, with their practice satisfaction. These results have implications for the selection, training, and career satisfaction of generalist physicians.",The Journal of family practice,1995 Sep,United States,1995,90
12283970,[A study on the proximate determinants of fertility decline in China].,"To study the biological and behavioral process of the recent drastic fertility decline in China, the authors reviewed relating factors (proximate determinants) and applied the Bongaarts model to the population of China for the years 1971 and 1981, during which the fertility rate dropped most rapidly and substantial population control policies were performed. By application of the model, the decrease of TFR of 2.78 between 1971 and 1981 was estimated to be contributed by widespread of contraception (68%), later marriage (49%), and increase of induced abortion (28%), through shortening of the length of postpartum breastfeeding showed negative effects (-32%), on the assumption that local data could be substituted for some national data. Compared with other countries, China was characterized by coexistence of strong fertility-inhibiting effects of nonmarriage, contraception, induced abortion, and relatively strong fertility-inhibiting effects of breastfeeding. It strongly suggested that the fertility transition in China was realized by powerful population policies in the context of insufficient socioeconomic development to lead to the transition.",[Minzoku eisei] Race hygiene,1990 May,Japan,1990,90
12291753,Contemporary American attitudes toward U.S. immigration.,"""This article aims to contribute to an understanding of contemporary American attitudes toward immigration.... The paper uses data from a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in June 1993. Respondents were asked whether they would like to see the level of immigration to the United States increased, decreased or kept the same. We test several hypotheses about factors influencing respondents' attitudes, including the importance of previously unexamined predictors. These new hypotheses relate to views about the health of the U.S. economy, feelings of social and political alienation, and isolationist sentiments concerning international economic issues and foreign relations. One important discovery is the close connection between possessing restrictionist immigration attitudes and having an isolationist perspective along a broader array of international issues.""",The International migration review,1996 Summer,United States,1996,90
1585681,[Selected results of attitudes regarding nutrition behavior in the former East Germany].,"In studying the causes of individual nutritional behaviour not only the economic, social, demographic, cultural and other determinants are of importance but also psychological processes of decision and evaluation. For recording the attitudes, value-orientations and action goals a questionnaire was developed (72 items, 13 social and nutrition-related features). It was completed by 867 subjects aged between 18 and 65 years. The statistical analysis shows that the action-determining goals investigated can be classified in 5 empirically developed, factorially validated scales (expenditure, health, enjoyment, matter of minor importance, stimulus). Besides, significant relationships were revealed between the scales and the social characteristics as e.g. sex, age, education, occupation, household size, cooking, mass catering, and self-assessment of body weight.",Zeitschrift fur Ernahrungswissenschaft,1992 Mar,Germany,1992,90
9435709,Contemporary medical students' quest for self-fulfillment through community service.,"The author argues against the criticism that contemporary medical students, like most educated youth in our society, are self-centered moral relativists without a sense of social responsibility. He first frames his argument in terms of what Charles Taylor calls the three ""malaises of modernity,"" namely, the rise of individualism, an emphasis on instrumental reasoning based on bureaucratic efficiency, and the loss of political action. He goes on to show how these malaises are manifested in the academic health center and their effect on the professional socialization of future physicians. Then, using John Evan's perspective of the need to shift from ""supply-side"" to ""demand-side"" thinking in the way today's medical students are trained and Hafferty and Frank's thesis that the most critical determinants of a physician's identity operate not within the formal curriculum but in a ""hidden curriculum,"" he presents his own case of how Rush medical students, by participating in student-generated, voluntary projects--via the Rush Community Service Initiatives Program--are harnessing their individualism through commitment to serving the poor and disadvantaged. To show that the situation at Rush is not unique, the author also points to the impact that the Health of the Public and service-learning programs have been having both in academic health centers and in the communities being served. Finally, it is his contention that these community service experiences, given unconditionally to people in need, broaden the students' education by offering a population and community perspective of health and illness and, perhaps more important, bind them closer to society in both a moral and a political sense.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,1997 Dec,United States,1997,90

10379455,"Embodying inequality: a review of concepts, measures, and methods for studying health consequences of discrimination.","Investigating effects of discrimination upon health requires clear concepts, methods, and measures. At issue are both economic consequences of discrimination and accumulated insults arising from everyday and at times violent experiences of being treated as a second-class citizen, at each and every economic level. Guidelines for epidemiologic investigations and other public health research on ways people embody racism, sexism, and other forms of social inequality, however, are not well defined, as research in this area is in its infancy. Employing an ecosocial framework, this article accordingly reviews definitions and patterns of discrimination within the United States; evaluates analytic strategies and instruments researchers have developed to study health effects of different kinds of discrimination; and delineates diverse pathways by which discrimination can harm health, both outright and by distorting production of epidemiologic knowledge about determinants of population health. Three methods of studying health consequences of discrimination are examined (indirect; direct, at the individual level, in relation to personal experiences of discrimination; at the population level, such as via segregation), and recommendations are provided for developing research instruments to measure acute and cumulative exposure to different aspects of discrimination.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1999,United States,1999,90

All the 1012 55-year-old citizens of Oulu (a medium-sized Finnish town) were invited to participate in this study. 780 of them did so. Information about frequency of toothbrushing, use of extra cleaning methods, use of sugar in coffee or tea, and time of the last dental visit, lifestyle, occupational status and gender was gathered from the 533 dentate subjects. Lifestyle was measured by means of questions about physical activity, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and dietary habits. Females and people with a healthy lifestyle brushed their teeth more often. Extra cleaning methods were used more often by people with a healthy lifestyle, whereas gender and occupational status had a weaker association. Males and people with a lower occupational status used sugar in coffee or tea more often. The time from the last dental visit was longer among workers and men; lifestyle had no significant association. At the population level oral cleaning habits are a matter of a health-oriented lifestyle and gender-related behavior.

7553514,"Paradox, process and perception: the role of organizations in clinical practice guidelines development.","The role of organizations in the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has received virtually no analytic attention. In a strictly rational and disinterested world, CPGs would be assessed on the basis of the supporting evidence and applicability to practice. However, factors that have more to do with medical sociology play a key role in CPG acceptance and, in some cases, development. The entire concept of CPGs entails troubling paradoxes, many of which turn on the distinction between scientific evidence and the sociologic determinants of validation and implementation. At the root of the question of organizational roles is the issue of values: Whose values should be at the table? What values are legitimate? From what perspectives should the utility of a procedure or technology be addressed? The Canadian health care system is a largely public creature, and CPG development is part of the public policy process. In this context, decisions about organizational roles must be sensitive to conflict of interest and a diversity of values. A provisional model for participation in CPG processes would minimize the role of organizations per se, although individual participants would no doubt reflect the legitimate interests of their affiliations without representing them formally.",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,1995 Oct 15,Canada,1995,90
8398220,Predicting physical activity change in men and women in two New England communities.,"We describe the predictors of change in physical activity in a population-derived sample of residents of two New England communities. In 1986-1987 and again in 1990-1991, we assessed the self-reported physical activity of 1,081 survey respondents using a single question concerning the frequency of exercise-induced sweating. We measured and analyzed sociodemographic variables, cardiovascular disease risk factors, health knowledge and beliefs, social support variables, and exercise performance variables at baseline as potential predictors of physical activity change. We defined physical activity change in subjects as follows: maintainers (12.2%) persisted with > or = 3 times per week of activity, adopters (16.0%) increased activity to > or = 3 times per week, quitters (11.9%) decreased activity to < 3 times per week, and sedentary (59.9%) individuals persisted with < 3 times per week of activity. Using polychotomous multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that short-term success with exercise and weight loss, school children's recommendation of exercise, and work outside the home predicted adoption or maintenance of increased physical activity in women. For men, short-term success with exercise and weight loss and health beliefs regarding the role of exercise in preventing heart attacks and stroke were the major determinants of maintaining or adopting increased physical activity. This identification of the predictors of physical activity change provides the rationale for future sex-specific strategies aimed at increasing regular physical activity and long-term adherence to an active lifestyle.",American journal of preventive medicine,1993 Jul-Aug,Netherlands,1993,90
8146138,Human ecology and behavior and sexually transmitted bacterial infections.,"The three direct determinants of the rate of spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are sexual behaviors, the mean duration of infectiousness, and the mean efficiency of sexual transmission of each STD. Underlying ecological and behavioral factors that operate through one or more of these direct determinants lie on a continuum, ranging from those most proximate back to those more remote (in time or mechanism) from the direct determinants. Most remote and least modifiable are the historical stages of economic development that even today conspicuously influence patterns of sexual behavior. Next are the distribution and changing patterns of climate, hygiene, and population density; the global population explosion and stages of the demographic transition; and ongoing changes in human physiology (e.g., menarche at younger age) and culture (e.g., later marriage). More proximate on the continuum are war, migration, and travel; and current policies for economic development and social welfare. Most recent or modifiable are technologic and commercial product development (e.g., oral contraceptives); circumcision, condom, spermicide, and contraception practices; patterns of illicit drug use that influence sexual behaviors; and the accessibility, quality, and use of STD health care. These underlying factors help explain why the curable bacterial STDs are epidemic in developing countries and why the United States is the only industrialized country that has failed to control bacterial STDs during the AIDS era.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994 Mar 29,United States,1994,90
7950522,Childhood antecedents of schizophrenia and affective illness: social adjustment at ages 7 and 11.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the social adjustment in childhood of people who as adults have psychiatric disorders. DESIGN: Subjects in a prospectively followed up cohort (the national child development study) who had been admitted as adults to psychiatric hospitals were compared with the rest of the cohort on ratings of social behaviour made by teachers at the ages of 7 and 11 years. SUBJECTS: 40 adult patients with schizophrenic illnesses, 35 with affective psychoses, and 79 with neurotic illness who had been admitted for psychiatric reasons by the age of 28. 1914 randomly selected members of the cohort who had never been admitted for psychiatric treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall scores and scores for overreaction (externalising behaviour) and underreaction (internalising behaviour) with the Bristol social adjustment guide at ages 7 and 11. RESULTS: At the age of 7 children who developed schizophrenia were rated by their teachers as manifesting more social maladjustment than controls (overall score 4.3 (SD 2.4) v 3.1 (2.0); P < 0.01). This was more apparent in the boys (5 (2.6)) than the girls (3.4 (1.8)) and related to overreactive rather than underreactive behaviour. At both ages prepsychotic (affective) children differed little from normal controls. By the age of 11 preneurotic children, particularly the girls, had an increased rating of maladjustment (including overreactions and underreactions). CONCLUSION: Abnormalities of social adjustment are detectable in childhood in some people who develop psychotic illness. Sex and the rate of development of different components of the capacity for social interaction are important determinants of the risk of psychosis and other psychiatric disorders in adulthood.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1994 Sep 17,England,1994,90

7646747,What makes a tutor effective? A structural-equations modeling approach to learning in problem-based curricula.,"PURPOSE: To test and further develop a causal model of the influence of tutor behaviors on student achievement and interest in the context of problem-based learning. METHOD: Data from 524 tutorial groups involving students participating in the four-year undergraduate health sciences curriculum at the University of Limburg in 1992-93 were analyzed. The tutorial groups were guided by 261 tutors. Overall, 3,792 data records were studied, with each student participating in an average of 2.3 groups. Correlations among tutors' social-congruence, expertise-use, and cognitive-congruence behaviors, small-group functioning, and student' self-study time, intrinsic interest in subject matter, and level of achievement were analyzed using structural-equations modeling. This statistical technique allows the investigator to test causal hypotheses on correlational data by comparing the structure of data with a theoretical model. RESULTS: After minor adaptations, the hypothesized causal model of the effective tutor fitted the data extremely will. Each tutor's level of expertise use and social congruence not only directly affected his or her level of cognitive congruence but also affected other elements of the model. Level of social congruence influenced group functioning in a direct fashion, while expertise use had a slightly negative effect on the students' level of self-study time and a slightly positive effect on level of achievement. As hypothesized, the level of cognitive congruence influenced tutorial-group functioning. Level of group functioning affected self-study time and intrinsic interest. Finally, time spent on self-study influenced level of achievement. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that subject-matter expertise; a commitment to students' learning and their lives in a personal, authentic way; and the ability to express oneself in the language used by the student are all determinants of learning in problem-based curricula. The theory of the effective tutor, presented in this article, merges two different perspectives prevalent in the literature. One perspective emphasizes the personal qualities of the tutor: his or her ability to communicate with students in an informal way, coupled with an empathic attitude that enables the tutor to encourage student learning by creating an atmosphere in which open exchange of ideas is facilitated. The other stresses the tutor's subject-matter knowledge as a determinant of learning. The data presented in this article suggest that what is needed, really, is much of both.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,1995 Aug,United States,1995,90
10653046,Patient factors and compliance with asthma therapy.,"Compliance by patients to prescribed treatment regimens can be considered as the interface between effective therapy and effective disease management. Compliance can be affected by the nature of the relationship between the practitioner and the patient, and their attitudes towards each other. It has also been suggested that practitioner behaviour can influence patient behaviour and health status. However, each individual patient is influenced in his or her attitudes, and reactions to disease and its management, by a wide variety of patient-related factors. These include psychological variables such as mood, beliefs, and the knowledge, motivation and ability of the patient. Social factors may also play a role: these include age, marital and socioeconomic status and level of education. Results from a range of studies in patients with pulmonary or other diseases show that the psychosocial determinants of compliance are only poorly understood, and suggest that compliance cannot be predicted from patients' health status and that social factors are weak indicators only. Furthermore, it appears from available data that patients' beliefs about health issues are not as useful as indicators of likely compliance as was previously believed.",Respiratory medicine,1999 Dec,England,1999,90

Among the various health status dimensions included, self-rated health was found to be the most important determinant, regardless of type of service. Factors, other than health status aspects affecting GP visits, were preoccupation with health and help seeking attitude. Volume of resources (GP per population), socio-demographic characteristics and social networks did not appear as important. Several inequitable effects were revealed on referrals: First, higher rate of referral of patients with higher educational achievement indicates a bias towards higher social status groups.

9642740,[Strategies to control cataracts].,"Cataracts, often associated with aging (80%), are a major cause of blindness (more than 50% of cases of blindness in Africa), and for this reason, up to 80% of cases could be predicted or prevented. The socio-economic costs (care and loss of productivity) are increased by morbidity (blindness, impaired vision, congenital, complicated or infected cataracts). The biological determinants of cataracts account for the difficulties in developing and implementing effective preventive action. These epidemiological determinants (prevalence, incidence, increase in life expectancy) account for the size of the public health problem. The surgical removal of cataracts in Africa currently only deals with about 1% of the prevalence rate or 10% of the incidence. Cataracts are, however, easy to cure, resulting in great benefits to public health. The waiting list for cataract operations is very short because of social and cultural barriers which limit the acceptability and accessibility of treatment. Rather than formalizing the dogmatic choices of surgical techniques and structures (fixed, mobile, advanced?), we should promote all phases of treatment from active screening and the selection of cases for surgery to the follow-up of interventions and their impact. We should also increase public awareness, develop a system for the transfer of information that is effective and improve the cost-effectiveness and capacity of the region to provide high quality services on a large scale. We must promote patient satisfaction at all stages of treatment: its quality, its delivery and its low cost.","Sante (Montrouge, France)",1998 Mar-Apr,France,1998,90
10409795,[Public health and behavior modification: a contemporary issue].,"Most cardiovascular disease risk factors can be modified through life-style changes. Choices of habits and behavior are in fact heavily influenced by concepts of normality and social values. However, social influences fail to fully explain these choices, insofar as health-related habits are also shaped by personal experience. The main limitations of public health practice can probably be found at this subjective level. This article emphasizes the need to consider determinants of human behavior at different levels, increasingly important for strategies to promote health and prevent disease, or at least delay its onset. The primary focus is to influence rules and laws aimed at protecting life. The article also discusses possible strategies for translating scientific knowledge into public health action, avoiding the restriction to the ""healthy life"" regulatory role. Finally, participation by public health professionals is suggested in places where population groups share life experiences, such as workplaces, schools, and churches, developing approaches which include those experiences as well as fears and hopes related to health. Scientific facts might thus be transformed into more familiar elements of everyday life.",Cadernos de saude publica,1999 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1999,90
7639977,The relational determinants of condom use with commercial sex partners in Thailand.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the extent and determinants of condom use with commercial sex partners among lower socioeconomic status groups in the Thai population. DESIGN: Respondents were sampled in Udon Thani, Saraburi and Bangkok in 1992. Completed sample size was 678 women in brothels, 330 male truck drivers and 1,075 men aged 17-45 years. Behavioral data and local sexual network information were collected using structured questionnaires (face-to-face interviews), focus groups and in-depth unstructured interviews. METHODS: Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Condom use with commercial partners remains inconsistent. Consistent use was reported by 61% of women in brothels, 25% of truck drivers, and 29% of men in the low-income population. The single strongest predictor of consistent condom use for all groups is type of partnership. Consistent use drops significantly with regular (multivisit) commercial sex partners compared with casual (single visit) commercial partners; adjusted odds of consistent use are 0.22 for women and 0.25 for men. Brothel women report that one in five of their commercial partners is a 'regular', and 20% of the young men who report a commercial partner report a 'regular'. DISCUSSION: The strongest determinant of consistent condom use is the nature of the relational bond between the partners, rather than their individual characteristics, knowledge or attitudes. To raise condom use further, programs will have to move beyond the standard knowledge-attitudes-practices paradigm focus on individual attributes to address the contextual determinants of behavior.","AIDS (London, England)",1995 May,England,1995,90

The census data allow an evaluation of socio-economic status of each subject, using variables such as education or occupation, or constructing indexes inclusive of deprivation indexes. Follow-up is from the census up to 1995 and for specific causes of death from 1987 (Leghorn) or 1991 (Florence). Estimates of risk are computed comparing rates of mortality among socio-economic groups, by means of poisson regression models, or by means of Standardized Mortality Ratios using the indirect method. The causes of deaths have been selected mainly because explained by known and strong determinants. As far as overall mortality, the results suggest the persistence of gradients by social class, more often negative among males. Mortality from lung cancer has a strong negative social class gradient among males, and a divergent gradient among women in the two towns, which is interpreted as the effect of a different prevalence of smoking by period, social class and sex. High RRs among lower socio-economic groups have been detected for liver cirrhosis mortality. Excess mortality of AIDS and overdose, an expression of the recent drug crisis, concentrates on the lower social strata and in young adults. Whereas mortality from AIDS has been detected among both sexes, deaths from overdose are occurring among males only. Being AIDS and overdose recent diseases, they stress the persistence of social inequalities over time.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,1999 Jul-Sep,Italy,1999,90
8860285,Determinants of intention to quit smoking among Dutch employees: the influence of the social environment.,"BACKGROUND: This study examines the influence of the social environment in worksites on employees' intention to quit smoking by applying the attitude-social influence-efficacy model. METHODS: Regression analyses were conducted with 509 smoking employees from eight Dutch worksites. Variables of interest were attitudes toward smoking, perceived social pressure to quit, perceived smoking behavior of others, self-efficacy, demographics, smoking history variables, company type, and smoking tolerance. RESULTS: Attitude, social pressure from people out-side the worksetting (partner, children), and self-efficacy explained 23% of the variance for intention. Past behavior increased the adjusted R2 from 0.23 to 0.29. Social influences in the worksite were unrelated to employees' intention to quit smoking. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that, in Dutch work-sites, social influences stemming from people at work have less influence on employees' intention to quit smoking than other important people outside the work situation. Implications for smoking control strategies in worksites are briefly discussed.",Preventive medicine,1996 Mar-Apr,United States,1996,90
10842504,Determinants of the risk and timing of alcohol and illicit drug use onset among natives and non-natives: similarities and differences in family attachment processes.,"This study examines data from Native Ontario reserve residents (Embree, 1993) and a sample from the Ontario Health Survey Supplement (1990-91) in order to compare and contrast the importance of family attributes such as parent-child attachment to Native and Non-native patterns of drug and alcohol use onset. Proportional Hazards modeling (Cox, 1972) was employed to identify factors associated with the risk and timing of onset of alcohol and illicit drugs for both cultural groups. For both Natives and Non-natives alike, and considering both drinking and drug use onset together, age cohort predominates as a risk factor, with youngest groups at greatest risk, and especially in the case of drug use other than alcohol. For the model of drug use timing, age of alcohol use onset is the second best predictor for Natives, although its effect is still apparent, albeit weaker, in the case of Non-natives. As for family characteristics, a number of factors emerge as determinants of risk and depend, in part, on the cultural group and the substance under consideration. Consistent with attachment theory's prediction about the universal applicability of the need for close parent-child relations (Bowlby, 1969), the findings for both Natives and Non-natives alike point to the salience of psychosocial attachment and other indicators of family functioning in affecting early onset drinking and drug use, behaviors well-recognized to lead to potentially adverse mental and physical health consequences as well as to negative social outcomes.",Social biology,1999 Spring-Summer,United States,1999,90

DESIGN: A single interview consisting of the Massara and Stunkard body image cards (1979) and questionnaires on sociocultural background, anthropometry, and dieting history were administered to volunteers from the staff of a hospital. SUBJECTS: The sample was a convenience sample of 186 women representing a range of staff positions recruited from Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, NY; 174 completed the study. Data on 150 women are presented in this article. RESULTS: Height and weight-for-height were stronger predictors of accuracy of perceived body size than ethnicity. Tall, slight women were more likely to overestimate and short, heavy women were more likely to underestimate actual body size. Ethnicity had an interactive effect with height as taller European Americans were more likely to perceive their body size as larger than actual compared with Afro-Caribbeans and African Americans. Women with a history of dieting were more likely to overestimate their size and to view it as different from what is perceived as attractive to others. APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we conclude that body size is a stronger predictor of accuracy of perceived body size than ethnicity; and dieters overestimate their body size and believe it to be heavier than their social group would prefer.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1996 Mar,United States,1996,90

8063623,The functions of self-injurious behavior: an experimental-epidemiological analysis.,"Data are summarized from 152 single-subject analyses of the reinforcing functions of self-injurious behavior (SIB). Individuals with developmental disabilities referred for assessment and/or treatment over an 11-year period were exposed to a series of conditions in which the effects of antecedent and consequent events on SIB were examined systematically by way of multielement, reversal, or combined designs. Data were collected during approximately 4,000 experimental sessions (1,000 hr), with the length of assessment for individuals ranging from 8 to 66 sessions (M = 26.2) conducted over 2 to 16.5 hr (M = 6.5). Differential or uniformly high responding was observed in 145 (95.4%) of the cases. Social-negative reinforcement (escape from task demands or other sources of aversive stimulation) accounted for 58 cases, which was the largest proportion of the sample (38.1%). Social-positive reinforcement (either attention or access to food or materials) accounted for 40 (26.3%) of the cases, automatic (sensory) reinforcement accounted for 39 (25.7%), and multiple controlling variables accounted for 8 (5.3%). Seven sets of data (4.6%) showed either cyclical or inconsistent patterns of responding that were uninterpretable. Overall results indicated that functional analysis methodologies are extremely effective in identifying the environmental determinants of SIB on an individual basis and, subsequently, in guiding the process of treatment selection. Furthermore, an accumulation of assessment data from such analyses across a large number of individuals provides perhaps the most rigorous approach to an epidemiological study of behavioral function.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1994 Summer,United States,1994,90
8803732,"Psychosocial conventionality, health orientation, and contraceptive use in adolescence.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to determine psychosocial and behavioral factors that are associated with variation in contraceptive use among adolescents. Because regular use of contraception may be seen both as a conventional behavior and as a health-protective behavior, analyses assess the association between psychosocial conventionality and health orientation, on the one hand, and variation in contraceptive use, on the other. METHODS: Analyses are based on an urban sample of 971 white, African-American, and Hispanic male and female sexually active high school students. Study participants filled out a 38-page questionnaire that included a wide range of measures derived from Problem-Behavior Theory. RESULTS: Correlational analysis and hierarchical regression analysis indicate that more regular contraceptive use is associated with greater psychosocial conventionality and also with greater orientation toward health for both male and female adolescents. These relationships hold when the sociodemographic characteristics of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, grade in school, family composition, and pregnancy experience are controlled. The linkages of psychosocial conventionality and health orientation to contraceptive behavior are stronger for African-American than for white and Hispanic adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings establish a more comprehensive and more distal set of influences on regularity of contraceptive use. In its negative relationship to problem behavior and its positive linkage with health behavior, contraceptive behavior may be seen as part of a larger, organized system of behavior in this stage of development (i.e., a more conventional adolescent lifestyle).",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1996 Jun,United States,1996,90
10565506,Clinical determinants of suicidal ideation and behavior in geriatric depression.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to find clinical characteristics that can identify elderly patients with depression at risk for suicidal ideation and to determine their prognosis. METHOD: Suicidal ideation, past suicidal behavior, severity of depression, cognitive impairment, medical burden, disability, and social support were studied in 354 patients with depression aged 61 to 93 years. The patients had in-person evaluations every 6 months and telephone evaluations for a mean of 1.8 years (SD, 2.2). RESULTS: During the index episode, suicidal ideation was predicted by previous suicide attempts with serious intent (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-5.80), severity of depression (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16), and poor social support (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.18-2.65). Suicide attempts during the year prior to entry were reported by patients with a severe index episode (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00-1.11), impaired instrumental activities of daily living (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.93), and limited impairment in activities of daily living (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.14). At the initial evaluation, severity of depression, previous attempts, and seriousness of suicidal intent during previous attempts predicted the course of suicidal ideation (concordance correlation, 0.78). During follow-up, contemporaneous severity of depression was the most important determinant of suicidal ideation over time (concordance correlation, 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly individuals with severe depression, history of suicide attempts with serious intent, and poor social support are most likely to have suicidal ideation and should be targeted for appropriate interventions. Severity of depression is the strongest predictor of the course of suicidal ideation.",Archives of general psychiatry,1999 Nov,United States,1999,90

1519079,Determinants and dimensions involved in self-evaluation of health.,"This study explores mechanisms involved in self-evaluation of health by making specifications of linkages among various dimensions of health status, physiological measures, social and behavioral factors or characteristics. The proposed structural equation model is tested by using data from a comprehensive health survey of the population of Finnmark county, Norway (1987-88), including 4549 men and 4360 women aged 30-62. The findings suggest the burden of physical distress and reliance on permanent disablement benefit to play the key role in reducing self-evaluated health. The seemingly strong labelling impact of permanent work disability, contrasted the modest effect of diagnoses of chronic disease. Moreover, the impact of both these key factors and other important determinants is strongly socially patterned. Positive health related life-style appeared to have a positive impact on self-rated health, while preoccupation with health had a negative impact. This finding adds some credibility to the suggestion that the growing occupation and fascination with health have some negative health outcomes.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Aug,England,1992,90
8511809,Factors that determine prevalence of use of contraceptive methods for men.,"Globally, men have not shared equally with women the responsibility for fertility regulation. While family planning efforts have been directed almost exclusively toward women, the lack of male involvement may also reflect the limited options available to men. Current methods for men are either coitus-dependent, such as the condom or withdrawal, or permanent, such as vasectomy. The 20-year history of social science research on male contraceptive methods is examined here in terms of the human and method factors related to the acceptability of hypothetical methods and the prevalence of use of existing methods. New male methods, particularly if reversible, may alter men's willingness to accept or share responsibility for the control of fertility. Research opportunities in the areas of gender, decision-making, communication, health education, and service delivery will be enhanced when methods for women and men are comparable.",Studies in family planning,1993 Mar-Apr,United States,1993,90

Study population were 3753 men and women aged 25-64 years who were sampled by the first MONICA Augsburg Survey (Monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease). The subjects were sampled in 1984-85, were followed up for three years, and were reexamined in 1987-88. The baseline findings showed for both men and women a statistically significant inverse association between current cigarette smoking and educational level. During the follow-up period the differences between highest and lowest educational levels increased significantly among men. In 1987-88 only 21% of the best educated men were smokers compared to 38% of those with the lowest educational level. Men with low educational levels also drank more alcohol than better educated men, whereas among women those with lowest educational level drank less alcohol than the better educated. Statistically independent of education and age it was found that male civil servants and farmers had the lowest proportion of smokers in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses. Among women, smoking was and remained most prevalent in simple white-collar occupations. In general, the findings indicate that the type of occupation and the actual working conditions have effects on life-style related risk factors which are in part independent of a social gradient. The results also suggest that the tendency to change unhealthy behavior is less pronounced in ""high risk"" groups.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1993,Switzerland,1993,90

10459890,The effect on morbidity of variability in deprivation and population stability in England and Wales: an investigation at small-area level.,"We seek to determine whether variability in deprivation at small area level, and population stability, influence standardised morbidity ratios in England and Wales. A regression analysis was conducted with data from the 1991 British Census, in order to explain variation in morbidity. Both an area deprivation score (for electoral wards) and the within-area variability of deprivation scores were examined as possible determinants of morbidity (self-reported, limiting, long-term illness). Particular attention was focused on a spatially-sensitive measure of the variability of deprivation scores within a wider 'locality'. There was a significant, positive relationship between age-standardised limiting, long-term illness and deprivation. The variation in area deprivation scores within the small areas themselves was also significant and positive. However, the variation in deprivation scores calculated for both an electoral ward and its contiguous neighbours (the locality) was slightly more significant. Areas with higher relative levels of in-migration also had significantly lower standardised morbidity ratios. Multivariate models showed that the deprivation score, the variation in deprivation scores for the broader locality, and the measure of migration, were all significant in combination. Residual analysis showed that many areas in London had lower levels of morbidity than expected, while electoral wards in the coal mining valleys of South Wales had higher levels than expected. We conclude that, for small areas (wards) in England and Wales, morbidity is related to deprivation, variation in deprivation within and surrounding each area, and the proportion of the population that are migrants. Variations in deprivation influence standardised morbidity rates, and policies which widen inequalities will influence health outcomes. Resource allocation based simply on measures of deprivation, which ignore population change within the area and variations in deprivation in the locality, may be inefficient.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Sep,England,1999,90

8827147,Early predictors of nonmarital first pregnancy and abortion.,"Most research on abortion has focused on women's characteristics at the time of the procedure, but individuals' behavior may also be shaped by their experiences from younger ages. This study uses longitudinal data on 351 California white women aged 27-30 in 1990-1991 to identify characteristics in childhood and adolescence that predict who will have a nonmarital first pregnancy and, of those who do, which women will seek an abortion. Bivariate analyses reveal that psychosocial characteristics indicating a strong sense of autonomy, such as feeling it is important not to be tied down and engaging in socially undesirable behavior, are significantly associated with the likelihood of having a nonmarital first pregnancy (odds ratios of 1.7 and 1.5, respectively), but family characteristics are not. However, among women who have a first pregnancy out of wedlock, the odds of having an abortion are mostly influenced by family rather than psychological characteristics, particularly having been a good student and having a well-educated mother (2.0 and 1.7).",Family planning perspectives,1996 May-Jun,United States,1996,90

It first prefaces a symposium titled ""Exercise adherence and behavior change: prospects, problems, and future directions."" The symposium describes the progress made during the past 5 years toward understanding the adoption and maintenance of physical activity and exercise. Specifically, research is discussed that has tested the applicability to physical activity of four psychological models of behavior: Reasoned Action, Planned Behavior, Social-Cognitive Theory, and the Transtheoretical Model of stages of change. Recent exercise interventions in clinical/community settings also are discussed to illustrate how theoretical models can be implemented to increase and maintain exercise. The second purpose of this paper is to provide a brief summary of the contemporary literatures on the determinants of physical activity and interventions designed to increase and maintain physical activity. The summary focuses on the measurement problems that have limited the advances made in theory and application in these areas of research. Progress toward resolving the measurement problems during the past 5 years is contrasted with earlier scientific consensus.",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,1994 Nov,United States,1994,90
9009810,Social determinants of cardiovascular reactivity: effects of incentive to exert influence and evaluative threat.,The effects on cardiovascular reactivity of incentive to influence the judgements of the experimenter and the threat of social evaluation were examined in a sample of 60 male and 60 female undergraduates. Participants either were guaranteed $5.00 to prepare and deliver a brief speech or were told that the money was contingent on an evaluation by the experimenter. Participants believed that their speech would be rated for either simple clarity or verbal intelligence. The contingent incentive increased systolic blood pressure reactivity by 6.5 mmHg (32%). Evaluative threat increased systolic reactivity by 7.1 mmHg (36%). These interpersonal processes could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and are likely to affect the degree of cardiovascular reactivity in laboratory studies.,Psychophysiology,1997 Jan,United States,1997,90

The goal of this paper is to document the eating patterns and problems of single homeless women and to locate the determinants of nutritional adequacy in their diets. Our findings are based on a random sample of 84 single homeless women using hostels and drop-in centers. For 85.5% of the women food was provided primarily by hostels and supplemented by the drop-ins. When their daily food intake was compared to the Canada's Food Guide recommendations, the average number of servings in each of the four food groups was below the recommended. The women in our sample indicated that their problems with food consumption were rooted in their poverty and further analysis indicated that the provision of food by social agencies was an important factor in the nutritional adequacy of their diets. Hostels and drop-in centers not only provide shelter, they have also assumed most of the responsibility for feeding the homeless. It is their poverty which burdens these women and structures their eating patterns.",Women & health,1990,United States,1990,90
1390784,Changing patterns of adolescent sexual behavior: consequences for health and development.,"Sexuality is a fundamental quality of human life, important for health, happiness, individual development, and indeed for the preservation of the human race. During the dynamic period of adolescence in which the passage from childhood to maturity takes place, sexuality takes on new dimensions; feelings become more intense, relationships become more complex, and the consequences of sexual behavior are radically altered. This not only affects the behavior of young people but also of those who interact with them, their families and peers, and those who work in the health, education, youth, social welfare, and other sectors. In the contemporary world the conditions of life for many young people have also changed, and with it patterns of sexual behavior. In general, earlier puberty, later marriage, a decline in the family leading to less control and more autonomy, and intense exposure to sexual stimuli via the mass media and travel across cultural boundaries have made pre-marital adolescent sexual activity more common. This has added to traditional problems of early marriage, newer problems of early pregnancy, childbirth, and induced abortion outside of marriage, sexually transmitted diseases, and human immunodeficiency syndrome infection leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. But the work of the World Health Organization (WHO), along with many others in the field, strongly suggests that given appropriate information and services, trust and equity between the sexes, young people will behave responsibly and well. In this paper some of the findings from methods developed by WHO for research, training, advocacy, and evaluation, and findings in relation to patterns and determinants of sexual and reproductive health and development will be described, and future directions suggested.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1992 Jul,United States,1992,90
7555215,Community level factors and child maltreatment rates.,"Using census and administrative agency data for 177 urban census tracts, variation in rates of officially reported child maltreatment is found to be related to structural determinants of community social organization: economic and family resources, residential instability, household and age structure, and geographic proximity of neighborhoods to concentrated poverty. Furthermore, child maltreatment rates are found to be intercorrelated with other indicators of the breakdown of community social control and organization. These other indicators are similarly affected by the structural dimensions of neighborhood context. Children who live in neighborhoods that are characterized by poverty, excessive numbers of children per adult resident, populations turnover, and the concentration of female-headed families are at highest risk of maltreatment. This analysis suggests that child maltreatment is but one manifestation of community social organization and that its occurrence is related to some of the same underlying macro-social conditions that foster other urban problems.",Child development,1995 Oct,United States,1995,90

METHODS: Unionized New York City health care workers (n = 1394) with comprehensive medical insurance were screened for hypertension. Union records documenting all physician visits and prescription medications for the year before screening provided the opportunity to relate patterns of treatment to blood pressure outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 409 employees found to have hypertension, 289 (71%) were aware of their condition and 201 (49%) had been treated, but only 51 (12%) had their blood pressure controlled at the recommended level (< 140/90 mm Hg). In a logistic regression model, the only variable of treatment associated with control was days of antihypertensive medication. The total number of physician visits was not associated with control. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in conventional community settings, even in the absence of financial barriers, treatment for hypertension continues to be characterized by poor outcomes.

The Inventory of Drug-Taking Situations (Heroin) (IDTS[H]; Annis y Martin, 1985) was administered to a sample of 124 opiate dependent patients in order to study its reliability and factor structure. An Alpha reliability coefficient of .93 was obtained. A principal component analysis of the measure revealed a five-component solution which accounted for 50.6% of the variance. Nevertheless, a confirmatory factor analysis of the self-report showed that the original eight-factor model provides an acceptable fit to the data. Lastly, the frequency at which each of the eight original IDTS(H) subscales appeared as the highest risk situation in the profile was calculated, showing the predominance of Negative Emotional States (35%) and Social Pressure to Use (18%) as the two most important high-risk situations.

2266433,Preferences for autonomy when patients are physicians.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess physicians' preferences for patient autonomy when they are patients themselves. DESIGN: Data from practicing physicians attending a continuing medical education course were obtained by questionnaire. After adjustment for sociodemographic differences, data from the physician population were compared with similar data previously obtained from a patient population. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one physicians (94% of the study population) agreed to participate. Ninety percent were primary care physicians. Fifty-eight percent practiced in the eastern United States. MAIN RESULTS: The physicians, like the regular patients, preferred that the principal role in decision making for their own illnesses be handled by their providers, not by themselves. As illness severity increased, physicians indicated significantly less desire for making decisions (p less than 0.01). The magnitudes of the effects of increasing illness severity upon the decision-making preferences of physician and regular patients were comparable (p = 0.53). Physician-patients, however, were slightly more interested than regular patients in making decisions (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: although physician-patients are slightly more interested than regular patients in making decisions, for the most part their preferences for autonomy resemble those of regular patients. These results suggest that medical knowledge and sociocultural factors are only minor determinants of patient attitudes towards autonomy. Rather, patients' preferences to be relieved of decision-making responsibility are better understood as part of the phenomenology of illness.",Journal of general internal medicine,1990 Nov-Dec,United States,1990,90

To begin our investigation, we analyzed cross-sectionally gathered data on 2879 IDUs who had been recruited through extensive community outreach efforts and who were interviewed at the time of recruitment. We then tested our hypotheses about suspected determinants of entry into treatment by analyzing prospectively gathered data on 1039 active drug users who had no recent history of being treated for drug problems. Among these 1039 IDUs (a subset of the initial cross-sectional sample), 144 entered a detoxification program between their recruitment interview and their next follow-up interview, conducted about six months after recruitment (range: 3.5-9.5 months) and 64 entered a methadone maintenance program during that observation interval. Using multiple logistic regression analyses, we found that a recent drug overdose, relatively higher frequency of injecting drugs, and a history of prior arrest or treatment were independent predictors of entry into detoxification. Being married or living with a partner, being female, a lengthy duration of drug use (> 10 years), and a history of prior treatment were independent predictors of entry into methadone maintenance. These findings shed light on what appears to be a different profile of suspected determinants of entry into a detoxification treatment versus methadone maintenance treatment, and help to clarify some potential differences between treated and untreated drug users that ought to be considered when evaluating results of investigations with IDU participants recruited solely from treatment settings.",Drug and alcohol dependence,1994 Oct,Ireland,1994,90

2292740,Why doctors do what they do: determinants of physician behavior.,"Direct payments to physicians account for about 20% of the medical care dollar, but physician decisions cause over 80% of the costs of medical care. Decision making can be viewed in a number of ways: as pure information processing, as an interaction with various stimuli, including financial penalties and incentives, and as social behavior, interacting with and reacting to peer and leadership influence. The model that accounts for the greatest amount of the available data is a multifactorial one that takes all of these views into account. The most successful behavior change efforts use a variety of mutually reinforcing approaches, and must be present constantly or behaviors revert to highly variable (lower quality) actions and decisions. This appears to be a behavioral version of the second law of thermodynamics (entropy increases spontaneously). The best practice model to manage costs and quality appears to be one in which physicians and administrators have adequate up to date information available, make group decisions, develop and continuously improve agreed upon methods of practice, interact and think before acting, and have rewards for such behavior.",Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,1990 Dec,United States,1990,90

Finally, in the fourth section, a brief review is presented of the economic, social and cultural implications of IRM for both the emigrants and their host communities.""",European urban and regional studies,1997 Jan,England,1997,90
10605254,"[Social differences and indicators of perceived health, chronic diseases, disability and life style in the 1994. ISTAT national health interview survey].","In this paper social differences in health, analysed by different dimensions (perceived health, chronic diseases, functional deficits and disability) and social differences in lifestyle, in particular smoking habit and use of health services for the prevention of some female tumours, are described. The study is based on the data collected in the National Interview Survey on Health Status and Use of Health Care Services, conducted by ISTAT in the 1994. The analysis has been performed separately for males and females, computing Prevalence Rate Ratios (PRR) standardized by age. Educational level and social class, based on Schizzerotto's classification, have been used as determinants of differences in health and lifestyle. Unfavourable perception of health status and most of chronic diseases, referred as diagnosed by a doctor, show an increasing prevalence with decreasing educational level. Less striking differences are observed in the occurrence of injuries and in the restriction of daily life activities caused by diseases. A lower educational level corresponds to a regular increase in the proportion of disabled subjects. Females show higher differences than males in overweight and underweight prevalences in favour of more educated. Smoking habit shows an inverse correlation with education in males and a direct correlation in females, while attempts to quit smoking are more common among more educated individuals. Among women, the tendency to use screening tests for the prevention of some tumours is directly proportional to the educational level. Similar findings were obtained using the social class, with small bourgeoisie and working class showing similar excess risks, compared to bourgeoisie. This study found significant social inequalities in health status and in lifestyle in Italian population in 1994. The discussion argues that in absence of preventive interventions on disadvantaged groups of the population an increase of social differences in health is predictable.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,1999 Jul-Sep,Italy,1999,90
10765444,Risk perception in context: the Savannah River Site Stakeholder Study.,"Environmental managers are increasingly charged with involving the public in the development and modification of policies regarding risks to human health and the environment. Involving the public in environmental decision making first requires a broad understanding of how and why the public perceives various risks. The Savannah River Stakeholder Study was conducted with the purpose of investigating individual, economic, and social characteristics of risk perceptions among those living near the Savannah River Nuclear Weapons Site. A number of factors were found to impact risk perceptions among those living near the site. One's estimated proximity to the site and relative river location surfaced as strong determinants of risk perceptions among SRS residents. Additionally, living in a quality neighborhood and demonstrating a willingness to accept health risks for economic gain strongly abated heightened risk perceptions.",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90

These experimental trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates. Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used to deliver the intervention provide few indications of what coverage of net re-treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and financing strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and re-treatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controlled trial on the Kenyan coast, a series of suitable delivery strategies were used to continue net re-treatment in the area. The trial adopted a bi-annual, house-to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge using research project staff and resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued to children. During the year following the trial, sentinel dipping stations were situated throughout the community and household members informed of their position and opening times. This free re-treatment service achieved between 61-67% coverage of nets used by children for three years. In 1997 a social marketing approach, that introduced cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net re-treatment services. The immediate result of this transition was that significantly fewer of the mothers who had used the previous re-treatment services adopted this revised approach and coverage declined to 7%. The future of new delivery services and their financing are discussed in the context of their likely impact upon previously defined protective efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimates.",Health policy and planning,1999 Mar,England,1999,90

Compared with adolescent women who became pregnant but had not been abused, sexually victimized teenagers began intercourse a year earlier, were more likely to have used drugs and alcohol and were less likely to practice contraception. The abused adolescents were also more likely to have been hit, slapped or beaten by a partner and to have exchanged sex for money, drugs or a place to stay. Young women in the abused group were also more likely to report that their own children had been abused or had been taken from them by Child Protective Services.",Family planning perspectives,1992 Jan-Feb,United States,1992,90

The socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods occupied by West Indian blacks are also examined and compared to those of areas occupied by African Americans. The results indicate that, on one hand, West Indians are largely denied access to residential areas occupied predominantly by whites and are confined to areas of large black concentrations. On the other hand, West Indians appear to have carved out somewhat separate residential enclaves within these largely black areas....""",The International migration review,1999 Spring,United States,1999,90
1423121,Learning to 'walk our talk': the implications of sociological theory for research methodologies in health promotion.,"In recent formulations of the concept of health promotion, such as Achieving Health for All and the Ottawa Charter, emphasis is clearly placed on comprehensivity and the integration of individual and social determinants of health, broadly defined. This paper is premised on the observation that despite evidence of a paradigm shift in the way we talk about health promotion at a conceptual level, we have yet to properly articulate a 'new' research methodology to accompany the 'new' health promotion. The paper has three main sections. First, some of the limitations and contradictions that separate the rhetoric of health promotion from its current operationalization in research practice are discussed. In asserting the inherent links between theory, methodology and method, the need for a new research paradigm is demonstrated. In the second section, seven key issues derived from the literature on sociological theory are identified and discussed in terms of their implications for choosing a new research methodology for health promotion. In the third section it is suggested that using these issue areas as a 'decision map' leads to the selection of a preferred strategy which brings together both interpretive and critical perspectives to bear on our understanding of social reality as it affects health. Elements of both of these approaches and the nature of their potential complimentarity are considered. Throughout these deliberations the reader is encouraged to consider the potentially conservative or activist orientations that alternate methodologies imply, and to critically evaluate how these mesh with the emerging rhetoric of fostering empowerment that is the cornerstone of the 'new' health promotion.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1992 Mar-Apr,Switzerland,1992,90
9353673,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori and parasites, social class and cancer.","Three genera of parasites are known or suspected risk factors for cancer in humans: Schistosoma, Opisthorchis and Clonorchis. No adequate information is available on the determinants of infections related to social class. Infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is an important cause of stomach cancer. Studies, in particular from the United Kingdom and the United States of America, strongly suggest that social class factors, especially those acting during childhood, are determinants of the infection, with odds ratios of seroprevalence of the order of 1.5-5 for lower social class as compared with higher social class. A conservative estimate of the contribution of social class, acting through an increased prevalence of H. pylori infection, to the burden of stomach cancer gives a figure of over 50,000 stomach cancers per year worldwide, or 8% of all stomach cancers. In countries with both high and low prevalence of infection with H. pylori, it is likely that a sizeable proportion of this difference is due to social-class-related risk factors of infection.",IARC scientific publications,1997,France,1997,90
8910029,Using the theory of reasoned action (TRA) to understand the decision to use condoms in an STD clinic population.,"The theory of reasoned action (TRA) provides useful information when designing health education interventions. In this study, 703 heterosexual STD clinic clients responded to a TRA-based survey. With steady partners, social norms and attitudes toward condom use were significant predictors of intention for both men and women. The interaction of attitude and norm increased prediction for men (R = .64, p < 0.001) and women (R = .70, p < 0.001). With casual partners, attitude was a predictor for men and social norm was a predictor for women. Prior use of condoms increased prediction for men (R = .38, p < 0.001) and women (R = .47, p < 0.001). Findings suggest that, in addition to traditional TRA model variables, the relationship between sexual partners and the individual's prior experience with condom use should be incorporated into attempts to understand this complex, dyadic behavior. Examining specific outcome and normative beliefs also provides important information for intervention design.",Health education quarterly,1996 Nov,United States,1996,90

Using data from the older men cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience, we examine the impact of employment, marriage, and being a supporter on health limitations and mortality. Employment has the most consistent health-protective effect, and the benefits of employment are more pronounced for Blacks than for Whites. Marriage affects health in conjunction with employment. These findings lend further support to the growing literature on the effects of roles on health. The results further illustrate the importance of ascribed statuses as structural determinants of the relationship between roles and health, highlighting the very real differences in the meanings and expectations of social roles for Blacks and Whites.",Journal of health and social behavior,1992 Jun,United States,1992,90
2397313,Links between drug misuse and crime.,"The paper argues that there may be benefits from combining the efforts of criminologists and drug researchers in the study of the nature of the relationship between drug/alcohol use and crime. The available evidence suggests that the relationship is probably not a simple one. In particular, the research shows that social, cultural, and environmental factors may all play some part in explaining the relationship. It is suggested that something might be gained by focusing on the various situational factors which link drug/alcohol use and crime. Some help might be forthcoming for this endeavour from criminology which has in recent years developed a body of knowledge on the role of situational determinants of crime. Research from within this perspective has been helpful in informing strategies for intervention over a wide range of crimes and crime settings. In particular, attention is drawn to the wealth of crime prevention ideas that has arisen out of situational analyses of alcohol-related public disorder. It is proposed that further research is conducted which draws on this approach in an attempt to increase our understanding of the micro social processes involved.",British journal of addiction,1990 Jul,England,1990,90

We have compared and contrasted the independent effects of these putative risk factors on parent-reported hayfever, eczema and wheeze by age 16 years and in the past 12 months at age 16 using data from the 1970 British birth cohort. The 1970 British birth cohort comprised all children born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week of April 1970, and follow-up surveys at birth, 5, 10 and 16 years of age involved a cumulative total of 17,427 children. We have used data on over 6000 children with complete data at every stage. Social advantage was a risk factor common to each of wheeze at, and hayfever and eczema at and by age 16. Low birth order was an independent risk factor for eczema and hayfever at age 16, but not for wheeze. However, wheeze at age 16 was significantly increased in relation to maternal smoking, with a significant interaction such that the effect of smoking was greatest in those of high birth order and, in the absence of maternal smoking, low birth order was a risk factor for wheeze at age 16. Social advantage and low birth order appear to be the independently consistent determinants of atopic disease. Maternal smoking is an additional risk factor for wheeze, which applies primarily in low socioeconomic groups.",Respiratory medicine,1998 Oct,England,1998,90

9785693,Trust me: technical and institutional determinants of health maintenance organizations shifting risk to physicians.,"This paper examines the factors that influence a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) to shift risk to doctors through an incentive arrangement called capitation, where physicians are paid a fixed amount per patient for a period of time for any and all medical services required by the patient. Multispecialty-medical-group (Group) HMOs are more likely to shift risk than Independent Physician Associations (IPA) HMOs. Within IPA HMOs, larger enrollment per physician is positively associated with more risk shifting. We find that institutional factors signaling legitimacy play an important role in determining risk shifting. For-profit HMOs are less likely to shift risk, which we interpret as reflecting consumer distrust of for-profit HMOs. However, for-profit HMOs that are federally qualified, which we interpret as a signal of legitimacy, are more likely to shift risk.",Journal of health and social behavior,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90

10202805,Coping efforts in daily life: role of big five traits and problem appraisals.,"The role of problem appraisal and Big Five traits in coping with bothersome daily events was investigated. Community-residing men completed diaries regarding stressful events and coping for eight consecutive days. Results of multi-level analyses indicated that lower perceived control over events was associated with greater reliance on distraction, catharsis, acceptance, seeking emotional social support, but less use of direct action. Stressor severity was positively associated with catharsis and religion, but negatively associated with acceptance. Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experience, and Conscientiousness predicted coping strategy use. In addition, broad personality dimensions moderated relations between appraisals (perceived uncontrolability and severity) and coping strategy use. Although previous research implicated perceived control in coping, the present study suggests that both appraisals of stressor severity and individual differences in personality are also important determinants of coping strategy use at the daily level.",Journal of personality,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90
9130317,The fate of the ego in contemporary psychiatry with particular reference to etiologic theories of schizophrenia.,"Despite its fruitfulness, the concept of the ego has fallen into disuse in contemporary psychiatry. It is the aim of this paper to explore the phenomenon of the decline of the concept of the ego by looking at the psychoanalytic theory of schizophrenia in which the ego is central and the genetic/neurochemical theory in which the ego is absent. Kuhn's (1970) explication of the competition of explanatory paradigms is utilized to frame this investigation and some of the factors involved in the displacement of the ego-oriented theory with the genetic/neurochemical theory are elucidated. Each theory is reviewed as to its theoretic and epistemological assumptions and its overall explanatory power. The psychoanalytic theory centers on the role of regression to an early state of ego development, and utilizes an intersubjective mode of data collection to describe developmental determinants of pathognomonic ego deficits. The genetic/neurochemical theory rests on the therapeutic outcome of neuroleptic treatment and family clustering of the illness. In failing to take into account data derived from intrapsychic, interpersonal, and cultural influences, the genetic/neurochemical theory is limited in its ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the nature of schizophrenia. The ego-oriented theory gains significance at the border of these limitations. The concept of the ego is capable of integrating a wide range of biologic, developmental, and social influences that can account for the clinical phenomena of schizophrenia and should be restored to a central position in etiologic theories.",Psychiatry,1997 Spring,United States,1997,90
10162860,Georgia's harvesting healthy habits: a formative evaluation.,"Occupational safety and health researchers seek to conduct effective cancer awareness campaigns to increase agricultural workers' skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Georgia undertook such a project using a social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) conceptual model, with its objectives focusing on personal determinants of and environmental influences on farmers' behavior. One underused strategy to increase the success of health campaigns, formative evaluation, was undertaken during year one of the demonstration project, with four goals. These included an assessment of: (1) the availability of societal resources to support farmers' practices, (2) the affordability for farmers to follow through with behaviors being promoted, (3) the social support for behaving in ways that reduce farmers' skin cancer risk, and (4) farmers' current knowledge, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy in this regard. Formative evaluation revealed an absence of information, products, services, and social support for farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. As a result, the Georgia project's plan was refined to include specific activities aimed at increasing the environmental support for health promotion activities relating to farmers' skin cancer prevention and detection. These include a seminar for rural primary care physicians and public health nurses to increase knowledge and skills relating to conducting clinical skin exams; programs for agricultural extension agents, cotton scouts, and 4-H groups to provide opportunities to learn more about and practice sun safety; and a feed and seed store campaign.",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,1996,England,1996,90
8582823,Life after a cardiac event: women's experience in healing.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of women's recovery after an acute cardiac event. DESIGN: Grounded theory provided the methodologic basis for qualitative data generation and analysis. SAMPLE: Thirteen women who had experienced an acute cardiac event. The participants' ages ranged from 42 to 78 with a mean age of 58 years. Four participants attended the group sessions after experiencing an acute myocardial infarction; five had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting; and two had undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Two participants had undergone exercise testing that indicated myocardial ischemia. The time after the cardiac event ranged from 8 weeks to 3 years at the initiation of the study, with a mean time after the cardiac event of 8 months. RESULTS: Healing, the basic social process identified from the data, explained women's struggle through the uncertainty surrounding the cardiac event as a way of creating new and positive health patterns. The process of healing consisted of three stages: surviving, originating, and patterning balance. These stages of healing illustrated determinants of individual motivation that guided the initiation and maintenance of risk factor modification efforts in women after the cardiac event. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study provide a basis for the development and evaluation of comprehensive rehabilitative interventions designed to enhance individual recovery after a cardiac event.",Heart & lung : the journal of critical care,1995 Nov-Dec,United States,1995,90
10176379,Mothers' management of childhood diseases in Yorubaland: the influence of cultural beliefs.,"Several studies have noted that, besides inadequate availability of health care services in many areas, especially the less developed countries, certain disease-specific and non-disease-specific cultural beliefs may influence people's health seeking behaviour. It has even been noted that health services may be underutilized and several health and child care instructions may be ineffective or ignored in traditional and transitional societies where people's ideas and behavioural patterns conflict with the knowledge being passed to them (Feyisetan and Adeokun 1992; Feyisetan 1992). Feyisetan and Adeokun (1992) argued that non-adoption of modern preventive and curative measures cannot be attributed to poverty alone since the costs of some preventive and curative measures are not exorbitant in several of these societies. Rather, they suggested that the gap between awareness of modern health measures and health seeking behaviour must be sought in the social and cultural determinants of behaviour in such matters as child care and disease management. Earlier studies have noted that children in Nigeria die mainly from malaria, diarrhoea, measles, neonatal tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, and bronchopneumonia (Morley and MacWilliam 1961; Ogunlesi 1961; Morley, Woodland and Martin 1963, 1966; Baxter-Grillo and Leshi 1964; Animashaun 1977; Tomkins 1981). Because these diseases are preventable at low cost to the individual, there is a need to investigate why large percentages of children are still subjected to many episodes of these diseases. In this paper, we examine (1) the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the three most cited childhood diseases in our study areas, measles, diarrhoea and fever, and the effect of these perceptions on the mothers' suggested curative measures; and (2) the persistence of the belief in abiku and how this cultural belief can influence mothers' management of childhood diseases. Since, for most mothers, perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases are rooted in cultural beliefs, a brief review of disease-specific cultural beliefs is undertaken. In order to determine the effect of socio-economic factors, the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases, their recommended curative measures and the belief in abiku are examined according to selected socio-economic variables.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1997 Oct,Australia,1997,90

Increasing flows of labor within the region, however, raise questions about three important issues: (1) the assumption that trade, investment and aid will eventually mitigate migration pressure in source countries and the effectiveness of migration policies based on that assumption; (2) whether increasing regional interdependence stimulates or deters migration; [and] (3) the effect of rising interdependence on the political and international relations aspects of migration. As a partial attempt to address these questions, this article examines the regional pattern of economic interdependence by utilizing information concerning trade, investment and migration flows.

8170446,After the war in Nicaragua: a psychosocial study of war wounded ex-combatants.,"Despite 150 wars in the Third World since 1945, there have been virtually no psychosocial studies of war wounded ex-combatants. This community study of 72 such men, on average 4.9 years post-injury, had both quantitative (General Health Questionnaire [GHQ] and clinical interview) and qualitative (personal narrative) components. Most men were coping adaptively. However their overall GHQ scores were significantly higher than an ex-combatant control group, suggesting relative psychological vulnerability (P = 0.001). 13 (18 per cent) had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) though in only three was this clinically significant, two of whom were aggressive alcoholics. Social dysfunction was a better indicator of the minority who needed psychological help than a diagnosis of PTSD. The one in three with a severe physical disability were not at greater risk than the rest of the group. Personal narratives illuminated the ways subjects had registered and responded to their war experiences. Identification with the social ideals being defended by the war effort had been psychologically bolstering. Ten severely disabled ex-Contra guerrillas, who had fought on the other side, were also interviewed. The availability of appropriate training/work, and thus the economic fortunes of the whole society, are likely to be major determinants of long-term psychosocial outcomes.

9347588,Life-cycle aspects of poverty among older women.,"This article focuses on the relationship between women's economic status earlier in their lives and their poverty status in old age. Previous research on the determinants of poverty among aged women has documented the socioeconomic and demographic correlates of the poor, and has examined the financial impact of adverse later-life events such as widowhood, deterioration of health, and loss of employment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women (NLSMW), we find that most women who experience these types of adverse events in their later years do not become poor and that a large majority of older NLSMW respondents who were poor in 1991-92 were poor earlier in their adult lives. Whether women are impoverished by adverse later-life events depends on their economic resources just prior to the event. But, the financial resources available in old age, in turn, depend very much on their long-term economic status throughout much of their adult lives. This article underscores the fact that for most older women, these adverse events do not appear to precipitate poverty spells--at least not within the first couple of years--and directs attention at longer term circumstances that make some women more vulnerable to poverty.",Social security bulletin,1997,United States,1997,90

A descriptive analysis of behavior under natural conditions indicated that bizarre vocalizations occurred most often in the presence of task-related demands and in the absence of adult attention. Further, bizarre speech occurring during tasks was followed frequently by the cessation of task demands by staff or the subject's voluntary disengagement from task-related activities; bizarre speech observed during noninteractional periods (i.e., in the absence of adult attention) was frequently followed by staff attention. The escape and attention hypotheses were tested under analogue conditions. Results of the experimental analysis supported only the attention hypothesis; that is, bizarre speech appeared to function as an attention-producing behavior. The functional analysis data were used to select two different yet functionally equivalent treatments. The first treatment provided the subject with noncontingent scheduled attention. The second intervention taught the subject social language skills in the form of initiation and expansion statements. Both interventions were effective in suppressing maladapted speech. Advantages of linking descriptive and experimental analyses are discussed.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,1991 Fall,United States,1991,90

The research is aimed at identifying the demographic and social characteristics that enhance the likelihood of minor psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire, and to reveal how these determinants relate to health status. In the second stage of the study, the same characteristics are related to their effect on the decision to decision to consult a general practitioner and, specifically, on presenting psycho-social problems to the GP. At the population level, the likelihood of a high GHQ score was greater for women, divorced persons and the unemployed, other variables remaining equal. However, GHQ score was contaminated by poor subjective health perception, especially for unemployed persons. Chronic physical illness did not have an independent effect on the GHQ score. Chronic physical illness did influence help-seeking. In addition, several socio-demographic characteristics showed an independent effect on consulting behaviour for both GHQ-positive and GHQ-negative patients. Women, unemployed persons and publicly insured patients with a minor psychiatric disturbance were more apt to visit their GP, regardless of their physical health status. However, no socio-demographic characteristics increased the likelihood that a GHQ-positive patient would present unambiguous psycho-social complaints as a reason to see their doctor.",Psychological medicine,1995 Jan,England,1995,90

1782520,The politics of welfare policy in Sweden: structural determinants and attitudinal cleavages.,"The article analyzes attitudes to Swedish welfare policies, using data from a survey conducted in 1986. In the first section, a number of indices tapping various aspects of attitudes to welfare policy are constructed. In the second section these indices are used to give an empirical assessment of competing theories about the impact of different structural determinants on attitudes. It is concluded (a) that there is general support for Swedish welfare policies, which, however, is mixed with criticisms of bureaucracy and suspicion about abuse of welfare programs, and (b) that class position and 'class-related' determinants such as income are more important than factors such as gender, private or public sector location or consumption groups in structuring attitudes. In the concluding section, these findings are discussed in relation to recent theorizing about newly emerging lines of division in the population. It is argued that either Sweden must be seen as a deviant case, which for specific historical and institutional reasons is characterized by class conflicts rather than other sectional splits, or the theories about new lines of division are simply mistaken.",The British journal of sociology,1991 Dec,England,1991,90
12320574,International migration and the politics of admission and exclusion in postwar Europe.,"""Although nation-states assume territorial, political and cultural boundedness, their boundaries are not uniform barriers, but rather are characterized by varying degrees of openness and closure to international migrants. The manipulation of the permeability of these boundaries constitutes the politics of admission and exclusion.... This paper provides a discussion of the complex economic, political and social forces impinging on the politics of admission and exclusion and an analysis of how these forces have been operating in a particular historical and geographical context to determine the admission of international migrants into national territory and community.... There are signs that the integration of nation-states into regional blocs such as the EC is shifting the politics of admission and exclusion practised by the dominant member countries to the supra-national scale.""",Political geography,1995 Apr,England,1995,90
7882876,Drinking and unemployment: contrasting patterns among men and women.,"Research on unemployment has paid only little attention to drinking and drinking problems. From the 1970s onwards the association of drinking and unemployment has come under systematic study. Contrasting tendencies emerge from this research. This paper distinguishes three instances of drinking and drinking problems and examines their association with employment status, i.e., (i) frequency of drinking, (ii) frequency of intoxication, and (iii) frequency of health problems due to drinking. A panel survey was conducted in 1983-1984, consisting of a sample of Finnish men and women, originally jobseekers in industry. Prevalence data and results of logistic regression analyses on the association of the three instances of drinking and drinking problems with employment status are presented. The frequency of drinking was unassociated with employment status for men and women at either of the two measurement points. Neither did the frequency of intoxication show any clear association with employment status. In contrast, the frequency of health problems due to drinking was associated in a statistically significant way with unemployment among men. Among women the association was rather the opposite, but it was not statistically significant. The paper concludes that it is important to distinguish between overall drinking and drinking problems, and between the determinants of male and female drinking problems. It is likely that selective processes at the labour market as well as social causation during unemployment lie behind the observed association of male unemployment and drinking problems.",Drug and alcohol dependence,1995 Jan,Ireland,1995,90
8465879,Psychiatric complications of family reunion after four decades of separation.,"OBJECTIVE: After four decades of separation due to civil war, many people who had migrated to Taiwan from mainland China had the unexpected opportunity to briefly visit their families in mainland China. A study was conducted to examine psychiatric complications associated with these family reunions following long involuntary separation. METHOD: Eighty subjects who made the journey were given semistructured interviews investigating their psychological experiences relating to the family reunion. The variables investigated were sociodemographic characteristics, the subject's previsit emotional condition, factors related to the family reunion experience, and stress encountered during the visit. RESULTS: The survey indicated that more than one-fifth of the subjects (22.5%) developed psychiatric complications, mainly depression, immediately after the visit. Determinants found to contribute significantly to the occurrence of emotional disorders were previous ways of expressing homesickness, family members seen during the reunion, family misfortunes that the subjects discovered, family conflict encountered at the reunion, and tactics for coping with such stressors. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that family reunions after long-term separation can be trauma-repairing experiences for some but for others can lead to trauma reexperiencing and psychiatric complications requiring mental health intervention.",The American journal of psychiatry,1993 Apr,United States,1993,90
9184786,Determinants of handicap 1 and 3 years after a stroke.,"A total of 361 consecutive admissions to hospital with acute stroke were followed up to examine the determinants of handicap 1 year and 2-3 years later. Handicap was measured using the London Handicap Scale, and data were collected on initial stroke severity, disability, mood and sociodemographic variables. Ninety-five of 170 survivors returned handicap questionnaires at 1 year, 102 of 149 survivors at 2-3 years, and 58 on both occasions. Mean handicap score decreased slightly between 1 and 2-3 years (45-48 on a 0-100 scale, 95% confidence interval for difference -1 to +7, p = 0.09). At both 1 and 2-3 years handicap was associated with pre-stroke disability, 1-year score disability, initial stroke severity and mood. Age and sex were associated at 1 year but not at 2-3 years. In multivariate analyses disability, stroke severity and mood were independently associated with handicap. None of the variables examined predicted change in handicap score. The study demonstrates the overriding importance of stroke severity (impairment) and disability in determining handicap. In comparison, social variables were less important.",Disability and rehabilitation,1997 May,England,1997,90
9059478,Exercise induced bronchospasm in Ghana: differences in prevalence between urban and rural schoolchildren.,"BACKGROUND: As more developing countries adopt a westernised style of living, an increase in the prevalence of asthma can be expected to occur in these areas. A study was undertaken to establish the normal response to exercise in Ghanaian children and to use these normal values to determine the prevalence of exercise induced bronchospasm (EIB) in urban rich (UR), urban poor (UP), and rural (R) school children. Skin test reactivity to common inhalant allergens in UR, UP, and R children with and without EIB was also investigated. METHODS: Two hundred children aged 9-16 years without a previous history of respiratory symptoms were randomly selected and underwent free running exercise testing. A normal response to exercise was defined as the group mean change in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) +/- 2 standard deviations. This value was used to identify the prevalence of EIB in UR, UP, and R schoolchildren. A total of 1095 children from three different schools underwent exercise testing (220 UP, 599 UR, 276 R), after which 916 children underwent skin prick testing to six common inhalant allergens (D farinae, D pteronyssinus, cat, dog, Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans). RESULTS: From the results of exercise testing in asymptomatic children the normal range was defined as a fall in PEFR of < 12.5% after exercise. Thirty four children were classified as having EIB on the basis of the above definition, giving an overall prevalence of 3.1%. The prevalence of EIB was significantly higher in UR children (4.7%) than in both UP (2.2%; p < 0.05) and R children (1.4%; p < 0.01). However, the prevalence rates in the UP and R children were similar. The prevalence of atopy in the whole population was 4.4%. Of the children with EIB, 10% were skin test positive to at least one of the allergens tested. The prevalence of atopy was significantly higher in UR children (6.55%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.5% to 9.2%) than in UP (2.9%, 95% CI 0.9% to 6.7%) and R children (1.5%, 95% CI 0.4% to 3.7%), respectively (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EIB and atopy is higher in urban rich than in urban poor or rural children suggesting that, in addition to genetic predisposition, social and environmental factors such as wealth, life style, and housing are important determinants of these phenotypes.",Thorax,1997 Feb,England,1997,90
9105332,"Reciprocity, emotional well-being, and family functioning as determinants of family satisfaction in caregivers of elderly parents.","The purpose of this study was to test a theoretical model developed to explain family satisfaction among 171 caregivers of elderly parents. Using LISREL to estimate path coefficients, the findings support family satisfaction as directly and indirectly influenced by reciprocity, emotional well-being and family functioning. Explanatory variables accounted for 70% of the variance in predicting family satisfaction. Intrinsic rewards derived from giving care, positive affect, and family functioning contributed to higher levels of family satisfaction, while dysphoria contributed significantly to lower levels. Family satisfaction was also indirectly influenced by positive and negative exchanges received by the parent. Increasing caregivers awareness of the reciprocal nature of their relationships with all family members may be an effective strategy in helping them appreciate their contribution to the well-being of their parents and achieve satisfaction in the caregiving role.",Nursing research,1997 Mar-Apr,United States,1997,90
9522857,Knowledge about AIDS and follow-up compliance in patients attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.,"In a survey of 300 consecutive new attenders at the Porgera Health Centre Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic information was obtained regarding knowledge about AIDS from male and female attenders. The differences between the sexes regarding a variety of socioeconomic variables, knowledge about AIDS and their compliance to follow-up appointments were studied as well as possible relationships between these social variables and the degrees of AIDS knowledge and compliance. Males tended to originate from further afield, be more educated, be either in salaried employment or not working at all, and be single as compared to females. They also admitted to more extramarital sexual contacts and received more adequate treatment. Knowledge about AIDS was also significantly higher amongst male attenders and in this group was correlated strongly with overall educational attainment and employment status but did not show any relationship with the number of extramarital contacts admitted to. Only 9% of the patients knew about condoms and their role in prevention. Follow-up compliance was generally poor, and not significantly higher in those with higher scores of knowledge about AIDS, but showed a relationship with the type of disease being treated and with the ultimate adequacy of treatment received.",Papua and New Guinea medical journal,1995 Sep,Papua New Guinea,1995,90

The strains of globalization, geopolitical reorientation, and economic restructuring are having decisive effects on policies of immigration and multiculturalism.

9690841,Well-being of haemophilia patients: a model for direct and indirect effects of medical parameters on the physical and psychosocial functioning.,"This study outlines the development and evaluation of a structural equation model for establishing the consequences of haemophilia. The hereditary disorder is characterized by a high tendency to haemorrhages, with recurrent bleeding into the joints causing irreversible joint damage. The model is, in general, an attempt to answer the following questions: what is the effect of haemophilia on the well-being (i.e. satisfaction, health, somatic complaints and self-esteem) of patients and what is the additional or mediating role of other individual characteristics in this pathway? Disease severity, joint impairment and disability are defined as antecedents of well-being and the mediating roles of appraisal (i.e. the personal evaluation of the disease), health beliefs (i.e. locus of control), psychological characteristics (i.e. anxiety, anger, depression and optimism) and social support are investigated. Psychological variables turned out to be the strongest determinants of well-being and partly mediated the detrimental effect of disability on well-being. The role of appraisal remained somewhat unclear, as no significant relationship was established between this personal evaluation of haemophilia and well-being. Nevertheless, appraisal very well reflected the level of disability. An internal locus of control and favourable psychological characteristics appeared to reduce the perceived seriousness of haemophilia. No evidence was found for social support to act as a mediator between disability and well-being. The perception of support did show moderately strong associations with psychological characteristics (i.e. anxiety and depression) and satisfaction ratings. The study merits further research on quantifying the relationships between clinical parameters and psychosocial outcomes in patients with a chronic disease.",Social science & medicine (1982),1998 Sep,England,1998,90

Residents of 24 nursing homes were surveyed using the Canberra Interview for the Elderly (CIE) and a range of environmental measures was also taken. Of 323 residents who were screened for cognitive impairment, 165 (51%) scored 18 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al. 1975), and were interviewed with the CIE. According to DSM-III-R criteria and the CIE, the prevalence of major depressive episode was 9.7%.

8601115,East-West mortality divide and its potential explanations: proposed research agenda.,"There is a sharp divide in mortality between eastern and western Europe, which has largely developed over the past three decades and is caused mainly by chronic diseases in adulthood. The difference in life expectancy at birth between the best and worst European countries in this respect is more than 10 years for both sexes. The reasons for these differences in mortality are not clear and data currently available permit only speculation. The contributions of medical care and pollution are likely to be modest; health behaviour, diet, and alcohol consumption seem to be more important; smoking seems to have the largest impact. There is also evidence that psychosocial factors are less favourable in eastern Europe. Available data show socioeconomic gradients in all cause mortality within eastern European countries similar to those in the West. Determinants of the mortality gap between eastern and western Europe are probably related to the contrast in their social environments and may be similar to those underlying the social gradients in mortality within countries.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Feb 17,England,1996,90

The low and middle class private schools in the city centre had higher incidence of sexually experienced girls. The same was observed in those girls staying away from their parents. Majority of the sexually experienced girls had started coitus within one to two years of attaining menarche or having a boyfriend. Some of these girls may have been forced to indulge in sex by the men/boys or circumstances. Lack of factual knowledge, parental guidance and lust for material gains are some of the factors the girls felt may be responsible for the upsurge in adolescent sexual behaviour. The role played by these factors in adolescent sexuality is discussed, and possible remedial measures are suggested.",East African medical journal,1990 Mar,Kenya,1990,90

In a simple model with two types of workers, skilled and unskilled, facing two possible actions, to migrate or not to migrate, we derive the theoretical conditions under which strategic transfers are still operating when pooling among communities is introduced.""",Journal of population economics,1998,Germany,1998,90
8982525,Adolescent alcohol use: social determinants and the case for early family-centered prevention. Family-focused prevention of adolescent drinking.,"The family plays a central role in the use of alcohol by children and adolescents, yet preventive interventions rarely focus on the family. Early drinking and much subsequent use of alcohol by children and adolescents is sanctioned and sometimes encouraged by their families. Unlike experimentation with alcohol, problem drinking is associated with low levels of family social support and with dysfunctional coping strategies of families that may lead children to use drinking as an adaptive behavior. While risk-factor research has advanced understanding of alcohol use by children and youth, the poor predictive power of individual risks has limited its contribution to successful interventions. On the other hand, protective factors, provided by relationships within and outside the family, can be preventive and health promoting. Parents influence their children's drinking through family interactions, modeling and reinforcing standards, and attitudes that children learn and use to guide their behavior in new situations. Thus, parental influences endure. This article argues that interventions to prevent alcohol abuse should be designed to help parents to carry out their parental functions. This can be accomplished by providing social support, resources, and education for parents, as well as developing extra-familial sources of social support and socialization for children and adolescents.",Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1996 Winter,United States,1996,90
10501712,Determinants of psychiatric inpatient admission to general hospital psychiatric wards: an epidemiological study in a region of central Italy.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which factors contribute to the decision to admit individuals to psychiatric wards in general hospitals. METHOD: Data on 1,379 individuals undergoing psychiatric evaluation in eight emergency rooms in a region of central Italy were collected. A logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the likelihood of psychiatric admission considering the independent effects of demographic, social, and clinical factors and of the history of psychiatric treatment. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for psychiatric admission significantly increased with the following variables: severity of symptoms; presence of paranoid states and schizophrenic psychoses, affective psychoses and acute psychotic conditions (with neurotic disorders used as reference); a history of outpatient treatment; the presence of a staff member of a community mental health facility upon presentation at the emergency room; and the availability of beds in the psychiatric ward. CONCLUSION: The independent effect played by the presence of a staff member of a community mental health facility is of particular interest, suggesting the existence of a collaborative relationship between inpatient and outpatient services.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1999 Aug,Germany,1999,90

Variations by gender and level of adiposity.,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity declines during childhood and determinants of this decline are poorly understood. The purpose of this prospective study was to examine modifiable psychological and social correlates of physical activity change over 20 months. SUBJECTS: 370 girls and 362 boys in public schools, studied through the 4th and 5th grades. MEASURES: A physical activity index was computed from child reports, parent reports, and objective activity monitoring. Predictor variables were assessed by child and parent surveys. RESULTS: In multiple regressions, after adjustments for demographic variables, psychological variables explained 4% of the variance in boys' physical activity change, parent variables explained 8%, and interactions with skinfolds explained 3%, for a total of 15% (unadjusted). Regarding change in girls' physical activity, psychological variables explained 3%, parent variables explained 1.5%, and interactions with skinfold explained 1.5%, for a total of 6% explained variance (unadjusted). There were differences in predictors among children with high and low levels of body fat. CONCLUSIONS: Children's preferences for physical activity and frequency of parents transporting children to activity locations explained significant proportions of variance for girls and boys. The results support a dynamic model of the determinants of children's physical activity, but most of the variance was left unexplained.",American journal of preventive medicine,1999 Apr,Netherlands,1999,90

9847029,Social support and hostility as predictors of depressive symptoms in cardiac patients one month after hospitalization: a prospective study.,"OBJECTIVE: Hospitalization for cardiac disease is associated with an increased risk for depression, which itself confers a poorer prognosis. Few prospective studies have examined the determinants of depression after hospitalization in cardiac patients, and even fewer have examined depression within the weeks after hospital discharge. The present study assessed the prospective relations among perceptions of social support and trait hostility in predicting symptoms of depressive symptoms at 1 month after hospitalization for a diagnostic angiography in 506 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. METHOD: A series of structural equation models 1) estimated the predictive relations of social support, hostility, and depressive symptoms while in the hospital to symptoms of depression 1 month after hospitalization, and 2) compared these relations across gender, predicted risk classification, and age. RESULTS: Social support assessed during hospitalization was independently negatively associated with depressive symptoms 1 month after hospitalization, after controlling for baseline symptoms of depression, gender, disease severity, and age. Hostility was an indirect predictor of postdischarge depressive symptomology by way of its negative relation with social support. This pattern of relations did not differ across gender, predicted risk classification, and age. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a patient's perceived social support during hospitalization is a determinant of depressive symptoms 1 month later. The relation of social support and hostility to subsequent depressive symptoms was similar across a variety of populations.",Psychosomatic medicine,1998 Nov-Dec,United States,1998,90
7522432,Patient requests to hasten death. Evaluation and management in terminal care.,"Terminally ill patients often hope that death will come quickly. They may broach this wish with their physicians, and even request assistance in hastening death. Thoughts about accelerating death usually do not reflect a sustained desire for suicide or euthanasia, but have other important meanings that require exploration. When patients ask for death to be hastened, the following areas should be explored: the adequacy of symptom control; difficulties in the patient's relationships with family, friends, and health workers; psychological disturbances, especially grief, depression, anxiety, organic mental disorders, and personality disorders; and the patient's personal orientation to the meaning of life and suffering. Appreciation of the clinical determinants and meanings of requests to hasten death can broaden therapeutic options. In all cases, patient requests for accelerated death require ongoing discussion and active efforts to palliate physical and psychological distress. In those infrequent instances when a patient with persistent, irremediable suffering seeks a prompt and comfortable death, the physician must confront the moral, legal, and professional ramifications of his or her response. Rarely, acceding to the patient's request for hastening death may be the least terrible therapeutic alternative.",Archives of internal medicine,1994 Sep 26,United States,1994,90
8398220,Predicting physical activity change in men and women in two New England communities.,"We describe the predictors of change in physical activity in a population-derived sample of residents of two New England communities. In 1986-1987 and again in 1990-1991, we assessed the self-reported physical activity of 1,081 survey respondents using a single question concerning the frequency of exercise-induced sweating. We measured and analyzed sociodemographic variables, cardiovascular disease risk factors, health knowledge and beliefs, social support variables, and exercise performance variables at baseline as potential predictors of physical activity change. We defined physical activity change in subjects as follows: maintainers (12.2%) persisted with > or = 3 times per week of activity, adopters (16.0%) increased activity to > or = 3 times per week, quitters (11.9%) decreased activity to < 3 times per week, and sedentary (59.9%) individuals persisted with < 3 times per week of activity. Using polychotomous multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that short-term success with exercise and weight loss, school children's recommendation of exercise, and work outside the home predicted adoption or maintenance of increased physical activity in women. For men, short-term success with exercise and weight loss and health beliefs regarding the role of exercise in preventing heart attacks and stroke were the major determinants of maintaining or adopting increased physical activity. This identification of the predictors of physical activity change provides the rationale for future sex-specific strategies aimed at increasing regular physical activity and long-term adherence to an active lifestyle.",American journal of preventive medicine,1993 Jul-Aug,Netherlands,1993,90
7643268,A contrast of mothering behaviors in women from Korea and the United States.,"In both the United States and Korea, culture heavily influences a mother's behavior toward her infant. Differences between these two cultures are explored, based on the author's experiences and work in both environments. This comparison includes a number of points of departure. The American culture encourages autonomous and independent behaviors from infants, whereas in the Korean culture, mothers tend to view infants as passive and dependent. American mothering is individually fashioned and relies on the expertise of health care providers. Conversely, the Korean culture is highly ritualistic, so mothering is molded more by societal rules than by individual design, and professional advice is less sought for guidance than is folklore information. American mothers tend to rear their infants in a nuclear family setting, whereas Korean mothers rear their infants in an extended family or at least in a highly social environment. Implications for American nurses who provide perinatal care for Korean immigrant women are discussed.","Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",1995 May,United States,1995,90

7738955,The natural history of juvenile chronic arthritis: a population based cohort study. II. Outcome.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome in a population based cohort of patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) who were in the process of being transferred from pediatric to adult rheumatology care. METHODS: The cohort of patients born in 1968 through 1972, recruited from a population based epidemiological study in southwestern Sweden, were called to a followup after a median disease duration of 7.1 years. The study group consisted of 124 patients with a median age of 17.7 years. The disability and discomfort dimensions were evaluated using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ). The impact of the disease on social life was evaluated by patients and parents. RESULTS: The median C-HAQ disability index was 0.19 with a range from 0 to 2.75 (maximum possible score = 3). Sixty percent of the patients indicated some difficulty in daily activities. Female sex and a polyarticular disease course were risk factors for disability. The strongest determinants for disability were continuing disease activity and a positive IgM rheumatoid factor. Social impact of the disease was strongly linked to a raised C-HAQ disability index. CONCLUSION: Even in a population based study of JCA, which includes many mild cases, the majority of patients experienced some difficulty in daily activities when judged by themselves. This underlines the necessity to use the patient's own values in outcome studies, rather than the physician's. Further development of internationally accepted, standardized instruments to evaluate the handicap dimension of childhood arthritis is called for.",The Journal of rheumatology,1995 Feb,Canada,1995,90
10176379,Mothers' management of childhood diseases in Yorubaland: the influence of cultural beliefs.,"Several studies have noted that, besides inadequate availability of health care services in many areas, especially the less developed countries, certain disease-specific and non-disease-specific cultural beliefs may influence people's health seeking behaviour. It has even been noted that health services may be underutilized and several health and child care instructions may be ineffective or ignored in traditional and transitional societies where people's ideas and behavioural patterns conflict with the knowledge being passed to them (Feyisetan and Adeokun 1992; Feyisetan 1992). Feyisetan and Adeokun (1992) argued that non-adoption of modern preventive and curative measures cannot be attributed to poverty alone since the costs of some preventive and curative measures are not exorbitant in several of these societies. Rather, they suggested that the gap between awareness of modern health measures and health seeking behaviour must be sought in the social and cultural determinants of behaviour in such matters as child care and disease management. Earlier studies have noted that children in Nigeria die mainly from malaria, diarrhoea, measles, neonatal tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, and bronchopneumonia (Morley and MacWilliam 1961; Ogunlesi 1961; Morley, Woodland and Martin 1963, 1966; Baxter-Grillo and Leshi 1964; Animashaun 1977; Tomkins 1981). Because these diseases are preventable at low cost to the individual, there is a need to investigate why large percentages of children are still subjected to many episodes of these diseases. In this paper, we examine (1) the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the three most cited childhood diseases in our study areas, measles, diarrhoea and fever, and the effect of these perceptions on the mothers' suggested curative measures; and (2) the persistence of the belief in abiku and how this cultural belief can influence mothers' management of childhood diseases. Since, for most mothers, perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases are rooted in cultural beliefs, a brief review of disease-specific cultural beliefs is undertaken. In order to determine the effect of socio-economic factors, the mothers' perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases, their recommended curative measures and the belief in abiku are examined according to selected socio-economic variables.","Health transition review : the cultural, social, and behavioural determinants of health",1997 Oct,Australia,1997,90
12293211,The immigrant family: cultural legacies and cultural changes.,"""This article examines the way family and kinship patterns change in the process of immigration--and why. Offering an interpretative synthesis, it emphasizes the way first generation immigrants to the United States fuse together the old and new to create a new kind of family life. The family is seen as a place where there is a dynamic interplay between structure, culture, and agency. New immigrant family patterns are shaped by cultural meanings and social practices immigrants bring with them from their home countries as well as social, economic and cultural forces in the United States.""",The International migration review,1997 Winter,United States,1997,90
9004368,Past or present? Childhood living conditions and current socioeconomic status as determinants of adult health.,"The aim was to study the associations of childhood living conditions, together with past and present socioeconomic status, with adult health among Finnish men and women. The data were derived from a nationwide interview Survey on Living Conditions collected by Statistics Finland in 1986. The sample represents the non-institutional Finnish population aged 15 years or older. The number of respondents was 12,057 and the response rate 87%. In this study we analysed 30-year-old and older subjects. Two health indicators were analysed: first, limiting long-standing illness; and second, self-assessed health as ""below good"". Four different indicators of childhood living conditions were included: one concerning economic problems, and three concerning family related social problems during childhood. Additionally, the degree of urbanisation of the childhood living area was examined. Past and present socioeconomic status were measured by the status of origin, i.e. the respondent's father's and mother's education, and the status of destination, i.e. the respondent's own current education. Economic problems during childhood were associated with current health. The association of childhood social problems with health was somewhat weaker and less consistent than that of economic problems. A comparison of the mutual impacts of economic and social problems, respectively, shows that economic problems are stronger and more independent determinants of adult health than social problems. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, past and, particularly, present socioeconomic status are both important determinants of adult health. Current socioeconomic status showed strongest associations with adult health, but living conditions during upbringing, particularly economic problems and status of origin, were also significant predictors.",Social science & medicine (1982),1997 Feb,England,1997,90
1590666,Maintenance of behaviour change in patients with coronary artery disease.,"This paper comments upon patterns of behavioural change after acute cardiac illness and discusses determinants of longterm compliance with advice. The importance of comprehensive rehabilitation during convalescence is emphasised. Education, motivation and support of the patients are essential for the adoption of healthier lifestyles. Despite comprehensive rehabilitation, however, recidivism to former habits is common, particularly with smoking and physical inactivity. This is partly determined by premorbid social and personality characteristics of patients. Social and behavioural support at the workplace and within the community may well be of significant benefit in supporting patients to maintain their necessary health behaviour changes. Some of the evidence related to these issues is discussed and recommendations are made regarding future directions for patient support.","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",1992 Jan,Singapore,1992,90
10214405,"The condom conundrum: barriers to condom use among commercial sex workers in Durban, South Africa.","We examined socio-cultural and economic determinants of condom use among 100 female South African commercial sex workers. The symbolism and dynamics of condom use between sex workers and their clientele were explored. These issues were also investigated when sex workers negotiated sex with their personal partners. An additional focus was the extent to which HIV/AIDS influences women's condom use in these situations. Results demonstrate considerable contrast between factors influencing condom use in professional versus private sex situations. With clients, practical issues such as financial strain were the major obstacles to condom use. With personal sex partners, sex workers avoided condoms due to their negative symbolism. Condoms were seen as suggestive of filth, disease, infidelity, and mistrust. HIV/AIDS awareness had minimal impact on condom use. HIV/AIDS was viewed as a remote threat, overridden by immediate practical and emotional concerns. The intervention implications of condom symbolism and differential barriers to condom use are discussed.",African journal of reproductive health,1997 Mar,Nigeria,1997,90
9748791,[Use of methadone in the treatment of narcotic addiction].,"In spite of the 30-year experience in the use of methadone in heroin addicts, there is no consensus about the value of that method. In view of the opinion that resistance to methadone treatment is partly caused by ignorance, the aim of this paper is to improve the knowledge about the method. The paper offers explanation of: (1) metabolic basis of heroin addiction, (2) methadone pharmacology, (3) psychosocial aspects of the addiction, (4) methadone treatment procedure, (5) aims and (6) results of the treatment. A demand for designing the treatment program on the basis of expert knowledge rather than on political and moral judgments is stressed. Topics in program organization are described: indications, daily dosage and its administration, treatment duration, professional job-sharing and control of the treatment. A review of medical goals--individual-oriented and social-oriented goals of the treatment is made. ""Therapeutic milieu"", as well as treatment dose and treatment duration have been recognized as the main determinants of the outcome. Evaluation criteria and treatment have been elaborated as potential basis for further research.",Lijecnicki vjesnik,1998 May,Croatia,1998,90

Musicians were designated as ""high-anxious"" if they reported at least one episode of performance-related tremor and as ""low-anxious"" if they never had experienced tremor while performing in public. All musicians performed privately and publicly while measurements of subjective, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions were made. Ratings of effort and distress were made prior to performance. Heart rate was monitored telemetrically before, during and after performance. Urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol were sampled after public and private performance, respectively. Situational factors influenced most measures. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, heart rate and ratings of distress but not effort increased from private to public performance. Heart rate was higher in high- than in low-anxious musicians during public performance but similar during private performance. The increase in neuroendocrine activation from private to public performance was similar in the high- and low-anxious groups. It is concluded that heart rate is a sensitive measure of both situational and individual determinants of performance-related distress.",Biological psychology,1992 May,Netherlands,1992,90
8363189,Cultural and psychosocial determinants of weight concerns.,"Several sociocultural and psychological factors underlie Western society's intense preoccupation with the body. These factors include the social value of attractiveness, the strong correlation between attractiveness and perceived fitness, the interrelation among attractiveness, a good body image, and feelings of self-worth, and the relation between pressures to succeed in both the appearance- and work-related domains. The strong societal emphasis on appearance and slimness has translated to both intense body preoccupation and a willingness to try almost any weight-loss strategy. Thus, dieting occurs across all weight categories in response to these powerful social and psychological motivators.",Annals of internal medicine,1993 Oct 1,United States,1993,90
9530898,Gender-related correlates and predictors of consistent condom use among young adult African-American women: a prospective analysis.,"The present study examined the correlates of consistent condom use among African-American women and prospectively evaluated the stability of these significant variables to predict consistent condom use at 3-month follow-up. A sample of 128 African-American women, 18-29 years of age completed a baseline interview and 3 months later completed a similar follow-up interview (n = 100). Compared to women who were inconsistent condom users, women who were consistent condom users were more likely to: have high assertive communication skills (OR=13), desire not becoming pregnant (OR=8.6), have high sexual self-control over condom use (OR=7.6), perceive having control over their partners' use of condoms (OR=6.6), be younger (OR=5.8), and report having a partner that was not committed to the relationship (OR=3.3). Prospective analyses identified baseline level of condom use as the best predictor of condom use at 3-month follow-up. Women who were consistent condom users at baseline were 6.3 times as likely to be consistent condom users at 3-month follow-up. In conclusion, HIV prevention programmes for women need to be gender specific and need to be implemented before high-risk behaviours are established and may be more difficult to modify.",International journal of STD & AIDS,1998 Mar,England,1998,90
9785693,Trust me: technical and institutional determinants of health maintenance organizations shifting risk to physicians.,"This paper examines the factors that influence a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) to shift risk to doctors through an incentive arrangement called capitation, where physicians are paid a fixed amount per patient for a period of time for any and all medical services required by the patient. Multispecialty-medical-group (Group) HMOs are more likely to shift risk than Independent Physician Associations (IPA) HMOs. Within IPA HMOs, larger enrollment per physician is positively associated with more risk shifting. We find that institutional factors signaling legitimacy play an important role in determining risk shifting. For-profit HMOs are less likely to shift risk, which we interpret as reflecting consumer distrust of for-profit HMOs. However, for-profit HMOs that are federally qualified, which we interpret as a signal of legitimacy, are more likely to shift risk.",Journal of health and social behavior,1998 Sep,United States,1998,90
1503162,"Determinants of passive smoking in children in Edinburgh, Scotland.","OBJECTIVES: Using saliva cotinine as a quantitative marker, we examined the contribution of factors other than parental smoking to children's passive exposure to tobacco smoke. METHODS: Saliva specimens from a random sample of 734 7-year-old schoolchildren in Edinburgh, Scotland, were analyzed for cotinine. Their parents completed a questionnaire covering smoking habits and conditions in the home. RESULTS: A number of independent predictors of cotinine were identified in addition to the main one of smoking by household members. These predictors included home ownership, social class, day of the week, season of the year, number of parents present, crowding in the home, the number of children in the household, and sex. Cotinine was higher in children from less advantaged backgrounds, during winter, on Mondays, in girls, and when fewer other children were present. The effects were similar between children from nonsmoking and smoking homes. CONCLUSIONS: Questionnaire measures of parental smoking are insufficient to fully characterize young children's exposure to passive smoking. Because socioeconomic variables contribute to measured exposure, passive-smoking studies that treat class as a confounder and control for it may be overcontrolling.",American journal of public health,1992 Sep,United States,1992,90
9431652,Ethnocultural identity and induced abortion in Kazakstan.,"This study analyzes ethnic differences in induced abortion among ever-married women in Kazakstan, drawing on data from the 1995 Kazakstan Demographic and Health Survey. Instead of conventional ethnic markers, such as ""Kazak"" or ""Russian,"" it focuses on more complex ethnocultural identities that combine ascribed ethnicity with language use. Because of the history of russification in Kazakstan, three ethnocultural groups are defined and compared--Kazak women who chose to be interviewed in Kazak, Kazak women who chose to be interviewed in Russian, and women of European background interviewed in Russian. Whereas women of European origin were the most likely to undergo induced abortion, the Russian-interviewed Kazaks had higher abortion ratios and were more likely to terminate their pregnancies than were the Kazak-interviewed Kazaks, net of other characteristics. The implications of the results for induced abortion trends and family planning policy in Kazakstan are discussed in addition to other findings.",Studies in family planning,1997 Dec,United States,1997,90
1632854,"Low serum cholesterol, cancer and other noncardiovascular disorders.","There has been much concern and discussion whether reduction of serum cholesterol by diet or drugs, while preventing coronary heart disease, might cause an increase in the risk of dying from noncardiovascular disorders, in particular cancer. A review of the evidence from ecological, cross-cultural comparisons, prospective epidemiological cohort studies and intervention trials provides no indication for a cause-and-effect association between low serum cholesterol or serum cholesterol lowering and the risk of cancer, except possibly at very low levels. An inverse relationship between noncardiovascular-noncancer mortality and serum cholesterol level does exist but the link is unlikely to be causal; for better understanding, there is a need for studying the biological, lifestyle and social correlates of this association. Continuing observations should pay attention to the accuracy of information on specific causes of noncardiovascular deaths, especially mortality not due to disease. Further research needs to include investigations into the determinants of low serum cholesterol levels and their possible influence on biological functions. It is concluded that the current recommendations for coronary heart disease prevention, aimed at lowering elevated serum cholesterol levels in individuals (the 'high-risk strategy') and in populations at high risk (the 'population strategy') require no basic modification in the light of present knowledge on the relationships between cholesterol and noncardiovascular disease mortality.",Atherosclerosis,1992 May,Ireland,1992,90
8501991,Multiuse of medicines in Finland.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of multiuse of prescription drugs and its major determinants among Finnish adults. The data were based on three nationally representative and intercomparable health surveys in 1976, 1978-80, and 1987. The study populations were 16,413 in 1976, 13,138 in 1987, and 7,217 in 1978-80. The simultaneous use of at least five prescription drugs was the main outcome measure. In 1976, 4.7% of the study population, and 6.3% in 1987 were multiusers. Of all users of prescription drugs, the proportion of multiusers was 14% both in 1976 and 1987. In 1987, the elderly comprised 55% of all multiusers, whereas their share in 1976 was 44%. The strongest predictor of the multiuse was, as expected, chronic morbidity. Of the various diagnostic groups, the main determinants were cardiac insufficiency, hypertension, asthma, mental disorders, and coronary heart disease. Even allowing for chronic morbidity, age was significantly associated with multiuse, but sex was not. The number of visits to a primary care physician correlated also independently with the multiuse. These findings indicate that the elderly may in part get prescriptions indiscriminately.",Medical care,1993 May,United States,1993,90
8909112,"Gender, family configuration, and the effect of family background on educational attainment.","A comprehensive model of family influences on educational resemblance of siblings expands the traditional sibling pair model to a full sibship model in order to investigate how gender, gender composition of sibships, and a measure of ordinal position moderate the effect of social origins on educational attainments of siblings. One common family factor is sufficient to explain the variation of educational attainment among brothers and sisters. Although effects of social origins variables on brothers are larger than on sisters, the relative effects of measured social origins are virtually the same among sisters and brothers. The disparity between educational attainments of brothers and sisters persists across sex composition and family size. Ordinal position does not alter the effects of social origins on educational attainment nor does it directly affect educational attainment. Father's and mother's education are equally important for all siblings regardless of birth order, gender composition, and family size.",Social biology,1996 Spring-Summer,United States,1996,90

These issues concern our understanding of community, of health, of population health and its determinants, of the concept of 'measurement' and the values that underlie it, and our reasons for wishing to measure these constructs. We then present a framework for indicator categories, propose some criteria for indicator selection and suggest an initial set of core indicators. This indicator set reflects not simply health status--no matter how broadly defined--but also the environmental, social and economic determinants of health and the ""healthfulness"" of the community itself. Our most important conclusion is that if the information that is contained in the data of the indicator set is to be transformed into knowledge that can empower and emancipate the community, it has to be developed in consultation with the local community and local users of the information.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1999 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1999,90
1782520,The politics of welfare policy in Sweden: structural determinants and attitudinal cleavages.,"The article analyzes attitudes to Swedish welfare policies, using data from a survey conducted in 1986. In the first section, a number of indices tapping various aspects of attitudes to welfare policy are constructed. In the second section these indices are used to give an empirical assessment of competing theories about the impact of different structural determinants on attitudes. It is concluded (a) that there is general support for Swedish welfare policies, which, however, is mixed with criticisms of bureaucracy and suspicion about abuse of welfare programs, and (b) that class position and 'class-related' determinants such as income are more important than factors such as gender, private or public sector location or consumption groups in structuring attitudes. In the concluding section, these findings are discussed in relation to recent theorizing about newly emerging lines of division in the population. It is argued that either Sweden must be seen as a deviant case, which for specific historical and institutional reasons is characterized by class conflicts rather than other sectional splits, or the theories about new lines of division are simply mistaken.",The British journal of sociology,1991 Dec,England,1991,90

This definition of women's health provides the conceptual framework for a relevant and effective approach to patient education, health promotion and disease prevention activities in women. Such activities must focus not only on diseases that are more common, more prevalent or more serious in women, but also on priority health issues identified by women themselves, the diversity of women, the determinants of health and above all, the impact of gender on health. These programs must also be based on knowledge resulting from gender sensitive, bias-free health research. The traditional oppression and disempowerment of women must also be addressed at both personal and societal levels, thus broadening our approach so that we become social as well as health activists.",Patient education and counseling,1998 Mar,Ireland,1998,90

28590572,Sources of measurement variation in child anthropometry in the Malawi maternal and child nutrition study.,"An examination of intra- and inter-observer error in child anthropometry and variation between two skinfold calipers was conducted as part of a large prospective study of maternal and child nutrition in Malawi, Central Africa. Measurements include length, weight, head and arm circumferences, triceps and subscapular skinfolds, and estimated cross-sectional arm fat and arm muscle areas. Total observer error, expressed as a percentage of total variance in each trait, is 3.2% for length, weight, and head circumference; 7% for arm circumference; 10% for arm fat area; and 16-20% for skinfolds and arm muscle area. When total observer error is divided into the two additive components studied, intraobserver error represents approximately 50% or more of total observer error for most traits. An exception is the subscapular skinfold for which intra-observer represents 38% of total observer error. Errors of this magnitude will cause an attenuation of approximately 10% in the correlation coefficients between anthropometric and other variables, and a loss of power in attempting to detect associations between anthropometric variables and either their determinants or outcomes. However, the effects of errors of this magnitude are minor compared to those encountered in studies correlating nutrient intake with other variables. This study also finds that the SlimGuide caliper systematically overestimates skinfolds at low readings and underestimates skinfolds at high readingss relative to the Lange caliper.",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,1991,United States,1991,90
8634561,Role of patients' view of their illness in predicting return to work and functioning after myocardial infarction: longitudinal study.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patients' initial perceptions of their myocardial infarction predict subsequent attendance at a cardiac rehabilitation course, return to work, disability, and sexual dysfunction. DESIGN: Patients' perceptions of their illness were measured at admission with their first myocardial infarction and at follow up three and six months later. SETTING: Two large teaching hospitals in Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS: 143 consecutive patients aged under 65 with their first myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attendance at rehabilitation course; time before returning to work; measures of disability with sickness impact profile questionnaire for sleep and rest, social interaction, recreational activity, and home management; and sexual dysfunction. RESULTS: Attendance at the rehabilitation course was significantly related to a stronger belief during admission that the illness could be cured or controlled (t = 2.08, P = 0.04). Return to work within six weeks was significantly predicted by the perception that the illness would last a short time (t = 2.52, P = 0.01) and have less grave consequences for the patient (t = 2.87, P = 0.005). Patients' belief that their heart disease would have serious consequences was significantly related to later disability in work around the house, recreational activities, and social interaction. A strong illness identity was significantly related to greater sexual dysfunction at both three and six months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' initial perceptions of illness are important determinants of different aspects of recovery after myocardial infarction. Specific illness perceptions need to be identified at an early stage as a basis for optimising outcomes from rehabilitation programmes.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 May 11,England,1996,90
12345926,Personality characteristics of condom users.,"The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) and a survey of sexual behavior and condom use specifically developed for this descriptive study were administered to 132 sexually active, heterosexual male university students (mean age = 19.2 years; 75% Caucasian). Condom ""users"" (44% of this sample) were defined as those who reported using a condom in their last sexual encounter to ejaculation. ""Sexually active"" men were defined as those who reported some form of intercourse with a partner to ejaculation within the past 3 months. On the CPI, the condom users scored significantly higher than nonusers on the Achievement via Independence scale and marginally higher on the Socialization and the Social Presence scales. The mean CPI profile for the condom users yielded the Gamma personality type which denotes an externally-oriented, norm questioning personality. Gammas tended to be uninhibited, clever, witty, pleasure-seeking risk takers. Those men who did not use a condom in their last sexual encounter offered their reasons for not doing so. The most common reasons were not expecting intercourse to occur and they were not available. In terms of perceived risk for HIV-infection, only 12.3% of the men had taken the antibody test and 75% considered themselves to be at zero or low risk. Several suggestions were made for counseling strategies in promoting condom use in college-age populations.",Journal of sex education and therapy,1994 Summer,United States,1994,90
7738955,The natural history of juvenile chronic arthritis: a population based cohort study. II. Outcome.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome in a population based cohort of patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) who were in the process of being transferred from pediatric to adult rheumatology care. METHODS: The cohort of patients born in 1968 through 1972, recruited from a population based epidemiological study in southwestern Sweden, were called to a followup after a median disease duration of 7.1 years. The study group consisted of 124 patients with a median age of 17.7 years. The disability and discomfort dimensions were evaluated using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ). The impact of the disease on social life was evaluated by patients and parents. RESULTS: The median C-HAQ disability index was 0.19 with a range from 0 to 2.75 (maximum possible score = 3). Sixty percent of the patients indicated some difficulty in daily activities. Female sex and a polyarticular disease course were risk factors for disability. The strongest determinants for disability were continuing disease activity and a positive IgM rheumatoid factor. Social impact of the disease was strongly linked to a raised C-HAQ disability index. CONCLUSION: Even in a population based study of JCA, which includes many mild cases, the majority of patients experienced some difficulty in daily activities when judged by themselves. This underlines the necessity to use the patient's own values in outcome studies, rather than the physician's. Further development of internationally accepted, standardized instruments to evaluate the handicap dimension of childhood arthritis is called for.",The Journal of rheumatology,1995 Feb,Canada,1995,90

The main finding is that experience of unemployment during the first year in Israel does not, on the whole, help predict subsequent remigration. The propensity to remigrate varies inversely with age for most groups, and it increases if the immigrant has not acquired permanent housing. Immigrants on temporary resident visas are naturally more prone to remigrate in the short run.

Proportional Hazards modeling (Cox, 1972) was employed to identify factors associated with the risk and timing of onset of alcohol and illicit drugs for both cultural groups. For both Natives and Non-natives alike, and considering both drinking and drug use onset together, age cohort predominates as a risk factor, with youngest groups at greatest risk, and especially in the case of drug use other than alcohol. For the model of drug use timing, age of alcohol use onset is the second best predictor for Natives, although its effect is still apparent, albeit weaker, in the case of Non-natives. As for family characteristics, a number of factors emerge as determinants of risk and depend, in part, on the cultural group and the substance under consideration. Consistent with attachment theory's prediction about the universal applicability of the need for close parent-child relations (Bowlby, 1969), the findings for both Natives and Non-natives alike point to the salience of psychosocial attachment and other indicators of family functioning in affecting early onset drinking and drug use, behaviors well-recognized to lead to potentially adverse mental and physical health consequences as well as to negative social outcomes.",Social biology,1999 Spring-Summer,United States,1999,90

1805367,"Socioeconomic development, health interventions and mortality decline in Costa Rica.","Costa Rica, whose life expectancy was 74 years by 1985, has reached a health level comparable to a developed country. The health achievements of this country are product of political and socioeconomic circumstances as well as of right public health policies. Until about 1970 the features of Costa Rica mortality, although somewhat better than the Latin American average, evolved in a similar way to the rest of the region. In particular, the decades of 1940s and 1950s saw dramatic improvements in life expectancy, thanks mainly to the import of low-cost, high-effectiveness health technologies. In the 1970s, however, Costa Rica departed from a regional pattern of stagnation and managed to close the gap with developed countries in terms of mortality levels. A dramatic decline in the infant mortality rate from 60 to 19 per 1,000 took place in this decade. The main determinants of this breakthrough were health interventions, notably a primary health care program, even though favorable socioeconomic conditions and a reduced fertility also played a role. Ecological data and other evidence suggest that up to three fourths of the mortality decline was accounted for contemporary improvements in public health services, with about 40 percent attributable to primary health care interventions. Furthermore, by targeting interventions on the less privileged population, these interventions had the merit of reducing geographic and socioeconomic differentials in child mortality.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine.

The sociocultural and economic factors studied are caste, education, breast-feeding status, and social status of the currently married females in the reproductive age group. The study population is predominantly Hindu, among whom caste is a strong indicator of socioeconomic conditions. The average age of the female at return marriage (RM) is below 18 years in each religion or caste group but has been increasing over time. Median durations of breast feeding and PPA differ significantly among various socioeconomic and demographic subgroups. These are longest in scheduled castes and shortest in upper-caste Hindus. As the social status of the household increases, the median durations of breast feeding and PPA decrease. The estimates of fecundability consistently decrease with age, whereas those of sterility increase with age after 35 years. The smallest estimate of sterility is 4%, corresponding to the 25-30-year age group in each religion or caste group. Occurrence of menopause is rare before age 35, and it increases with the age of the female irrespective of religion or caste. However, the risk is minimum for females in upper castes and maximum for those in scheduled castes.",Human biology,1995 Dec,United States,1995,90

10421088,Blood pressure and hypertension in rural and urban Sierra Leoneans.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and awareness of hypertension and determinants of blood pressure in rural and urban Sierra Leoneans. METHOD: 598 subjects from Freetown and 606 subjects from three villages in the northern province of Sierra Leone were selected for this study using multi-stage sampling. All were adults aged 15 years and over. Single blood pressure measurements were made after a minimum rest period of 10 minutes using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Korotkoffs phases I and V were used for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. Standard anthropometric measurements were made and a questionnaire used to collect information on demographic, dietary, and social factors, including consumption of tobacco products, alcohol, salt, palm oil, and kola nuts. Hypertension was diagnosed if systolic blood pressure(SBP) was equal or greater than 160 mm Hg and/or if diastolic blood pressure(DBP) was equal or greater than 95 mm Hg and/or there was a history of hypertensive therapy. RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension in the Freetown and Port Loko subjects was 23.4% and 14.7%, respectively (P=0.006). Females had a higher prevalence in both populations. The most significant determinants of blood pressure were age, body mass index (BMI) and a low level of education. When adjusted for BMI and age, no significant difference in prevalence was observed between the two populations. The level of awareness was low, particularly in the rural areas. CONCLUSION: This survey confirms a high prevalence, and low level of awareness, of hypertension in rural and urban Sierra Leoneans.",Ethnicity & disease,1999 Spring-Summer,United States,1999,90
8817181,Distribution and population determinants of gamma-glutamyltransferase in a random sample of Sardinian inhabitants. 'ATS-SARDEGNA' Research Group.,"The relation of a number of determinants to serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was studied in a random sample of Sardinian inhabitants of 2283 males and 2520 females aged 20-59 years. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of environmental, behavioural and biochemical factors on GGT levels. Mean values were higher in males than in females and increased with age in both sexes. In sex-specific multiple regression analysis, GGT showed a positive association with body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, total serum cholesterol (T-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and age, and a negative one with coffee consumption and physical activity in males, while in females the enzyme was positively associated with BMI, alcohol use, age, T-C, ApoB, TG and cigarette smoking. The negative association between coffee drinking and serum GGT observed in males suggests that coffee may inhibit the inducing effects of other factors, particularly alcohol use, on GGT in the liver. No biological mechanism has been suggested to explain the association of GGT with BMI, age or physical activity. This study confirms the importance of GGT as a strong marker for alcohol use; but a number of variables, ranging from life-style to biological characteristics, are also important determinants of its plasma values in the 'normal' population.",European journal of epidemiology,1996 Feb,Netherlands,1996,90

8840201,Policy and ideology: the politics of post-reform health policy in the United Kingdom.,"While it is commonly accepted that the broader political and economic climate directly influences the nature of any major changes in the provision of health care (witness the 1991 National Health Service reforms in the United Kingdom), there is less consideration of the effect of paradigm changes in health care and health care management themselves on wider political and ideological strategies. This article examines the recent health policy initiatives presented by Britain's Labour Party. The author argues that while the Conservatives' market-oriented reforms reflected the perceived political and economic realities of the 1980s, the rapidly increasing credibility of strategies of prevention within the health care sector (including an emphasis on the social determinants of ill-health, the need to plan a shift from acute to community care, and the desire for greater lay participation in policy-making) allows Labour to highlight the limitations of a strongly market-oriented system in the health care sector more so than in any other policy area.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1996,United States,1996,90
7933968,"Behavioral management of specific pathogen-free rhesus macaques: group formation, reproduction, and parental competence.","Breeding colonies of specific pathogen-free (SPF) rhesus macaques were established to eradicate the transmission of Herpesvirus simiae and several retroviruses in this species. Strategies to attain this goal included the combination of large numbers of monkeys into groups, the establishment of small unimale groups, and a program using animals that were temporarily socially restricted. All methods required the establishment of new social groups from unfamiliar animals. In using these methods, we encountered important behavioral questions related to the group formation process, as well as reproductive and parental competence. Age and prior social experience were important determinants of social and parental success. New multimale-multifemale SPF group formations were successful initially and involved the least aggression during the first breeding season when young females and older males were used. Formation of unimale groups was successful, even when males and females were of similar ages. Breeding competence did not seem to be affected by any of the SPF colony management procedures, but animals with restricted early social experience exhibited impaired parental competence when compared with animals with more social experience. Males were more sensitive to the effects of early social restriction than females. A variety of behavioral obstacles will be encountered when attempting to establish an SPF breeding colony by forming groups by use of these methods. Skilled behavioral management is necessary to surmount these obstacles and to achieve satisfactory social integration, reproduction, and parenting.",Laboratory animal science,1994 Jun,United States,1994,90
7871562,"Incidence, determinants, and consequences of subclinical noncompliance with immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplant recipients.","In this descriptive cross-sectional study, we investigated the incidence, determinants, and consequences of subclinical noncompliance with immunosuppressive therapy in 150 adult renal transplant recipients with more than one year posttransplant status. Symptom frequency and symptom distress, and self-care agency were measured by the Transplant Symptom Frequency and Symptom Distress Scale, and the Appraisal for Self-Care Agency Scale, respectively. The Long-Term Medication Behavior Self-Efficacy Scale and a renal transplant knowledge questionnaire were developed as part of this study to measure perceived self-efficacy and knowledge of the therapeutic regimen. Demographic variables were also measured. The incidence of subclinical noncompliance with immunosuppressive therapy as assessed by interview was 22.3%. Compliers and noncompliers differed significantly on the variables of marital status (P = 0.03), situational-operational knowledge (P = 0.02), self-care agency (P = 0.03), and perceived self-efficacy related to long-term medication intake (P = 0.048). A logistic regression model using gender, marital status, perceived self-efficacy, self-care agency, knowledge about medication administration and signs of infection, and situational operational knowledge as predictor variables, revealed a 78.6% correct classification of compliers versus noncompliers and a sensitivity ratio of 95.9%. There were significantly more acute late rejection episodes (P = 0.003) in the noncompliant group. Graft survival at 5 years in this group was also significantly lower (P = 0.03) than the compliant patients. No significant difference was found in terms of the occurrence of chronic rejection episodes or in terms of patient survival at 5 years. Because noncompliance is a risk factor for negative clinical outcome in renal transplant recipients, it is of utmost importance to develop intervention strategies to enhance compliance in this population by using determinants identified in exploratory studies.",Transplantation,1995 Feb 15,United States,1995,90
8066490,Self-rated health: biological continuum or social discontinuity?,"Correlates of self-rated health among a randomly selected sample of 1863 Australian-born women 45-55 years of age were examined in two logistic regression analyses: one comparing a self-rated health of worse than one's peers with a self-rated health the same as one's peers; and, one comparing a self-rated health of better than one's peers with a self-rated health the same as one's peers. The final model for worse health was largely a reflection of the physical experience of ill health while that for better health was a more complex construct including not only the absence of illness but also markers of sociodemographic advantage and self-image. The two models had only three variables in common. Notably, the relationship between the outcome measures and one common variable, body mass index, differed markedly. It is suggested that previous analyses of self-rated health have had their power to adequately describe correlates and determinants of health status constrained. By assuming that the various self-rated health states are part of a continuum and employing statistical methods consistent with that assumption, previous studies have been unable to demonstrate the discontinuity among such states. In particular, it is suggested that self-rated health is at least in part a reflection of social role and as there is no basis for assuming that such roles form a continuum as the use of correlation-based analyses imply, then such analyses are inappropriate.",Social science & medicine (1982),1994 Jul,England,1994,90
1813676,The developmental mode of adolescent psychopathology: from the pathogenic viewpoint of the eating disorder.,"The developmental mode of eating disorder was studied by investigating 48 cases in detail. After various factors were examined, it appeared certain that the intensification of adolescent turmoil as well as the neurotic level of determinants can become the strong driving force and the cause of eating disorder. Among most cases, the less sprightly life is dominant around preadolescence, which affects the orientation of psychopathology in adolescence. Under the influence of the developmental mode in preadolescence, every case determines how to utilize adolescent mentality (asceticism and indulgence colored by masochism and defiance vs. obedience). With this standpoint, the author illustrates how there may occur branching out of the subtype of eating disorder.",The Japanese journal of psychiatry and neurology,1991 Dec,Japan,1991,90

Cultural preferences also influence this tendency and the propensity of immigrant groups from developing regions to live in three- or more than three-generation households ranges up to 18 times those of their Canadian-born and immigrant counterparts from the developed regions. Variables such as average income, percent receiving Old Age Security payments, percent widowed and duration of residence in Canada are significantly associated with proportions of immigrants living in such arrangements, and explain about 84 percent of birthplace variation for males and 81 percent for females.""",Asian and Pacific migration journal : APMJ,1998,Philippines,1998,90

The girls were 14 through 17 years of age, from working-class backgrounds, and living in rural and urban areas. Adapted versions of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and the Parental Bonding Instrument were administered. Results indicated that the two groups did not differ in perceived maternal care and control. However, the self-esteem of urban schoolgirls was significantly higher than that of their once-pregnant counterparts. This was also true of the total sample. Urban teenagers without father figures were nearly 2.7 times more likely to have been pregnant than were those living with adult male relatives. Thus, father-figure absence and low self-esteem may combine as risk factors for teenage pregnancy in urban Jamaica.",Adolescence,1992 Winter,United States,1992,90

Results show that 309 (54.4%) of the respondents had ever had a Pap smear. The women who reported having had a smear were more likely to be below 45 years of age (prevalence ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.88), Chinese and of a higher socioeconomic status (1.68, 1.33 to 2.12). They were also more likely to have married at a later age (1.68, 1.21 to 2.31) than women who had not had a smear. Age and socioeconomic status remained independent predictors on multivariate analysis. The findings suggest that an important task of public health practitioners is to increase the uptake of screening among older and socially disadvantaged women who are known to be at the highest risk of cervical cancer. In addition, strategies to encourage younger women to continue regular attendance at screening clinics beyond their childbearing years will be important for the future.","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",1994 May,Singapore,1994,90

7728557,Mass childhood immunization: some ethical doubts for primary health care workers.,"The mass childhood immunization programme has traditionally been viewed as a safe and effective preventative measure by health promoters, primary health care professionals and governments. This consensus has meant that immunization has rarely been viewed as ethically problematic. A number of recent changes in the context of the delivery of health care, particularly the emphasis on consumerism and the effect of the marketization of services, makes timely an examination of ethical, social and political issues. This article examines four main grounds for problematizing the mass childhood immunization programme. These are: clinical research evidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccines; the masking of wider social and political determinants of ill health; the contradictory strictures about collective and individual rights in relation to immunization; and the uniqueness of childhood immunization as a physical intrusion into a healthy body. The implications of these ethical issues are discussed in relation to informed consent and the need for a 'greenfield' review that includes the views of dissenting parents, lawyers and moral philosophers, as well as health professionals.",Nursing ethics,1995 Mar,England,1995,90

Pattern, predictors, and impact on everyday life in a 4-year follow-up.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the evolution of cognitive dysfunction in early-onset multiple sclerosis, to identify clinical predictors of mental decline, and to determine its impact on a patient's everyday life. DESIGN: The cognitive performance of 50 patients with multiple sclerosis on a neuropsychological battery was compared with that of 70 control subjects initially and again after a 4-year interval. Clinical predictors of cognitive impairment and its effect on daily life were analyzed by stepwise linear regression. SETTING: The research clinic of a university department of neurology. PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive sample of 50 inpatients and outpatients with multiple sclerosis (mean disease duration, 1.58 years) and 70 demographically matched healthy control subjects selected from the patients' relatives and friends. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean psychometric test scores of both groups at the initial and follow-up testing. Regression coefficients measuring the relationship between clinical parameters and cognitive capacity and between mental decline and performance of common tasks measured by the Environmental and the Incapacity Status scales. RESULTS: Multiple sclerosis-related deficits in verbal memory and abstract reasoning on initial testing remained more or less stable on the retest, at which time linguistic disturbances on the Set and Token tests also emerged. A patient's initial disability level predicted decreased performance on only four of 13 cognitive variables, and disease duration did so on only two. Extent of intellectual decline on initial testing, initial disability level, and progressive course were independent determinants of handicap in a patient's work and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and neurological deficits appear not to develop in parallel. Yet cognitive dysfunction proves to be a predictor of handicap in everyday life, even in patients in the incipient phase of multiple sclerosis.",Archives of neurology,1995 Feb,United States,1995,90
8816874,Determinants of loneliness in Jerusalem's 70-year-old population.,"This study aims to find the determinants of feelings of loneliness in 70 year olds living in Jerusalem. Results based on home interviews (n = 605) of a 40% systematic sample of 70 year olds in the electoral register showed that around 46.3% of females and 21.3% of males reported being lonely. Persons of European/North American origin felt less lonely than those of Asian or African origin, probably due to the former's wider social support network, perceiving friends, neighbors or other relatives as being available to back up children in an emergency. The major factors associated with loneliness were: being depressed, having a poor self-assessed health status, not attending synagogue, and being widowed but not remarried. Factors that did not reduce loneliness included having paid employment, watching TV or listening to the radio. No association was found between cognitive status and loneliness.

9519570,"Geographical distribution and dramatic increases in incidences of malaria: consequences of the resettlement scheme in Gambela, SW Ethiopia.","The spatial distribution of malaria results from the interaction between vector, parasite, host, physical and human environments. This basic geographical approach provides an illustration of the geographical distribution of malaria in the world, particularly in the tropical regions. Due to the global climate change and population movements, it is predicted that malaria could have a greater impact on the non-immune or unprepared populations in the Northern Hemisphere in the coming decades. Presently, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the most adversely affected region in the world. Like any other SSA country, Ethiopia suffers from both epidemic (unstable) and endemic (stable) malaria in the high and lowland regions, respectively. Gambela is one of the areas with stable malaria in the humid tropical region of the country. This study is based on observations, unpublished data, interviews and discussions with settlers and officials in Gambela. It is found that a degree of diverse malaria prevalence is associated with altitudinal, temperature and rainfall variations. Owing to the settlement and land-use changes, unexpected rainfall patterns, temperature increase, unstable political system and poverty, malaria has gone beyond its geographical limits. As a result, the number of malaria affected people has increased in the last 12 years. It is suggested that proper physical and social planning, understanding the geography, entomology, epidemiology, behaviour and life-cycle of malaria parasite, cooperation between the policy-makers, malaria specialists, neighbouring countries and international communities are urgent, if malaria has to be controlled and eradicated.",Indian journal of malariology,1997 Sep,India,1997,90
9885864,Predictors of length of stay for transurethral prostatectomy in Victoria.,"BACKGROUND: Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) is among the top 10 surgical conditions that account for hospital admission in Victoria. Bed utilization for TURP is an increasing concern in current times. This paper describes trends in length of stay (LOS) and identifies predictors of LOS for TURP in Victoria. METHODS: Trends in TURP were studied using ICD-9-CM coded Victorian hospital morbidity data from public hospitals from 1987/88 to 1994/95. Detailed morbidity data from the same source for the financial year 1995/96 were used to study predictors of LOS by logistic regression. RESULTS: Length of stay decreased significantly between 1987 and 1995 from 10.6 to 6.1 days. The strongest predictor of increased LOS was admission through the emergency room (odds ratio (OR) 14.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.8-18.3). Other significant predictors were older age, lower socio-economic status, presence of comorbid conditions, occurrence of procedural morbidity, and hospital type and location. CONCLUSIONS: The trend in decreasing LOS may be explained by increasingly efficient bed management in hospitals who are faced with an increasing need for cost control. Advances in surgical techniques and peri-operative care have also contributed to the decrease in LOS. Other factors that influence LOS can be divided into three categories: intrinsic patient factors, such as co-morbid conditions; procedure-specific factors such as peri-operative morbidity; and intrinsic hospital factors relating to capacity and resources. Such determinants of LOS may be of value to policy makers when considering the effective application of newer methods for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery,1998 Dec,Australia,1998,90

METHODS: 1078 tenth grade high school students, 15-16 years old answered an anonymous questionnaire including, perceived concerns and risk behaviors, (e.g., smoking, alcohol, drugs, and sexual activity). Concerns were grouped into six domains. RESULTS: The most frequently reported concerns related to school, weight, coping with aggression, fatigue, war, enlistment into army, and relationships with peers. Girls had more concerns in the domains of self-image, anxiety, and relationships with peers (p < .05). Adolescents with mothers who had less education had significantly more concerns in the domains of anxiety and relationships with peers and adults (p < .05). Forty-seven percent engaged in at least one risk behavior (boys 63% and girls 34%). The Guttman scalogram indicated the following sequence of risk behaviors: alcohol, cigarettes, sex, and drugs. There were statistically significant associations between concerns and risk behaviors in the domains of anxiety, sex, and relationships with adults and peers. CONCLUSION: Many adolescent concerns are universal, although the ranking and prevalence may vary based on different regional and population characteristics (e.g., in this population a high rate of concerns relating to aggression and war were identified). The results support the need to develop prevention and health promotion programs relating to the concerns and risk behaviors in the school and community, and individual counseling programs in primary care settings.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

10468392,Do measures of self-reported morbidity bias the estimation of the determinants of health care utilisation?,"Most national surveys of health care utilisation capture only self-reported measures of morbidity. If self-reported morbidity is measured with error, then the results of applied work may be misleading. In this paper we propose a model of the relationship between morbidity and health service utilisation which allows for reporting errors and simultaneity. Errors in self-reported morbidity are expressed as a function of person-specific reporting thresholds and recent contact with health services, arising because of better self-evaluation of current health status or a desire to justify consumption of a publicly-provided good. We demonstrate the bias in ignoring the potential problems of reporting errors and simultaneity for a variety of special cases, but in the general case the biases are of ambiguous sign. The empirical nature of these biases is investigated using limiting long-standing illness (LLI) and recent contact with a General Practitioner (GP) in two waves of The UK Health and Lifestyle Survey. Biomedical measures of functioning are used as objective indicators of health status. We find evidence of substantial and significant differences between individuals in reporting thresholds and some evidence that the reporting of LLI may depend on recent visits to a GP. Adjustments for these biases significantly increase the estimated effect of morbidity on utilisation.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Oct,England,1999,90
9802736,Determinants of the quality of life of patients with diabetes under intensified insulin therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: The concept of quality of life (QOL) is understood as a multidimensional construct made up of physiological, psychological, and social aspects, but their particular weightings for the global QOL are rarely investigated. We examined 1) the general QOL of patients with diabetes, 2) the significance of the individual QOL aspects for the overall assessment of QOL, and 3) the modulating function of coping mechanism and particular personality traits. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 116 diabetes patients under intensified insulin therapy were studied, as were 107 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 66 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 229 students who served as control subjects. The examination was based on eight standardized QOL and personality questionnaires (354 items) and assessed by means of linear structural regression models (AMOS 3.6). RESULTS: The QOL of diabetes patients appears to be higher than the QOL of other chronically ill patients. Social, psychological, and physical aspects contribute to the overall QOL, although physical complaints receive a comparatively low weighting. Coping behavior and particular personality traits covary with all QOL aspects, giving these variables greater significance for the QOL than the existence of secondary illnesses. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that the various factors involved in the multidimensional construct QOL receive different weightings was confirmed, making a simple summary score for the general QOL appear unjustifiable. In addition, all aspects that are commonly understood as parameters of QOL are influenced by external factors, such as coping behavior, based on individual personality characteristics.",Diabetes care,1998 Nov,United States,1998,90
22204507,An evaluation of the potential role of the physician in influencing community exercise behavior.,"Abstract The potential influence of physicians upon the exercise behavior of individuals has been examined. Key questions explored were a) whether people believed that their personal physician thought that they should exercise, and b) the level of motivation to comply with these perceived expectations. Subjects were drawn from four independent populations: 1) parents of junior high school students (N = 479); 2) university employees (N = 190); 3) lower-limb disabled adults (N = 62); and 4) pregnant women (N = 68). Questionnaire-based physical activity scores were transformed into Z-scores and the data sets for activity and beliefs were pooled. Multiple regression models were developed for each individual data set and for the combined data. The proportion of the variance in reported physical activity explained by the normative belief regarding the physician and the level of motivation to comply with the perceived physician's expectations was very low (adjusted R(2) = 0.026 for the combined data sets). In general, healthy adults thought that their personal physician wanted them to exercise and were motivated to comply with such advice. In contrast, disabled adults saw their personal physician as opposed to exercise which they were motivated to undertake. These findings are discussed in terms of the importance of social norms as determinants of exercise behavior and the position that physicians should adopt when seeking to enhance exercise behavior.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,1990 Mar,United States,1990,90

A longitudinal analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Research has demonstrated that physical activity serves an important preventive function against the development of cardiovascular disease. The recognition that U.S. children are often sedentary, coupled with the observation that physical activity habits tend to persist into adulthood, has prompted the investigation of exercise determinants consistent with social learning theory. The purposes of the present study were to identify social learning variables relevant to children's exercise and to explore the longitudinal predictive value of the determinants. METHODS: Data were collected from 111 families (N = 54 girls, N = 57 boys) who were interviewed in both Phase 1 (fifth and sixth grades) and Phase 2 (eight and ninth grades) of this study. Data from mothers (N = 111) were collected during both phases; data from 80 fathers were collected at Phase 2 only. RESULTS: The results of simultaneous stepwise regression analyses indicated that child's enjoyment of physical activity was the only consistent predictor of physical activity during Phase 1. At Phase 2, child's exercise knowledge, mother's physical activity, and child's and mother's friend modeling/support emerged as predictors for girls. For boys, child's self-efficacy for physical activity, exercise knowledge, parental modeling, and interest in sports media were important. Longitudinally, mother's self-efficacy, barriers to exercise, enjoyment of physical activity, and child's self-efficacy for physical activity were important for girls. Only child's exercise knowledge predicted boys' physical activity. The addition of information from fathers nearly doubled the explanatory power of the predictors for both genders. CONCLUSIONS: Socialization in the family unit exerts a tremendous influence on health-related behaviors such as exercise. The relative importance of determinants seems to differ for girls and boys and the pattern of these determinants appears to change over time.",Preventive medicine,1998 May-Jun,United States,1998,90
9708598,Use of health services by Chinese elderly in Beijing.,"OBJECTIVES: This article provides an inquiry into use of health services by the elderly. METHODS: The authors operationalize models of use with a survey of 350 elderly Chinese. Because the survey involves native Chinese, the empirical test can isolate functional social support as well as ""structural"" social supports (marriage, living with children). RESULTS: The principal findings comport with prior work: the strongest determinants of the use of health services by the elderly are those that relate to need. In addition, structural social support impacts use but demonstrates complex patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of family support increases physician visits while diminishing the probability of a hospital stay. Increased Western physician use ties to increased use of Chinese physicians and increased hospitalization. Functional social support plays a role as well. Finally, income effects did not play a large role in determining the use of health services among this population.",Medical care,1998 Aug,United States,1998,90
9204701,The determinants of IUD discontinuation in China: a discrete-time competing risk model analysis.,"This research examines the social, demographic, and family-planning-program factors that influence the occurrence of IUD discontinuation among Chinese women, using a sample of 14,639 IUD use segments from the 1988 Chinese National Survey of Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence. A discrete-time competing-risk event history method is employed to identify the determinants of IUD discontinuation by five kinds of reasons: contraceptive failure, expulsion, switching method, side-effects and other nonmethod-related reasons. The predictors of IUD discontinuation suggest that a number of mechanisms are in operation. Some of the determinants may reflect the effects of the family planning program; some may illustrate women's physiological and biological reactions to IUD's; some may be related to women's previous history of contraceptive use; and still others may indicate social characteristics of women that lead them to have their IUD's removed.",Social biology,1996 Fall-Winter,United States,1996,90
8146138,Human ecology and behavior and sexually transmitted bacterial infections.,"The three direct determinants of the rate of spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are sexual behaviors, the mean duration of infectiousness, and the mean efficiency of sexual transmission of each STD. Underlying ecological and behavioral factors that operate through one or more of these direct determinants lie on a continuum, ranging from those most proximate back to those more remote (in time or mechanism) from the direct determinants. Most remote and least modifiable are the historical stages of economic development that even today conspicuously influence patterns of sexual behavior. Next are the distribution and changing patterns of climate, hygiene, and population density; the global population explosion and stages of the demographic transition; and ongoing changes in human physiology (e.g., menarche at younger age) and culture (e.g., later marriage). More proximate on the continuum are war, migration, and travel; and current policies for economic development and social welfare. Most recent or modifiable are technologic and commercial product development (e.g., oral contraceptives); circumcision, condom, spermicide, and contraception practices; patterns of illicit drug use that influence sexual behaviors; and the accessibility, quality, and use of STD health care. These underlying factors help explain why the curable bacterial STDs are epidemic in developing countries and why the United States is the only industrialized country that has failed to control bacterial STDs during the AIDS era.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1994 Mar 29,United States,1994,90
7761906,Smoothed breastfeeding durations and waiting time to conception.,"Breastfeeding beyond the resumption of mother's menstruation plays a significant role in the proximate determinants of fertility. Breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea data collected from retrospective surveys usually exhibit digit preferences. Here, these heaping errors were smoothed by B-spline and used in multivariate models of risk of conception to investigate the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. The data used come from a 1987 Indian survey. Results show that lactation, after mother's menses resume, reduces the risk of conception. Heaping in breastfeeding data attenuates this relationship. When adjustment is made, breastfeeding reduced the rate of conception by 47 per cent; the reduction, with adjusted data, was 63 per cent.",Social biology,1994 Fall-Winter,United States,1994,90
9752284,[Influence of knowledge relative to cancer on prevention behavior in the population of Bas-Rhin].,"The tendency today is to make the population more aware of health in order to encourage their use of prevention activities. The aim of our telephone survey which was performed on a representative sample of the population (1,010) in the Bas-Rhin department in France, was to study the relationship between the level of knowledge of cancer and the use of screening techniques to prevent it. Eighty-two percent of the males and 78% of the females surveyed, show a profound understanding of cancer in general, the associated risk factors and its prevention. The level of awareness of males did not influence a specific behaviour (p = 0.68) towards cancer prevention. It was shown that in smokers, the more they smoke, the more they underestimate the chances of cure from all categories of cancer (p = 0.01). They both overestimate the number of cigarettes needed daily before smoking becomes toxic (p < 0.01) and are less active physically than nonsmokers (p < 0.007). Heavy smokers live in larger communities (p < 0.02) and smokers are younger than non-smokers (p < 0.0001). In the female population, the level of awareness did indeed influence their behaviour towards cancer prevention (p < 0.04). The level of knowledge was higher in both those who consciously attend cancer screening clinics (cervical Papanicolaou smears and faecal tests) and those who are opposed to faecal tests. Younger females are significantly less aware than those who are older (p = 0.0001) and more than two-thirds of these would not consider a cervical Papanicolaou smear as a preventative diagnostic tool. Females who conscientiously attend cancer screening clinics and who are very much aware of cancer, are generally older in age (p < 0.05). The occurrence of mammography as a preventative measure is both high and dependent on age. In conclusion, the level of knowledge of cancer cannot explain alone human behaviour towards the prevention of this disease. Other determinants responsible for influencing human behaviour towards cancer prevention will be better understood once the social sciences, epidemiology and anthropology units work together and combine resources to achieve a common goal.",Bulletin du cancer,1998 Jun,France,1998,90
10379455,"Embodying inequality: a review of concepts, measures, and methods for studying health consequences of discrimination.","Investigating effects of discrimination upon health requires clear concepts, methods, and measures. At issue are both economic consequences of discrimination and accumulated insults arising from everyday and at times violent experiences of being treated as a second-class citizen, at each and every economic level. Guidelines for epidemiologic investigations and other public health research on ways people embody racism, sexism, and other forms of social inequality, however, are not well defined, as research in this area is in its infancy. Employing an ecosocial framework, this article accordingly reviews definitions and patterns of discrimination within the United States; evaluates analytic strategies and instruments researchers have developed to study health effects of different kinds of discrimination; and delineates diverse pathways by which discrimination can harm health, both outright and by distorting production of epidemiologic knowledge about determinants of population health. Three methods of studying health consequences of discrimination are examined (indirect; direct, at the individual level, in relation to personal experiences of discrimination; at the population level, such as via segregation), and recommendations are provided for developing research instruments to measure acute and cumulative exposure to different aspects of discrimination.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1999,United States,1999,90
9415858,Determinants of psychological distress and its course in the first year after diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis patients.,"In order to examine determinants of psychological distress and its course in the first year after diagnosis in rheumatoid arthritis patients, self-report data and clinical and laboratory measures were collected in 91 patients (70% female, mean age 57 years) shortly after diagnosis and 1 year later. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sex, pain and functional status, disease impact on daily life, life events, and perceived social support were related to psychological distress (anxiety and depressed mood) shortly after diagnosis. Coping strategies were related to distress levels only 1 year later. Multiple regression analysis of change in anxiety and depressed mood revealed that a decrease of psychological distress after 1 year could be predicted by male sex, an initially less severe inflammatory activity and an initially more extended social network. In addition, a decrease in distress was related to parallel improvements in clinical status. Results indicate the importance of a multimodal assessment of demographic variables, clinical and life stressors and social resources for the understanding of distress and the identification of risk factors in the first stage of the disease. Personal coping resources appear to become more important predictors of distress in a later phase of the disease.",Journal of behavioral medicine,1997 Oct,United States,1997,90
16250705,"Social cognitive and physical health determinants of exercise adherence for HIV-1 seropositive, early symptomatic men and women.","This study examined social cognitive and physical health factors that might explain variations in exercise adherence in a 3-month supervised exercise intervention for a group of mildly symptomatic, HIV-1 seropositive men and women. The social cognitive predictor variables were outcome expectations and self-efficacy. The physical health predictor variables included CD4+ cell counts, self-report inventories of physical symptoms, and physicians' examinations. Self-report inventories of physical symptoms were associated with physicians' examinations and combined into a composite measure of physical health. Criterion variables included exercise adherence rates, VO2max change, and status as a 'remainder' versus 'drop-out.' The composite measure of physical health emerged as a significant predictor of adherence rate and gave perfect prediction of remainers and a moderate prediction of dropouts. No significant associations were observed between the social cognitive predictors and adherence. Results suggest that for this population physical health status is a better predictor of exercise adherence than either perceived self-efficacy or outcome expectancy.",International journal of behavioral medicine,1998,England,1998,90
8533054,Immune disorders and handedness in dyslexic boys and their relatives.,Thirty dyslexic and 30 control boys aged 7-11 years were compared for frequency of immune disorders and handedness as well as for family history of immune disorders and learning disabilities (dyslexia and stuttering). They were also compared for neurological status and for history of speech and language difficulties. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the frequency of immune disorders and in handedness. The results showed significantly more dyslexic boys with soft neurological signs and signs of speech and language disorders. The frequency of dyslexia was significantly higher in the relatives of the dyslexic boys. Also significantly more mothers of the dyslexic boys reported difficulties during pregnancy and complications at delivery. The results are discussed in terms of Geschwind's hypothesis and neuromaturational delay as possible determinants of developmental dyslexia.,Scandinavian journal of psychology,1995 Dec,England,1995,90

All 354 children below two years of age living in two urban slum areas of Pelotas, southern Brazil, were included. The multivariate analyses took into account the hierarchical structure of the risk factors for each type of deficit. Variables selected as significant on a given level of the model were considered as risk factors, even if their statistical significance was subsequently lost when hierarchically inferior variables were included.

9077016,[Hierarchical model: a proposal for a model to be applied in the investigation of risk factors for severe diarrhea].,"In epidemiological investigations of infant diseases, data are usually collected on a large set of variables. The associations between presumptive risk factors and the outcome is commonly evaluated through statistical modeling, but the model-building strategies are seldom described. In the project, data collected in a case-control study of risk factors for dehydrating diarrhea in infants have been used to present a hierarchized approach to the assessment of risk factors. The variables were grouped into a hierarchy of categories, ranging from distal determinants to proximate ones. These categories included, in this order, socioeconomic, environmental, reproductive maternal, nutritional and demographic sets. According to the univariate analyses all variables were associated with the outcome. As the purpose was to identify a parsimonious model to explain the data, in each set the confounders were selected through backward elimination, according to an alpha level of 0.10. The risk factors were evaluated through logistic regression after adjustment for confounders in the same set or in hierarchically superior sets. This approach allows researchers to quantify the contribution of each level of adjustment, to understand the model-building strategy as well as interpret the independent associations. The goodness-of-fit assessed at each set showed significant improvements in the model. The gamma coefficient of association was employed to quantify the proportion of cases and controls correctly identified by comparing the observed value with that predicted by the variables in the model. The final model resulted in a gamma of 0.74. The children's ages did not improve the prediction of cases and controls, but they have been kept in the model as they affect some exposures such as breastfeeding.",Revista de saude publica,1996 Apr,Brazil,1996,90

Following family economics we postulate that for women a longer education decreases marriage rates both during education (institutional effect) and after the degree has been obtained (human capital effect). For men family economics predicts the delaying institutional effect, too, but the human capital effect is expected to increase marriage rates. Further considerations lead to the additional hypothesis that for younger birth cohorts these sex differences should attenuate.... For the United States and West Germany the observed marriage patterns confirm our hypotheses for the most part. For East Germany, however, we observe different marriage patterns. This was expected because the institutional context in this former socialist country was a very different one."" (SUMMARY IN ENG)",Zeitschrift fur Soziologie,1994 Feb,Germany,1994,90
9458570,Health promotion practice and public health: challenge for the 1990s. Heart Health Think Tank Group.,"The issue of practice skills arose in the course of a process evaluation of the Heart Smart North Shore (HSNS) project in British Columbia. We created a Think Tank of researchers and community practitioners to make recommendations for improvement of our skills. These recommendations differed according to different values for health and opinions on how to create health in the community. Because the site reviewers of the HSNS project were clear this was a disease prevention project and not a community development initiative, HSNS's orientation to skill development after the Think Tank moved toward the Precede/Proceed model, the Transtheoretical model and social marketing approaches. The Health Unit has now been restructured into multidisciplinary service teams which must focus on population health, evidence-based practice and the social determinants of health, and thus need to consider health promotion from a community development perspective and empowerment model. We suggest that learning and the development of staff and community volunteers should be seen as a continuous and reflective process that takes place at the individual, community and organizational level.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1997 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1997,90

2378312,Objective and subjective dimensions of travel impedance as determinants of commuting stress.,"The stressful characteristics of commuting constraints are conceptualized in terms of both physical and perceptual conditions of travel impedance. This study develops and operationalizes the concept of subjective impedance, as a complement to our previously developed concept of impedance as a physically defined condition of commuting stress. The stress impacts of high-impedance commuting were examined in a study of 79 employees of two companies in the follow-up testing of a longitudinal study. Subjective impedance was overlapping but not isomorphic with physical impedance, and these two dimensions have differential relationships with health and well-being outcomes. The physical impedance construct received further confirmation in validational analyses and in predicted effects on various illness measures and job satisfaction. The newly constructed subjective impedance index was significantly related to evening home mood, residential satisfaction, and chest pain. Job change was also influenced primarily by commuting satisfaction. The results are discussed within an ecological framework emphasizing interdomain transfer effects and situational moderators of commuting stress.",American journal of community psychology,1990 Apr,England,1990,90

21544449,Predictors of the interval between onset of symptoms and first medical visit in patients with digestive tract cancer.,"Lack of effective population screening programmes for digestive tract cancer makes a prompt diagnosis of symptomatic patients the primary option for early detection. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics and determinants of the interval between the first medical symptom and the first medical visit (ISV) in a sample of symptomatic patients of mid-low socioeconomic level admitted to hospital for a digestive tract cancer. During two years, 183 patients were personally interviewed with a structured questionnaire designed to elicit initial symptoms of digestive cancer. Fifty-seven percent consulted a physician during the first month after onset of symptoms, and over two-thirds did so within the first 2 months, but it took more than 3 months for 22.4% of the patients. In univariate analyses, the ISV was longer among patients illiterate, unemployed and in the lower social classes. The interval was also significantly longer when the physician-interviewer judged that the patient did not correctly identify the first symptom (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, the chance of a longer ISV was 2.8 times higher in men; 16 times higher in unemployed patients; 9 times higher in patients with a first symptom of the lower digestive tract; and it increased 8-fold in subjects who attributed no importance to the first manifestation (all p<0.05). In spite of virtually universal health coverage, social factors seemed to act as barriers to seeking medical help in a subgroup of patients. Their procrastination was also related to the nature of the initial symptoms. Achieving an early clinical detection of digestive cancers may be difficult in some segments of the population, and may require substantial improvements in access to and the efficiency of the health system.",International journal of oncology,1996 May,Greece,1996,90

The Health Belief Model (HBM), supplemented by other factors (locus of control, self-efficacy, health value, and social support), was used as a theoretical model. In multiple regression analyses both DA (p<.01) and SMBG (p<.001). SMBG showed strong associations with self-efficacy in SMBG (p,.001) and net benefits of SMBG (p<.001). The revised models explained 14% and 21% of the variation in DA and SMBG, respectively. The results suggest that although perceived net benefits are important determinants of both SMBG and DA, DA is also related to diabetes support, whereas SMBG is more strongly related to perceived self-efficacy. Thus self-care regimen should be planned individually for diabetic patients.",International journal of behavioral medicine,1997,England,1997,90

The prevalence of experimental or daily smoking was 67.4%, the rate being 65.5% in the standard, two-parent families and 75.5% in the non-standard families, the difference being statistically significant (p less than 0.001). The corresponding prevalence of daily smoking was 6.4%, but the rate was 5.1% in standard families and 12.1% in non-standard families (p less than 0.001). An elevated risk of smoking existed among adolescents who had experienced death of their father or divorce of their parents and among girls who had experienced death of their mother. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and maternal age under 20 years at the time of delivery increased the risk, while being the first-born child reduced it. Among family factors existing in 1980, paternal smoking increased the risk for both sexes, while more than three siblings, mother's unemployment or gainful employment (i.e. not a housewife) were associated with smoking by the boys as was urban living, and for the girls migration by the family to a town. The results suggest that juvenile smoking may be a kind of indicator of possible problems experienced by the parents and/or the adolescents themselves with respect to parenthood and family development.",British journal of addiction,1991 Apr,England,1991,90

Some implications from longitudinal studies.,"This chapter presents a review and discussion of the dynamic relationship between drug use, especially the use of illicit drugs, and its social covariates from the period of adolescence to young adulthood. The discussion is based primarily on longitudinal studies. In particular, I include a review and discussion of my collaborative studies with Kandel, in which we employ life-course perspectives for the analysis of natural drug and life histories of individuals based on event-history models. Specifically, I discuss five covariates: (1) age, (2) onset age of drug use, (3) historical period, (4) family and work roles, and (5) influence of significant others, with the dynamic interdependence between drug use and family and work roles as the major topic of discussion. The discussion also includes some insights into the issue of causation vs. selection effects regarding the influence of drug use on life-course pattern, and presents a novel aspect of indirect effects in the analysis of the determinants of drug use progression.","Recent developments in alcoholism : an official publication of the American Medical Society on Alcoholism, the Research Society on Alcoholism, and the National Council on Alcoholism",1990,United States,1990,90
10363349,Parent-child mediated learning interactions as determinants of cognitive modifiability: recent research and future directions.,"The main objectives of this article are to describe the effects of mediated learning experience (MLE) strategies in mother-child interactions on the child's cognitive modifiability, the effects of distal factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, mother's intelligence, child's personality) on MLE interactions, and the effects of situational variables on MLE processes. Methodological aspects of measurement of MLE interactions and of cognitive modifiability, using a dynamic assessment approach, are discussed. Studies with infants showed that the quality of mother-infant MLE interactions predict later cognitive functioning and that MLE patterns and children's cognitive performance change as a result of intervention programs. Studies with preschool and school-aged children showed that MLE interactions predict cognitive modifiability and that distal factors predict MLE interactions but not the child's cognitive modifiability. The child's cognitive modifiability was predicted by MLE interactions in a structured but not in a free-play situation. Mediation for transcendence (e.g., teaching rules and generalizations) appeared to be the strongest predictor of children's cognitive modifiability. Discussion of future research includes the consideration of a holistic transactional approach, which refers to MLE processes, personality, and motivational-affective factors, the cultural context of mediation, perception of the whole family as a mediational unit, and the ""mediational normative scripts.""","Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs",1999 May,United States,1999,90
9459470,Health values of hospitalized patients 80 years or older. HELP Investigators. Hospitalized Elderly Longitudinal Project.,"CONTEXT: Health values (utilities or preferences for health states) are often incorporated into clinical decisions and health care policy when issues of quality vs length of life arise, but little is known about health values of the very old. OBJECTIVE: To assess health values of older hospitalized patients, compare their values with those of their surrogate decision makers, investigate possible determinants of health values, and determine whether health values change over time. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal, multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Four academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred fourteen hospitalized patients aged 80 years or older and their surrogate decision makers who were interviewed and understood the task. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time-trade-off utilities, reflecting preferences for current health relative to a shorter but healthy life. RESULTS: On average, patients equated living 1 year in their current state of health with living 9.7 months in excellent health (mean [SD] utility, 0.81 [0.28]). Although only 126 patients (30.7%) rated their current quality of life as excellent or very good, 284 (68.6%) were willing to give up at most 1 month of 12 in exchange for excellent health (utility > or =0.92). At the other extreme, 25 (6.0%) were willing to live 2 weeks or less in excellent health rather than 1 year in their current state of health (utility < or =0.04). Patients were willing to trade significantly less time for a healthy life than their surrogates assumed they would (mean difference, 0.05; P=.007); 61 surrogates (20.3%) underestimated the patient's time-trade-off score by 0.25 (3 months of 12) or more. Patients willing to trade less time for better health were more likely to want resuscitation and other measures to extend life. Time-trade-off score correlated only modestly with quality-of-life rating (r=0.28) and inversely with depression score (r=-0.27), but there were few other clinical or demographic predictors of health values. When patients who survived were asked the time-trade-off question again at 1 year, they were willing to trade less time for better health than at baseline (mean difference, 0.04; P=.04). CONCLUSION: Very old hospitalized patients who could be interviewed were able, in most cases, to have their health values assessed using the time-trade-off technique. Most patients were unwilling to trade much time for excellent health, but preferences varied greatly. Because proxies and multivariable analyses cannot gauge health values of elderly hospitalized patients accurately, health values of the very old should be elicited directly from the patient.",JAMA,1998 Feb 4,United States,1998,90

The purpose of the present series of studies was to provide a more rigorous test of the hypothesis that certain personality attributes buffer the impact of daily hassles on health outcomes among female executives. Three studies were conducted to examine how perfectionism, humor, and optimism moderate the deleterious effects of daily hassles on self-esteem, burnout, and physical health. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that all attributes significantly moderated the relationship between daily hassles and self-esteem maintenance, emotional exhaustion, and physical illness. A fourth study examined the correlations between high levels of perfectionism, humor, and optimism and female executives' use of different coping strategies and orientations. The results provide implications for the early socialization and management training of female executives working in stressful environments.","Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs",1995 May,United States,1995,90
7996589,The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years.,"The term ""gender role"" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ""gender identity"" was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.",Journal of sex & marital therapy,1994 Fall,England,1994,90

Two types of questionnaires developed by the team are used for investigating the students' family and social status--one designed for the pupils and one--for the teachers and supervisors in the schools. The inquiry for the students contains 15 questions revealing family and school environment (family relations and problems; number of children and sequential number of the problem child; parents' education and employment; school training and curriculum; social contacts in the school; school results). The inquiry, engaging the class teachers, day and night supervisors in recovery schools, contains 19 questions. There are additional questions concerning students' specific learning difficulties as well. The results made it clear that parents' divorce is the most unfavorable family determinant for school maladjustment of students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders. Many other factors such as the poor educational qualification and social-professional status of the parents, children number, the sequential number of the problematic child additionally impedes the relationship with the parents, thus increasing the risk of school failure and the manifestations of school maladjustment. The determined peculiarities of the family environment of students with emotional disturbances and behavioral disorders suggest targeted psychocorrective work of the school psychologist individually with the student as well as with his/her family.",Central European journal of public health,1998 Nov,Czech Republic,1998,90
9438877,The Swedish Centenarian Study: a multidisciplinary study of five consecutive cohorts at the age of 100.,"UNLABELLED: Centenarians born 1887-91, who lived in southern Sweden were asked to participate in this multidisciplinary study (N = 164). Of the survivors (N = 143), 70 percent agreed (N = 100). The purpose was to describe the population from physical, social, and psychological points of view; to characterize centenarians with various health conditions and diverse degrees of autonomy and life satisfaction; and to identify factors at 100 years that predict future survival. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent were women, 25 percent lived in their own home, 37 percent in old age homes, and 38 percent in nursing homes. Socioeconomic status showed a similar distribution compared to nationally representative data. Fifty-two percent managed activities of daily living with or without minor assistance. The incidence of severe diseases was low. In 39 percent a disorder of the circulatory system was found. Thirty-nine percent (women) and 11 percent (men) had had at least one hip fracture. Twenty percent had good hearing and good vision. Twenty-seven percent were demented according to DSM III-R criteria. Means on cognitive tests (word-list, digit-span, learning, and memory) were lower compared to seventy to eighty year old groups. The variation in performance was extremely widespread. Personality profiles (MMPI) indicated that the centenarians were more responsible, capable, easygoing and less prone to anxiety than the population in general. Extensive neuropathological investigation revealed no major diseases or large lesions but mild through multiple changes. RESULTS suggest that centenarians are a special group genetically. A causal structure model emphasized body constitution, marital status, cognition and blood pressure as particularly important determinants for survival after 100 years.",International journal of aging & human development,1997,United States,1997,90
10564848,"[Determinants of quitting smoking in Catalonia, Spain].","OBJECTIVE: While trends in the prevalence of smoking and ex-smoking in Catalonia, Spain have been monitored, the characteristics of those smokers who quit have not been investigated. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the prevalence of cessation, or quit ratio, in Catalonia and to study its sociodemographic, life-style, and smoking correlates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data collected in the Catalan Health Interview Survey conducted in 1994. This is a cross-sectional study based on a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population of Catalonia. We included for analysis a total of 5,424 subjects (3,649 males and 1,775 females) who declared to be current smokers (2,335 males and 1,331 females) or past smokers (1,314 males and 444 females). We computed the crude and age-standardized quit ratios (QR) or prevalence of cessation, as well as the odds ratio (OR) of quitting smoking, according to gender and the variables studied. RESULTS: The age-standardized QR was 31. 8% for males and 30.9% for females and increased with age. The QR was, both in males and females, greater among married subjects, with higher socioeconomic status, and with healthy life-styles (moderate and heavy leisure physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption). The OR of quitting smoking was higher in heavy smokers (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 2.2-3.8; smokers of > 30 cigarettes/day vs. 1-10 cigarettes/day) in males, while it was < 1 for females of medium intensity, conforming a shaped curve rather than a linear trend (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.9, in heavy smokers). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a positive association in males and females between quitting smoking and increasing age, a higher socioeconomic level, heavy smoking, and healthy life-styles. The identification of these groups should facilitate the planning of successful interventions. Further effort is also necessary to target groups with low cessation rates, such as individuals in disadvantaged social classes and light smokers.",Gaceta sanitaria,1999 Sep-Oct,Spain,1999,90

12291071,Illegal immigration in the presence of labor unions.,"""This paper develops a general equilibrium framework of a two-sector economy which incorporates illegal immigration in the presence of labor unions. It demonstrates that stricter enforcement of immigration laws, by reducing the demand for or supply of illegal aliens, benefits all legal workers in the economy. The model is used to evaluate the impact of these policy changes on national income. Results indicate that national income does not necessarily fall when immigration controls are tightened. The existence of a union mitigates the negative welfare impact of a reduction in the number of illegal immigrants.""",International economic journal,1994 Summer,Korea (South),1994,90

One distinguishing feature of the article is that it breaks out and cross-classifies various classes of immigrants--numerically limited versus numerically exempt and new immigrant versus adjustment of status. A second distinguishing feature is that it utilizes a unique vector of variables relating to the presence and characteristics of various social programs in source countries. The models developed here emphasize the importance of both differential economic advantage and the ease with which a prospective migrant can transfer skills to the U.S. labor market. Hausman-Taylor instrumental variable estimates of the coefficients indicate that in addition to other factors, social programs in source countries are significant determinants of immigration to the USA.""

In addition, early sexual debut is eight times as likely among black boys as among non-Hispanic white boys. Children who use controlled substances at an early age are more than twice as likely to have sex before age 14 as those who do not, although the type of substance having an effect is different for girls (cigarettes) and boys (alcohol).

9623686,Asthma and allergies among children in West and East Germany: a comparison between Munster and Greifswald using the ISAAC phase I protocol. International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood.,"The study aim was to compare the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in children living in Munster, western Germany, and Greifswald, eastern Germany, and to investigate associations of several characteristics and exposures with atopic disease symptoms. In 1994 and 1995, questionnaire information was gathered on 5-8 yr old children (n=3,741 in Munster and n=2,857 in Greifswald) and 12-15 yr olds (n=4,003 and n= 3,153, respectively) using the phase I protocol of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The 12 month period prevalences of reported atopic disease symptoms in 5-8 yr olds were generally higher in Munster than in Greifswald, whereas only a few prevalence differences were observed in 12-15 yr olds. In both age groups the reported lifetime prevalences of asthma, hay fever and eczema were lower in Greifswald. Indoor exposures such as wood or coal heating and feather bedding were negatively associated with symptoms, whereas exposures such as truck traffic in a residential street or active smoking were positively associated with symptoms. Wood or coal heating could partly explain the prevalence difference of allergic rhinitis symptoms among 5-8 yr olds between Munster and Greifswald. The findings provide additional evidence for a role of several characteristics and exposures as potential determinants of asthma and allergies in children.",The European respiratory journal,1998 Apr,England,1998,90
9690286,[Risk behaviors of intravenous drug users: are females taking more risks of HIV and HCV transmission?].,"BACKGROUND: This work was aimed at identifying differences in HIV and HCV risk behaviors among intravenous drug users (IDUs) according to the gender and their determinants. METHODS: IDUs over 18 years, having had sexual intercourse and able to answer the questionnaire were interviewed in 10 drug abuse treatment centers or social institutions using a questionnaire adapted from the one used in the survey of sexual lifestyle in France. RESULTS: Over 612 eligible IDUs, 595 completed the questionnaire (women: 29%);37% had multiple partners with no difference according to the gender; 14% of the women and 7% of the men reported trading sex. More women reported inconsistent condom use (46% vs. 55%) and inconsistent clean equipment use (65% vs. 73%). A younger age, independently associated to sharing equipment (men: OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.90-0.99; women: OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.85-0.99) and inconsistent HIV serology testing, independently associated to inconsistent condom use (men: OR = 3.36; 95% CI = 2.02-5.60; women: OR = 10.72; 95% CI = 3.18-36.18), were the only risk markers common to both genders. For women, being HIV negative increased the risk of inconsistent condom use. Low educational level increased the risk of inconsistent clean equipment use. No risk marker among those analyzed was associated to having had multiple partners. For men, low socioeconomic status markers, a steady sexual partner or not living in couple and educational level were associated with sexual risk behaviors (inconsistent condom use and having multiple partners); low socioeconomic status markers were associated with injecting risk behaviors (inconsistent clean equipment use and sharing). CONCLUSIONS: Women were more likely to have both sexual and injecting risk behaviors; their significant risk markers are less numerous thus harm reduction could be more difficult than for men.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1998 Jun,France,1998,90
8478160,Comparison of adaptation to the home culture of Japanese children and adolescents returned from overseas sojourn.,"A questionnaire based on the MMPI was administered to Japanese children aged between 6 and 18 years who had returned from an overseas sojourn of more than one year's duration (N = 1941) and a matched control group who had no overseas experiences (N = 1354). Overall females had more difficulty with friends, and scored higher on both psychological and physical symptoms. The older children had more complaints about life in Japan, difficulty with friends and physical and psychological problems. The differences between the returnee and control group were less in the age range between 7 and 9, but the overseas experience seemed to have positive effects between the ages of 10 to 15. The longer the children stayed overseas, the more they had complaints about life in Japan and difficulty with friends, and less negative attitudes towards overseas life. Children who had multiple overseas experiences had more problems such as anxiety, depression and mental complaints. Children's developmental stages and the amount of exposure to the foreign culture are therefore important determinants of their readjustment. The expectations of parents and the home culture to the returnee children, gender, and emphasis on academic achievement, must also be taken into account.",The International journal of social psychiatry,1993 Spring,England,1993,90
9228591,Determinants of HIV seroconversion in injection drug users during a period of rising prevalence in Vancouver.,"To identify determinants of HIV seroconversion among injection drug users (IDUs) during a period of rising prevalence, a case-control investigation was conducted. Cases were IDUs with a new positive test after 1 January 1994, and a negative test within the prior 18 months. Controls required 2 negative tests during the same period. Subjects completed a questionnaire on demographic, psychosocial, and behavioural factors. Eighty-nine cases and 192 controls were similar with respect to gender, age, ethnicity and inter-test interval. Multivariate analyses of events during the inter-test interval showed borrowing syringes (adj. OR = 2.96; P < 0.006), unstable housing (adj. OR = 2.01; P = 0.03) and injecting > or = 4 times daily (adj. OR = 1.71; P = 0.06) to be independently associated with seroconversion. Protective associations were demonstrated for sex with opposite gender (adj. OR = 0.36; P = 0.001) and tetrahydrocannabinol use (adj. OR = 0.41; P = 0.001).

Although only imperfect proxies for breast-feeding practices and other potentially confounding factors are available for this population, the results suggest that the association between previous interval length and infant mortality in this population is not solely, or primarily, a function of differences in breast-feeding behaviour or socioeconomic status.

1480790,[From epidemiology to social epidemiology in dentistry. The example of caries].,"Today, we know the caries aetiology and prevention rather well. We also know that caries-related levels of dental health are inequitably distributed among social classes: on the average, disadvantaged people experience higher DMFS then privileged people. This difference can be explained by a differential access to health care, which can be shown by the study of components of the DMFS index: proportion of filled surfaces (F/DMFS), proportion of missing surfaces (M/DMFS), and proportion of recurrent caries (secondary caries/filled surfaces). Though we are able to describe the social distribution of levels of dental care, we cannot ""explain"" the differences we observe. The explanation of those differences defines the field of social epidemiology. This consists in determining the social aetiology of diseases, starting from social determinants of attitudes and behaviors influencing health.",Revue belge de medecine dentaire,1992,Belgium,1992,90
10560326,Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation.,"Human differentiation on the basis of gender is a fundamental phenomenon that affects virtually every aspect of people's daily lives. This article presents the social cognitive theory of gender role development and functioning. It specifies how gender conceptions are constructed from the complex mix of experiences and how they operate in concert with motivational and self-regulatory mechanisms to guide gender-linked conduct throughout the life course. The theory integrates psychological and sociostructural determinants within a unified conceptual structure. In this theoretical perspective, gender conceptions and roles are the product of a broad network of social influences operating interdependently in a variety of societal subsystems. Human evolution provides bodily structures and biological potentialities that permit a range of possibilities rather than dictate a fixed type of gender differentiation. People contribute to their self-development and bring about social changes that define and structure gender relationships through their agentic actions within the interrelated systems of influence.",Psychological review,1999 Oct,United States,1999,90

In bivariate analyses, respondents who reported having had sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs were no less likely than respondents with no such experience to report consistent use of condoms, and having had sex under the influence of substances was positively related to lifetime condom use. Multivariate analyses that included gender and urban area as predictors yielded similar findings.

10326046,"Smoking, drinking, and other life style factors and cognitive function in men in the Caerphilly cohort.","STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the cognitive function in a large, ongoing cohort study of older men, and to identify associations with social and lifestyle factors. DESIGN: A cross sectional study of cognitive function was conducted within the Caerphilly Prospective Study of Heart Disease and stroke. SETTING: The Caerphilly Study was originally set up in 1979-83 when the men were 45-59 years of age. Extensive data are available on a wide range of lifestyle and other factors of possible relevance to cognitive decline. Associations between some of these and cognitive function are reported. PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of 1870 men aged 55-69 years. MAIN RESULTS: Age, social class, medication, and mood were found to be powerful determinants of performance. Self report data on the involvement of the men in leisure pursuits were examined by factor analysis. This indicated that the more intellectual leisure pursuits are the most strongly linked with performance. A measure of social contact showed a weak positive association with the test scores. Current cigarette smokers gave lower test cognitive function scores than either men who had never smoked, or ex-smokers. There was however no evidence of any gradient in function with the total lifetime consumption of tobacco. The disparity between these two data sets suggests that there had been prior selection of men who had originally started to smoke, but more particularly selection of those who later quit smoking. There was no significant association between alcohol consumption and cognitive function, though ex-drinkers had markedly lower test scores than either current drinkers or men who had never drunk alcohol. This seemed probably to be a consequence of an high prevalence of illness among the ex-drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: Age and social class show strong associations with cognitive function. Leisure persuits and social contact are also both positively associated. Neither tobacco smoking nor the drinking of alcohol seem to be associated with cognitive function, though there is evidence suggestive of self selection of both men who had never smoked and ex-smokers.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1999 Jan,England,1999,90

DATA AND METHOD: Cross-sectional population survey including questions on social background, body-height and health, and retrospective questions on childhood living conditions. The data derive from a representative Survey on Living Conditions collected by Statistics Finland in 1994. The response rate was 73%. Male and female respondents > or =20 years were included in the analysis (N = 8212). Statistical methods include regression analysis and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Body-height was strongly associated with year of birth, region, childhood living conditions and education among adult men and women. Body-height was also associated with limiting long-standing illness and perceived health as below good. Tall men had the best health and short men the poorest health. Among women the association of body-height with health differed from men, as tall women showed high levels of limiting long-standing illness, notably musculo-skeletal diseases. Adjusting for the background variables weakened but did not abolish the association between poor health and short stature among men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Short stature is associated with poor health among Finnish men and women. A non-linear association among women was found for musculo-skeletal diseases. The studied social background factors explained only little of the association between body-height and health.",International journal of epidemiology,1999 Oct,England,1999,90
2002204,Academic underachievement in children with epilepsy.,"Academic achievement was studied in 78 children with epilepsy, ages 5 to 13 years, to determine how seizures, treatment of seizures, and sociocultural factors influence academic achievement. Cognitive abilities were assessed with either the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised. Achievement was measured with the Peabody Individual Achievement Tests. Achievement scores were corrected for cognitive ability (IQ), and underachievement was defined as achievement score 1/2 standard deviation or more below IQ. Information regarding seizure history (severity, duration) and treatment with anticonvulsant drugs was obtained. In addition, the family was extensively interviewed regarding the child's environment, behavior, and demographic background. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) scale was completed on a home visit. Underachievement was frequent, ranging from 16% (Reading Recognition) to 50% (General Knowledge), but there was no relationship between severity or duration of seizure disorder or total exposure to anticonvulsant medications and achievement. Major determinants of achievement included subscales of the HOME scale, age (older children more likely to be underachieving), and parental education. An equal proportion of newly diagnosed and/or untreated subjects were underachieving compared to those with longstanding epilepsy and anticonvulsant drug treatment.",Journal of child neurology,1991 Jan,United States,1991,90
8735376,"Self-perceptions, motivation, and school functioning of low-income maltreated and comparison children.","Maltreated children are at risk for disturbances and delays in their socioemotional and scholastic functioning. This study examined the impact of child maltreatment and age on perceptions of competence, and the relations among perceived competence, motivation, and school functioning. The sample included 76 school children living in poverty, approximately two-thirds of whom had been victims of child maltreatment. Results indicated that both maltreated and nonmaltreated children exhibited maladaptive motivational orientations toward scholastic tasks and poor academic performance, supporting the idea that threats to scholastic functioning reside as much within the ecology of poverty as in that of maltreatment. Over and above the general effects of poverty, maltreatment was found to disrupt the psychological processes accounting for children's scholastic performance. Results revealed that younger maltreated children (6- and 7-year-olds) reported more inflated self-perceptions of competence and social acceptance than nonmaltreated children. In contrast, older maltreated children (8- through 11-year-olds) reported lower perceived social acceptance than nonmaltreated children. Among older nonmaltreated children, perceived competence was positively related to teacher's ratings of their effort, intrinsic motivation, and grades. For older maltreated children, these relations among self-perceptions and school functioning were in the opposite direction from those of nonmaltreated children, suggesting that the determinants of academic engagement are different for maltreated and nonmaltreated children.",Child abuse & neglect,1996 May,England,1996,90
8211276,Determinants of regional differences in lung cancer mortality in The Netherlands.,"Although regional differences in lung cancer mortality are likely to be attributable to regional differences in tobacco smoking, studies in various countries found only weak relationships. This paper aimed at explaining regional differences in lung cancer mortality in the Netherlands. In a first step, clues for the role of smoking were obtained from a detailed description of regional mortality differences. These differences were found to be strongly determined by cohort effects: they vary between birth cohorts, and have been stable for over 30 years. Regional mortality differences reflect a diffusion of the lung cancer epidemic from high-income regions to low-income regions. These findings are suggestive of a relationship with regional differences in trends in cigarette smoking. In a second step, by means of multiple regression analysis, mortality differences in 1980-84 were related to available data on cigarette smoking and two other possible risk factors: work in transport and manufacturing industry, and air contamination. The independent variables referred to the 1970s. Positive associations with various smoking measures were found for women, but for men the associations were weak or non-existent. Mortality differences among men 45-64 years were associated with work in transport and manufacturing industry. Strong associations with air contamination were found for men and women 65 years and older. Additional analysis showed that regional differences in lung cancer among old men were strongly associated with smoking in 1930, i.e. half a century before. Changes in the regional pattern of tobacco consumption between 1930 and 1970 explain why smoking in 1970 is not associated with mortality differences in the 1980s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Sep,England,1993,90
7811684,Determinants of condom use by Australian secondary school students.,"PURPOSE: To identify factors that are associated with condom use to aid in the understanding of how to change the behavior of those young people who have sex without using condoms. METHODS: The article reports data from 932 sexually active grade 10-12 students from a sample of 72 public secondary schools in seven Australian states and territories. The data were collected using a cross-sectional, self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: Boys were more likely than girls to report that a condom was used the last time they had sex. For boys and girls, communication with a partner about avoiding infection with HIV/STDs, the belief that more peers use condoms, and a higher perceived risk of becoming infected with HIV/STDs were associated with using a condom, as was lower knowledge of STDs. The use of oral contraception and the unavailability of condoms were reported by the students as prominent reasons for non-use of condoms. Number of sexual partners in the past year and type of relationship with partner on the most recent occasion were not associated with condom use. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents are more concerned with unwanted pregnancy than with disease prevention. School students more at risk are not more likely to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from HIV/STDs.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1994 Sep,United States,1994,90

This controversy includes both the importance of diet as a precursor of an unfavorable lipid profile, and the potential importance of social and psychological factors in determining lipid values. These questions were addressed in a study of serum lipids in urban Brazil.

9793892,Characteristics of responders and non-responders in an infant feeding study.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have fully investigated and described the characteristics of non-responders in infant breast feeding studies. Examination of the characteristics of non-responders enhances this understanding and provides information on the representativeness of the sample actually investigated. METHODS: As part of a larger local longitudinal study, couples whose babies were due to be born during the three months of the study in the autumn of 1995, at two local maternity hospitals, were approached by midwives to participate in the study of infant feeding patterns and determinants, including interviews, questionnaires and postal survey. From the 648 eligible mothers, 91 (14 per cent) were not approached, 233 (35.9 per cent) consented but were not interviewed, 256 (39.5 per cent) consented and were interviewed and 68 (10.5 per cent) refused to participate (non-responders) in the longitudinal study. To make a comparison between the 'responders' (i.e. the 233 who consented but were not interviewed and the 256 who consented and were interviewed) and non-responders (the 68 who refused to consent), appropriate data were collected on their socio-demographic characteristics, their feeding intentions and their feeding behaviour. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed a number of significant differences between responders and non-responders. However, log-linear analysis of these differences indicated that the main factors that differentiated between responders and non-responders were social class, smoking habit and actual feeding behaviour. When comparing the feeding intention at the time of 'booking', the non-responders compared with the responders were less likely to intend to breastfeed and more likely to be uncertain about their feeding intentions. Following delivery non-responders compared with responders were more likely to bottle feed their babies. By the time of discharge, of the non-responders, 83.6 per cent were bottle feeding in comparison with 47.3 per cent of responders who were also bottle feeding. CONCLUSIONS: In this study non-responders were found to be more similar to bottle-feeding responders than to breastfeeding responders. Furthermore, non-responders were more likely to be smokers, from lower social class and to bottle feed. This study also showed that the non-responders were more undecided about their feeding intention at the time of the booking visit.

10412999,Cognitive strategies and self-esteem as predictors of brace-wear noncompliance in patients with idiopathic scoliosis and kyphosis.,"Psychological determinants of brace-wear compliance were analyzed among 113 patients who used a brace because of an adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (92%), kyphosis (5%), or both (3%). The results showed that noncompliant girls did not expect to succeed in dealing with scoliosis and that they were anxious about the possibility of failure. They also had low self-esteem and did not seek social support from other people. Noncompliant boys, in contrast, had high self-esteem and high achievement success expectation. Among patients with a short time of brace use, low compliance was best predicted by low amount of reflective thinking and a good body-image. In turn, among patients who had used the brace for >6 months, low compliance was best predicted by high amount of reflective thinking, poor body-image, low social success expectation, and low master orientation in social behavior. Only sleeping problems predicted compliance across gender and the time of brace use: the more the patients experienced sleeping problems, the less they used the brace.",Journal of pediatric orthopedics,1999 Jul-Aug,United States,1999,90
10120999,The heart of the matter.,"Coronary heart disease deaths have declined in New Zealand, as in other Western countries, during the past two decades. This is probably due to a combination of population lifestyle changes and improved treatment of the disease. However, the social class gradient for coronary disease has reversed and it is now more common in lower socio-economic groups who are increasingly disadvantaged in our community. Socioeconomic factors are powerful, primary determinants not only of coronary disease but also of many of the other health problems outlined in the New Zealand Health Charter. Policy making and health services delivery shape societal conditions essential for true health. These factors are considered in relation to the spectrum of human communication and the current transitional changes in our health system.",New Zealand health & hospital,1992 Jul-Aug,New Zealand,1992,90
2236366,Genetic and environmental determinants of the lability of trait neuroticism and the symptoms of anxiety and depression.,"A genetic analysis was conducted on trait neuroticism and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a five-wave study of 462 twin pairs. Models that assessed the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors to the lability (within-individual variability over time) of these measures were fitted to the data. Previous results concerning the substantial genetic involvement in the level of neuroticism and symptoms were confirmed. However, it was found that neither genes nor the shared environment of the twins was a significant cause of lability of these measures. An attempt was therefore made to identify aspects of individuals' environments that might be responsible for lability of neuroticism and symptoms. Adverse life events were found to predict variability of symptoms, but not of neuroticism. The availability of close social ties or having affectionless control in childhood did not contribute to lability.",Psychological medicine,1990 Aug,England,1990,90

Research shows a relationship between psychotic symptom levels and several intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental factors. These determinants are incorporated into an etiologic causal model of psychotic symptoms based on a vulnerability-stress framework.

Finally, a research agenda to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention model is described, and related methodologic issues are considered.",Image--the journal of nursing scholarship,1994 Fall,United States,1994,90
8822021,Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.,"The proceedings of the inaugural scientific meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) are summarized. The primary objective of the meeting was to foster the exchange of information on the effects of nicotine and tobacco use, as well as factors which influence their use, drawing from biological, behavioral and social sciences. Much of this research can be viewed as a tale of ""two"" drugs--nicotine as a key to an important public health problem, and nicotine as a classical tool of physiological and pharmacological research. A historical overview of research on ""both"" drugs is provided first. Public policy alternatives for reducing the prevalence of tobacco use have been derived in part from basic and clinical research results and are briefly outlined. Evidence for genetic determinants on nicotine use and effects is presented using data from twin studies and from molecular genetic research with humans and animals. Consistent with this research, there is evidence of individual differences in pharmacokinetics and effects of nicotine, which could account for differences in smoking behavior and nicotine dependence. Finally, recent developments in the therapeutic uses of nicotine and novel nicotinic agonists with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome and ulcerative colitis are presented. Overall, the research presented at the meeting demonstrated the vast diversity of areas of study involving nicotine and tobacco, as well as the rich opportunities for cross-communication among researchers from different disciplines.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",1996 Jan,England,1996,90
10081240,Marriage structure and contraception in Niger.,"Analysis of the 1992 Niger Demographic and Health Survey showed that although roughly two-thirds of both polygamous and monogamous women approve of birth control, polygamous wives are less likely than monogamous wives to discuss family size or birth control with their husband or to plan on using birth control. The study suggests that characteristics of polygamous couples have caused polygamous women to be more resistant to birth control use than monogamous women. The polygamous women tended to be married to older men who had not gone to primary school and who desired more children than monogamous husbands. The influence of marital structure is not significantly associated with intention to use birth control when the husband's age and the wife's ideal number of children were controlled for in the multivariate logistic regression model suggesting that background social factors may be more influential. In fact, educational level and age at first marriage were significantly associated with attitudes towards birth control and also with marital structure.",Journal of biosocial science,1999 Jan,England,1999,90
12319653,"Internal migration, earnings, and the importance of self-selection.","This paper analyzes the impact of internal migration on earnings within the human capital model framework. Since migrants constitute a non-random sample of population, the endogenous nature of migration decision warrants necessary correction for the selectivity bias in their earnings function. The Mincer-type earnings model is thus augmented to determine the extent of this bias. Besides estimating the standard Mincerian earnings model, the paper also attempts to verify the learn-as-you-go proposition by introducing migration duration variables in the earnings model. Based on the household level Population, Labor Force, and Migration (1979-80) survey data, the analysis yields the following important conclusions: (i) the data allowed a meaningful estimation of Mincerian earnings function for migrants and non-migrants; (ii) the level of schooling was one of the important determinants of the distribution of income both for migrants and nonmigrants--the four categorical variables of education were in general statistically significant with expected signs, implying that the hypothesis of a positive relationship between income and education was accepted; (iii) the rates of return to education improved systematically with higher levels of education, thus confirming the notion that education serves as a signalling device; (iv) the age-income profile was almost linear for migrants but showed concavity for nonmigrants; (v) the presence of sample-selection was observed for migrants; and (vi) even after controlling for the influence of personal characteristics, i.e., education and experience, the long-standing migrants earned relatively more at the destination than the more recent migrants.",Pakistan development review,1994 Autumn,Pakistan,1994,90

However, the link between panic/agoraphobia and Axis II disorders does not appear to be specific because (1) general features such as neuroticism, stress, dysphoric mood, and interpersonal sensitivity, rather than duration and severity of panic attacks and phobias, emerge as unique predictors or determinants of personality disorder; and (2) similar personality profiles are obtained in a heterogenous population of psychiatric outpatients or patients with social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depression.",The Psychiatric clinics of North America,1990 Dec,United States,1990,90
1619258,Predicting continued use of marijuana among adolescents: the relative influence of drug-specific and social context factors.,"Most research on the determinants of adolescent drug use has focused on predictors of either initiation or current use. Little attention has been given to the determinants of continued use of drugs after initiation, even though some researchers have found that the consequences of continued use are more serious than those associated with experimental or occasional use. In this study, a longitudinal sample of 456 secondary and high school students who had already tried marijuana was used to examine the determinants of continued use of marijuana. Nearly 38 percent of those who had tried marijuana continued using, according to the definition operationalized in this study. Potential predictor measures were grouped in a drug-specific domain and a social context domain, and their effects on continued use, controlling for background characteristics, were examined in logistic regression models. Results showed that only the drug-specific domain had a statistically significant effect on the likelihood of continued use. Students who felt that the adverse physical and psychological effects of marijuana were not very important reasons for discontinuing use and those who had gotten stoned during their experimental stage of use were the most likely to continue use after initiation. The results suggest that the perceived physical and psychological effects of the drug are more important determinants of continued use than are social factors or benefits related to use. Any relationships between social factors and continued use are mediated by the perceived effects and risks of the drug.",Journal of health and social behavior,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90

8303014,A case study in the use of race and ethnicity in public health surveillance.,"Increased attention has been focused on the use of racial and ethnic categories in public health research and surveillance in recent years. This attention, however, has done more to increase the collective awareness of the difficulties inherent in these classification schemes than to resolve either the theoretical or practical problems. It has been recognized for many years that health outcomes for a particular ethnic population must be seen as an interaction between genetically determined factors and socially mediated exposures. The operational meaning of these concepts remains poorly defined, however. Although the general biologic construct of race and ethnicity appears straightforward, appearance is deceiving and the technical requirements that allow formulation of a rigorous and objective working definition have never been fully developed. The social factors that influence ethnic health differentials are perhaps better understood in practical terms; measurement of many of the relevant variables remains difficult, however. In this article an attempt is made to outline the implications of the new developments in molecular biology for the concept of race, and to provide an illustrative example of the continued evolution of the social determinants of ethnicity.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1994 Jan-Feb,United States,1994,90

2019096,Determinants of psychiatric rehospitalization: a social area analysis.,"The purpose of this paper is to develop an analytic framework and methodology for estimating the demand for psychiatric hospitalization in state facilities, either new admissions or readmissions of clients from the Community Services Boards (CSBs) of Virginia. The combination of community and organizational factors with inpatient characteristics for the CSBs can help identify pertinent predictors of psychiatric hospitalization. Review of the literature on psychiatric epidemiology shows that the predictors of psychiatric hospitalization can be classified into four major dimensions including community resources, socio-demographic factors, CSB client characteristics, and CSB organizational factors. It is postulated that the rates of first admissions and readmissions to state facilities are influenced by four dimensions. Furthermore, the variation in readmissions rates is contingent upon previous first admission rates and the average length of stays in state institutions while other conditions-such as community resources and demographics, CSB client mix, and CSB organizational factors-are simultaneously considered. The data were compiled from multiple sources. A path analytic model, using a linear structural relations program (LISREL VI), was validated. After the model was carefully fitted, the estimation equations for the rates of first admissions and readmissions were finalized. The estimates for psychiatric hospitalization, both first- and re-admissions, were made for each of the study CSBs.",Community mental health journal,1991 Feb,United States,1991,90
9195528,Work and disability status of persons with fibromyalgia.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and determinants of self-reported work disability in persons with fibromyalgia (FM). METHODS: A longitudinal, multicenter survey of 1604 patients with FM from 6 centers with diverse socioeconomic characteristics was begun in 1988. Assessments were by self-report questionnaire and telephone contact, and included work and disability events that occurred before and after 1988. Comparative analyses were performed on the entire data set and, separately, on the Wichita data set. RESULTS: More than 16% of patients reported receiving US Social Security disability (SSD) payments (highest center rate 35.7%; lowest center rate 6.3%) compared to 2.2% of the US population (US Social Security Administration data) and 28.9% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis seen at the Wichita outpatient rheumatology clinic. Overall, 26.5% reported receiving at least one form of disability payment when SSD and other sources of disability payments were considered. In Wichita, less than 25% of SSD awards were made specifically for FM, but after 1988 that figure increased to 46.4%. Work disability was greatest at the San Antonio and Los Angeles centers. Multivariate predictors (correlates) included pain, Health Assessment Questionnaire disability, and unmarried status. In addition, more than 70% of patients reporting being disabled did receive disability payments. On the other hand, 64% reported being able to work all or most days, and more than 70% were employed or were homemakers. CONCLUSION: Although most patients (64%) report being able to work, we found high rates of self-reported work disability awards among persons with FM followed in 6 rheumatology centers. But we also found great variability among centers as to awards and as to self-reported work ability. Center differences in work disability might reflect clinic referral patterns, physician beliefs, or socioeconomic status.",The Journal of rheumatology,1997 Jun,Canada,1997,90
8976599,Social determinants of loneliness among older Americans.,"To further understand loneliness among older persons, a conceptual model, predicated on a social-support perspective, was examined. Results were based on 1,071 participants in the congregate and home-delivered meal programs of the Senior Citizens Nutrition and Activities Program in Hillsborough County, Florida. A series of stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that loneliness was greater among men, those with no children, those with no friends, those more physically disabled, those who subjectively felt that their health was poorer, and those who subjectively felt that their economic condition was inadequate. Not related directly to loneliness but with indirect influence were age, race, education, marital status, and poverty status. Those variables with no direct or indirect effect included rural or urban location, identification of emotional closeness with existing children or friends, and living alone. Theoretically, the results do not fully support the social-support perspective but point to the impact of a broad spectrum of demographic, health, economic, and social factors.","Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs",1996 Nov,United States,1996,90

One-year follow-up of a National Tobacco Quit and Win Contest in Sweden.,"The first nation-wide Quit and Win Contest in Sweden was held in 1988 with 12,840 participants. This corresponds to a participant rate of 6.4 per 1,000 daily tobacco users in Sweden. In order to follow up the long-term effects of cessation and to analyse the determinants for successful cessation, a panel (n = 946) of randomized participants were followed-up at 6 and 12 months with a mailed questionnaire. This gave a complete set of data for 557 (panel) respondents. Available baseline data from the participants' entry forms included sex, age, occupation, specific tobacco habits, quitting attempts during the previous year, and place of residence. At the 12-month follow-up 21% had been tobacco-free for the whole year. In addition 9% of the participants relapsed into tobacco-use, then quit again and were tobacco-free at the 12-month follow-up. The success rate for those participants (14%) who used smokeless tobacco (oral snuff) was similar to that of smokers. The logistic regression showed a significantly better prognosis for success among those without any earlier quitting attempts during the previous year (OR 2.35), if the subjects participated of their own volition rather than having been recruited by a non-tobacco user (OR 1.74), and if they were married/co-habiting (OR 1.92), the results were also significantly improved. The results also show that as a population-based method, Quit and Win produced many successful tobacco quitters, and one year after the contest one-fifth of the participants were still abstinent.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1995 Sep,Sweden,1995,90

8990587,The burden of aging: a theoretical framework for understanding the shifting balance of caregiving and care receiving as cohorts age.,"Unless changes occur in the way cohorts age, the future aging of the population will make the burden of caring for older persons an increasingly salient political issue in American society. There is no reason, however, why aging in the future should replicate the pattern of aging that currently exists. A helpful step toward understanding what social changes would reduce the burden that aging cohorts place on society is the development of aging theory. This article develops a theoretical framework that explicates factors determining the level of care given and care received by cohorts moving through different stages of later life. Four proximate determinants of caregiving and three proximate determinants of care receiving are specified. Once the proximate determinants are identified, attention is focused on social changes that could reduce the burden of aging produced by cohorts aging through later life in the future.",The Gerontologist,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90

This article addresses the question whether or not individual past and current life-course experiences become increasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into marriage across female birth cohorts, and yet become decreasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into cohabitation across female birth cohorts. This question is examined using a non-proportional hazard model. Empirical evidence supports this hypothesis strongly, in that both past determinants such as family size or religion and current life-course determinants such as work or education change in their impact on cohabitation and marriage across birth cohorts.""",European sociological review,1996 May,England,1996,90
24203500,Behavioral research on diabetes at the Oregon Research Institute.,"This article overviews the scope and progression of research on behavioral aspects of diabetes over the past decade at the Oregon Research Institute. Our research team has investigated several topics including: (a) conceptual models of self-management; (b) social learning factors associated with regimen adherence; (c) individual and group-based interventions to enhance diabetes self-management; (d) rates and determinants of participation in diabetes education; (e) determinants of glycemic control; and (f) patient models (beliefs) about diabetes and its treatment.We have employed a social learning theory approach to diabetes management, and over the past decade have come to adopt a broader public health perspective that addresses environmental influences on diabetes self-management at multiple levels (e.g. family, health care system, community). This approach has led us to conclude that increased attention should be devoted to the most prevalent types of diabetes, to the behavioral issues that create the most difficulty for the greatest number of patients, and to the social environment in which patients live and diabetes management education takes place. Our research focus has evolved over time and currently emphasizes: (a) assessment and tailoring of intervention based upon the patient's perspective; (b) patient-provider interactions; and (c) brief, low-cost, and system-wide interventions that can be implemented in medical office settings.

In bivariate analyses, respondents who reported having had sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs were no less likely than respondents with no such experience to report consistent use of condoms, and having had sex under the influence of substances was positively related to lifetime condom use. Multivariate analyses that included gender and urban area as predictors yielded similar findings.

8690737,Determinants of contraceptive use in Morocco: stopping behaviour in traditional populations.,"The determinants of modern contraceptive use in traditional populations are analysed in married women aged 30-44 living in the province of Marrakech (Morocco). Women who have never used contraception have smaller family sizes than those who do: the number of live children (or live births) is the variable with maximum predictive power on contraceptive use, while child mortality is the main inhibiting factor. The probability of contraceptive use increases with female age at marriage and decreases with the woman's age, indicating a generational change in reproductive behaviour. The socioeconomic variables education, employment and residence, have no significant independent predictive character on contraceptive use, although the interaction between education and residence does. The paper evaluates the hypothesis that traditional populations in the initial phase of their demographic transition resort to modern contraception in order to stop childbearing, when they have reached a desired number of children, rather than to space births or reduce their fertility.",Journal of biosocial science,1996 Jan,England,1996,90
1473867,Time costs and informal social support as determinants of differences between black and white families in the provision of long-term care.,"This paper presents an economic model that predicts the observed racial difference in the mix of informal home and nursing home services used for long-term care by black versus white families. A cause of this difference in services used is a difference between black and white families in the relative prices they pay for particular services. Each group uses relatively more of the relatively less expensive (for that group) form of long-term care. The model indicates three specific hypotheses. The empirical analysis focuses on the Differential Opportunity Cost of Informal Caregiver Time hypothesis. Based on data from the 1982 and 1984 National Long-Term Care Surveys, two sets of results consistent with though not direct tests of this hypothesis are presented.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",1992 Winter,United States,1992,90

Most previous research on the topic has focused on LBW as a single entity, and without using a causal framework for analysis. The present study examines the determinants of race differences in the two main components of LBW--preterm birth (PRETERM) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)-within a partially causal framework that includes social and proximate explanatory variables. The data come from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth. This study asks, first, through what intervening variables do race and other exogenous sociodemographic variables operate to raise the risk of these adverse pregnancy outcomes? Second, what are the determinants of the two components of LBW when all explanatory variables are included in the model? The findings reveal differences in how race (and other exogenous variables) act through downstream variables to affect PRETERM and IUGR, as well as differences in the net determinants of these pregnancy outcomes. The models are better able to account statistically for race differences in IUGR (which is explained by intervening sociodemographic, attitude, and behavior variables) than in PRETERM (which is explained partly by intervening health variables).",Demography,1993 Aug,United States,1993,90

The factors studied were structured according to a theoretical model of coping with cancer. Reviewed studies have shown that factors most frequently evaluated were depression, anxiety, hopelessness/helplessness, hostility, marital status and social involvement. Mainly inconsistent results were found. The strongest evidence for a relationship between psychosocial variables and prognosis was found for social involvement/social support; in 7 of 15 studies a positive relationship was demonstrated, while no negative associations were found. Coping styles e.g., fighting spirit and stoic acceptance, and severe/stressful life events were found to have no conclusive influence on the length of survival. Important determinants of the coping model, such as uncertainty and information given by the specialist were not studied as possible predictors of survival and/or relapse free period. Among the factors that showed no correlation at all was multidimensional health locus of control. For the inconsistent findings, a considerable number of methodologic shortcomings with respect to study design, sample size, measure and statistical analysis are enumerated.",Patient education and counseling,1999 Jul,Ireland,1999,90

This study represents an initial attempt to investigate high-risk alcohol and drug use situations in a sample of dually diagnosed individuals. Thirty men and women with both a serious mental illness and an alcohol use or drug use disorder were recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit and completed questionnaires assessing high-risk alcohol and drug use situations psychiatric symptomatology, and psychological symptoms that trigger substance use. Although the alcohol and drug groups did not differ significantly in the frequency of self-reported high-risk situations for substance use, effect size analyses suggest that six of eight comparisons would demonstrate statistically significant differences with a larger sample size. Both groups reported using substances most frequently when feeling anxiety or depressive symptoms rather than psychotic symptoms.

Using two waves of data (collected in 1985 and 1987), cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses focused on the effects of five sets of factors (demographic, community integration/network, AIDS-related loss, individual, and health) on satisfaction with three types of support (emotional, informational, and practical). Personal acceptance of one's gay identity and talking to family members about AIDS showed the strongest positive associations with concurrent measures of support and changes in support satisfaction over the two-year period. Conversely, depression and number of HIV symptoms were negatively associated with cross-sectional support and support changes. Family knowledge of respondents' homosexuality interacted with HIV symptoms, such that knowledge was negatively associated with support among those experiencing greater numbers of HIV symptoms. Findings suggest that those most in need of support may be the least satisfied with the support they receive. Family appear to have the potential to be particularly helpful or especially harmful to gay men trying to cope with the AIDS crisis.",Journal of health and social behavior,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90
10933632,Variables independently associated with self-reported obesity in the European Union.,"OBJECTIVE: The rapid increase in obesity rates over recent years suggest that cultural and societal influences are affecting the adjustment in the energy balance equation in addition to other physiopathological or genetic determinants. Therefore, a pan-EU study was carried out to explore the influence of sociodemographic factors as well as some attitudes (smoking and exercise) on the prevalence of obesity in the adult population of all 15 member states of the EU. DESIGN: Overall, a sample of 15,239 individuals aged 15 years and upwards in the EU completed the questionnaire. Subject selection was quota-controlled to make the sample nationally representative following a multistage stratified cluster sampling. Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: From the EU average results, it can be seen that only about half of the EU population (48%) is within the normal weight range, while the obesity (BMI > or = 30 kg m(-2)) prevalence was about 10% in the EU and the overweight prevalence was 36.6% and 25.6% among men and women, respectively. UK subjects had the highest prevalence of obesity (12%), while Italians, French and Swedes had the lowest levels of obesity (about 7%). Concerning age and social class interactions, logistic regression analysis showed that high social class and younger individuals in all groups had a lower odds ratio for obesity prevalence. People with a higher level of education are less likely to be obese, while the interaction between educational levels and obesity was different for men and women. A low participation in various leisure-time physical activities, the lack of interest (precontemplation) in being involved in exercise/physical activity and the increasing number of hours sitting down at work appear to be predictors of obesity. Single individuals were less prone to become obese than couples or widowed/divorced people. Finally, smoking status was statistically linked to the prevalence of obesity, since non-smokers or ex-smokers for more than 1 year presented a higher tendency for a BMI > 30. CONCLUSIONS: This survey confirms that a priority area for health intervention aimed at preventing the development of obesity should be to increase levels of physical activity, although the approach will depend on the population, especially with respect to educational and socioeconomic aspects.",Public health nutrition,1999 Mar,England,1999,90

A questionnaire (covering family characteristics, social status, fetal and perinatal events, breast-feeding habits, infectious diseases and stressful life events) was sent by mail to all incident diabetic children in 1990 (n = 163) and to two referent children (for each diabetic child), matched for age, sex and county. Diabetic children had a tendency to have mothers > 35 years of age (odds ratio (OR) = 3.52; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.74-16.79), a lower proportion of their mothers had higher education (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 0.95-3.0) and these children tended to move home more frequently (OR = 1.99; 95% CI 0.97-4.1). Although the duration of exclusive breast feeding was similar in both groups, the proportion of diabetic children who received no breast milk tended to be higher (OR = 1.76; 95% CI 0.91-3.4). A higher proportion of diabetic children reported non-specific infections (OR = 2.94; 95% CI 1.19-7.21) and the number of stressful life events was higher in diabetic children aged 10-14 years (OR = 3.9; 95% CI 1.14-13.27). As the risk determinants for childhood insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus identified in our low-risk population appear to be similar to those detected in the genetically different, high-risk Swedish population, our study strongly supports an etiological role for these non-genetic risk factors in IDDM.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",1994 Jul,Norway,1994,90
9394205,Patient satisfaction with emergency house calls.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify determinants of patient satisfaction with emergency house calls and to assess the properties of a satisfaction measurement questionnaire. DESIGN: Patient survey, combined with routinely collected information on the circumstances of the house call. SETTING: Emergency house calls provided by an independent emergency care organization (ECO) in Geneva, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive sample of 389 patients (67% response rate). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Patient satisfaction. PREDICTOR VARIABLES: patient age and sex, type of medical problem, time of visit, waiting time, duration of visit, perceived effectiveness of treatment. RESULTS: The satisfaction questionnaire was easy to administer. Factor analysis identified 3 separate dimensions of satisfaction, which pertained to the visit itself, to access and to general attitude toward the ECO. Validation tests were consistent with expectations. In multivariate analysis, older patient age and greater perceived treatment effectiveness predicted independently all satisfaction scales. Presence of a mixed physical and mental problem reduced satisfaction with the visit itself only, a delay between the phone call and the visit exceeding one hour reduced satisfaction with access and worsened the attitude toward the ECO. CONCLUSION: The instrument used to measure patient satisfaction with emergency house calls performed well. Overall levels of satisfaction were high. Perceived effectiveness of treatment was the strongest correlate of patient satisfaction. Monitoring of patient satisfaction in emergency settings may contribute to improvements of quality of care.",International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care,1997 Oct,England,1997,90
8075092,The impact of AIDS on an urban population of high-risk female minority adolescents: implications for intervention.,"PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to describe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related concerns, risk behaviors, and psychosocial/situational determinants of condom use among an urban minority population of sexually active, adolescent girls. In addition we sought to define the accuracy of personal AIDS risk-assessment, the relative importance of AIDS in relation to other concerns, and the broader context of sexual experience and attitudes in this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional interview study was conducted involving sexually active female adolescents attending a pediatric clinic in an inner-city university-affiliated community hospital. Sixty-nine subjects (ages 13-19 yr, 90% African-American) were enrolled. While the goals of this study were primarily descriptive, subject characteristics felt to impact on condom use were identified prior to data collection and were examined against several measures of usage including: use at the time of last sexual intercourse, overall frequency of condom use, and reported behavior change to include initiation of or increased condom usage. RESULTS: Forty-one percent of participants reported knowing someone with AIDS. Global concern regarding this disease was high, although worry about poverty-related issues was often greater. Despite concern and high measures of AIDS risk (median number of sex partners, 3; past sexually transmitted disease, 55%; past pregnancy 77%), most participants perceived themselves to be at low personal risk owing to current monogamy, lack of intravenous drug use, and implicit trust in their partner's safety. Discussion with their partner about actual risk and awareness of the importance of past behaviors was generally lacking. Although 98% were aware that condoms may prevent AIDS, 64% used condoms half of the time or less when they had sex and use appeared to be primarily for contraception. Several intrinsic cognitive/psychological and extrinsic social/situational factors were found to correlate with measures of condom use. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' sexual histories and behavior emphasize the need for concern regarding AIDS risk in this population. Patterns of sexual behavior and beliefs regarding committed relationships raise challenging questions regarding how to motivate sexually active members of this population to use condoms more frequently. Programs aimed at AIDS prevention among urban minority adolescents need to be cognizant of the larger personal and sociocultural context in which these teenagers are making health-behavior choices.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,1994 May,United States,1994,90

8138521,"Home behaviors of children in three treatment settings: an outpatient clinic, a day hospital, and an inpatient hospital.","OBJECTIVE: To compare parents' ratings of home behaviors of three groups of children: those entering an outpatient clinic, a day hospital, and an inpatient hospital. It was hypothesized that the home behaviors of children starting day and inpatient hospital treatment would be rated as significantly more deviant than those of children beginning outpatient treatment, and there would be no significant differences in behavior ratings of children beginning day and inpatient hospital treatment. METHOD: A standardized behavior checklist was completed by the primary parent at the time treatment was begun. Scores on four factor scales were obtained, and a multivariate analysis of covariance was carried out. RESULTS: The hypotheses were partially supported. Children beginning day and inpatient hospitalization were seen as more disordered, anxious, and aggressive than were those starting outpatient treatment; children starting day treatment were reported as more learning disabled than were those in both outpatient and inpatient settings; and children entering the inpatient setting were perceived as more aggressive than were those in day treatment. CONCLUSION: Aggressive behavior and learning disability appear to be determinants of choice of treatment setting. The progression from least to most restrictive placement was demonstrated for aggressive behavior only.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1994 Jan,United States,1994,90
10924027,Does social medicine still matter in an era of molecular medicine?,"To ask whether social medicine still matters may seem to be in poor taste at a symposium to honor Martin Cherkasky, but social medicine has always had the courage to take on difficult questions. There is all the more reason to do so when its legitimacy is challenged. The extraordinary findings emerging from the human genome project will revolutionize diagnostic and therapeutic methods in medicine. The power of medical interventions, for good and for harm, will increase enormously. However, in the next millennium, as in this one, social factors will continue to be decisive for health status. The distribution of health and disease in human populations reflects where people live, what they eat, the work they do, the air and the water they consume, their activity, their interconnectedness with others, and the status they occupy in the social order. Virchow's aphorism is as true today as it was in 1848: ""If disease is an expression of individual life under unfavorable conditions, then epidemics must be indicative of mass disturbances of mass life."" Increasing longevity resulting from major economic transformations has made ours the age of chronic disease. Changes in diet and behavior transform genes that once conferred selective biologic advantage into health hazards. Although disease risk varies with social status, medical care makes an important difference for health outcomes. Access to care and the quality of care received are functions of social organization, the way care is financed, and political beliefs about the ""deserving"" and the ""underserving"" poor. It is a moral indictment of the US that ours is the only industrialized society without universal health care coverage. In educating the American public about the social determinants of health, a goal Martin Cherkasky championed, the very power of the new molecular biology will help make our case. Social medicine is alive and well.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1999 Jun,United States,1999,90
1311941,HIV-related risk behaviors among cocaine users.,"Risk behaviors related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and transmission were studied in a sample of 167 male cocaine users admitted during a 5-month period to an inpatient drug treatment program. Data obtained included drug history and related behaviors, sexual behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes regarding HIV infection and AIDS. Approximately 20% of the sample had used IV drugs in the year prior to the interview and 94% of these reported sharing needles; 20% of the IV drug users (IVDUs) reported always using bleach to clean needles. With regard to sexual practices, 7% of the total sample reported sex with other males in the year prior to the interview; 86% of the total sample reported having sex with females and 80% of these noted they never or rarely used condoms during vaginal sex. Respondents generally did not believe they themselves were at high risk for HIV infection, yet they continued to engage in acknowledged high-risk behaviors. These findings suggest that IVDUs and non-IV cocaine users are likely to contribute to the spread of HIV in several populations.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1992 Spring,United States,1992,90
9455171,Looking for the agent: an investigation into consciousness of action and self-consciousness in schizophrenic patients.,"The abilities to attribute an action to its proper agent and to understand its meaning when it is produced by someone else are basic aspects of human social communication. Several psychiatric syndromes, such as schizophrenia, seem to lead to a dysfunction of the awareness of one's own action as well as of recognition of actions performed by others. Such syndromes offer a framework for studying the determinants of agency, the ability to correctly attribute actions to their veridical source. Thirty normal subjects and 30 schizophrenic patients with and without hallucinations and/or delusional experiences were required to execute simple finger and wrist movements, without direct visual control of their hand. The image of either their own hand or an alien hand executing the same or a different movement was presented on a TV-screen in real time. The task for the subjects was to discriminate whether the hand presented on the screen was their own or not. Hallucinating and deluded schizophrenic patients were more impaired in discriminating their own hand from the alien one than the non-hallucinating ones, and tended to misattribute the alien hand to themselves. Results are discussed according to a model of action control. A tentative description of the mechanisms leading to action consciousness is proposed.",Cognition,1997 Dec,Netherlands,1997,90

This hypothesis was not supported. Support was found, however, for a relationship between negative bias and the amount of negative mood assessed at the time the retrospective report was given. As has been previously found, the most frequent precipitant of relapses and crises in this study was negative emotional states. Female participants were more likely to report interpersonal and less likely to report intrapersonal determinants than male participants. Minor relapses were more likely to be precipitated by social pressure and less likely to be related to negative emotions than major relapses.",Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,1995 Jun,United States,1995,90
8900703,The development and evaluation of a computer-aided diabetes education program.,"This paper describes the development and evaluation of a computer-aided learning (CAL) program. The program was tested in a trial that involved 36 people with diabetes; 20 received CAL lessons in diabetes management and 16 attended conventional diabetes classes conducted by diabetes educators. When measurements taken before and three months after the education were compared, both groups showed significant improvement in their knowledge; the blood glucose levels of the CAL group were significantly lower but those of the conventional education group were higher. This means that the CAL program was as effective as conventional education in imparting knowledge but it was more likely to motivate people to control their glucose levels. The CAL program allows diabetes educators to spend less time on education in basic knowledge and to concentrate more on motivational and social factors that are important determinants of patient compliance. It can also benefit people with diabetes whose access to health professionals and/or conventional diabetes education is restricted.",The Australian journal of advanced nursing : a quarterly publication of the Royal Australian Nursing Federation,1996 Winter,Australia,1996,90
9010510,Predictors of African American adolescents' condom use and HIV risk behavior.,"This study evaluated predictors of risky and safer behavior in a sample of low-income African American adolescents, assessed their perceptions of the risk associated with their sexual behavior, and examined differences between adolescents who used condoms consistently, inconsistently, or engaged only in unprotected intercourse. African American adolescents (N = 312) completed measures related to AIDS knowledge, frequency of condom use, attitudes toward condoms, and sexual behavior over the preceding 2 months. Multiple regression analyses for the sexually active youths (N = 114) revealed that lower self-efficacy, higher perceived risk, and male gender were associated with high-risk behavior. Positive attitudes toward condoms and younger age had the strongest association with condom use. Consistent condom users were more knowledgeable and held more positive attitudes toward condoms, and nonusers were older. Regardless of their behavior, the adolescents generally did not perceive themselves to be a risk for HIV infection. The findings suggest that precautionary practices (condom use) and high-risk behavior (unprotected sex with multiple partners) may have different correlates. In addition, the data indicate that theoretical models developed with homosexual male populations may also be generalizable to African American adolescents' sexual behavior.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90

Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey of 1046 households (5546 individuals) sampled from locations in two counties situated in the study area. The survey included anthropometric measurements, a 24-hour dietary recall, stool tests, and childhood mortality data. Children of private farmers and ""wealthy peasants"" displayed better nutritional status, higher quality diet, lower prevalence of intestinal parasites, and a lower risk of dying than those whose parents were communal farmers, from ejidos, or ""poor peasants"". The results suggest that using volume of maize production as a classification method proved more valuable than land tenure to identify agricultural groups with different health status. It appears that the main determinants of health differentials are structural inequities in resource distribution. Thus, the impact of medical interventions on inequalities will be limited unless they are accompanied by redistribution of resources.",Cadernos de saude publica,1999 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1999,90
22151109,Intrathecal therapy for cancer and nonmalignant pain: patient selection and patient management.,"Intrathecal drug delivery improves pain relief, reduces suffering, and enhances quality of life in the small proportion of patients who do not respond well to oral analgesics, including oral morphine. Although morphine is the ""gold standard,"" and the only drug approved for intrathecal pain therapy in the United States, off-label use of alternative agents appears promising, particularly in patients with neuropathic pain. Careful patient selection and management are significant determinants of successful treatment outcomes. Patient selection criteria for cancer and nonmalignant pain are similar; however, a more comprehensive psychological and social assessment is required for patients with nonmalignant pain. In addition, all patients (those with cancer or nonmalignant pain) must exhibit a positive response to an epidural or intrathecal screening test. A multidisciplinary team approach, involving psychologists, nurses, physical therapists, social workers, and spiritual leaders should be used to manage patients. Current practices for patient selection and management, screening tests, and dosing guidelines for intrathecal drug delivery systems are discussed.",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90

We draw predictions from industrialism and dependency theories for the explanation of social security programs. The explanations are tested with data on seventy-five nations, representative of core, semipheripheral and peripheral nations. Industrialization variables such as the percentage of older adults and economic productivity have strong effects in models involving all nations, as does multinational corporate (MNC) penetration in extraction, particularly when region is controlled; such penetration is negatively associated with spending on social security. We then look at industrialism and dependency effects for peripheral and non-core nations alone. The effects of all industrialization variables, except economic productivity, appear insignificant for peripheral nations, while the effects of region and multinational corporate penetration in extractive and agricultural industries appears significant. Models involving all non-core nations (peripheral and semi-peripheral) look more like models for all nations than for peripheral nations alone.",International journal of aging & human development,1991,United States,1991,90
10730470,"[Social differences in cancer incidence, fatality, and mortality in Turin].","INTRODUCTION: The study of social differences in health is today focused on determinants. The knowledge of determinants is useful for the definition of policies to tackle inequities. The aim of this paper is to analyse the social distribution of cancer incidence, fatality and mortality in the city of Turin during the 80's and to estimate the amount of inequality produced within the health system. SOURCES OF DATA: The social distribution of the risk of death in Turin during 1981-1989, estimated from the Turin Longitudinal Study, is compared with incidence and fatality during approximately the same time period. RESULTS: Among men, the relative risks for all cancer sites, among social classes, appear to confirm the hypothesis of a multiplicative model of incidence and fatality. In particular, colo-rectal, prostatic, bladder cancers and lymphoma and leukaemia show relative risks similar to the expected ones. Cancers of larynx, lung and stomach seem to be less coherent. Among women, colon-rectum, lung, breast and lymphoma and leukaemia show coherent results, whereas relative risks for uterus are far from the expected. DISCUSSION: The coherence with the expected values of the social distribution of mortality suggests the adequacy of the multiplicative model for the provision of mortality from incidence and fatality. Therefore it is possible to state that the portion of inequality in health originated within the health system is big enough to suggest the need to put the equity in the access to health services in the agenda of interventions.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,1999 Oct-Dec,Italy,1999,90
2237325,"Work and ""lifestyle"" in occupational mortality in Denmark.","Using social class standardization Fox and Adelstein found that 18% of all mortality was attributed to work, while 82% was attributable to lifestyle. Fox and Adelstein had access to 25 occupational orders. We have made similar calculations on Danish mortality statistics including 146 occupational groups. Our results are very different: more than 50% of all mortality among Danish men seems to be related to work. Of 51,317 work-related deaths in 10 years, one third were due to cancer, and half due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The marked differences in results have lead to considerations on the applicability of the model and the underlying assumptions. One conclusion is that social differences and differences in mortality between social groups are so small in Denmark that a few subgroups with ""deviant"" mortality and/or lifestyle will be determinants of the results. Inclusion of more occupational groups increases the percentage of deaths associated with work.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1990 Sep,Sweden,1990,90

A randomized two group pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test design was used. The experimental group received an educational session on BP, designed for this study, which consisted of a 40-minute session, comprised of a 10-minute video presentation and discussion by the teacher on BP (guided by the program guide). The educational session was effective in improving students knowledge of BP at one week post-test; however, this positive effect did not persist at the three month post-test. Student interest in, or knowledge of, their own BP was not obviously affected by the session. The findings were interpreted in light of Social Learning Theory (SLT) and the PRECEDE Model of Health Education (PMHE). In testing the effect of one component of an educational program, i.e., the videotape and teacher lesson the environmental determinants of behaviour change could not be addressed in this study. The educational session was able, however, to achieve the desired knowledge change. The 10-minute videotape and complementary print program guide was shown to be a viable educational tool and can therefore be utilized as a resource in a broader multi-faceted program of cardiovascular (CV) health promotion.",Canadian journal of cardiovascular nursing = Journal canadien en soins infirmiers cardio-vasculaires,1990 Dec,Canada,1990,90

Based on interviews with 76 triads composed of physicians, terminally ill patients, and primary caregivers, this study uses the socialization perspective to identify the actors and actions that most strongly affect the patient's death acknowledgment and receipt of exclusively palliative care (i.e., socialization to the dying role). Whereas patient preferences and sociodemographic characteristics do not influence significantly the patient's odds of death acknowledgment, these odds are increased if their primary caregivers accept death, their physicians are not affiliated with a teaching hospital, and the terminal prognosis is disclosed to them and disclosed ""matter-of-factly."" Patients who acknowledge death, whose agents value pain alleviation over life-prolongation, and whose physicians are not affiliated with a teaching hospital, are substantially more likely to receive exclusively palliative rather than curative terminal treatment.",Journal of health and social behavior,1992 Dec,United States,1992,90

10440685,Determinants of caregiving experiences and mental health of partners of cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Research regarding informal caregiving showed considerable individual variation in responses to cancer caregiving. The current longitudinal study examined determinants of caregiver outcomes in terms of caregiver experiences at 3 months and caregiver's mental health at 6 months after hospital discharge. It included both negative and positive dimensions of caregiving outcomes. METHODS: One hundred forty-eight patients with newly diagnosed colorectal carcinoma and their partners were included. Caregiver experiences were assessed by the Caregiver Reaction Assessment Scale, which contains four negative subscales (disrupted schedule, financial problems, lack of family support, and loss of physical strength) and one positive subscale (self-esteem). The mental health of the caregiver was assessed in terms of depression and quality of life. Possible determinants of the caregiver's experiences and mental health were categorized according to characteristics of the caregiver, the patient, and the care situation. Caregiving experiences were studied as a fourth additional category of possible determinants of the caregiver's mental health. RESULTS: Each domain of the caregiving experience was explained by different factors, with total explained variances ranging between 11-46%. Negative caregiver experiences were associated with a low income, living with only the patient, a distressed relationship, a high level of patient dependency, and a high involvement in caregiving tasks. Caregivers with a low level of education and caregivers of patients with a stoma were able to derive more self-esteem from caregiving. Although caregiving may lead to depression, especially in those experiencing loss of physical strength, caregivers may sustain their quality of life by deriving self-esteem from caregiving. CONCLUSIONS: It is important that professionals involved in the ongoing care of cancer patients and their families be aware of the increasing demands made on caregivers and the specific problems and uplifts they perceive in caregiving. Professional caregivers are urged to involve informal caregivers with care explicitly and continuously. However, specific attention to those caregivers who live only with the patient, those with a low income, those with a distressed relationship, and those with a high level of patient dependency and care involvement is warranted.",Cancer,1999 Aug 15,United States,1999,90
1458861,The chronic disease data bank model: a conceptual framework for the computer-based medical record.,"The principles underlying the chronic disease data bank model are straight-forward: (1) the purpose of medical care is to improve patient outcomes; (2) patient outcomes in contemporary developed societies are overwhelmingly linked to chronic illnesses and degenerative processes and will become increasingly so; (3) such outcomes have multiple determinants including the psychological and social, as well as the biologic; (4) outcome antecedents (risk factors) may precede clinical illness by years or decades; and (5) these complex characteristics require for their study (a) computer aid and (b) longitudinal data. The chronic disease data bank provides an important resource, available to many investigators, for examination of the complex set of clinical and policy questions arising with long-term illness and addressing the questions of lifetime health. The chronic disease data bank consecutively enrolls eligible subjects, follows them for life, and amasses time-oriented, multidisciplinary data including clinical findings, medical history, demographics, treatments, resource utilization and disease outcomes, and assessing both the quality of life and its duration. Analyses are longitudinal and time-series in type, examining changes in trends and tempo of the disease, and are focused upon long-term outcomes. Outcomes are regularly and carefully assessed, and include the outcome dimensions of death, disability, discomfort, iatrogenic toxicity, and dollar cost. Specific studies address the description of the disease from biologic, demographic, economic, and social viewpoints, identify the factors associated with good and bad outcomes, and assess the effects of treatment, both good and ill. The clinical and policy goals are focused upon delaying transitions from more benign disease states to more serious ones, thus improving both longevity and the quality of life. The time is appropriate to consider generalization of the chronic disease data bank model to the usual clinical care situation, with large rewards in improvement of the quality of care. The traditional medical record lacks systematic documentation of end results and of important covariates related to health risks. As such, it cannot readily be used to assess the ultimate quality of care and to establish a feedback loop to change behaviors and thereby improve outcomes. It is weak where the chronic disease data bank is strong. The technology is transferable.","Computers and biomedical research, an international journal",1992 Dec,United States,1992,90

Results from testing the hypotheses are somewhat consistent with the proposition that, after a period of adjustment, migrants do begin to remit, thereby providing their families with an insurance against the uncertainties of life in the country of origin. However, the level of remittances does not appear to depend on the potential to inherit from a family's wealth. Moreover, families do not seem to invest in their migrants so as to improve their farm lands and to undertake risky agricultural techniques. The long-term remittance commitment of migrants to their residual families suggests that migrants' altruism may be a more significant motivating factor than self-interest.""

10563479,Genetic and environmental sources of QT interval variability in Israeli families: the kibbutz settlements family study.,"QT interval prolongation not attributed to long QT syndromes is reported to be associated with increased risk of sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. Genetic and environmental determinants of QTc interval were investigated in an unselected free living population sample of 80 kindreds residing in kibbutz settlements in Israel. The sample included 214 males and 227 females aged 15-97 years. There was a significant familial aggregation of adjusted QT interval levels, as indicated by inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients significantly different from zero. Complex segregation analysis applied to the sex- and age-adjusted data was not conclusive and heterogeneous etiologies for individual differences were suggested. There was evidence for a single recessive locus (q = 0.173) with a major effect in addition to polygenic effects (h2 = 0.41) that explained the mixture of distributions. In parallel, a nontransmitted environmental major factor in addition to polygenic effects that explained the adjusted variation in QTc could not be rejected. Similar results were obtained upon the adjustment for sex, age, and environmental covariables. The major factor, either genetic or environmental, and polygenic-loci accounted for about 20 and 33% of the adjusted QTc variation, respectively. Furthermore, sex, age, measured environmental covariables, the unmeasured major factor, and the unmeasured polygenes could account for 63% of the variation of QTc in these families. Our data provide evidence for a major factor, either genetic or environmental, in addition to a polygenic background, influencing QT interval levels in a population-based sample of pedigrees.",Clinical genetics,1999 Sep,Denmark,1999,90
8235739,Determinants of lactation performance across time in an urban population from Mexico.,"We identified determinants of breastfeeding and full breastfeeding among 165 healthy mothers from Hermosillo, Mexico who planned to breastfeed and delivered vaginally a healthy term infant. Deliveries took place in either a nursery (n = 58) or a rooming-in (n = 107) public hospital where formula supplementation was not allowed. Multivariate analyses indicated that at 1 week full breastfeeding was associated (P < or = 0.05) with early milk arrival, social support for full breastfeeding and planned breastfeeding duration. At 2 months, full breastfeeding was associated with social support for full breastfeeding and early milk arrival. Breastfeeding was positively associated with early milk arrival and inversely associated with early introduction of supplementary bottles, maternal employment, maternal body mass index and infant age. At 4 months, full breastfeeding was positively associated with social support for full breastfeeding and inversely associated with infant age. Breastfeeding was positively associated with planned breastfeeding duration and inversely associated with early introduction of a bottle and urban background. Rooming-in mothers reported that their milk came in earlier (P < or = 0.05) than did the nursery group. Milk arrival was later when a bottle was introduced in the first week; both of these variables might be important in explaining a positive effect of rooming-in on lactation performance.",Social science & medicine (1982),1993 Oct,England,1993,90

Instruments developed for use in hospital level implementation of the WHO/UNICEF baby friendly hospital initiative were used in five hospitals (two public and three private). No hospital was implementing all Ten Steps. A core hospital team on lactation management and a sufficient number of health personnel skillful in breastfeeding counselling and adequate delivery room conditions are required to implement the Ten Steps. It is very difficult to provide these conditions in public hospitals with an excessive patient load. On the other hand, the fee for service system and the policy of changing practices according to the wishes of the clients can also become barriers to successful breastfeeding, as may occur in some private hospitals.","Child: care, health and development",1997 Mar,England,1997,90
10352846,Personal reflections on occupational health in the twentieth century: spiraling to the future.,"The history of occupational health in the United States during the twentieth century demonstrates pendular swings, with periods of rapid progress followed by periods of reversal. Happily, the last three decades have witnessed the most impressive gains, with establishment of a near-universal system for regulating conditions in the workplace, legitimization and growth of the occupational health professions, a marked increase in scientific research, most notably epidemiology, and the transfer of knowledge about occupational health to affected workers and the larger US population. Not surprisingly, rates of injury and illness have fallen. However, analysis of these cyclical historic changes suggests that extrinsic factors--broad social currents, changes in health care financing, and societal perceptions of health and disease--have dominated over enhanced scientific knowledge, technologic changes or professional achievements, usually the determinants of medical or public health advances. Practitioners of occupational health are not, and have never been, in a particularly advantageous position to fashion future events in their own field, and the current situation, however encouraging, is likely no exception.",Annual review of public health,1999,United States,1999,90

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data. Structural equation modeling with LISREL was used. SETTING: The Yukon Health Promotion Survey, Yukon Territory, Canada, 1993. SUBJECTS: The population-based sample was made up of 742 women and 713 men between 15 and 90 years of age; 80.3% responded. MEASURES: Self-rated health status was operationalized with the ""excellent, good, fair, poor"" indicator derived from the question: ""In general, compared to other people your age, would you say your health is...."" Social, spiritual, emotional, and physical health status were also self-rated from excellent to poor. RESULTS: The model's fit of the data was acceptable. Only physical health status significantly contributed to the variance in self-rated health status (55.1% of the variance was explained). Emotional, social, and spiritual health were found to have no effect on individuals' ratings of their health status. CONCLUSIONS: Although recent conceptualizations have broadened in much of the theoretical and political discourse about health, especially in health promotion, the self-rated health status indicator measures only physical health status.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,1998 Mar-Apr,United States,1998,90

One hundred and eighty-eight individuals in three age groups answered a questionnaire. Answers were classified according to WHO's ICIDH, and 11 areas of behaviour were distinguished. Diagnoses and locations of lesions were noted from medical records. Impairment and disability increased with increasing age at the time of the incident. Individuals working before but not after the incident indicated decreased life satisfaction and changed intellectual function, personal care, and domestic/housework/gardening activities, and inability to organize their time. Those who had resumed work but at different tasks indicated changed emotional and sensorimotor function and content in leisure activities. The influence of the localization and lateralization of the lesion is also discussed.",Disability and rehabilitation,1992 Jan-Mar,England,1992,90

Items on sexual interest and satisfaction were treated as one composite variable, the SIS scale, measuring sexual adjustment after injury. Despite severe genital dysfunction, more than half of the subjects (57%) rated their sexual relations after injury as satisfying or at least rather satisfying. The majority continued having intercourse, although many of them more seldom than before, and about half experienced orgasm. Sexual adjustment after injury was closely and positively correlated to frequency of intercourse, willingness to experiment with alternative sexual expressions and young age at injury. Physical and social independence and a high mood level were further positive determinants of sexual adaptation after injury, whereas the neurological level and completeness of injury showed no significant correlation with sexuality. It is suggested that sexual information and counselling should be integrated in the total care of the SCI patient to reduce the negative effects on sexuality, caused by the injury.",Paraplegia,1990 Jun,England,1990,90

It extends previous research by documenting the extent to which the relative importance of parental inputs and ethnic spillovers in the intergenerational transmission of skills differs both within and across immigrant and U.S.-born ethnic groups. Using data drawn from the General Social Surveys, the study documents that the second and third generations (i.e., the children and grandchildren of immigrants) experience relatively more rapid economic advancement than do other generations, and that ethnic spillovers play a stronger role in households which are at the extremes of the skill distribution.""",Journal of population economics,1994,Germany,1994,90
2030286,A typology of social climates in group residential facilities for older people.,"A typology of the social climates of group residential facilities for older people was developed by a cluster analysis of seven social climate attributes obtained on a national sample of 235 nursing homes, residential care facilities, and congregate apartments. The analysis yielded six distinct types of social climate: Supportive, Self-Directed; Supportive, Well-Organized; Open Conflict; Suppressed Conflict; Emergent-Positive; and Unresponsive. Facility and resident characteristics were related to social climate type. In addition, the type of social climate was related to resident adaptation. Supportive, Self-Directed and Supportive, Well-Organized facilities had residents who rated higher in well-being and levels of self-initiated activities and who used fewer health services. A configural approach to describing social climates and their determinants and effects may help to develop more humanistic residential facilities and to better match individual residents to appropriate housing placements.",Journal of gerontology,1991 May,United States,1991,90

In the 1930s, the group designated as most dangerous was the Jews; in the 1980s, it was the North Africans.

Although racist ideas were commonly expressed in the 1930s, they are no longer openly espoused today, with the exception of certain fringe groups.

1830689,Determinants of sciatica and low-back pain.,"Several factors were studied for their association with the prevalence of chronic low-back syndromes, sciatica, and unspecified low-back pain (LBP) in 2,946 women and 2,727 men (age range, 30-64 years) participating in the Mini-Finland Health Survey, a project aimed at comprehensive evaluation of the population's health. On the basis of a standardized clinical examination, a physician diagnosed sciatica in 5.1% and LBP in 11.6% of the subjects. Those with a previous traumatic back injury had a 2.5-fold risk of having sciatica or LBP. The fractions of sciatica and LBP attributable to such back injuries were estimated to be 16.5% and 13.7%, respectively. Sum indices of both physical and mental stress at work were found to be directly proportional to the prevalence of sciatica and LBP. Smokers had an increased risk of LBP, and body height was related positively to the prevalence of sciatica. These associations, however, were inconsistent between sex and age subgroups. In the presence of osteoarthritis in the knee, hip, or hand, LBP was prevalent (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-6.9), but sciatica was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.7). Diabetics were found to have a significantly decreased prevalence of LBP (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). Many factors, independent of each other, determine the occurrence of chronic low-back syndromes. The determinants of sciatica and LBP are different to some extent.",Spine,1991 Jun,United States,1991,90
9224179,The association between the purchase of a handgun and homicide or suicide.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer is associated with the risk of homicide or suicide and whether any association varies in relation to time since purchase. METHODS: A case-control study was done among the members of a large health maintenance organization. Case subjects were the 353 suicide victims and 117 homicide victims among the members from 1980 through 1992. Five control subjects were matched to each case subject on age, sex, and zip code of residence. Handgun purchase information was obtained from the Department of Licensing. RESULTS: The adjusted relative risk of suicide was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.5) for persons with a history of family handgun purchase from a registered dealer. The adjusted relative risk for homicide, given a history of family handgun purchase, was 2.2 (95% CI = 1.3, 3.7). For both suicide and homicide, the elevated relative risks persisted for more than 5 years after the purchase. CONCLUSIONS: Legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death.",American journal of public health,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90

The authors reviewed medical records of all first time admissions during a 22 month period. A total of 272 patients age 60 and older were admitted for the first time during this period. Nine variables comprised of medical, demographic, social, and discharge information were examined in retrospective analysis to assess their relationship to LOS. The mean and standard deviation of days spent in hospital was 392.3 +/- 752.81. The median number of days of hospitalization was 72.0. Single marital status, type of living arrangement, polypharmacy, and limited functional status were predictive of LOS.

2197395,Preventing relapse in the treatment of nicotine addiction: current issues and future directions.,"Although smoking-cessation rates have continued to increase, the vast majority of smokers who quit eventually relapse. Between 1974 and 1985, over 1.3 million smokers quit during each of those years. However, 75% to 80% of those individuals resumed smoking within six months. This article describes the dynamic phenomenon of smoking relapse within the context of cyclical episodes of smoking and quitting during an individual's lifetime. Theories of the determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed and methods designed to prevent relapse are described. Smoking relapse is discussed in terms of three aspects of tobacco addiction: (1) biological-addiction mechanisms, (2) conditioning processes, and (3) cognitive-social learning factors. The major determinants of smoking relapse are reviewed, including nicotine withdrawal, stress, weight gain, social influences, conditioning factors, causal attributions, and environmental variables. A trans-theoretical-developmental model is explored in the longitudinal investigation of the natural history of slips (lapses) and relapse episodes. Relapse prevention interventions are described that emphasize self-awareness, self-regulation, self-efficacy, affect regulation, social support, and lifestyle balance. Recent developments in pharmacological adjuncts to treatment are also examined. It is concluded that innovative relapse prevention methods need to be designed for hard-core smokers with histories of cessation failures, substance abuse and/or psychiatric impairment. These and other recommendations for future research on smoking relapse and relapse prevention are discussed.",Journal of psychoactive drugs,1990 Apr-Jun,United States,1990,90

10163955,Is long-term maintenance of health-related physical activity possible? An analysis of concepts and evidence.,"The phenomenon of maintenance of health-related physical activity is explored through an analysis of the underlying concepts and of the existing empirical evidence. The following targets were used for the analysis: (1) the concept of health-related physical activity, (2) the concept of maintenance, (3) common manifestations of maintenance in everyday living, (4) the promotional and behavioral characteristics of health-related physical activity, (5) the known determinants of free-living physical activity, and (6) intervention trials on physical activity in free-living groups. The analyses revealed the inherent resistance to adoption and maintenance of physical activity, particularly that of high-intensity and program-centered activities, the persistence, however, of many simple everyday routines and habits, the multiple determinants discovered for free-living physical activity and a few empirical demonstrations of the successful promotion of the maintenance of physical activity over a year or two. The promotion of the maintenance of health-related physical activity seems thus a distinct possibility provided that (1) the promotional situation is analyzed thoroughly, (2) the activity is chosen carefully with an emphasis on moderation in intensity and integration into the participant's life-style, (3) multiple promotional contacts are used, and (4) support from the participant's social and physical environment is provided. There is a need for more research on the maintenance of health-related physical activity using the stages of change models, behavior modification principles, self-control concepts, the concept of intrinsic motivation and the Relapse model. The method of analysis used here could apply to other health-related behaviors as well.",Health education research,1996 Dec,England,1996,90

In practice, briefly trained community health workers provide people with education and health care, but they require sound supervision. Such tasks of leadership require higher education. This demands more schools of public health of independent status, as well as stronger departments of community medicine within schools of medicine. Independent schools of public health throughout the world are much stronger than preventive medicine departments in medical schools, as measured by full-time faculty, scope of teaching and research, and candidates enrolled. To train properly for leadership, such independent schools in the developing world should be multiplied by 12 times to meet the needs. Leadership requires basic preparation in the full scope of public health knowledge, along with skills of effective management.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1993,United States,1993,90

9560871,Changes in cognitive coping skills and social support during cognitive behavioral stress management intervention and distress outcomes in symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive gay men.,"OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported decreases in dysphoria, anxiety, and total mood disturbance in symptomatic HIV seropositive gay men after a 10-week cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) group intervention. This structured intervention was designed a) to increase cognitive and behavioral coping skills related to managing the distress of symptomatic HIV, and b) to increase social support among group members. Here we examine the relative contribution of changes in coping skills and social support during the intervention period to reductions in dysphoria, anxiety, and distress-related symptoms in this sample. METHODS: Participants were randomized to a 10-week CBSM group intervention or to a wait-list control condition. Coping, social supports, and mood were measured before and after the intervention period. RESULTS: Members of the CBSM group (N = 22) showed significant improvement in cognitive coping strategies involving positive reframing and acceptance, and in social supports involving attachment, alliances, and guidance at the end of the 10-week CBSM program compared with controls (N = 18) who showed decrements in these coping abilities and no changes in social support. Improved cognitive coping, specifically acceptance of the HIV infection, was strongly related to lower dysphoria, anxiety, and total mood disturbance in both conditions. Changes in social support and in cognitive coping skills seem to mediate the effects of the experimental condition on the changes in distress noted during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that cognitive coping and social support factors can be modified by psychosocial interventions and may be important determinants of the changes in psychological well-being and quality of life during symptomatic HIV infection that can be achieved through this form of intervention.",Psychosomatic medicine,1998 Mar-Apr,United States,1998,90
12320114,Marital status and earnings in developed countries.,"""When estimating earnings equations for men in the United States, a dichotomous variable for whether or not the man is currently married is often included as a regressor. The coefficient estimate for this variable is most usually large and significant. However, there is rarely much discussion of the marriage effect. This effect is central to this study, which contributes to the understanding of this statistical association in two ways. First, it shows that the relationship exists in almost all of the fourteen developed countries examined and across several different time periods. Controlling for age, and, when available, education, race/ethnicity, hours worked, and location, marriage differences in annual earnings in favor of currently married males range from 0% to 30%. Second, it finds that there are important differences between those who are separated, divorced, widowed, and never married.""",Journal of population economics,1995 Nov,Germany,1995,90
9144822,Determinants of mental health providers' expectations of patients' improvement.,"OBJECTIVE: Characteristics of individual mental health providers and of treatment settings were examined to determine their effects on providers' expectations about the improvement of patients with serious mental illness. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1,567 treatment providers working in 107 inpatient and outpatient units or programs in 29 Veterans Affairs mental health facilities. They completed a questionnaire about their prognostic expectations and a broad range of attitudes toward job satisfaction, professional relations, and team functioning. Unit or program directors of all 107 units completed another questionnaire about the average functional ability of patients, unit workload, and unit size. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to assess the effects of both individual and unit-level attributes on providers' expectations of improvement in clinical symptomatology and social-functional skills of patients in their care. RESULTS: The providers had generally low expectations about the improvement of patients with serious mental illness. Expectations were higher among staff in units or programs that were smaller and that had an outpatient focus, a greater proportion of staff involved in the treatment team, and higher-functioning patients. Individual characteristics significantly associated with prognostic expectations were occupation, age, and membership on the treatment team. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic expectations among providers of care to persons with serious mental illness vary with identifiable individual and unit or program characteristics. The latter may be amenable to manipulation and intervention to improve mental health providers' prognostic expectations.","Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",1997 May,United States,1997,90
7660042,[Reliability of the declaration of underlying cause of infant deaths in the metropolitan region of southeastern Brazil].,"The quality of official information on underlying causes of infant deaths was studied on the basis of data collected for a population-based study of the surveillance of infant mortality in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil in 1989. The survey included the analysis of a sample of infant deaths carried out by comparing the underlying causes of death as coded on death certificates to those recorded by a group of doctors who abstracted information from hospital records. We verified that 11.7% of neonatal deaths did not have the underlying cause of death confirmed by the investigation (kappa = 0.61), and neither did 44.0% of post-neonatal deaths (kappa = 0.47). It is believed that this major disagreement among post-neonatal deaths is due to the close correlation observed among the major causes of death within this group (pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition). For example, associated malnutrition was observed in 76.9% of those cases in which diarrhoea was coded as the underlying cause of death. It was concluded that the quality of the death certificates is not satisfactory. However, the composition of the main groups of causes presented no significant alteration after investigation and may be used in public health surveillance, especially if we regard pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition as a group with the same determinants. Unfortunately, this group still accounts for a great number of otherwise avoidable deaths in Brazil.",Revista de saude publica,1994 Oct,Brazil,1994,90
8932893,Emotional overinvolvement in parents of patients with schizophrenia or related psychosis: demographic and clinical predictors.,"BACKGROUND: Parental emotional overinvolvement (EOI) may entail a worse outcome in schizophrenia. In the present study we examined demographic and clinical predictors of EOI. METHOD: The predictors were examined in a Norwegian sample of 41 recently admitted patients (schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder) and 66 parents. Parents' expressed emotion was assessed by the Camberwell Family Interview. RESULTS: Regression analyses showed that higher EOI was significantly related, on the part of the parent, to being a mother, single, spending more time with the patient; and, on the part of the patient, to no substance misuse, more anxiety-depression, and less uncritical and aggressive behaviour. EOI was not linked to previous hospital admissions. CONCLUSION: Our analyses indicate that characteristics of the parent and of the parent-patient dyad seem to be the most important determinants of EOI. EOI is probably not linked to psychotic relapse, but rather to affective disturbances in the patient.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1996 Nov,England,1996,90

DESIGN: Questionnaire administered on admission and prior to discharge. SETTING: Two acute geriatric medicine units (Southampton and Poole). PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and fourteen consecutive consenting mentally competent patients admitted to hospital as emergencies. RESULTS: Resuscitation was wanted by 60%, particularly married and functionally independent patients and those who had not already considered it. Not wanted resuscitation was associated with lack of social contacts. Sixty-seven per cent welcomed enquiry about their preferences and 78% wanted participation in decision, 43% as sole decision-maker. Wishing to choose oneself was associated with not wanting resuscitation, prior knowledge of it, and lack of a spouse. Patients' opinions remained stable during their admission. CONCLUSIONS: Discussion of resuscitation is practical on hospital admission without causing distress and the views expressed endure through the period of hospitalisation. Elderly patients' attitudes depend partly on personal health and social circumstances. This may assist doctors when patients are unable to participate themselves.",Journal of medical ethics,1996 Jun,England,1996,90

DESIGN: Interviewer-administered questionnaire. METHODS: IDUs who had injected illicit drugs within the previous month were recruited through street outreach. They underwent serology for HIV-1 and questionnaires on demographics, drug using behaviors, housing status, and health service utilization (hospitalization overnight and emergency department visits) in the previous 6 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent associations with the use of health services. RESULTS: Of 1,103 cohort participants, 65% were male, 63% were white, and 23% were HIV positive. Cocaine was the most frequently injected drug used. Almost half (47%) had used health services in the previous 6 months. The following variables were associated independently with health service utilization (adjusted odds ratio; 95% confidence interval): unstable housing, defined as living primarily in a hotel, boarding room, or transition house or on the street in the past 6 months (1.44; 1.11-1.86); female gender (1.45; 1.11-1.89); HIV-positive status (1.43; 1.06-1.92); injection of cocaine (1.50; 1.12-2.02); and primary care I physician visit in past 6 months (1.91; 1.39-2.64). CONCLUSION: IDUs with unstable housing were more likely to report emergency department and hospital use, which may be a reflection of their disorganized lifestyle or poorer health status. Further studies are required to assess the effect on the health status and health care use of IDUs of interventions that increase the availability of safe, affordable housing.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90
1740227,Contextual determinants of auditory learning in bobwhite quail embryos and hatchlings.,"This study examined the ability of bobwhite quail embryos and hatchlings to learn an individual bobwhite maternal call. Results revealed that embryos could learn an individual maternal call and remember that call for at least 24 hr following exposure. In contrast, hatchlings reared socially in groups of same-age chicks during postnatal exposure to a maternal call did not demonstrate a preference for that familiar call at 24 hr following exposure. However, individual auditory recognition was exhibited by hatchlings reared in social isolation, suggesting that the perceptual and social complexity of the postnatal situation can disrupt or interfere with early auditory learning. Additional support for this view was the finding that embryos exposed to unusually early visual stimulation during prenatal exposure to a maternal call also failed to prefer that familiar maternal call in subsequent choice tests. The idea that early auditory learning capacity is determined more by context and experience rather than the organism's specific age or stage of development is discussed.",Developmental psychobiology,1992 Jan,United States,1992,90
7833551,Maternal and pediatric AIDS in the United States: the current situation and future research directions.,"The epidemic of HIV infection and disease in women, adolescents and children represents a complexly intertwined biological and social challenge to health care workers and researchers alike. When considering various issues in confronting this epidemic, women must be viewed as individuals important in their own right, as the primary caretaker of their family members (both infected and uninfected), and as the sexual partners of men who may or may not be infected. Of the myriad of compelling biological questions facing AIDS researchers today, two of the most interesting involve the timing and determinants of vertical transmission and the natural history of HIV infection and disease in women. Scientifically, confronting this epidemic involves research into pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection. Primary emphasis in the research arena in HIV/AIDS in the United States is focused on therapeutic and prophylactic research. Other research issues are very important, including studies of early diagnostic techniques, behavioral research concerning reproductive choices, the role of breastfeeding in HIV transmission, HIV-specific adolescent issues, and surrogate markers of disease progression.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992).

2056748,"Consequences of person-environment incongruence: absenteeism, frustration, and stress.","Two correlational studies using English nurses and working adults are reported that examined the relationship between the three measures of person-environment (P-E) fit as derived from Holland's (1973) theory and three dependent work-related variables. In the first study, the P-E fit measures of congruence, consistency, and differentiation were correlated with two measures of absenteeism, frustration, and various demographic variables. Contrary to predictions, two measures of absenteeism were positively correlated with congruence and consistency. In accordance with the hypothesis, however, frustration was highly negatively correlated with congruence and consistency. In the second study, consistency, but not congruence or differentiation, was significantly negatively correlated with stress, as predicted. These studies provide some support for Holland's theses, although not all hypotheses were supported, both for methodological and theoretical reasons. It is argued that P-E fit measures are useful predictors of occupational behavior in conjunction with other major determinants.",The Journal of social psychology,1991 Apr,United States,1991,90
8738549,Malnutrition in children under five in Zimbabwe: effect of socioeconomic factors and disease.,"Using data from the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (1988), this study investigates the factors that determine the nutritional status of children under five years of age. Several sociocultural, economic, and demographic variables were selected for the study. These independent variables were regressed against three proxy measures of malnutrition: height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height. The results show that the nutritional status of a child is determined by a variety of factors that are biological, social, cultural, and economic in nature, namely, birth status, birth weight, diarrhoeal status, duration of breastfeeding, and residence. The study concludes that most of the factors that account for malnutrition in children in Zimbabwe are preventable.",Social biology,1995 Fall-Winter,United States,1995,90
8909110,Risk of mortality following widowhood: age and sex differences by mode of death.,"This study examines how spouses' deaths from sudden or lengthy illnesses differentially affect the mortality risks of surviving widows and widowers by age. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find the mortality risk differs by gender, age, and type of widowhood. For nonelderly (< 65) widowers, there is an elevated risk when their wives died suddenly. For older (> or = 65) widows, the mortality risk is lower than that of comparably aged married women when their husbands died after a long-term illness. These gender, age, and mode-of-death differences are consistent with role theory and theories of social support.",Social biology,1996 Spring-Summer,United States,1996,90
10686755,Indicators that count! Measuring population health at the community level.,"We begin with a discussion of some vitally important conceptual and methodological issues. These issues concern our understanding of community, of health, of population health and its determinants, of the concept of 'measurement' and the values that underlie it, and our reasons for wishing to measure these constructs. We then present a framework for indicator categories, propose some criteria for indicator selection and suggest an initial set of core indicators. This indicator set reflects not simply health status--no matter how broadly defined--but also the environmental, social and economic determinants of health and the ""healthfulness"" of the community itself. Our most important conclusion is that if the information that is contained in the data of the indicator set is to be transformed into knowledge that can empower and emancipate the community, it has to be developed in consultation with the local community and local users of the information.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,1999 Nov-Dec,Switzerland,1999,90
1558698,Framing the construct of life satisfaction in terms of older adults' personal goals.,"Older adults' life satisfaction can be better understood in light of their personal goals. This study of 179 elders examined (a) how goals correlate with satisfaction, (b) whether elders maintain satisfaction by accommodating goals to past losses, and (c) how correlations between satisfaction and key predictors differ among groups with different goals. Satisfaction was related positively to social maintenance and energetic life-style goals and negatively to concerns for improvement, disengagement, stability, and reduced activity. Past losses were correlated with current goals but not with satisfaction, consistent with the notion of accommodation. A cluster analysis identified 5 patterns of goals: high demand, age prescribed, self-focused, socially engaged, and low demand. Correlations between satisfaction and other predictors differed by cluster, suggesting that the determinants of elders' satisfaction depend on personal goals.",Psychology and aging,1992 Mar,United States,1992,90
10365626,Whom to ask for help in case of a mental disorder? Preferences of the lay public.,"BACKGROUND: Although socio-cultural factors have been recognised as an important predictor in shaping help-seeking behaviour, few attempts have been made in this regard to specify the nature and impact of socio-cultural factors such as attitudes and belief systems prevalent in society. METHODS: We investigated the lay public's attitudes toward help-seeking regarding psychiatric disorders, and their determinants, in a cross-sectional national survey in Germany (n = 1564), using structured interviews with vignettes depicting a person either suffering from depression or from schizophrenia. Two distinct methodological approaches (rating vs ranking) were applied. RESULTS: Public opinion considers mental health professionals helpful in treating schizophrenia but not in the treatment of depression. For depression, public opinion clearly favours the lay support system and believes in involving the family physician if the former resource is exhausted. Determinants of help-seeking recommendations were problem definition, perception of the cause of distress and anticipated prognosis, as well as resentment against mental health professionals. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that attitudes and belief systems prevalent in society have a major impact on help-seeking behaviour, both through transmission to the person suffering from mental distress via his/her social network and through the person's own attitudes formed in the process of socialization. Implications are pointed out for the daily work of mental health care providers, health care planning and public discussion of mental health issues.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,1999 Apr,Germany,1999,90
12291801,The demographic transition revisited: lessons for foreign aid and U.S. immigration policy.,"""The completed demographic transitions in industrialized countries inspired a model which underlies many well-meant policies affecting the Third World. However, the model's postulate--modernization and prosperity will lower fertility rates--has exacerbated rather than helped control worldwide population growth and the associated environmental degradation. Here we show that perceived economic opportunity leads to raising family size targets and to discarding elements of traditional cultures which formerly held fertility rates in check. Conversely, fertility rates fall when limits are recognized. These observations imply that a liberal immigration policy and large-scale foreign aid are counterproductive for restoring balance between population size and carrying capacity.""",Ecological economics : the journal of the International Society for Ecological Economics,1993 Dec,Netherlands,1993,90

9577516,Determinants of management errors in acute severe asthma.,"BACKGROUND: It is hypothesised that, despite recent initiatives to improve asthma self-management including asthma education, detailed investigation of the sequence of events culminating in hospital admission will lead to the identification of important management errors and thus the likelihood that the majority of severe asthma attacks are preventable by currently available strategies, and that psychological, health care and socioeconomic factors are risk factors for such management errors. METHODS: A cross sectional study was undertaken of 138 patients aged 15-50 years admitted to hospital (general ward or intensive care unit) with acute severe asthma who were assessed within 24-72 hours of admission using a number of previously validated instruments. A detailed history of events of the attack was assessed against predetermined criteria for non or delayed use of oral corticosteroids and non or delayed use of emergency ambulance services. RESULTS: Subjects had evidence of severe chronic asthma and had acute severe asthma at presentation (n = 90, pH = 7.3 (0.2), PaCO2 = 7.2 (5.0) kPa) but duration of hospital stay was short (3.7 (2.6) days). Serious management errors occurred very frequently and most were deemed to have been made by the patient. Forward stepwise regression revealed that delayed or non-use of oral corticosteroids was predicted independently by lack of paying job (p = 0.02), high total use of inhaled beta agonists in the 24 hours before index admission (p = 0.04), loss of a job in the last year (p = 0.04), low frequency of use of oral corticosteroids in the last year (p = 0.06), concerns during the index attack about medical expenses (p = 0.07), and delay in the use of ambulance services (p = 0.05)--the model being responsible for 23% of the variance. Delayed or non-summoning of emergency ambulance services was predicted independently by total life events (p = 0.03), having something stolen in the last year (p = 0.003), panic during the index attack (p = 0.01), and concerns during the index attack about taking time off work (p = 0.07)--the model being responsible for 21% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that, despite recent educational advances, serious management errors are common in those admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma and that most management errors relate to patient self-management behaviour. Serious management errors are predicted by a variety of socio-economic and psychological factors. While the results of this study are consistent with the widely held view that most acute severe attacks are theoretically preventable, the challenge for the future is to change patients' behaviour in the face of considerable adverse socioeconomic and psychological factors.",Thorax,1998 Jan,England,1998,90
8357893,A holosphere of healthy and sustainable communities.,"Public health practice is in a transitory state, expanding considerably beyond medical and behavioural models of health and disease to encompass physical and social environmental health determinants. A new public health practice is emerging, apparent in initiatives like the international healthy cities/communities projects. This new public health practice must integrate the challenge of sustainable development, as defined by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development. The holosphere framework locates health as its central metaphor, and defines six interacting environmental spheres: a viable natural environment, a sustainable economic environment, a sufficient economy, an equitable social environment, a convivial community, and a livable built environment. There are five functional roles for local government: policy, legislation, education, partnerships and advocacy. Representative actions from each of the six environmental spheres of the holosphere framework are identified and discussed, using the five functional roles of local government. There is a need for new intersectoral forums to act upon the knowledge generated by integrative models such as the holosphere. Canadian Round Tables on Environment and Economy are encouraging examples of such intersectoralism.",Australian journal of public health,1993 Mar,Australia,1993,90

Our research proposes to analyse the Quebec Health Survey--a population health survey carried out in Quebec in 1987--using a geographic grid which defines three different rural areas: that area bordering urban centers, a more remote area and the very remote hinterland. The analysis brings to light major, statistically significant, discrepancies between these areas in three sectors: health status determinants (physical activity and social support), the actual state of health (perceived health, a global health index and various pathologies) and the consequences that may be attributed to this state of health (disability and medication).

7612128,Determinants of primary care specialty choice: a non-statistical meta-analysis of the literature.,"This paper analyzes and synthesizes the literature on primary care specialty choice from 1987 through 1993. To improve the validity and usefulness of the conclusions drawn from the literature, the authors developed a model of medical student specialty choice to guide the synthesis, and used only high-quality research (a final total of 73 articles). They found that students predominantly enter medical school with a preference for primary care careers, but that this preference diminishes over time (particularly over the clinical clerkship years). Student characteristics associated with primary care career choice are: being female, older, and married; having a broad undergraduate background; having non-physician parents; having relatively low income expectations; being interested in diverse patients and health problems; and having less interest in prestige, high technology, and surgery. Other traits, such as value orientation, personality, or life situation, yet to be reliably measured, may actually be responsible for some of these associations. Two curricular experiences are associated with increases in the numbers of students choosing primary care: required family practice clerkships and longitudinal primary care experiences. Overall, the number of required weeks in family practice shows the strongest association. Students are influenced by the cultures of the institutions in which they train, and an important factor in this influence is the relative representation of academically credible, full-time primary care faculty within each institution's governance and everyday operation. In turn, the institutional culture and faculty composition are largely determined by each school's mission and funding sources--explaining, perhaps, the strong and consistent association frequently found between public schools and a greater output of primary care physicians. Factors that do not influence primary care specialty choice include early exposure to family practice faculty or to family practitioners in their own clinics, having a high family medicine faculty-to-student ratio, and student debt level, unless exceptionally high. Also, students view a lack of understanding of the specialties as a major impediment to their career decisions, and it appears they acquire distorted images of the primary care specialties as they learn within major academic settings. Strikingly few schools produce a majority of primary care graduates who enter family practice, general internal medicine, or general practice residencies or who actually practice as generalists. Even specially designed tracks seldom produce more than 60% primary care graduates. Twelve recommendations for strategies to increase the proportion of primary care physicians are provided.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,1995 Jul,United States,1995,90

We investigated the influence of some socioeconomic, behavioral, dietary and reproductive factors on body mass index (BMI). Data were obtained from a comparison group of a case-control study of gastrointestinal cancers from the four largest teaching and general hospitals in Milan, northern Italy. The subjects were 1,188 men and 832 women admitted between January 1985 and June 1992 to the hospitals under study for diseases other than malignant or digestive and not known or suspected to be related to alcohol or tobacco. The following were measured: BMI (Quetelet's index, weight, kg/height, m2) and the corresponding standard errors (s.e.) in strata of selected variables, linear regression coefficients (beta) and correlation coefficients between BMI and each variable. Mean BMI increased with age until 35-44 years in men and 45-54 years in women. In both sexes BMI was inversely associated with education and social class. Smokers tended to be leaner than non-smokers, but no consistent trend was observed with increasing numbers of cigarettes. Alcohol drinkers had mean BMI similar to non-drinkers, except heavy drinking women who were lighter. BMI was not significantly associated with coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, bread, vegetable and fruit consumption. No relation was observed between total estimated caloric intake and BMI. In women BMI was directly associated with marriage and number of children, and inversely with oral contraceptive use.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",International journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,1994 Jul,England,1994,90

The method's side effects were defined by 200 first-time users in Matlab district during lengthy, open-ended interviews. Women with many children used the method longer than did women of low parity. Those who experienced side effects had shorter use durations than those who did not, and those who cited heavy bleeding as their main problem discontinued use soonest. Women whose husbands approved of family planning had significantly longer use durations than those whose husbands disapproved. Respondents who adopted DMPA because of perceived positive aspects of the drug used it longer than those who chose it for other reasons. Results of the study underscore the importance of viewing side effects in a specific social and cultural context.

10186847,Bearing the costs of our eldercare policies: work constraints among employed caregivers.,"For many caregivers, rendering aid to frail parents, grandparents, siblings, and spouses comes at a high price: compromised physical and mental health, disturbed relationships with spouse and children, truncated opportunities for social life, and, for caregivers who are employed, declining job performance. Using the 1982 National Long Term Care Survey's ""Survey of Informal Care-givers,"" this study investigates how the sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers, care requirements, the availability of backup caregivers, and conditions of employment affect the likelihood that caregivers will suffer work constraints. Estimations of both the probability of work constraints and hours of work reveal that proxies for work conditions figure prominently, as do care requirements. In the model of constrained work, ill health, financial burdens, and primary responsibility for care are significant determinants; the estimation of hours of work revealed that low income and competing care demands wielded major influence. Women and white caregivers are employed fewer hours, while spouses are more likely than other informal caregivers to face constrained work. Occupation, as an indicator of work conditions, is shown to be an important addition to the factors considered in investigations of circumstances that affect caregivers' experiencing work constraints.",Journal of aging & social policy,1993,England,1993,90

10220021,Gender differences in structural and behavioral determinants of health: an analysis of the social production of health.,"This paper explores aspects of the social production of health by focussing on the ways in which levels of health are shaped by structures of social inequality and behaviors or 'lifestyles'. We address two questions: What is the relative importance of the social, structural and behavioral determinants of health? And, are there gender differences in the determinants of health? These questions are explored using multiple regression analyses of data from the 1994 Canadian National Population Health Survey. Two measures of health are used: subjective health status and the Health Utilities Index (a measure of functional health status). By structural determinants we refer to age, family structure, main activity, education, occupation, income and social support. Behavioral determinants include lifestyle factors related to smoking, drinking, weight and physical activity. Findings indicate that the structures of social inequality are the most important determinants of health acting both independently and through their influence on the behavioral determinants of health. There are very real differences in the factors that predict women's and men's health. For women, social structural factors appear to play a more important role in determining health. Being in the highest income category, working full-time and caring for a family and having social support are more important predictors of good health for women than men. Smoking and alcohol consumption are more important determinants of health status for men than women, while body weight and being physically inactive are more important for women than men. Our findings suggest the value of models which include a wide range of structural and behavioral variables and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in the determinants of health.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 May,England,1999,90

10346032,Ecological and geographic characteristics predict nutritional status of communities: rapid assessment for poor villages.,"The quality of poverty alleviation programmes relies heavily on appropriate targeting and priority setting. Major problems in assessing poverty include identification of the indicators of poverty and the methods used for its assessment. Nutritional status, expressed by anthropometric indices, has been proposed as a poverty indicator because of its validity, objectivity, reliability and feasibility. This study was conducted to explore the application of remote sensing to poverty mapping based on nutritional status at the community level. Relationships between the nutritional status within a community and the ecological characteristics of the community were investigated. Multiple linear regression tests were executed, and the resultant equations were tested for their validity in predicting communities with poor nutritional status. Among geographical and ecological indicators used, distance to the nearest market, main soil type, rice field area, and perennial cultivation area were found to be most useful predictors for the ranking of the communities by nutritional status. Among non-ecological determinants, food consumption, health service status and living conditions were also found as predictors. The highest correlation was found if total population was also taken into account in the regression model (R2 = 0.69; p < 0.0001). In the assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the eight models studied, 'undernutrition' was defined as a condition where a community belongs in the first quartile for nutritional status (highest prevalence of undernutrition), and the baseline nutritional survey was considered as a standard method for final diagnosis. Most models which included only ecological factors in the equations had lower sensitivity and specificity than models which included all determinant factors in the equations. All models which took into account the total population had higher sensitivity and specificity than those that did not take total population into account. The best model of those that took into account only the geographical and ecological characteristics of the community's living environment had similar sensitivity and specificity (80% and 94.1%, respectively) as the models that considered non-geographical and non-ecological variables in addition to geographical and ecological variables. In the case of West Sumatra, only four ecological and geographic characteristics were sufficient to predict poverty in village. Since these characteristics could be surveyed by remote sensing, it may well be possible to use remote sensing for a rapid method for poverty mapping.",Health policy and planning,1998 Dec,England,1998,90

10400276,The role of social networks and media receptivity in predicting age of smoking initiation: a proportional hazards model of risk and protective factors.,"The increasing prevalence of adolescent smoking demonstrates the need to identify factors associated with early smoking initiation. Previous studies have shown that smoking by social network members and receptivity to pro-tobacco marketing are associated with smoking among adolescents. It is not clear, however, whether these variables also are associated with the age of smoking initiation. Using data from 10,030 California adolescents, this study identified significant correlates of age of smoking initiation using bivariate methods and a multivariate proportional hazards model. Age of smoking initiation was earlier among those adolescents whose friends, siblings, or parents were smokers, and among those adolescents who had a favorite tobacco advertisement, had received tobacco promotional items, or would be willing to use tobacco promotional items. Results suggest that the smoking behavior of social network members and pro-tobacco media influences are important determinants of age of smoking initiation. Because early smoking initiation is associated with higher levels of addiction in adulthood, tobacco control programs should attempt to counter these influences.",Addictive behaviors,1999 May-Jun,England,1999,90
9346048,"Annual incidence of unintentional injury among 54,000 children.","OBJECTIVE: To enhance the case definition of unintentional injuries in childhood by applying an objective severity measure to fatal and non-fatal cases. DESIGN: A descriptive prospective epidemiological study of a defined resident childhood population (< 16 years of age) for a one year period, 1990. SETTING: Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Child population estimate for 1990 was 54,400. SUBJECTS: Resident children who died, were admitted to local hospitals, or attended local accident and emergency departments. OUTCOME MEASURES: Using recognised severity scoring systems (for example the injury severity score, trauma score) injuries were classified as severe, moderate, or mild. RESULTS: There were six deaths, 904 admissions, and 11,682 accident and emergency department attendances. All deaths, 25% of admissions, and 1% of accident and emergency attenders were classified as severe. The underlying determinants of severe injuries are different than those for all other injuries (for example age, social class). A comparison with a local survey in 1986 showed a 26% rise in hospital admissions, but no significant rise in the frequency of severe or moderately injured children. Comparisons with other international data showed higher rates of injury admissions and attendances for England, but no significant differences in the frequency of severe injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Objective severity scoring enhances the case definition of unintentional injuries in childhood by allowing for the identification, and, therefore, the more reliable ascertainment of severely injured children. This more completely ascertained set of population cases increases the accuracy of comparisons of injury frequency over time and by place, and, in addition, enhances our basic understanding about the epidemiological characteristics of childhood unintentional injury.",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,1996 Mar,England,1996,90

DESIGN: Replicated single case study with qualitative and quantitative data analysis. SETTING: University teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: 40 consecutive patients referred for echocardiography either because of symptoms (10 patients) or because of a heart murmur (30). 39 were shown to have a normal heart. INTERVENTIONS: Medical consultations and semistructured patient interviews were tape recorded. Structured interviews with consultant cardiologists were recorded in survey form. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient recall of the explanation and residual understanding, doubt, and anxiety about the heart after the test and post-test consultation. RESULTS: All 10 patients presenting with symptoms were left with anxiety about the heart despite a normal test result and reassurance by the consultant. Of 28 patients referred because of a murmur but shown to have no heart abnormality, 20 became anxious after detection of the murmur; 11 had residual anxiety despite the normal test result. CONCLUSIONS: Reassurance of the ""worried well""-anxious patients with symptoms or patients concerned by a health query resulting from a routine medical examination or from screening-constitutes a large part of medical practice. It seems to be widely assumed that explaining that tests have shown no abnormality is enough to reassure. The results of this study refute this and emphasise the importance of personal and social factors as obstacles to reassurance.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Aug 10,England,1996,90
9107004,Determinants of observed confidant support for divorced mothers.,"Marital separation can be a time of extreme stress and can significantly disrupt support networks and support processes when they are needed most. The purpose of this investigation was to test mechanisms of support erosion in a multimethod study of 138 divorced mothers and their confidants. Previous work was extended by using observational measures of confidant support in a process model including (a) maternal characteristics over time, (b) support person characteristics, and (c) relationship characteristics (intimacy and confidant relationship type). A hypothesized mechanism of erosion was supported in which ongoing maternal distress was positively associated with levels of confidant negativity, which in turn was related to lower levels of observed support. Having a partner was related to more intimacy than was having family and friends. Contrary to expectation, however, having a partner was related to lower levels of support, and intimacy was not related to observed support.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1997 Feb,United States,1997,90
10178658,Average annual drug cost and its determinants in a population based cohort of HIV-positive adult men and women.,"The purpose of this study is to determine drug costs and the sociodemographic and clinical determinants of drug costs in a large open cohort of HIV-positive adult men and women in British Columbia, Canada from 1993 to 1995. The study is descriptive and population-based using time-series data. Individuals included in the study were men and women enrolled in a province-wide HIV/AIDS drug treatment programme who had given consent to access their entire prescription records held by the provincial drug plan. The primary outcome measure was the average annual drug cost for treating HIV/AIDS among programme participants; results were stratified by sociodemographic status, drug category and disease severity. The analysis was restricted to 1271 consenting programme participants. The average annual drug cost per participant in 1996 Canadian dollars ($Can) was $Can3431 in 1993, $Can3892 in 1994 and $Can4377 in 1995. Between 1993 and 1995, the average annual cost of antiretroviral therapies increased by 6.6% ($Can2579 in 1995), anti-infectives increased by 61.4% ($Can2402 in 1995) and other drugs used in the management of patients with HIV disease increased by 35.7% ($Can1146 in 1995). The overall increase over this period was 27.6%. In 1995, the average annual drug cost was $Can4720 for those on social assistance, $Can4545 for seniors and $Can5937 for the general population (nonpoor and nonelderly). In 1995, the average annual drug cost was $Can6887 for those with AIDS and $Can3911 for those without. Multivariate modelling indicated that drug costs were significantly related with CD4+ cell count (p < 0.001), diagnoses of AIDS (p < 0.001), provincial drug plan type (p = 0.002), time participants had spent in the HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program (p = 0.003), number of hospitalisations (p = 0.003) and patient's age (p = 0.004). Our data demonstrate that the average annual drug costs for persons with HIV/AIDS in British Columbia have been increasing even though the cost of antiretrovirals has been relatively stable. This was due mainly to the increase in the cost of anti-infectives and other drugs. Important cost drivers were participant's age, socioeconomic status (by provincial drug insurance coverage level) and rate of disease progression as measured by CD4+ cell counts, hospitalisation events and duration of illness.",PharmacoEconomics,1998 Mar,New Zealand,1998,90
8422295,Regional lung cancer death rates unrelated to smoking? The case of The Netherlands.,"It has been observed in various countries that regional variation in lung cancer mortality can hardly be explained by differences in current smoking. This paper addresses the question of whether mortality variation within. The Netherlands in 1980-1984 is due to differences in past instead of current smoking. A first indication of the role of past smoking is that, within male birth cohorts, regional mortality patterns have been very stable for over 30 years. Reliable data on smoking in 1972 explain 40% of the mortality variation among women, but only 2% of that among men. A crude indicator on smoking in 1930 explained 43% of the mortality variation among men aged 75+ years (correlation = 0.66). The lack of a relationship with smoking in 1972 appears to be due to a radical change in regional smoking differences, which caused smoking in 1972 to be unrelated to smoking in 1930; long time lags, so that these changes were not yet followed by changes in regional mortality differences. It is concluded that the explanation of regional lung cancer death rates sometimes has to go far back in time. Studying determinants of lung cancer by means of regional analyses requires a more detailed control for smoking history than has been usual.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",1993,England,1993,90
17214174,Human fascioliasis in an Egyptian village: prevalence and some epidemiological determinants.,"A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Abis area, 15 kilometers south east of Alexandria city, to determine the prevalence of human fascioliasis and to study some of the epidemiological determinants which may affect the infection. A specially designed questionnaire interview was completed, and a total number of 3475 stool samples were examined. The results revealed a prevalence rate of fascioliasis of 11% in the studied area which was only second to S. mansoni. The prevalence of infection was significantly higher among females in general and specifically in the age group 5 to less than 15 years and 25 to less than 35 years. Family aggregation of fasciola infection was noticed among the studied group. The prevalence and also the risk of infection were significantly higher among children whose mothers were infected. They were, however, insignificantly higher among illiterate, single males, and low social class group. In addition, the prevalence and risk of infection were significantly higher among individuals obtaining their raw green leafy vegetables from multiple sources. From the results it was concluded that human fascioliasis is an important public health problem in Abis area with increased risk of spread of infection to Alexandria city through raw green leafy vegetables which represent the main source of infection.",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,1995,England,1995,90
2004868,Women and AIDS in Zimbabwe: the making of an epidemic.,"As the AIDS epidemic in Africa assumes major proportions, the need to understand the social context in which heterosexual transmission occurs takes on urgent importance. In this article we explore how the intersection of traditional culture with the colonial legacy and present-day political economy has influenced family structure and sexual relations, and particularly the social position of women. Drawing on Zimbabwe's historical experience, we show how land expropriation, rural impoverishment, and the forcible introduction of male migrant labor fostered new patterns of sexual relations, characterized by multiple partners. Traditional patriarchal values reinterpreted in European law resulted in further subjugation of women as even limited rights to ownership were withdrawn. For many women, sexual relations with men, either within marriage (for the majority) or outside, become inextricably linked to economic and social survival. In this setting, all sexually transmitted diseases became rampant, including genital ulcer, which facilitates transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Intervention programs to halt the spread of AIDS need to take into the account the epidemic's historical roots and social nature. For example, efforts to reduce risk of HIV transmission should seek to expand women's limited options, both technically (e.g., by providing alternatives to condoms) and socially (e.g., by promoting employment).","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1991,United States,1991,90

As predicted, future outlook had a powerful association with dyadic conflict. Other strong predictors of conflict for care receivers were current state of happiness and changes in the relationship over a 3-year period. For caregivers, conflict was associated with care receivers' lack of social participation with family and friends, and changes in dyadic relationship.",The Gerontologist,1992 Feb,United States,1992,90
12345040,Socio-cultural organization and fertility attitudes and behaviour of wives in Ezibeleni Township (Transkei).,"""The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of socio-cultural organization on both desired and completed fertility of a group of married women in Ezibeleni township in the Transkei. Among the socio-cultural factors examined were religion, education, labour force participation, age, age at marriage, duration of marriage, birth and marriage cohorts etc. We found sufficient evidence to support the contention that childbearing is a fundamentally social behaviour. On the whole, families tend to be large in the township. The higher a woman's socio-economic status, the smaller the size of her family. Contrary to existing findings, age at marriage is positively associated with achieved family size, while the timing of entry into a marital union is negatively associated with desired family size. Finally, fertility desires have been changing over the years with the younger generation of wives desiring smaller family sizes compared to the older generation.""

9277007,High mortality despite good care-seeking behaviour: a community study of childhood deaths in Guinea-Bissau.,"The care-seeking behaviour of mothers of 125 children deceased aged 1-30 months was investigated by verbal autopsy in an urban area of Guinea-Bissau. A total of 93% of the children were seen at a health centre or hospital during the 2 weeks before death. In a previous survey covering the period 1987-90 we found that 78% of the children who died had presented for consultation (8); despite this increase in care seeking, infant mortality had not decreased. Comparison of elapsed time from disease onset to first consultation between children who died and matched surviving controls indicated that the interval was shorter for children who died than for those who survived (odds ratio (OR) = 0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-0.99). Of the 125 terminally ill children, 56 were hospitalized. A total of 20 children died on the way to hospital or while waiting in the outpatient clinic. Lack of hospital beds resulted in 15 mothers being refused hospitalization for their child. Of hospitalized children, 42% were discharged as improved or recovered during the 30 days preceding death. These results reveal a need for improved hospital admission criteria, improved recognition of the symptoms of serious illness, better discharge criteria, and the implementation of quality assurance systems for health services.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,1997,Switzerland,1997,90

The analysis tests the hypothesis that the negative effect on educational attainment often associated with living in a mother-only or stepfather family stems primarily from the reduced level of economic resources available to these households. Empirical findings indicate that living with a widowed, divorced, or separated mother has little or no effect on educational attainment once we control for economic status.

8242586,A clinician-driven home care delivery system.,"The financial, entrepreneurial, administrative, and legal forces acting within the home care arena make it difficult for clinicians to develop and operate home care initiatives within an academic setting. HomeMed is a clinician-initiated and -directed home care delivery system wholly owned by the University of Michigan. The advantages of a clinician-directed system include: Assurance that clinical and patient-based factors are the primary determinants of strategic and procedural decisions; Responsiveness of the system to clinician needs; Maintenance of an important role for the referring physician in home care; Economical clinical research by facilitation of protocol therapy in ambulatory and home settings; Reduction of lengths of hospital stays through clinician initiatives; Incorporation of outcome analysis and other research programs into the mission of the system; Clinician commitment to success of the system; and Clinician input on revenue use. Potential disadvantages of a clinician-based system include: Entrepreneurial, financial, and legal naivete; Disconnection from institutional administrative and data management resources; and Inadequate clinician interest and commitment. The University of Michigan HomeMed experience demonstrates a model of clinician-initiated and -directed home care delivery that has been innovative, profitable, and clinically excellent, has engendered broad physician, nurse, pharmacist, and social worker enthusiasm, and has supported individual investigator clinical protocols as well as broad outcomes research initiatives. It is concluded that a clinician-initiated and -directed home care program is feasible and effective, and in some settings may be optimal.",Cancer,1993 Dec 1,United States,1993,90

7906766,Childhood and adult socioeconomic status as predictors of mortality in Finland.,"Research has suggested that social-class differences in adult health may be at least partly determined by conditions earlier in life. In 2636 Finnish men, we assessed impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic conditions on adult mortality risk by examining whether differing socioeconomic life-courses from early childhood to adulthood were associated with different risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Compared with high-income adults, those with low income had increased relative risks of all-cause (2.54, 95% CI 1.83-3.53) and cardiovascular (2.37, 1.51-3.7) mortality, but these increased risks were not related in either adult group to childhood socioeconomic conditions. Men who went from low-income childhood to high-income adulthood had the same mortality risks as those whose socioeconomic circumstances were good in both childhood and adulthood (1.14, 0.56-2.31, all causes; 0.99, 0.39-2.51, cardiovascular). By contrast, men who experienced poor socioeconomic circumstances as both children and adults were about twice as likely to die as those whose position improved (2.39, 1.28-4.44, all causes; 2.02, 0.9-4.54, cardiovascular). Our findings suggest that socioeconomic conditions in childhood are not important determinants of adult health. We caution against this interpretation--a life-course approach to socioeconomic differences in adult health requires understanding of the social and economic context in which individual life-courses are determined.","Lancet (London, England)",1994 Feb 26,England,1994,90
10564848,"[Determinants of quitting smoking in Catalonia, Spain].","OBJECTIVE: While trends in the prevalence of smoking and ex-smoking in Catalonia, Spain have been monitored, the characteristics of those smokers who quit have not been investigated. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the prevalence of cessation, or quit ratio, in Catalonia and to study its sociodemographic, life-style, and smoking correlates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data collected in the Catalan Health Interview Survey conducted in 1994. This is a cross-sectional study based on a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population of Catalonia. We included for analysis a total of 5,424 subjects (3,649 males and 1,775 females) who declared to be current smokers (2,335 males and 1,331 females) or past smokers (1,314 males and 444 females). We computed the crude and age-standardized quit ratios (QR) or prevalence of cessation, as well as the odds ratio (OR) of quitting smoking, according to gender and the variables studied. RESULTS: The age-standardized QR was 31. 8% for males and 30.9% for females and increased with age. The QR was, both in males and females, greater among married subjects, with higher socioeconomic status, and with healthy life-styles (moderate and heavy leisure physical activity and moderate alcohol consumption). The OR of quitting smoking was higher in heavy smokers (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 2.2-3.8; smokers of > 30 cigarettes/day vs. 1-10 cigarettes/day) in males, while it was < 1 for females of medium intensity, conforming a shaped curve rather than a linear trend (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.9, in heavy smokers). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a positive association in males and females between quitting smoking and increasing age, a higher socioeconomic level, heavy smoking, and healthy life-styles. The identification of these groups should facilitate the planning of successful interventions. Further effort is also necessary to target groups with low cessation rates, such as individuals in disadvantaged social classes and light smokers.",Gaceta sanitaria,1999 Sep-Oct,Spain,1999,90
7964331,Coronary heart disease rates within a small urban area in Belgium.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify geographical differences in coronary heart disease (CHD) attack rates in a small urban area and to relate these to indicators of socioeconomic class. DESIGN: CHD attack rates were calculated from data of the Ghent MONICA myocardial infarct register for the period 1983-87. The city of Ghent is subdivided into 201 sectors based on morphological, and socioeconomic characteristics. During the national census of 1981, the main determinants of residential differentiation were measured. These sector variables were linked with the CHD attack rates. PATIENTS: All residents of the city aged 25-69 years are prospectively followed with regard to heart attacks. Between 1982 and 1987, 1728 suffered an acute heart attack according to MONICA criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.05) differences in age and sex standarised attack rates were observed between city sectors. These differences were related to an index of socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: Within a small urban area, significant geographical differences occur in CHD attack rates and these are related to socioeconomic status.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1994 Aug,England,1994,90
7996589,The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years.,"The term ""gender role"" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ""gender identity"" was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.",Journal of sex & marital therapy,1994 Fall,England,1994,90
2347833,Determinants of maternal child-rearing attitudes.,"This study investigated the correlates of negative attitudes toward child-rearing among low-income urban black and Hispanic mothers. Using a randomized block procedure, 144 adolescents and 139 adults giving birth to healthy infants at a large metropolitan hospital were recruited. All consenting women were interviewed in the hospital within 2 days after delivery, using standardized measures of child-rearing attitudes, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social support, and cognitive ability. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that depressive symptoms, cognitive ability, and two demographic characteristics (maternal age and spoken language) accounted for 42.4% of the variance in negative childrearing attitudes during the postpartum period. The contributions of social support and self-esteem were no longer significant when the effects of the other psychosocial factors were taken into consideration simultaneously. The utility of early assessment of maternal attitudes as a marker for maternal risk status is addressed. The adaptive function of maternal attitudes and the implications for child-rearing practices are discussed in relation to the process of acculturation.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1990 May,United States,1990,90

8698013,Induced abortion in Kenya: its determinants and associated factors.,"In a study involving 1077 women who were admitted and treated for incomplete abortion and its related problems at eight hospitals (seven district and one mission hospitals) in six of the eight provinces of Kenya, between October 1988 and March 1989, 169 (15.7%) had illegally induced unsafe abortion, based on their own history and clinical findings. The illegally induced unsafe abortions were common among both rural and urban dwellers, and women from almost all social and economic strata were involved. However, they were more common among the youth (< 25 year olds), school girls, those with high formal education, in formal employment, and not currently married. Majority (90.4%), of the induced group said their pregnancies were unwanted, as compared to only 29.1% of the non-induced (p < 0.05). The main determining factor for termination of pregnancy amongst these women appeared to be the fact that it was unwanted and/or unplanned, either because of inappropriate timing, the type of man responsible, the relationship itself and the social and economic implications thereof. This is contributed to by poor contraceptive use inspite of very good awareness, and/or desire to use. There is urgent need to integrate abortion care and related services into the overall reproductive health care and as a part of the broader safe motherhood initiative in Kenya. In addition it is necessary to revise the legal provisions on abortion so as to make them more relevant. Appropriate management of adolescent fertility, should be undertaken with the aim of reducing the extent of illegally induced unsafe abortion with attendant sequealae.",East African medical journal,1996 Mar,Kenya,1996,90

Participants either were guaranteed $5.00 to prepare and deliver a brief speech or were told that the money was contingent on an evaluation by the experimenter. Participants believed that their speech would be rated for either simple clarity or verbal intelligence. The contingent incentive increased systolic blood pressure reactivity by 6.5 mmHg (32%). Evaluative threat increased systolic reactivity by 7.1 mmHg (36%).

Researchers attempted to contact all randomized participants, not just those who completed treatment. The processes by which baseline characteristics, early treatment-research experiences, and short-term outcome affected subsequent participations were examined using logistic regression. The analyses deal primarily with refusal, the main reason for attrition. Baseline characteristics had small effects on likelihood of refusal; research engagement had some impact; but treatment participation had strong effect. Short-term outcome did not predict refusal. These findings, if generalizable, have implications for the conduct and reporting of outcome studies.

Models that assessed the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors to the lability (within-individual variability over time) of these measures were fitted to the data. Previous results concerning the substantial genetic involvement in the level of neuroticism and symptoms were confirmed. However, it was found that neither genes nor the shared environment of the twins was a significant cause of lability of these measures. An attempt was therefore made to identify aspects of individuals' environments that might be responsible for lability of neuroticism and symptoms. Adverse life events were found to predict variability of symptoms, but not of neuroticism. The availability of close social ties or having affectionless control in childhood did not contribute to lability.",Psychological medicine,1990 Aug,England,1990,90
12321181,"The new economic policy and permanent migration in Zhejiang Province, China.","""This article examines the impact of economic reforms on the volume and characteristics of permanent migration in Zhejiang Province, China. The data suggest that the new economic policy induced a surge in permanent migration during the post-reform years. Such positive impact of the reform on permanent migration has started to fade away in 1985, as government relaxed its control over residence. Moreover, market mechanisms started playing a more important role in employment, exchange, and consumption. The data also suggest that the new economic policy has particularly favored the better educated, and thereby increased educational differentials between permanent migrants and nonmigrants. For all other characteristics examined, the results show consistently that post-reform migrants are less differentiated from nonmigrants than their pre-reform counterparts.""

8405611,"Race, intervening variables, and two components of low birth weight.","The low birth weight (LBW) gap between blacks and whites has remained largely unexplained in past research. Most previous research on the topic has focused on LBW as a single entity, and without using a causal framework for analysis. The present study examines the determinants of race differences in the two main components of LBW--preterm birth (PRETERM) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)-within a partially causal framework that includes social and proximate explanatory variables. The data come from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth. This study asks, first, through what intervening variables do race and other exogenous sociodemographic variables operate to raise the risk of these adverse pregnancy outcomes? Second, what are the determinants of the two components of LBW when all explanatory variables are included in the model? The findings reveal differences in how race (and other exogenous variables) act through downstream variables to affect PRETERM and IUGR, as well as differences in the net determinants of these pregnancy outcomes. The models are better able to account statistically for race differences in IUGR (which is explained by intervening sociodemographic, attitude, and behavior variables) than in PRETERM (which is explained partly by intervening health variables).",Demography,1993 Aug,United States,1993,90
1503162,"Determinants of passive smoking in children in Edinburgh, Scotland.","OBJECTIVES: Using saliva cotinine as a quantitative marker, we examined the contribution of factors other than parental smoking to children's passive exposure to tobacco smoke. METHODS: Saliva specimens from a random sample of 734 7-year-old schoolchildren in Edinburgh, Scotland, were analyzed for cotinine. Their parents completed a questionnaire covering smoking habits and conditions in the home. RESULTS: A number of independent predictors of cotinine were identified in addition to the main one of smoking by household members. These predictors included home ownership, social class, day of the week, season of the year, number of parents present, crowding in the home, the number of children in the household, and sex. Cotinine was higher in children from less advantaged backgrounds, during winter, on Mondays, in girls, and when fewer other children were present. The effects were similar between children from nonsmoking and smoking homes. CONCLUSIONS: Questionnaire measures of parental smoking are insufficient to fully characterize young children's exposure to passive smoking. Because socioeconomic variables contribute to measured exposure, passive-smoking studies that treat class as a confounder and control for it may be overcontrolling.",American journal of public health,1992 Sep,United States,1992,90
1628712,"A comparison of the fertility of Dominican, Puerto Rican and mainland Puerto Rican adolescents.","Data from three fertility surveys are used to examined the probabilities and determinants of adolescent births among Dominican and Puerto Rican women. Young women in the Dominican Republic are the most likely to have had a child by each year of age from 14 through 24, followed by young women on the Island of Puerto Rico; the probability of an early birth is lowest for Puerto Rican women on the U.S. mainland. Eighteen percent of Dominican women have had a child before their 18th birthday, compared with 13% of women living in Puerto Rico, and 10% of Puerto Rican women in metropolitan New York. The cumulative probabilities that Puerto Rican women will have borne a child before their 20th birthday are almost identical, whether the women live on the island or the U.S. mainland, but the difference between Puerto Rican and Dominican women widens. The order is reversed, however, in the analysis of premarital births: The probability of a premarital birth during adolescence is highest for Puerto Rican women in New York, and lowest for Dominican women. In a separate logistic regression analysis, education and age at first sexual intercourse are shown to be important determinants of adolescent fertility in all three populations.",Family planning perspectives,1992 May-Jun,United States,1992,90
7640680,The disablement experienced by traumatically brain-injured adults living in the community.,"The disablement that occurs following traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be extensive and severe and consequently has been difficult to report on in a comprehensive and thorough manner. We were able to address this difficulty by analysing a sub group of data from the Canadian Health and Activity Limitation Survey (HALS) using the theoretical framework of disablement developed by the World Health Organization, the International Classification of Impairment, Disability and Handicap (ICIDH). There were 454 survey respondents (representing 12,290 in the Canadian population) with disability resulting from a TBI and a mean time post-injury of 13 years. Three handicaps identified in the ICIDH were the focus of the study: physical independence, work, social integration. The prevalence of long term handicap was very high with 66% of the sample reporting the need for ongoing assistance with some activities of daily living, 75% not working, and 90% reporting some limitations or dissatisfaction with their social integration. Multivariate regression analysis was used to investigate the determinants of the handicaps. The determinants included: age, gender, level of education, living alone, physical environment, and specific disabilities. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to rehabilitation issues, the usefulness of the ICIDH as a model to investigate outcomes, and directions for future research.",Brain injury,1995 May-Jun,England,1995,90
9114467,A retrospective study of determinants of length of stay in a geropsychiatric state hospital.,"This pilot study investigated the importance of social, clinical, and discharge factors in predicting extended length of stay (LOS) in a state geropsychiatric hospital. The authors reviewed medical records of all first time admissions during a 22 month period. A total of 272 patients age 60 and older were admitted for the first time during this period. Nine variables comprised of medical, demographic, social, and discharge information were examined in retrospective analysis to assess their relationship to LOS. The mean and standard deviation of days spent in hospital was 392.3 +/- 752.81. The median number of days of hospitalization was 72.0. Single marital status, type of living arrangement, polypharmacy, and limited functional status were predictive of LOS. Our findings underscore the challenge within geropsychiatry of treating patients with coexisting medical conditions who also have significant behavioral, mood, and/or cognitive disturbances.",The Psychiatric quarterly,1997 Summer,United States,1997,90
8913996,Alcohol-related measures as factors in traffic fatalities.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if alcohol-related measures (per capita consumption, drinking-driving arrest rate, alcohol abuse treatment rate and Alcoholics Anonymous [AA] membership rate) were related to differences between states in traffic fatality rates (total and alcohol-related). METHOD: Fatality rates were regressed onto the alcohol-related variables, using state level data for 1982 and 1990 as well as measures of relative change between the 2 years. RESULTS: Fatality rates demonstrated significant positive relationships with per capita consumption and drinking-driving arrest rates, and significant negative relationships with AA membership rates, for the years 1982 and 1990. Also, changes in per capita consumption were significantly and positively related to changes in both traffic fatality measures. CONCLUSIONS: Per capita alcohol consumption measures were the strongest and most consistent determinants of traffic fatality measures. The negative relationship between AA membership rates and traffic fatality measures for 1982 and 1990 suggests a beneficial impact of AA on these measures at the aggregate level, although other explanations are possible.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1996 Nov,United States,1996,90
9616410,Blood thiamin status and determinants in the population of Seychelles (Indian Ocean).,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Micronutrient deficiencies have become rare in industrialised countries as availability of fresh food, supplementation, and fortification have improved but a less favourable situation may still prevail in many developing countries. Blood thiamin status and determinants were therefore investigated in the Seychelles in view of the high incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy and as the staple diet is polished rice that is deficient in thiamin. DESIGN: This was a cross sectional population study using an age and sex stratified random sample. SETTING: Seychelles Islands (Indian Ocean). PARTICIPANTS: A subsample of 206 subjects aged 25-64 years from the population of Seychelles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of total thiamin concentration in whole blood using high performance liquid chromatography. Dietary variables measured using a face to face semi-quantitative food questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean (SD) whole blood thiamin concentration was 77.9 (22.4) nmol/l and low concentration (< 70 nmol/l) was found in 37% of the subjects (95% CI: 31%, 44%). Blood thiamin was significantly related to education and diet but not to age, sex, smoking, and body mass index. Blood thiamin was associated positively with meat, vegetable, salad, and tea intake and negatively with alcohol and fish intake. However, no combination of the examined variables could explain more than 15% of the observed variance in blood thiamin values. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the distribution of blood thiamin in the sampled population is shifted to lower values compared with that generally accepted as normal in European populations. Further research should establish the significance of such lower values in this specific population to facilitate clinical and public health action as necessary.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1998 Apr,England,1998,90
9649962,Predictors of cessation of marijuana use: an event history analysis.,"Event history analysis was applied to monthly life and drug histories of a representative community sample of 706 marijuana users, followed from ages 15-16 to 34-35, to investigate factors associated with cessation of marijuana use from adolescence to adulthood. In addition to age and gender, the most important determinants of cessation are the phenomenology of marijuana use, social role participation, depressive symptoms and deviance. Frequent users, those who started using early and those who use illicit drugs other than marijuana are more likely to continue their marijuana use. Using marijuana for social reasons accelerates cessation, using to change one's mood reduces cessation. Becoming pregnant and a parent is the most important social role leading to marijuana cessation for women. There is also a very important experimental effect of the interview itself on the reported timing of a cessation. The effect of a social context favorable to marijuana use appears to reflect selection rather than social influence.",Drug and alcohol dependence,1998 Apr 1,Ireland,1998,90

9881127,Interacting factors affecting illegitimacy in preindustrial northern England.,"Illegitimacy in a historic, single community at Penrith, Cumbria (1557-1812), has been studied using aggregative analysis, family reconstitution and time series analysis. This population was living under extreme conditions of hardship. Long, medium and short wavelength cycles in the rate of illegitimacy have been identified by time series analysis; each represents a different response to social and economic pressures. In a complex interaction of events, the peaks of the cycles in wheat prices were associated with rises in adult mortality which promoted an influx of migrants and a concomitant rise in illegitimacy. The association between immigration and illegitimacy was particularly noticeable after the mortality crises of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Children of immigrant families also tended to produce illegitimate offspring. Native and immigrant families responded differently to extrinsic fluctuations, and variations in their reproductive behaviour were probably related to access to resources.",Journal of biosocial science,1997 Apr,England,1997,90

The Delphi technique].,"OBJECTIVE: An approach to finding the determinants of the risk of health inequality among foreign immigrants living in the city of Barcelona. DESIGN: A descriptive study done by interviewing a group of key informers, using the Delphi technique. SETTING: Barcelona city Health Region. PARTICIPANTS: 20 professionals from different sectors and levels of care were selected because of the relationship of their work area to the immigrant population. Primary Care, specialist, hospital, Family Planning and Public Health professionals took part from the health field; Primary Care, planning and non-governmental organisations from the social field. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A series of mailed questionnaires were used to elicit the participants' opinions and perceptions of the determinants of foreign immigrants' health inequalities. The final reply figure was 90%. Of the overall points granted to the agreed situations, 52.4% concerned aspects relating to their general living situation, 25.1% to health care and 22.4% to socio-cultural questions. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that, in addition to the health-care field, general living situation and socio-cultural questions play a fundamental part in determining foreign immigrants' health inequalities. We considered that the Delphi was a useful and rapid technique for obtaining qualitative information on the determinants of health inequalities and that it permitted us to contribute information which was complementary to other studies of inequalities which used classical health indicators.",Atencion primaria,1995 Sep 15,Spain,1995,90
7853627,Determinants in Canadian health care workers of the decision to withdraw life support from the critically ill. Canadian Critical Care Trials Group.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the attitudes of health care workers regarding the withdrawal of life support. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: Attending staff, house staff, and intensive care unit (ICU) nurses in 37 Canadian university-affiliated hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health care workers' ratings of the importance of 17 factors considered in the decision to withdraw life support, and their ratings of five levels of care ranging from comfort measures to intensive care in two of 12 different clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We surveyed 1361 respondents (149 of 167 potentially eligible ICU attending staff, 142 of 173 ICU house staff, and 1070 of 1455 ICU nurses, with response rates of 89%, 82% and 74%, respectively). The most important factors were likelihood of surviving the current episode, likelihood of long-term survival, premorbid cognitive function, and age of the patient. In choosing the level of care for the patient scenarios, the same option was chosen by more than 50% of respondents in only one of 12 scenarios; opposite extremes of care were chosen by more than 10% of the respondents in eight of 12 scenarios. Respondent characteristics affecting choices included the number of years since graduation, the city and province in which they worked, the number of beds in their ICU, and their assessment of the likelihood that they would withdraw life support in comparison with their colleagues (P < .001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: While ICU health care workers consistently identify a number of patient factors as important in decisions to withdraw care, there is extreme variability, which may be explained in part by the values of individual health care providers.",JAMA,1995 Mar 1,United States,1995,90
21544449,Predictors of the interval between onset of symptoms and first medical visit in patients with digestive tract cancer.,"Lack of effective population screening programmes for digestive tract cancer makes a prompt diagnosis of symptomatic patients the primary option for early detection. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics and determinants of the interval between the first medical symptom and the first medical visit (ISV) in a sample of symptomatic patients of mid-low socioeconomic level admitted to hospital for a digestive tract cancer. During two years, 183 patients were personally interviewed with a structured questionnaire designed to elicit initial symptoms of digestive cancer. Fifty-seven percent consulted a physician during the first month after onset of symptoms, and over two-thirds did so within the first 2 months, but it took more than 3 months for 22.4% of the patients. In univariate analyses, the ISV was longer among patients illiterate, unemployed and in the lower social classes. The interval was also significantly longer when the physician-interviewer judged that the patient did not correctly identify the first symptom (p<0.05). In multivariate analyses, the chance of a longer ISV was 2.8 times higher in men; 16 times higher in unemployed patients; 9 times higher in patients with a first symptom of the lower digestive tract; and it increased 8-fold in subjects who attributed no importance to the first manifestation (all p<0.05). In spite of virtually universal health coverage, social factors seemed to act as barriers to seeking medical help in a subgroup of patients. Their procrastination was also related to the nature of the initial symptoms. Achieving an early clinical detection of digestive cancers may be difficult in some segments of the population, and may require substantial improvements in access to and the efficiency of the health system.",International journal of oncology,1996 May,Greece,1996,90

8636902,Dispositional and situational determinants of repression.,This research project posits a model of repression that incorporates both repressive personality and repressive social behavior. The 1st parameter of the model specifies the motivation for repressors' distancing of themselves from emotional events. Experiment 1 demonstrates that repressors are hypersensitive--in their cognitive attention--to both negative and positive emotional events. The 2nd parameter of the model specifies the conditions under which repressors distance themselves from emotional events. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that repressors psychologically distance themselves when the situation threatens their self-evaluation and provides opportunity for them to attend to and process self-relevant and non-self-relevant information. This 2-factor model extends the current conceptualization of repression in that it identifies motivation (dispositional emotional sensitivity) and context (situational threats to self-evaluation and distraction availability) for repressors' distancing of themselves from negative and positive emotional events.,Journal of personality and social psychology,1996 Apr,United States,1996,90
1644512,"Freidson then and now: an ""internalist"" critique of Freidson's past and present views of the medical profession.","Freidson is a foremost analyst of the medical profession. Most recently Freidson attacks those who claim that medicine is declining in power. He insists that medicine has not lost the core elements that make it a powerful, indeed, the dominant, health profession. The author compares Freidson's early writings on medicine with his most recent ones, and shows that there are critical confusions in Freidson's central concepts of professional autonomy and dominance. This difficulty is illuminated by viewing dominance, autonomy, and subordination as on a continuum of control. Using this continuum, the author argues that Freidson implicitly admits what he set out to deny (that medicine has not declined in power) by shifting his focus from medical dominance to that of autonomy. Freidson also now rejects valid parts of his earlier work (that which emphasizes social structural determinants of behavior over socialization). In equating medicine in the United States with teaching in that country, Freidson's contention of ""little change in medical power"" meets its own refutation. Finally, despite his derogation of others, Freidson's lack of an adequate framework to explain the dynamics and not simply the structure of health care produces purely normative, utopian (and unhelpful) policy recommendations.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1992,United States,1992,90
9084798,"The spread of AIDS and the re-emergence of tuberculosis in Catalonia, Spain.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of HIV/AIDS on the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and to analyse the determinants of TB presenting as the first indicative disease of AIDS. DESIGN: Analysis of TB and AIDS surveillance data. SETTING: Catalonia, north-east Spain. PATIENTS: Two separate sources were used: (i) TB cases reported to the Catalan TB registry diagnosed between January 1982 and December 1993; (ii) AIDS cases reported to the AIDS Catalan registry diagnosed between January 1982 and December 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected and observed TB cases, and number and characteristics of AIDS cases presenting with TB. RESULTS: From 1987 to 1993 the annual TB crude incidence rate increased by 50% to a rate of 49.7 per 100,000, with a least 60% of the increase directly due to AIDS. During that period specific rates among children aged 0-4 years remained high at around 40 per 100,000. A total of 7,010 AIDS cases were diagnosed between 1988 and 1994, of whom 24.3% had TB. Multivariate analysis from those AIDS cases showed that besides male sex, young age, and urban residence, the strongest predictors of TB among AIDS cases were history of imprisonment (odds ratio, 2.16; P < 0.001) and intravenous drug use (odds ratio, 1.65; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The high rates of TB among children and young adults suggest that TB transmission has increased during this period, especially among people at high risk of AIDS. The determinants of individual risk of TB among AIDS patients act together, especially in prisons. The HIV/TB coepidemic is an emerging threat potentially for all and requires expanding targeted measures to prevent and control both disease in our setting.","AIDS (London, England)",1997 Mar 15,England,1997,90

A cross cultural background comparison of general practitioner attitudes towards contraceptive service provision for young adolescent females in Scotland.",No previous studies have examined the influences of cultural background on the provision of contraceptive services to females under 16 years of age. A research project was undertaken to investigate any differences between general practitioners trained in the United Kingdom and those trained in the Indian sub-continent in relation to contraceptive service provision to females under 16 years of age. A self-completion postal questionnaire survey was distributed to 230 unrestricted principal general practitioners across Scotland. Subjects were identified from the Medical Register. Half of the sample consisted of all those working in Scotland who had been trained in the Indian sub-continent. The other half were a comparable group that had been trained in the United Kingdom and were selected by quasi-random quota sampling. The response rate was 57 per cent (131/230). General practitioners in the study who had trained in the Indian sub-continent were found to be significantly less likely to provide contraceptive services to a female under 16 years of age than those who had trained in the United Kingdom. Cultural background may be influential in general practitioner provision of contraceptive services to females below the legal age of consent for sexual intercourse. In order to obtain more conclusive evidence a larger study is necessary. Such investigations must be undertaken with appropriate sensitivity and social awareness.,The British journal of family planning,1998 Jul,England,1998,90

It was hypothesized that the home behaviors of children starting day and inpatient hospital treatment would be rated as significantly more deviant than those of children beginning outpatient treatment, and there would be no significant differences in behavior ratings of children beginning day and inpatient hospital treatment. METHOD: A standardized behavior checklist was completed by the primary parent at the time treatment was begun. Scores on four factor scales were obtained, and a multivariate analysis of covariance was carried out. RESULTS: The hypotheses were partially supported. Children beginning day and inpatient hospitalization were seen as more disordered, anxious, and aggressive than were those starting outpatient treatment; children starting day treatment were reported as more learning disabled than were those in both outpatient and inpatient settings; and children entering the inpatient setting were perceived as more aggressive than were those in day treatment. CONCLUSION: Aggressive behavior and learning disability appear to be determinants of choice of treatment setting. The progression from least to most restrictive placement was demonstrated for aggressive behavior only.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1994 Jan,United States,1994,90

The variability and determinants of the therapeutic approach of primary care physicians].,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the influence of independent factors, relating to the characteristics of primary care doctors, patients and the illness, on therapeutic attitudes and their variability before anxiety disorders. DESIGN: Observational study of people attending primary care family medicine clinics who are identified as suffering anxiety disorders. SETTING: The autonomous Communities of Castilla and Leon, the Basque Country and the Valencian Community. PARTICIPANTS: 3247 patients over 18 classified by their doctors as suffering an anxiety disorder. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During 1995, 317 primary care doctors collected information from patients with anxiety disorders (CIE codes F40 and F41). The information was gathered with the same questionnaire in the three communities. The data were validated monthly before the final analysis. Women doctors gave less medical advice than male doctors (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.36-0.65). Patients with anxiety in Castilla and Leon were at greater ""risk"" of receiving drugs treatment than those in the Basque Country (OR: 1.64, CI: 1.31-2.06). When the consultation was for any mental symptom or when the kind of anxiety was a panic disorder (OR: 2.39, CI: 1.53-3.65), phobic disorder (OR: 2.17, CI: 1.52-3.08) or mixed anxiety disorder (OR: 2.20, CI: 1.77-2.73), patients were more likely to be referred for specialist treatment. If it was decided to prescribe drugs treatment, women doctors used more often than their male colleagues a mixed treatment with anti-depressants, anxiolytic drugs and drugs for psychosis (OR: 1.60, CI: 160-4.28). Castilla and Leon, and the Valencian Community were less likely to use mixed treatment than the Basque Country reference group. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the variability in the difficulties encountered in diagnosis and finding a common standard of conduct for primary care doctors faced with patients suffering anxiety disorders. Although the treatment used for anxiety can be considered adequate in most cases, there is high variability, which depends mainly on the type and other characteristics of the process, the patient and the professional.",Atencion primaria,1999 Dec,Spain,1999,90
9179583,"The association between substance use, condom use and sexual risk among low-income women.","Substance use is frequently assumed to be associated with higher levels of sexual risk-taking and lower levels of condom use. An analysis of 668 black, Hispanic and white low-income women at public health and public assistance facilities in Miami show that 19% engaged in risky sexual behavior over the preceding six months, 24% in substance use and 31% in condom use. Overall, substance users are nearly four and one-half times more likely to take sexual risks than nonusers, but are about half as likely to have relied on condoms. When the probability of condom use is considered in the context of both substance use and sexual risk, substance users who take sexual risks appear just as likely to rely on condoms as are nonusers who take sexual risks and those who do not (odds of 0.43-0.49). However, substance users who do not take sexual risks are much less likely to use condoms (odds of 0.15). This pattern holds among black, Hispanic and white women, and suggests that perceptions of risk and the risks that partners bring to sexual encounters may be more important determinants of condom use than substance use per se.",Family planning perspectives,1997 May-Jun,United States,1997,90

9268254,Determinants of regular source of care among homeless adults in Los Angeles.,"OBJECTIVES: The authors explore the determinants of having a regular source of care in a community-based probability sample of homeless adults in Los Angeles. Results from this study should be more representative than those from previous studies of the homeless that are clinic- or shelter-based. In addition to those factors found to be barriers to regular sources of care in the general population, we hypothesized that psychosocial characteristics of the homeless and the homeless lifestyle would negatively impact their likelihood of having a regular source of care. METHODS: The authors conducted a multiple logistic regression to predict regular source of care among the homeless, using an adaptation of the Behavioral Model of health services utilization as an analytic framework. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the sample reported that they had a regular source of care. Of those with a source of care, 30% reported a hospital outpatient department; 25% reported a community or homeless clinic; 23% reported a hospital emergency room; 14% reported a government clinic; and 9% reported a private physician's office as their source of care. Some factors found to be barriers to having a regular source of care in the general population (male, Hispanic, young age) also were barriers among homeless adults. Additional barriers in this sample included homelessness-related characteristics such as competing needs, long-term homelessness, and social isolation. Chronic mental illness and chronic substance dependence were not related to having a source of care among the homeless. Characteristics that increased the likelihood of having a regular source of care in the general population (poor health status, Medicaid) were not related to having a regular source of care among the homeless. CONCLUSIONS: In a context of limited resources, the distribution of regular source of care among the homeless appears to be highly inequitable. Although some of the characteristics identifying those with a regular source of care suggest differential patterns of behavior across subgroups, others suggest differential advantage in access to care and a lack of fit between the needs of the homeless and the organization of health services.",Medical care,1997 Aug,United States,1997,90
1950174,Socio-demographic determinants of stopping smoking from Italian population-based surveys.,"Frequency and determinants of smoking cessation were analysed using data from two Italian National Health Surveys, conducted in 1983 and 1986-87 on samples of 89,753 and 77,155 individuals respectively, randomly selected within strata of region of residence, size of the municipality and of the household, in order to be representative of the general Italian population. Overall stopping ratios or ""quit ratios"" (i.e., ratios between ex- and ever-smokers) were 20.5% for males and 9.0% for females in the 1983 survey, and rose to 23.2 and 11.9% respectively in 1986-87. With reference to age, stopping rates were slightly higher for females than for males below age 35, but considerably higher for males in each subsequent age group, particularly in middle age. Ratios were apparently higher for the most recent survey for both sexes and each subsequent age group. After standardisation for age, ""quit ratios"" in both sexes were directly related with education. Cessation of smoking was more common in northern (and richer) areas of the country, and positively associated with the prevalence of smoking-related chronic diseases. The major, and most discouraging, finding from these analyses is the absolute low rate of stopping in Italy as compared to northern America or northern Europe, although some positive tendency towards increasing cessation was evident between the early and the late 1980s. These tendencies, together with some recent drops in smoking prevalence in younger women, first observed after decades of increase, indicate a change at least in attitudes towards reporting smoking, and hence social acceptance of the habit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,1991,Switzerland,1991,90
1879391,Changes in condom use among homosexual men in San Francisco.,"Employed data from two longitudinal surveys of gay men in San Francisco (a) to examine for cohort (Study 1) and attrition (Studies 1 and 2) bias effects on reported changes in condom use by gay men and (b) to investigate predictors of condom use (Study 2). Substantial increases in condom use were observed, and these changes were unrelated to attrition and cohort bias. In terms of predictors of condom use, men who always used condoms had higher levels of social support from informal sources of help, had more positive expectations that condoms would have positive interpersonal and personal consequences, and were more likely to be HIV positive than men who used condoms occasionally or never. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for HIV-prevention research.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1991,United States,1991,90
2065639,Total and domestic consumption of salt and their determinants in three regions of Italy.,"Total and domestic (discretionary) consumption of salt was assessed in a sample of 91 households, which were randomly selected in three areas of Italy characterized by different dietary habits. Total salt intake was estimated by the mean urinary sodium in four 24 h collections. Discretionary salt, added during the preparation of the meals or at the table, was assessed using a simplified protocol of the lithium marker technique. Total sodium excretion was 191 mmol/d, 160 mmol/d and 132 mmol/d in adult males, adult females and children respectively. Dietary sodium density was 15 mmol per MJ of energy in children and 19 mmol/MJ in adults. It was significantly lower in the area where the traditional consumption of unsalted bread persists. Discretionary sodium intake was 67 mmol/d in adult males and females and 43 mmol/d in children; equivalent respectively to 36 per cent, 39 per cent and 34 per cent of total sodium intake. No difference was found between urban and rural environments, whereas discretionary use of salt was higher in the lower social class. These findings have important nutrition policy implications for the lowering of salt intake in the general population.",European journal of clinical nutrition,1991 Mar,England,1991,90
8862153,The use of theory based semistructured elicitation questionnaires: formative research for CDC's Prevention Marketing Initiative.,"Through one of its many HIV prevention programs, the Prevention Marketing Initiative, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention promotes a multifaceted strategy for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS among people less than 25 years of age. The Prevention Marketing Initiative is an application of marketing and consumer-oriented technologies that rely heavily on behavioral research and behavior change theories to bring the behavioral and social sciences to bear on practical program planning decisions. One objective of the Prevention Marketing Initiative is to encourage consistent and correct condom use among sexually active young adults. Qualitative formative research is being conducted in several segments of the population of heterosexually active, unmarried young adults between 18 and 25 using a semistructured elicitation procedure to identify and understand underlying behavioral determinants of consistent condom use. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the use of this type of qualitative research methodology in designing effective theory-based behavior change interventions. Issues of research design and data collection and analysis are discussed. To illustrate the methodology, results of content analyses of selected responses to open-ended questions on consistent condom use are presented by gender (male, female), ethnic group (white, African American), and consistency of condom use (always, sometimes). This type of formative research can be applied immediately to designing programs and is invaluable for valid and relevant larger-scale quantitative research.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",1996,United States,1996,90
9009810,Social determinants of cardiovascular reactivity: effects of incentive to exert influence and evaluative threat.,The effects on cardiovascular reactivity of incentive to influence the judgements of the experimenter and the threat of social evaluation were examined in a sample of 60 male and 60 female undergraduates. Participants either were guaranteed $5.00 to prepare and deliver a brief speech or were told that the money was contingent on an evaluation by the experimenter. Participants believed that their speech would be rated for either simple clarity or verbal intelligence. The contingent incentive increased systolic blood pressure reactivity by 6.5 mmHg (32%). Evaluative threat increased systolic reactivity by 7.1 mmHg (36%). These interpersonal processes could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and are likely to affect the degree of cardiovascular reactivity in laboratory studies.,Psychophysiology,1997 Jan,United States,1997,90
7983105,The impact of husband's and wife's education and occupation on family size in Zimbabwe.,"This paper assesses the impact of husband's and wife's education and occupation on family size in Zimbabwe. Results from the 1988 Male Fertility Survey indicate that husband's education had a strong negative effect, and wife's education had a moderate negative effect on the number of children ever born. Contrary to the literature, wives who were not employed had significantly fewer children than those who work in agriculture, and fewer, but not significantly, than those in non-agricultural occupations. Findings show the importance of husband's education and the changing dynamics of wife's occupation in fertility decline.",Journal of biosocial science,1994 Oct,England,1994,90
11618375,Anchored narratives: the story and findings of half a century of research into the determinants of fertility.,"This paper reviews half a century of research into the determinants of fertility. It is argued that the quest for the determinants of fertility behaviour and change during that period can best be interpreted as the development of a series of sub-narratives from different disciplinary perspectives and orientations. These are normally based upon the initial narrative of the demographic transition and usually take the form of a verbal theory illustrated by a 'box and arrow' diagram. On occasions formalization has been attempted. Different parts of the initial narrative have been highlighted at different times depending on policy interest, improvements in technical skills, availability of data, changes in social setting, and the degree of satisfaction with the dominant sub-narrative of the day. There is every reason to believe that the research process identified will continue and will lead to a further accumulation of knowledge. In fact, all important variables have probably already been identified. That it will, ultimately, lead to a single, consolidated narrative fully satisfactory for all settings and for all time is, however, highly unlikely.",Population studies,1996 Nov,England,1996,90
10468392,Do measures of self-reported morbidity bias the estimation of the determinants of health care utilisation?,"Most national surveys of health care utilisation capture only self-reported measures of morbidity. If self-reported morbidity is measured with error, then the results of applied work may be misleading. In this paper we propose a model of the relationship between morbidity and health service utilisation which allows for reporting errors and simultaneity. Errors in self-reported morbidity are expressed as a function of person-specific reporting thresholds and recent contact with health services, arising because of better self-evaluation of current health status or a desire to justify consumption of a publicly-provided good. We demonstrate the bias in ignoring the potential problems of reporting errors and simultaneity for a variety of special cases, but in the general case the biases are of ambiguous sign. The empirical nature of these biases is investigated using limiting long-standing illness (LLI) and recent contact with a General Practitioner (GP) in two waves of The UK Health and Lifestyle Survey. Biomedical measures of functioning are used as objective indicators of health status. We find evidence of substantial and significant differences between individuals in reporting thresholds and some evidence that the reporting of LLI may depend on recent visits to a GP. Adjustments for these biases significantly increase the estimated effect of morbidity on utilisation.",Social science & medicine (1982),1999 Oct,England,1999,90
8044971,Determinants of coronary artery reactivity in premenopausal female cynomolgus monkeys with diet-induced atherosclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify determinants of coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal female monkeys. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal females modulates reactivity of atherosclerotic coronary arteries. However, no studies have evaluated the factors that modulate coronary artery reactivity among premenopausal females. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five adult premenopausal female monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 32 months. During this time, monkeys were housed in small social groups and determined to be socially dominant (associated with normal ovarian function) or subordinate (associated with impaired ovarian function). After 32 months, coronary artery vasomotor responses to intracoronary acetylcholine, nitroglycerin, and serotonin were assessed by computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography. Coronary arteries of dominant monkeys dilated (+9 +/- 2%), whereas those of subordinate monkeys constricted (-6 +/- 2%) in response to acetylcholine (P < .05). There was no effect of social status on vascular response to nitroglycerin or serotonin (P > .10). Vascular responses to acetylcholine were independent of social status effects on plasma lipids, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis extent. The correlation between acetylcholine responses and plasma estradiol concentration measured on the day of angiography was r = .7 (P = < .01). Furthermore, dilation occurred only if plasma estradiol concentrations were greater than 60 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors and endogenous estrogen production are important modulators of acetylcholine-mediated dilation of atherosclerotic coronary arteries among premenopausal female monkeys.",Circulation,1994 Aug,United States,1994,90
7798578,Moderators and determinants of satisfaction with diet counseling for patients consuming a therapeutic diet.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify moderators and key determinants of patient satisfaction with diet counseling. DESIGN: Survey questionnaire. SETTING: A French-Canadian acute-care urban hospital. SUBJECTS: Population of eligible patients hospitalized for a minimum stay of 5 days. Patients excluded from the study were those with notable physical, cognitive, or emotional limitations; those receiving enteral and parenteral nutrition; and those from long-term-care units. Analyses were performed on 49 patients who consumed a therapeutic diet and who received diet counseling during their current hospital stay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall satisfaction with diet counseling, compliance intentions, and satisfaction with four components of diet counseling. Measures were taken on seven-point graphic scales and five-point semantic scales. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Reliability estimates with Cronbach's alpha correlation coefficient, stepwise multiple regression analyses, t tests, and one-way analyses of variance. RESULTS: Facilitation skills and knowledge components of diet counseling were the key determinants of patient satisfaction. Among the moderators of patient satisfaction with diet counseling, women and patients with a good appetite were more satisfied with the knowledge components and had stronger compliance intentions. Patients who spent more than 50% of the time at rest were less satisfied than more active patients. APPLICATIONS: Enhancing patient satisfaction implies having a good understanding of a patient's social and cultural context, developing problem-solving skills, and demonstrating greater flexibility and creativity about the means of providing diet counseling.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,1995 Jan,United States,1995,90
10073193,Exploratory analysis of factors associated with teens' repeated childbearing.,"This study was designed to explore the factors regarding unique determinants of repeat childbearing among teens. The influence that key people have on subsequent teen childbearing is examined. Data for this research were gathered in focus groups with teen mothers and parents of teen mothers who access the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in Georgia. Based on the results, repeated childbearing appears to occur within the context of poor parent-child relations, conflicting support for the roles teen mothers are expected to assume, limited social pressures for effective fathering, and limited access to social services for all family members. Pregnancy prevention efforts by agencies for teen mothers should coordinate services for the teen mother, her parent, and her partner.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,1998 Feb,United States,1998,90

Although less than 9 percent of interviewees had concrete plans to return, over 32 percent were positively disposed to returning in the future. Key background variables that affect that decision are people's age, sex, social background in China, and their views about returning when they first left China. Concern about children's future was not significant, but having a wife abroad greatly increased the desire to stay abroad. Why people chose not to return varied significantly between people [who had] children and those who didn't.""",Studies in comparative international development,1997 Spring,United States,1997,90
1471566,Psychosocial factors associated with teenage pregnancy in Jamaica.,"The self-esteem and perceived maternal care and control of 134 Jamaican schoolgirls and 108 pregnant adolescents and teenage mothers were compared. The girls were 14 through 17 years of age, from working-class backgrounds, and living in rural and urban areas. Adapted versions of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and the Parental Bonding Instrument were administered. Results indicated that the two groups did not differ in perceived maternal care and control. However, the self-esteem of urban schoolgirls was significantly higher than that of their once-pregnant counterparts. This was also true of the total sample. Urban teenagers without father figures were nearly 2.7 times more likely to have been pregnant than were those living with adult male relatives. Thus, father-figure absence and low self-esteem may combine as risk factors for teenage pregnancy in urban Jamaica.",Adolescence,1992 Winter,United States,1992,90
12345760,A decade of change in contraceptive behaviour in Latin America: a multivariate decomposition analysis.,"This study relies heavily on World Fertility Survey and Demographic and Health Surveys data to examine recent trends and determinants of contraceptive use in five Latin American countries: Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. These countries experienced a substantial increase in contraceptive prevalence in the inter-survey period. Within countries, however, the increase was not equally shared by all social and demographic groups. The study found that relatively disadvantaged groups experienced greater gains in contraceptive use. Despite the prevailing tendency towards convergence, wide differentials in contraceptive behavior among social sectors still persist. A decomposition analysis based on logistic regression revealed that certain shifts in the population composition--i.e., increased proportion of urban and better educated women and a growing proportion of mothers who want to discontinue child-bearing--contributed substantially to the aggregate increase in contraceptive prevalence in most countries. Structural changes, understood as changes in the relations between the explanatory variables and the likelihood of using contraception, were also found to play a significant role in contraceptive use trends, particularly in Colombia.",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1994,United States,1994,90
12349718,Correlates of child mortality in Pakistan: a hazards model analysis.,"This study investigated factors associated with child mortality in an area in Rawalpindi, one of the large cities of Pakistan. Using both demographic and anthropological methods, the research was conducted to specifically examine the process and mechanisms whereby a link is established between child mortality and its covariates. Controlling for the socioeconomic status as a determinant of child mortality, the study population was limited to a lower income stratum living in a homogeneous environment where all households had equal access to health-related and other facilities. Results of the proportional hazards model analysis on 1301 index children suggest that non-economic factors like maternal health-seeking behavior were related to high child mortality. The cultural norm of bearing a large number of children was the most significant correlate. In order of significance, this was followed by contraceptive use, current age of the mother, age at marriage, and the hygienic conditions of the household. The study provides strong evidence of familial clustering of mortality by order of the household.",Pakistan development review,1999 Spring,Pakistan,1999,90

We measured social and dietary characteristics via interview. Levels of DDT metabolites were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The mean values (lipid milk basis) were 0.162 ppm p,p'-DDT; 0.138 ppm o,p'-DDT; and 0.594 ppm 2,2(bis)p-chlorophyenyl-1-1-dichloroethylene (DDE). The main determinants of DDT metabolites were maternal age, lifetime lactation, history of living in an agricultural area, and consumption of salted meat and fish. We estimated that 6.0% of the breast-fed babies had daily intakes of DDT above the level of 0.005 mg/kg d recommended by the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (WHO/FAO).

However, decisive issues of quality, course and determinants cannot be answered sufficiently due to shortcomings of research (e.g. lack of representative samples and adequate measures, reliance on cross-sectional study designs). Grief reactions and their determinants are differentiated in relation to depressiveness and anxiety in 86 patients from a longitudinal study, employing the Perinatal Grief Scale (Thoedter et al. 1988) and standardized symptom checklists. For the majority of the women, around the 10th week of gestation, the embryo is psychologically represented in fantasies, dreams and concrete arrangements in reality. Immediately after the abortion, these women react with painful feelings of ""active grief"" and ""despair"". Additional stresses in the pregnancy and lack of social support predict ""self-reproachful coping"". Women with recurrent abortions who have no children show depressive reactions. Retrospectively, these also present more anxiety and depressive moods during pregnancy. Results support reliability and validity of the grief scale. Implications for counselling and psychotherapy of women after a spontaneous abortion are discussed with respect to these risk constellations.","Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",1992 May,Germany,1992,90
12689499,Personal and social variables as co-determinants of noise annoyance.,"This paper starts with the fact that noise annoyance is partly due to acoustic factors, partly due to so-called moderating variables, i.e. personal and social aspects of the residents. Noise annoyance is considered to be the (long-term) negative evaluation of living conditions with respect to noise. This evaluation is not simply dependent on past disturbances, but on attitudes and expectations, too. The personal factors influencing the evaluation and described here are: Sensitivity to noise, fear of harm connected with the source, personal evaluation of the source, and coping capacity with respect to noise. The social factors described here are: General (social) evaluation of the source, trust or misfeasance with source authorities, history of noise exposure, and expectations of residents. For most of these variables, data from different community studies are used in order to illustrate the respective moderating effect on annoyance. In addition, some of the moderators are presented as possible tools in order to reduce noise annoyance. It is expected that a significant decrease in a negatively moderating variable is as effective in reducing noise annoyance, as is a significant decrease in noise level.",Noise & health,1999,India,1999,90
8816008,Lay theories of heroin addiction.,"This study examined the structure and determinants of lay people's implicit theories of heroin addiction. A questionnaire was derived from interviews with lay people about their beliefs and theories of heroin addiction and academic literature on the subject. One hundred and forty-four subjects completed the questionnaire, in which they rated 105 statements about the causes, correlates and cures of heroin addiction. The three parts of the questionnaire were individually factor analyzed and a clear, interpretable factor structure emerged for each. The factors seemed similar to explicit academic theories, but the exception was beliefs about cure, which did not show overall support for the most clinically used models. When the three factor analyses were combined into a single 'higher-order' factor analysis four factors emerged, labelled moralistic, psychosocial, sociocultural and drug treatment, which reflect more or less coherent views on the nature of heroin addiction. Subjects' political beliefs was the greatest (demographic and attitudinal) determinant of lay beliefs in these factors, with experience of addiction, addicts, drugs and age also highly correlated. Vote was the main determinant and best predictor of the four 'higher-order' structured lay theories: right-wing voters emphasizing moralistic and individualistic theory and left-wing voters supporting the psychological and societal ideas. Implications for policy and interventions to addicts of these lay theories are considered.",Social science & medicine (1982),1996 Jul,England,1996,90
2367820,"Health workers and AIDS: knowledge, attitudes and experiences as determinants of anxiety.","The objective of the study was to measure the level of HIV/AIDS related anxiety among health care workers and identify its determinants. Data were obtained by means of a mailed, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire distributed to 2561 Danish medical doctors, nurses and nursing aides drawn randomly from the lists of members of the respective national associations. The data were analysed on the basis of a pre-study model including 12 variables hypothesizing a hierarchy of causal dependencies with anxiety at the top. 44% of the participants expressed HIV/AIDS related anxiety--hospital workers more than primary care workers, the older less than the younger. Anxiety was significantly associated with negative/restrictive attitudes towards HIV positives and gay men and with low levels of knowledge about HIV transmission and less education about HIV/AIDS. Negative/restrictive attitudes towards HIV positives were associated both with less knowledge regarding HIV transmission and fewer contacts with HIV positives. Similar associations were found regarding gay men. It is suggested that new kinds of training programmes be established which focus much more on attitudes and norms concerning HIV/AIDS--especially among health care workers with only occasional contact with HIV patients.",Scandinavian journal of social medicine,1990 Jun,Sweden,1990,90

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based registry of incident cases of type 1 diabetes among African-American and Latino children in Chicago was used to explore the influence of individual and neighborhood characteristics on diabetes risk. New cases of insulin-treated diabetes in African-American and Latino Chicagoans aged 0-17 years for 1985-1990 (n = 400) were assigned to one of 77 community areas based on street address. Census tables provided denominators, median household income, percentage of adults > or = 25 years old who had completed high school and college, and a crowding variable for each community area individual-level data were birth cohort, sex, and ethnicity. Outcomes in Poisson regression were sex-, ethnic-, and birth cohort-specific incidence rates. RESULTS: Significant univariate associations between diabetes risk and ethnicity, birth cohort, crowding, and the percentage of adults in each community area who had completed high school and college were observed. African-Americans had a relative risk (RR) of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.14-1.76) compared with Latinos. Risk varied significantly by birth cohort in both ethnic groups. For every 10% increase in the proportion of adults who completed college, the RR for diabetes increased by 25% (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.09-1.44]). Social class variables were significant determinants of risk for African Americans, but not for Latinos.

1473867,Time costs and informal social support as determinants of differences between black and white families in the provision of long-term care.,"This paper presents an economic model that predicts the observed racial difference in the mix of informal home and nursing home services used for long-term care by black versus white families. A cause of this difference in services used is a difference between black and white families in the relative prices they pay for particular services. Each group uses relatively more of the relatively less expensive (for that group) form of long-term care. The model indicates three specific hypotheses. The empirical analysis focuses on the Differential Opportunity Cost of Informal Caregiver Time hypothesis. Based on data from the 1982 and 1984 National Long-Term Care Surveys, two sets of results consistent with though not direct tests of this hypothesis are presented.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",1992 Winter,United States,1992,90
1945937,Determinants of health-promotive behavior. A review of current research.,"The determinants of health promotive-behavior are proposed by Pender in the HPM. The exact impact of the various variables on singular behaviors or a lifestyle index, however, is far from conclusive. All the proposed factors have been supported through research, at least in part, as either directly or indirectly influencing the intent to participate in different health behaviors. The difficulty in concluding which variables are most critical is perhaps due to the variety of definitions, theoretical approaches (from different disciplines), and research methods. Of primary concern to this author is the overlap of activities among different ""patterns"" of behavior and the various definitions of such behavioral patterns. Little evidence exists on how specific types of behaviors relate to one another. Thus, knowing the determinants of a lifestyle index, for example, may be insignificant if the goal of nursing is to target priority behaviors that may indeed be influenced by more significant variables. For example, a person's perception of control may be a significant predictor of lifestyle behaviors in general; however, this variable may not impact on the person's decision to engage in changes related to exercise or activity behavior. Hence, because the motives behind various behaviors may be different, it seems more prudent to invest our research efforts on the impact of various factors on singular behaviors rather than lifestyle patterns. Finally, the efforts of nursing research on health behavior have been directed primarily at explaining the impact of various individual perceptions on the likelihood of behavior. Such focus has revealed some evidence of the significance of these variables, yet much unexplained variance remains. Perhaps it would be more prudent to direct attention at those variables such as situational or environmental factors that may impede or act as a cue to healthy behavior. Because the explanation of behavior has been individually focused (perhaps due to an ""individualizing"" theme in nursing education), the impact of the ecological model of behavior tends to be dismissed or underrated in nursing research. Knowledge of the impact of societal factors on behavior may be more appropriate to planning strategies for various groups rather than the behavioristic approaches that separate people from their social, physical, and economic environments. Thus, personal lifestyles may not be a simple matter of informed choice, and attention to the complex processes of societal opportunities, cultural interpretations, and group-specific attitudes must be studied further.",The Nursing clinics of North America,1991 Dec,United States,1991,90
8173825,Culture and schizophrenia: the DOSMD challenge.,"The World Health Organization's International Pilot Study on Schizophrenia (IPSS) and subsequent Determinants of Outcomes of Severe Mental Disorder (DOSMD) studies have reported that the course of schizophrenia is more favourable in 'developing' than 'developed' societies. The 1992 DOSMD study attributes this difference to culture. We review studies concerning the course of schizophrenia and conclude that the evidence for a more favourable course in developing societies is not conclusive. Indeed, a favourable course has also been reported in various industrialised societies. We also raise questions about the findings reported in the recent DOSMD study, including the conclusion that the putatively more favourable course is a product of culture. Finally, we argue that longitudinal, direct observation of patients in their natural environments must be carried out before variations in the course of schizophrenia can be adequately understood.",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,1994 Feb,England,1994,90

A structured interview was administered to 106 Dominican and Puerto Rican women who reported that they knew or suspected that their partner had other partners. A subsample participated in qualitative interviews. The study assessed concern about HIV and predictors of condom use. The majority of women reported that they worried about getting HIV and almost half had been HIV-tested. Most of the women discussed HIV/AIDS concerns with their partners, and one-third reported some condom use. Predictors of condom use were: born in the Dominican Republic/Puerto Rico, having talked with their partner about being tested, and belief that he used condoms with others. Although the women were concerned about HIV, condom use was infrequent. Results suggested methods to address this discrepancy: introducing condoms early in the relationship, developing women-controlled methods, and directly influencing men's behavior.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,1996 Aug,United States,1996,90
9136289,The relationship between socioeconomic status and recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in physical functioning, pain, and depressive symptoms among newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with severe disease. METHODS: Data are from 118 non-Hispanic patients of European origin at baseline of a longitudinal study of early, severe RA. Outcome measures with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) functional disability index, the HAQ visual analog pain scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using a health status block (disease activity and comorbidities), a non-SES related social structure block (age, sex and Lubben Social Network Scale), and indicators of SES (income and education). RESULTS: Non-SES related social structure and SES were important independent determinants of functional disability and depressive symptoms, but both they and the health status variables were unrelated to pain. Further, neither income nor education was related to disease activity or comorbidities. CONCLUSION: It cannot be argued from these data that poorer health status explains the link between SES and disability and depressive symptoms. Although, at baseline, the psychosocial effects of early RA are more severe for those with SES, the disease does not appear to be more severe. It may be that the biologic impact of status differentials will become clearer as the effects of treatment and the course of the disease unfold over time.",Arthritis care and research : the official journal of the Arthritis Health Professions Association,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90
8828747,"HIV seroincidence and correlates of seroconversion in a cohort of male factory workers in Harare, Zimbabwe.","OBJECTIVES: Given that health promotion messages on transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) have been widely publicized in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in the late 1980s, it is vital to analyse which risk events still expose individuals to infection. A cohort was established with the objectives of estimating HIV seroincidence, behavioural and biological determinants of infection, and ultimately, evaluating the impact of AIDS prevention interventions in the workplace. METHODS: HIV seroincidence was estimated in a prospectively followed cohort of male factory workers recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe during the period prior to a workplace AIDS prevention intervention. Correlates of HIV seroconversion were identified using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: There were 51 seroconversions among 1607 HIV-negative participants following 1738 person-years (PY) of observation [seroincidence, 2.93 per 100 PY; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.18-3.86]. The prevalence of HIV in the cohort was 19.1%. HIV seroincidence was significantly increased among men who were younger [hazard ratio (HR) per year, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99], were single (HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.56-6.96), were married but resided separately from their wives (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 0.99-4.80), reported having any STD (HR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.53-5.86), reported having a genital ulcer (HR, 4.87; 95% CI, 2.18-10.91), and reported paying for sex (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.06-3.77). Seroincidence also increased with the number of sex partners reported in the year preceding enrolment (HR per partner, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21). In multiple Cox regression analysis, three independent associations with HIV seroconversion were reporting a genital ulcer (adjusted HR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.52-8.29), number of sex partners (adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21), and being married but residing separately from one's wife (adjusted HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.00-4.89). CONCLUSIONS: Innovative and sustained workplace-based interventions are needed to address the high risk of HIV infection in this economically productive population. The predictors of HIV seroconversion described in this study underscore the need for public health efforts to simultaneously address the biological, socioeconomic and behavioural factors that continue to place individuals at risk of HIV in general populations of Africa.","AIDS (London, England)",1996 Jul,England,1996,90
10519460,Psychosocial predictors of delay of first sexual intercourse by adolescents.,"This investigation predicted adolescents' delay of intercourse onset from attitudes, social norms, and self-efficacy about refraining from sexual intercourse. Age, gender, ethnicity, and parental education were also examined as predictors and moderators of the relationships among the 3 psychosocial determinants and onset. The participants (N = 827), part of a cohort initially surveyed in the 9th grade, reported at baseline that they had never engaged in intercourse. The multivariable proportional hazards regression model suggested that adolescents with more positive attitudinal and normative beliefs, as well as those with a parent who graduated from college, were less likely to engage in intercourse in the follow-up period (up to approximately 2 years). Interventions that include an objective to delay onset may benefit from addressing psychosocial determinants, especially attitudes and norms about sexual intercourse.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1999 Sep,United States,1999,90
8212935,[Importance and determinants of early mother-child relations].,"In a prospective longitudinal study on child development from birth to age eight 362 first-born infants and their families were investigated. The subjects were distributed across the nine cells of a two-factorial design, factor 1 representing the degree of organic, factor 2 the degree of psychosocial risk. At age 3 months mother-child interaction was videotaped and evaluated with microanalytic technique. The quality of MCI could be demonstrated to be as predictive for later cognitive development as early developmental tests. Social-emotional problems of the toddler and preschool child was predicted better by parameters of early MCI than by temperament. Disturbed interactions were associated with later cognitive retardation and enhanced behavior problems. MCI is significantly determined by neglect and rejection, which showed typical behavioral patterns. The early separation of mother and high risk newborn itself did not lead to alterations in maternal attachment. Compared with mother daughter dyads early interaction of mother and son was characterized by more reactivity and positive emotion.",Zeitschrift fur Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychoanalyse,1993,Germany,1993,90
2218623,Levels of health development: a new tool for comparative research and policy formulation.,"Levels of health development are formed by mathematically clustering countries using six health status indicators: crude birth, crude death, infant mortality and child death rates, and male and female life expectancy. Stratifying two international samples of 128 and 163 countries into levels of health development--groups with similar health status profiles--improves the results of regression analyses used to identify economic, political, social, educational, health and other health determinants. For this reason, health development levels are a systematic framework for delineation of health determinants. Earlier large scale statistical studies have been limited in their success in part because they did not partition their data sets prior to analysis, or used inappropriate criteria that blurred rather than heightened developmental differences in underlying social systems. These developmental differences regulate the way in which health status inputs are converted into health status outputs, defining the relative importance of health determinants at various developmental levels. At lowest health development levels (countries with poorer health status), the under-development of economic, health and educational infrastructures creates a vacuum which allows international intervention (aid, investment, export/import activities) to play a dominant role in health status determination. At middle health development levels, health and educational infrastructures are better developed, but still secondary in importance as health status determinants to basic economic infrastructure. Demographic problems are particularly apparent at these levels. At higher health development levels, education, women's status, and political structure are especially important health status determinants. This research has facilitated the identification of health status determinants for use in health policy analysis. Recommendations for future research include use of findings in health policymaking by individual countries and by comparative researchers, and development of appropriate health systems models for each level of health development.",Social science & medicine (1982),1990,England,1990,90
10202805,Coping efforts in daily life: role of big five traits and problem appraisals.,"The role of problem appraisal and Big Five traits in coping with bothersome daily events was investigated. Community-residing men completed diaries regarding stressful events and coping for eight consecutive days. Results of multi-level analyses indicated that lower perceived control over events was associated with greater reliance on distraction, catharsis, acceptance, seeking emotional social support, but less use of direct action. Stressor severity was positively associated with catharsis and religion, but negatively associated with acceptance. Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experience, and Conscientiousness predicted coping strategy use. In addition, broad personality dimensions moderated relations between appraisals (perceived uncontrolability and severity) and coping strategy use. Although previous research implicated perceived control in coping, the present study suggests that both appraisals of stressor severity and individual differences in personality are also important determinants of coping strategy use at the daily level.",Journal of personality,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90

1997583,Health perceptions and survival: do global evaluations of health status really predict mortality?,"Self-evaluations of health status have been shown to predict mortality, above and beyond the contribution to prediction made by indices based on the presence of health problems, physical disability, and biological or life-style risk factors. Several possible reasons for this association are discussed: (a) methodological shortcomings of previous studies render the association spurious; (b) other psychosocial influences on mortality are involved and explain the association; and (c) self-evaluations of health status have a direct and independent effect of their own. Four-year follow-up mortality data from the Yale Health and Aging Project (N = 2812) are used to explore these possibilities. The analysis controls for the contribution of numerous indicators of health problems, disability and risk factors, and also makes adjustments of standard errors for the complex sample design. The findings favor the third possibility, an independent effect, to the extent that the particular set of psychosocial factors examined did not explain the basic association, and to the extent that the control variables were an adequately comprehensive set.",Journal of gerontology,1991 Mar,United States,1991,90

METHOD: A questionnaire was administered to 327 randomly selected pregnant women on the first or second postpartum day A and again 6 to 12 weeks later B. The questionnaire comprised a psychosocial and demographic self-report, and the 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS: At time A the prevalence of postnatal depression was 9.9-22.3%, and at time B it was 5.2-12.4% (p < 0.0001). Four of the psychosocial determinants examined correlated significantly with depression at times A and B. These factors were: a positive psychiatric history, Oriental ethnic origin, being foreign born, inconvenient timing of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Postnatal depression was less common than in most reported series. It was related to marital and social support, the circumstances of the pregnancy, and the degree of religious observance.

8982525,Adolescent alcohol use: social determinants and the case for early family-centered prevention. Family-focused prevention of adolescent drinking.,"The family plays a central role in the use of alcohol by children and adolescents, yet preventive interventions rarely focus on the family. Early drinking and much subsequent use of alcohol by children and adolescents is sanctioned and sometimes encouraged by their families. Unlike experimentation with alcohol, problem drinking is associated with low levels of family social support and with dysfunctional coping strategies of families that may lead children to use drinking as an adaptive behavior. While risk-factor research has advanced understanding of alcohol use by children and youth, the poor predictive power of individual risks has limited its contribution to successful interventions. On the other hand, protective factors, provided by relationships within and outside the family, can be preventive and health promoting. Parents influence their children's drinking through family interactions, modeling and reinforcing standards, and attitudes that children learn and use to guide their behavior in new situations. Thus, parental influences endure. This article argues that interventions to prevent alcohol abuse should be designed to help parents to carry out their parental functions. This can be accomplished by providing social support, resources, and education for parents, as well as developing extra-familial sources of social support and socialization for children and adolescents.",Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1996 Winter,United States,1996,90

11100216,Personality and dental care utilization: findings from the VA longitudinal study.,"The personality traits of introversion/extraversion and neuroticism were investigated as determinants of the utilization of restorative dental care, controlling for socioeconomic status and restorative need. The VA Dental Longitudinal Study (DLS) provided information on the restorative treatment received by 593 healthy adult males during a 10-year period. Utilization of restorative services was measured by calculating the percentage of surfaces that needed and received treatment, as identified by the DLS examiners by clinical and radiographic examination. Oral examinations were initiated in 1969 with subsequent examinations occurring at approximately 3-year intervals. Personality measures for these individuals were obtained using the EPI-Q, a shortened form of the Eysenck Personality Inventory. A plot of neuroticism versus the utilization measure yielded a curvilinear relationship suggesting that participants seeking the most dental care scored moderately on the neuroticism scale while those scoring lowest and highest on this scale sought less treatment. In contrast, the introversion/extraversion scale showed no apparent relationship with dental care utilization. Results from the regression analysis suggest that dentition and socioeconomic status are strong determinants of utilization and that need for restorative treatment influences utilization.","Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",1990 Jul-Aug,United States,1990,90

A multicentre hospital-based incident case-control study with 431 female stomach cancer cases aged less than 75 years and an equal number of age-matched controls without cancer has been carried out in Poland. The respondents were asked about their opinions on relevance in cancer prevention of such factors as protective role of raw vegetables and fresh fruit, consumption of fats, alcohol and coffee or using table salt. The data were compared with information on eating habits and diet behaviours in the reference group. It was shown in both groups that beliefs about the importance of raw vegetables and fresh fruit were closely associated with high frequency of everyday consumption of vegetables and fruit; however, statistically significant differences were found between cases and controls as regards the frequency of eating vegetables and fresh fruit at every meal. The same relation was observed between the belief in an unhealthy role of consumption of fats and using the animal fat in cooking. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that a relation between beliefs and behaviours existed in the cases with the same demographic and social determinants.",Cancer letters,1997 Mar 19,Ireland,1997,90

Current controversies in the British debate about health.,"This article uses the current controversies in the British debate about health to illustrate the need to theorize, and therefore critically evaluate, the links between medicine and health policies, including health care policies. The medical model of health is deeply embedded in institutional practices in many countries, and while this model has attracted deserved criticism in recent years, an alternative social model, or one that incorporates indispensable aspects of the medical model, has attracted much less attention and requires sustained development. Comparative study of patterns of inequality in health, and especially of the correlation between material deprivation and premature mortality, necessarily reveals causal determinants of both health and ill-health in populations and invites ambitious programs to develop a social model.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",1990,United States,1990,90

Cohabitation started as an alternative way of living, developed into a temporary phase before marriage, and finally became a strategy for moving into a union gradually.... This article addresses the question whether or not individual past and current life-course experiences become increasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into marriage across female birth cohorts, and yet become decreasingly important in explaining the differentiation of entry into cohabitation across female birth cohorts. This question is examined using a non-proportional hazard model. Empirical evidence supports this hypothesis strongly, in that both past determinants such as family size or religion and current life-course determinants such as work or education change in their impact on cohabitation and marriage across birth cohorts.""",European sociological review,1996 May,England,1996,90
1890782,[Determinants of preferences among tasks with diagnosis of his/her own ability: individual and sex differences in self-assessment motivation and self-enhancement motivation].,"There are two different views on gathering information about self. According to ""self-assessment"" view, individuals choose tasks that are diagnostic about themselves, regardless of self-esteem implications. On the other hand, according to ""self-enhancement"" view, individuals choose tasks that are diagnostic only when they have positive self-esteem implications. Present research tested these predictions in Japanese college students, using for tasks with high or low diagnosticity of success and failure. In subjects with low uncertainty of self-esteem, task preference increased with diagnosticity of success and diagnosticity of failure. This was consistent with self-assessment view. However, in subjects with high uncertainty of self-esteem, task preference didn't increase with diagnosticity of failure. In subjects with high self-esteem, task preference is high with high diagnosticity of failure than that of subjects with low self-esteem. The results suggest large individual differences in gathering information about self. They also suggest that not only self-esteem but also uncertainty of self-esteem should be considered in studies of self-enhancement motivation.",Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology,1991 Apr,Japan,1991,90

This data was used to characterize the clinical and epidemiological profiles of the endemic desease in the population, allowing for the determination of the efficacy of the potable water supply and the specific treatment of those infected with S. mansoni. The district contains three locations, Ravenopolis, Ravena and Lavapes, where the prevalence of the endemic disease was, 20.1%, 42.6% and 63.9%, respectively. The prevalence in the district was statistically higher in men. The age brackets that displayed differences by gender were 10-14 and 15-19 years. Severity of infection was statistically different among individuals within the 10-14 year bracket in ali three locations, and in the 15-19 year bracket among individuals from Ravenopolis and Ravena. The hepatointestinal form was associated with age, and individuals under 15 years of age presented risk of infection 8.85 times higher than adults. Multivariable analysis of the factors involved in transmission of the disease showed that Lavapes was independently associated with infection. In that area, poor sanitary conditions and the proximity of houses to streams infested with S. marsoni cercariae facilitated infection of neighborhood women while performing domestic activities, as well as men digging sand from the streams for construction.

Subjects younger than 40 years were three times more likely than older subjects to develop depression and women were approximately twice as likely as men to develop depression regardless of age. Marital disruption, a farm setting, and high educational achievement substantially increased the risk of depression among female subjects. Of 214 never-depressed subjects with a history of nonaffective mental disorder, 62 (29.0%) developed major depression. Age and sex were again powerful determinants.

Elderly subjects over 55 were the least articulate group. The first-ever addiction treatment subjects reported the lowest mean number of years of problem drinking, the lowest mean Michigan Alcoholic Screening Test scores and the lowest mean daily alcohol intakes. They also displayed greater current social stability than the 2 readmission treatment categories. The general determinants of admission to this addiction unit centered around the experience of crises, social instability and psychological complaints. The most important specific determinants for the individual subject were the propensity to fight when drunk, followed by a positive parental history of excess alcohol intake.

8693173,[Objective and subjective determinants in the benefits of home help services for the elderly].,"In this paper, we analyze the factors related to the allocation of home help services, a main component for maintaining elderly at home. The study is based on a random sample of 889 people aged 65 and over, living at home in the areas of Lunel and Pezenas (Herault, France). The factors taken into account were disabilities, income, social support, and subjective health assessed through the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). A logistic model allowed to bring out the factors related to the delivery of home help services. Positive statistical correlations were found for age (OR = 1.6 per 10-year age groups), disabilities for instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 3.8) and for the notion of mobility assessed through the NHP (OR = 3.3); negative statistical correlations were found for the level of income (OR = 0.3), as well as for disabilities for activities of daily living (physical dependency) (OR = 0.5). These results show that the main criterion for allocating home help services is not severe disability and that subjective aspects play an important part. Accordingly, current practices should be modified to obtain a better targeting of home help services for disabled elderly at home.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,1996 Apr,France,1996,90

Data were obtained from parents by mailed questionnaires in two cross-sectional studies in 1991 (n = 3,330) and 1995 (n = 3,124). Prevalence of prone sleeping decreased from 37.6% to 8.7% (p < 0.05) in the German population and from 44.1% to 32.0% (p < 0.05) in the Turkish immigrant population. Parents who laid their infants prone in 1995 were less likely to follow advice from physicians, public media, and other parents (relative risks < 0.5, p < 0.05) and were more likely to have a low educational level, to be <20 years old, to be single parents, to have two or more children, to be raised in West Germany, or to be of Turkish ethnicity. Although the information on prone sleeping being a risk factor for SIDS became known among the population, these data suggest that subgroup-specific public intervention campaigns may be needed to reduce the prevalence of prone sleeping even further in those countries where no nationwide campaign has been initiated.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 Jul 1,United States,1999,90

DESIGN: Two closely matched subsamples of spouse carers, husbands and wives respectively, were selected and the two groups compared. SETTING: An urban psychogeriatric service in the UK. SUBJECTS: 48 spouses of referred dementia cases. MEASURES: Mental health was rated by the General Health Questionnaire, the Strain Scale and the Life Satisfaction Index. Various factors related to caregiving were assessed by the Problem Checklist, and a specially devised instrument to record caregiving task involvement, formal/informal support, objective burden, satisfaction with supports and attitudes to the relationship and to caregiving. RESULTS: The wives' levels of strain and morale were significantly worse than husbands'. There were qualitative differences between husbands and wives in terms of caregiving tasks undertaken. Wives tolerated dementia sufferers depending on them less well. Wives were also more likely to wish to leave caregiving to someone else and cited more reasons for giving up. Subjects of both sexes displayed a strong tendency to view women as generally better suited to the caregiving role, and wives felt a greater obligation to care. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that such attitudinal or social factors are the chief determinants of wives' higher levels of strain and distress.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,1997 Dec,England,1997,90

Outcome.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome in a population based cohort of patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) who were in the process of being transferred from pediatric to adult rheumatology care. METHODS: The cohort of patients born in 1968 through 1972, recruited from a population based epidemiological study in southwestern Sweden, were called to a followup after a median disease duration of 7.1 years. The study group consisted of 124 patients with a median age of 17.7 years. The disability and discomfort dimensions were evaluated using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ). The impact of the disease on social life was evaluated by patients and parents. RESULTS: The median C-HAQ disability index was 0.19 with a range from 0 to 2.75 (maximum possible score = 3). Sixty percent of the patients indicated some difficulty in daily activities. Female sex and a polyarticular disease course were risk factors for disability. The strongest determinants for disability were continuing disease activity and a positive IgM rheumatoid factor. Social impact of the disease was strongly linked to a raised C-HAQ disability index. CONCLUSION: Even in a population based study of JCA, which includes many mild cases, the majority of patients experienced some difficulty in daily activities when judged by themselves. This underlines the necessity to use the patient's own values in outcome studies, rather than the physician's. Further development of internationally accepted, standardized instruments to evaluate the handicap dimension of childhood arthritis is called for.",The Journal of rheumatology,1995 Feb,Canada,1995,90
10186447,Towards a psycho-social theoretical framework for sexual health promotion.,"Numerous interventions have been designed to promote safer sexual behaviour amongst young people. However, relatively few have proved effective, which is, at least partially, due to the lack of development of theoretically based programmes. An understanding of the origins and control of sexual behaviour can be derived from basic social science research. Unless this is applied to the design of behaviour-change programmes they are unlikely to target the most important determinants of young people's sexual behaviour and are, therefore, unlikely to be effective. This paper outlines some of the key theoretical insights which have been drawn upon in the development of a new sex education programme currently being tested in Scottish schools. The theoretical basis is intentionally eclectic, combining social psychological cognitive models with sociological interpretations, since we are not concerned to advance any particular theory but to find which are most useful in promoting sexual health. First, the social influences on sexual behaviour are considered, and then the way in which these translate into individual perceptions and beliefs. Finally, the paper attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of sexual interaction and the social contexts of sexual behaviour.",Health education research,1998 Sep,England,1998,90

On the base of above, it has been assumed that demographic transformations are result of two forces. First of them is formed by biological determinants, forcing human sociates to function in the environment in a way which would maximize both--ability to survive and multioly, and the result of these strifes in expressed by the guarantees of population existence.

10656467,Dietary questions as determinants of mortality: the OXCHECK experience.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether responses to simple dietary questions are associated with specific causes of death. DESIGN: Self-reported frequency intakes of various classes of foods and data on confounding factors were collected at the baseline survey. Death notifications up to 31 December 1997 were ascertained from the Office for National Statistics. Relative risk (RR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with baseline dietary factors were calculated by Cox regression. SETTING: Prospective follow-up study based on five UK general practices. SUBJECTS: Data were used from 11,090 men and women aged 35-64 years (81% of the eligible patient population) who responded to a postal questionnaire in 1989. RESULTS: After 9 years of follow-up, 598 deaths were recorded, 514 of these among the 10,522 subjects with no previous history of angina. All-cause mortality was positively associated with age, smoking and low social class, as expected. Among the dietary variables, all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in participants who reported relatively high consumption of vegetables, puddings, cakes, biscuits and sweets, fresh or frozen red meat (but not processed meat), among those who reported using polyunsaturated spreads and among moderate alcohol drinkers. These associations were broadly similar for deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cancer and all other causes combined, and were not greatly attenuated by adjusting for potential confounding factors including social class. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to simple questions about nutrition were associated with mortality. These findings must be interpreted with caution since residual confounding by dietary and lifestyle factors may underlie the associations.",Public health nutrition,1999 Dec,England,1999,90
2029940,Tailoring family planning services to the special needs of adolescents.,"Experimental service protocols tailored to the needs of teenage family planning patients were developed that emphasized indepth counseling, education geared to an adolescent's level of development, and the provision of reassurance and social support. These protocols were tested against usual service delivery practices in a study involving 1,261 patients under 18 years of age at six nonmetropolitan family planning clinics. A comparison with teenagers obtaining services at control sites found that six months after their first clinic visit, patients at the experimental sites were more likely to be using a method, were less likely to experience difficulty in dealing with problems, were more likely to continue using their method despite problems and had learned more during the educational session. Teenage patients at the experimental clinics were also less likely to have become pregnant within one year than those who went to control clinics. Attrition during the year following the first study visit was similar among both groups; patient satisfaction was very high, and equivalent at experimental and control sites. The data show that the extra time and effort required to meet the special needs of teenagers is justified by their improved contraceptive use, greater knowledge and lower pregnancy rates.",Family planning perspectives,1991 Jan-Feb,United States,1991,90

Critical disciplines for public health.,"The mission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. Fifty years ago, CDC's efforts were focused on epidemiologic and laboratory studies of malaria, typhus, and plague. Today, CDC's activities cover a broad range of diseases and conditions, and a broader range of disciplines are required to address these diverse public health problems. The behavioral and social sciences have a critical role to play in helping the public understand risk group characteristics and the frequency, context, and determinants of risky behaviors and in developing, implementing, and assessing prevention programs. CDC is taking steps to foster an environment in which behavioral and social sciences can flourish and to integrate these sciences into all of CDC's prevention activities.

8817181,Distribution and population determinants of gamma-glutamyltransferase in a random sample of Sardinian inhabitants. 'ATS-SARDEGNA' Research Group.,"The relation of a number of determinants to serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was studied in a random sample of Sardinian inhabitants of 2283 males and 2520 females aged 20-59 years. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of environmental, behavioural and biochemical factors on GGT levels. Mean values were higher in males than in females and increased with age in both sexes. In sex-specific multiple regression analysis, GGT showed a positive association with body mass index (BMI), alcohol use, total serum cholesterol (T-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and age, and a negative one with coffee consumption and physical activity in males, while in females the enzyme was positively associated with BMI, alcohol use, age, T-C, ApoB, TG and cigarette smoking. The negative association between coffee drinking and serum GGT observed in males suggests that coffee may inhibit the inducing effects of other factors, particularly alcohol use, on GGT in the liver. No biological mechanism has been suggested to explain the association of GGT with BMI, age or physical activity. This study confirms the importance of GGT as a strong marker for alcohol use; but a number of variables, ranging from life-style to biological characteristics, are also important determinants of its plasma values in the 'normal' population.",European journal of epidemiology,1996 Feb,Netherlands,1996,90
2213488,On-line and memory-based modification of attitudes: determinants of message recall-attitude change correspondence.,"Experiments investigated the impact of message elaboration on attitude change-message recall correspondence when attitude change occurs in an on-line (as attitude-relevant information is received), or memory-based (on the basis of retrieved attitude-relevant information) fashion. In 2 experiments, Ss' processing goals were manipulated to increase or inhibit on-line change and message elaboration. As predicted, Ss reported postexposure attitudes more rapidly in on-line vs memory-based conditions. Decreased message elaboration increased attitude-recall correspondence, regardless of when attitude change occurred. Increased elaboration produced elaboration-attitude judgment correspondence. Results suggest that recall of message content will best predict persuasion when message content is encoded free of elaborations, regardless of when attitude change occurs.",Journal of personality and social psychology,1990 Jul,United States,1990,90

Among black women, an unplanned teenage birth--represented by the secondborn twin--results in significantly lower rates of high school graduation and labor-force participation and significantly higher rates of poverty and welfare recipiency. Ten years after giving birth, black women who have an unplanned child are also significantly less likely than women who have not to be currently married, but are not less likely to have ever been married. Like black women, white women who have an unplanned teenage birth have significantly higher rates of poverty and welfare recipiency; they also have significantly lower family earnings and household income.",Family planning perspectives,1993 Jul-Aug,United States,1993,90

Canonical discriminant function analysis of the relationship between these predictor variables on the first testing and whether participants (a) returned for retesting, (b) did not return because of apparent disinterest, or (c) did not return because of illness or death, revealed two significant canonical variates. The first, characterized by decreased mental and physical capacity, discriminated between the deceased/ill group and the other two groups. The second was characterized by decreased social interaction and life satisfaction, and increased life events, and distinguished between the disinterested group and the other two groups. However, both groups that failed to return for retesting showed evidence of impaired physical health and a general disengagement from social and personal activities, compared to the retested group.",Experimental aging research,1990 Spring-Summer,United States,1990,90

They were also compared for neurological status and for history of speech and language difficulties. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the frequency of immune disorders and in handedness. The results showed significantly more dyslexic boys with soft neurological signs and signs of speech and language disorders. The frequency of dyslexia was significantly higher in the relatives of the dyslexic boys. Also significantly more mothers of the dyslexic boys reported difficulties during pregnancy and complications at delivery.

In the case of [Soviet] Central Asia, neither the various steps to bring down labour intensity in the farm sector, nor the falling standard of living in rural areas, could bring about migration from rural to urban areas. This was because in traditional societies economic mechanisms are not effective unless they are complemented by appropriate social and cultural policies. All policies were oriented towards the state's goal of vertical integration of regions with the central economy.

Teachers evaluated adaptive functioning, social withdrawal, and aggressive behavior at school for a carefully selected sample of 22 boys and 24 girls (ages 7-12) whose parents had been separated for two to 18 months. Regression analyses indicated that boys' overall school adjustment was associated with better maternal parenting skills, lower child fear of abandonment, less blaming of father for the separation, and positive parental verbal attributions toward the other parent. Girls with better overall school adjustment reported less blaming of their mothers and a higher rate of positive attributions by mother about father.

Positive and negative peer evaluations related significantly to children's ability to recall positive and negative self-referential information (respectively), even after controlling for concurrent depressive symptoms. Positive and negative peer evaluations also related strongly to children's self-reported depressive symptoms. Incidental recall of positive and negative information significantly related to self-reported depression. In fact, the relation between recall of negative information and depression significantly increased in the eighth grade. Finally, preliminary support emerged that cognitive processes related to the incidental recall of negative self-descriptive information may mediate the relation between peer evaluations and depression. Implications for further research into the social determinants of cognitive processes and into the social and cognitive determinants of depression are discussed.",Child development,1995 Apr,United States,1995,90

The data for the analysis were obtained from the 1983 Census of Population conducted by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. The analysis focuses on men who immigrated to Israel between 1979 to 1983.... The data reveal that the likelihood of finding employment, the mode of labor market incorporation, and the size of the occupational cost are significantly affected by geocultural origin, occupation in the country of origin, and individual-level demographic and human capital resources. The meaning of the differentiated effects are discussed in detail. The findings point toward two central aspects that should be examined in the study of labor market incorporation of new immigrants: employment status and occupational cost.""",The International migration review,1995 Summer,United States,1995,90

The relationships between the MCAS and gender, sexual experience, intentions to use a condom, and past condom use were assessed. The MCAS has five distinct factors: (a) Reliability and Effectiveness of condoms, (b) the sexual Pleasure associated with condom use, (c) the stigma attached to persons who use condoms (Identity Stigma), (d) the Embarrassment About Negotiation and Use of condoms, and (e) the Embarrassment About the Purchase of condoms. The results strongly suggest that condom attitudes are multidimensional and thus cannot meaningfully be summed to a single global score. Results further indicate that men and women hold very different attitudes toward condoms. Implications of scale multidimensionality and directions for future research are discussed.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",1994 May,United States,1994,90

The analysis tests the hypothesis that the negative effect on educational attainment often associated with living in a mother-only or stepfather family stems primarily from the reduced level of economic resources available to these households. Empirical findings indicate that living with a widowed, divorced, or separated mother has little or no effect on educational attainment once we control for economic status.

8847107,Physical workload and the aging worker: a review of the literature.,"In the coming decades, demographic, economic and social changes will result in an increased proportion of elderly persons in the workforce in most industrialized countries. This trend is causing growing interest in the problems of the aging worker in current employment. The objective of this particular paper is to provide more insight into the impact of aging on the balance between physical work capacity and physical workload. To this end, the scientific literature in the field is reviewed and ordered by means of a specific conceptual model of ""aging and physical workload"". A progressive decline in physical work capacity, characterized by diminished aerobic capacity and muscular capacity, has consistently been reported. However, inter-individual differences appear to be considerable. The question of whether there are systematic differences in physical work demands between younger and older workers within occupations has been answered vaguely. Conflicting results in this matter bring into discussion the role of the actual working method as one of the determinants of the physical workload. An age-related imbalance between physical workload and physical work capacity is suggested to result in a chronic overload, increasing the risk of long-term health effects such as musculoskeletal complaints and disorders. For many aging workers in physically demanding occupations, extreme physical workloads, increasing the risk of disease or disablement, are still reported. The multiconceptual study of aging and physical workload in the present paper reveals several possibilities for preventive measures. However, as information is still lacking, additional research is needed, in particular on the onset and development of long-term effects on health in relation to age and work demands.",International archives of occupational and environmental health,1995,Germany,1995,90
8639009,"Alcohol-related problems in older persons. Determinants, consequences, and screening.","Demographic trends reveal the elderly to be the fastest growing segment of the population. Physicians can therefore anticipate encountering increasing numbers of older patients with alcohol-related problems. These problems include liver disease, dementia, confusion (masquerading as dementia), peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, late-onset seizure disorder, poor nutrition, incontinence, diarrhea, myopathy, inadequate self-care, macrocytosis, depression, fractures, and adverse reactions to medications. Despite the prevalence of alcohol use in older people, their risks and problems are often unrecognized. We reviewed published literature on the determinants and consequences of alcohol-related problems in persons aged 65 years and older and the usefulness of available screening measures. Thirteen of 25 eligible studies on determinants and consequences met quality criteria and were reviewed. Nine additional studies on screening tests were also evaluated. Determinants include history of alcohol use and abuse, social isolation, and reduced mobility; consequences consist of risks of hip fracture from falls, neoplasms, and psychiatric illness. Currently accessible screening tests focus on high levels of alcoholic beverage use and abuse and dependence. They are not useful in screening for hazardous consumption that may result from relatively low levels of alcohol use alone or in combination with medications, medical illness, or preexisting diminished physical, emotional, or social function. Research is needed on the consequences of lower levels of alcohol consumption on the physical and psychosocial health of older individuals and on methods for distinguishing alcohol-related from age-related problems. Existing screening tests should be expanded or new screening methods developed in anticipation of a growing public health problem.",Archives of internal medicine,1996 Jun 10,United States,1996,90
7551771,Determinants of perceived consistency: the relationship between group entitativity and the meaningfulness of categories.,"The concept of entitativity was developed by Campbell (1958) to refer to the extent to which a group is perceived as a coherent whole or entity. This concept is relevant to research in both social perception (e.g. the categorization effects approach to the study of social stereotyping) and social influence (e.g. the consistency attributed to minority groups in theories of minority influence). On the basis of previous research, four variables were expected to play a role in group entitativity judgements. These were intra-group variability, group size, diversity (or variety) and extremity. In two empirical studies it was found that entitativity decreased as variability and diversity increased and that it increased with group size. These effects and interactions between group size and extremity, size and diversity, and variability and extremity are consistent with the idea that entitativity is a function of how meaningful a stimulus pattern is. This is in turn (in part) a function of how unlikely the pattern is.",The British journal of social psychology,1995 Sep,England,1995,90

METHODS: All major disciplines at a major regional hospital were studied. Participants responded to a structured questionnaire concerning broad aspects of physicians' work. The response rate was approximately 78%, with 356 respondents. RESULTS: The results show that even though physicians are overall very satisfied with their work, they list high workload, lack of influence on daily work and work processes as dissatisfactory. Skills utilisation and development are some major areas for improvement. Physicians that were aware of the overall mission statement for their hospital were more satisfied with and informed about departmental goals. Perceived organisational efficiency and leadership qualities were important determinants of perceived workload and work climate. CONCLUSIONS: Stress among physicians is a growing occupational health concern, impacting negatively on patient care.

It decreases with the importance of agriculture. Industrialization and agricultural importance have the same implications for the concentration of urban population in cities with 100,000+ population as for the urban percentage. Greater export orientation reduces such concentration. Finally, GDP per capita, population, and export orientation reduce primacy. Political factors, such as whether a country's largest city is also its capital, affect primacy.

10563479,Genetic and environmental sources of QT interval variability in Israeli families: the kibbutz settlements family study.,"QT interval prolongation not attributed to long QT syndromes is reported to be associated with increased risk of sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. Genetic and environmental determinants of QTc interval were investigated in an unselected free living population sample of 80 kindreds residing in kibbutz settlements in Israel. The sample included 214 males and 227 females aged 15-97 years. There was a significant familial aggregation of adjusted QT interval levels, as indicated by inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients significantly different from zero. Complex segregation analysis applied to the sex- and age-adjusted data was not conclusive and heterogeneous etiologies for individual differences were suggested. There was evidence for a single recessive locus (q = 0.173) with a major effect in addition to polygenic effects (h2 = 0.41) that explained the mixture of distributions. In parallel, a nontransmitted environmental major factor in addition to polygenic effects that explained the adjusted variation in QTc could not be rejected. Similar results were obtained upon the adjustment for sex, age, and environmental covariables. The major factor, either genetic or environmental, and polygenic-loci accounted for about 20 and 33% of the adjusted QTc variation, respectively. Furthermore, sex, age, measured environmental covariables, the unmeasured major factor, and the unmeasured polygenes could account for 63% of the variation of QTc in these families. Our data provide evidence for a major factor, either genetic or environmental, in addition to a polygenic background, influencing QT interval levels in a population-based sample of pedigrees.",Clinical genetics,1999 Sep,Denmark,1999,90
10409795,[Public health and behavior modification: a contemporary issue].,"Most cardiovascular disease risk factors can be modified through life-style changes. Choices of habits and behavior are in fact heavily influenced by concepts of normality and social values. However, social influences fail to fully explain these choices, insofar as health-related habits are also shaped by personal experience. The main limitations of public health practice can probably be found at this subjective level. This article emphasizes the need to consider determinants of human behavior at different levels, increasingly important for strategies to promote health and prevent disease, or at least delay its onset. The primary focus is to influence rules and laws aimed at protecting life. The article also discusses possible strategies for translating scientific knowledge into public health action, avoiding the restriction to the ""healthy life"" regulatory role. Finally, participation by public health professionals is suggested in places where population groups share life experiences, such as workplaces, schools, and churches, developing approaches which include those experiences as well as fears and hopes related to health.

DESIGN: A simple random sample was drawn of 15,198 individuals aged 16-74 years. Of these, 85% (12,982) were interviewed by trained non-medical interviewers between 1982 and 1983 about cultural activities. They were followed up with respect to survival until 31 December 1991. SETTING: Swedish interview survey of living conditions comprising a random sample of the adult Swedish population. SUBJECTS: 12,675 people interviewed between 1982 and 1983. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival of subjects after controlling for eight confounding variables: age, sex, education level, income, long term disease, social network, smoking, and physical exercise. RESULTS: 6,301 men and 6,374 women were followed up; 533 men and 314 women died during this period. The control variables influenced survival in the expected directions except for social network for men; a significant negative effective was found when the analysis was made separately for men and women. We found an influence on mortality when the eight control variables were controlled for in people who rarely attended events compared with those attending most often, the relative risk being 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.09). CONCLUSION: Attendance at cultural events may have a positive influence on survival. Long term follow up of large samples with confounders that are well controlled for and with the cultural stimulation more highly specified should be used to try to falsify the hypothesis before experiments start.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),1996 Dec 21-28,England,1996,90

In addition, early sexual debut is eight times as likely among black boys as among non-Hispanic white boys. Children who use controlled substances at an early age are more than twice as likely to have sex before age 14 as those who do not, although the type of substance having an effect is different for girls (cigarettes) and boys (alcohol).

12689499,Personal and social variables as co-determinants of noise annoyance.,"This paper starts with the fact that noise annoyance is partly due to acoustic factors, partly due to so-called moderating variables, i.e. personal and social aspects of the residents. Noise annoyance is considered to be the (long-term) negative evaluation of living conditions with respect to noise. This evaluation is not simply dependent on past disturbances, but on attitudes and expectations, too. The personal factors influencing the evaluation and described here are: Sensitivity to noise, fear of harm connected with the source, personal evaluation of the source, and coping capacity with respect to noise. The social factors described here are: General (social) evaluation of the source, trust or misfeasance with source authorities, history of noise exposure, and expectations of residents. For most of these variables, data from different community studies are used in order to illustrate the respective moderating effect on annoyance. In addition, some of the moderators are presented as possible tools in order to reduce noise annoyance. It is expected that a significant decrease in a negatively moderating variable is as effective in reducing noise annoyance, as is a significant decrease in noise level.",Noise & health,1999,India,1999,90
1574737,"HIV in the U.K.: problems of prevalence, sociological response and health education.","It is argued that the prevalence of AIDS is substantially under-represented in existing national AIDS data. Thus although official statistics demonstrate significant recent shifts in transmission routes for HIV, health educators are faced with a problem because it is difficult to develop preventive strategies against a syndrome whose prevalence can only be estimated. Problems of the true extent of the prevalence of HIV are compounded when there is a lack of knowledge about the specifics of heterosexual behaviour. It is unwise to assume that the protective strategies developed by gay men in the face of HIV are routinely available for adoption by heterosexuals, who are characterised by social divisions of age, gender and relative amounts of social power. These concerns represent a problem for health educators. To date, sociological work may not have made the most effective contribution in its support of intervention strategies against HIV/AIDS. Examination of the empirical literature on lay concepts of health and illness reveals a pessimistic stance on the part of some researchers about the ability of individuals to modify behaviour. More positive readings of their own data are possible. The traditional concerns to emphasise the socio-economic determinants of health and behaviour, now also shared by some health educators, should not obscure a concern for the fate of individuals. The most effective contribution that health promotion may be able to make to the control of HIV in the heterosexual population is to assist in the development of strategies of empowerment and 'horizontal intervention'.",Social science & medicine (1982),1992 Mar,England,1992,90

Studies of the geographic and social variation of stroke mortality between populations have focused solely on either trends or social determinants, but not on both. In addition, conclusions have concentrated on the comparison of whites to nonwhites. The purpose of this study was to investigate the variation in stroke mortality trends, from 1968 to 1987, between US black populations categorized by the socioeconomic structure of the state economic area. The educational achievement profile of the population (percentage of the state economic area that had not completed high school) was used as an indicator of socioeconomic development. This aggregate study assessed whether (1) an inverse relationship existed between stroke mortality and educational achievement category, and (2) levels and trends of stroke mortality by educational achievement category varied from 1968 to 1987, for each age-gender-specific group (35 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 years). Results showed an inverse relationship between educational achievement level of communities and stroke mortality, as well as a rank-ordering in level of educational achievement for all age-gender-specific groups. The absolute difference in rates among educational achievement levels clearly converged over time, with greater convergence in the period 1968 to 1978 than 1979 to 1987. The percent declines were similar across education categories. Results suggest that geographic inequalities in stroke mortality, in relation to socioeconomic structure, have converged over time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Ethnicity & disease,1992 Fall,United States,1992,90
9216030,Levels and determinants of gynecological morbidity in a district of south India.,"This article presents the results of an assessment of gynecological morbidity among 385 women with young children residing in a district of Karnataka State, South India. All three main modes of assessment (clinical examination, laboratory tests, and self-reports) reveal a high burden of reproductive tract infections. The two most common conditions, identified by laboratory tests, were bacterial vaginosis and mucopurulent cervicitis. Approximately one-fourth of the women had clinical evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical ectopy, and fistula. The contribution of sexually transmitted diseases to overall gynecological morbidity appears to be relatively modest; 10 percent were so diagnosed. Associated conditions of anemia and chronic energy deficiency were common. Severe anemia was found in 17 percent of cases and severe chronic energy deficiency in 12 percent. These results indicate that radical improvements in women's health in India will require far more than the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract infections.",Studies in family planning,1997 Jun,United States,1997,90
10067904,Low-weight neonatal survival paradox in the Czech Republic.,"Analysis of vital statistics for the Czech Republic between 1986 and 1993, including 3,254 infant deaths from 350,978 first births to married and single women who conceived at ages 18-29 years, revealed a neonatal survival advantage for low-weight infants born to disadvantaged (single, less educated) women, particularly for deaths from congenital anomalies. This advantage largely disappeared after the neonatal period. The same patterns have been observed for low-weight infants born to black women in the United States. Since the Czech Republic had an ethnically homogenous population, virtually universal prenatal care, and uniform institutional conditions for delivery, Czech results must be attributed to social rather than to biologic or medical circumstances. This strengthens the contention that in the United States, the black neonatal survival paradox may be due as much to race-related social stigmatization and consequent disadvantage as to any hypothesized hereditary influences on birth-weight-specific survival.",American journal of epidemiology,1999 Mar 1,United States,1999,90
8746967,Psychosocial determinants of fruit and vegetable consumption.,"Psychosocial correlates of fruit and vegetable consumption were studied in an adult Dutch population (n = 367) based on the ASE model of attitudes, social influence and self-efficacy. Attitudes were a summation of beliefs about taste, different health consequences, and costs in time and money. Social influences were measured through the social stimulation respondents expected to get from important others to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables and by asking the subjects about the behaviour of important others. Self-efficacy reflected the respondents' ability to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables in various situations. Self-efficacy and attitudes were consistently and significantly associated with consumption of boiled or otherwise heated vegetables, of salads, and of fruit. Furthermore, respondents reporting low consumption of these food groups had lower self-efficacy expectations and less positive attitudes than subjects with relatively high consumption of fruit and vegetables. It is concluded that nutrition education aimed at stimulating fruit and vegetable consumption should focus especially on changing attitudes and self efficacy expectations.",Appetite,1995 Dec,England,1995,90
9648039,Psychosocial determinants of alcohol use among minority youth living in public housing developments.,"Youth residing in low income, inner city, public housing developments might be extremely vulnerable to psychosocial risk factors associated with alcohol use. In this study, we developed and tested a model of alcohol etiology with 624 African-American and Hispanic 7th graders residing in public housing developments. The students completed questionnaires concerning their alcohol use, social influences on their drinking, their drinking attitudes and knowledge, their psychosocial skills, and demographic and behavioral control information. Logistic regression analyses indicated that social influences from adults, friends, and family members predicted alcohol use. Individual psychosocial characteristics, e.g., drinking refusal, lowered the odds of drinking. These findings imply that effective prevention approaches targeting minority urban youths residing in public housing developments should provide them with an awareness of social influences to drink, correct misperceptions concerning the prevalence of drinking, and train them in relevant psychosocial skills.",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,1998 Jun,United States,1998,90
8237314,"Association of overweight, trauma and workload with coxarthrosis. A health survey of 7,217 persons.","In a population sample health survey, body mass, previous trauma and physical stress were studied for associations with coxarthrosis. A sample of 8,000 persons representative of the Finnish population aged 30 or over was invited for examination, and 90 percent participated. On the basis of a standardized clinical examination, a physician diagnosed coxarthrosis in 6 percent of the women and 4 percent of the men. The prevalence rose with age. In persons with a past traumatic lower-limb injury, the odds ratio of unilateral coxarthrosis was 2.1 and of bilateral coxarthrosis 1.5, as adjusted for sex, age and other determinants using logistic regression. The sum index reflecting self-reported features of physical stress in present or previous occupations was directly proportional to the prevalence of coxarthrosis. Body mass index (kg/m2) was closely associated with bilateral coxarthrosis; the adjusted odds ratio (95 percent confidence intervals) for indices > 35, compared to those < 25, was 2.8 (1.4-5.7). In terms of the population attributable fraction, prior trauma, physical stress and body mass were estimated to explain 59 percent of the prevalence of coxarthrosis. The potential for primary prevention may be great, but longitudinal population studies are necessary to elucidate causal significance of the risk factors.",Acta orthopaedica Scandinavica,1993 Oct,England,1993,90
2313073,Situational determinants of coping and coping effectiveness.,"This study contributes to the growing body of research on situational determinants of coping. Based on a general population sample of 1556 married men and women, it goes beyond previous efforts in two ways. First, it presents the first large-scale analysis of situational determinants of coping effectiveness in response to a wide variety of stressful life events and chronic difficulties. This analysis documents that previous aggregate analyses overlooked a number of specifications which, when observed, provide insights into the mechanisms of coping effectiveness. Second, it assesses the importance of two empirically generated multivariate coping profiles, passivity and versatility. The study's findings suggest that these profiles are associated significantly with adjustment to stress, that these associations differ across situations, and that they help to interpret the effects of separate coping strategies.",Journal of health and social behavior,1990 Mar,United States,1990,90
1599999,"Psychobiology of stage fright: the effect of public performance on neuroendocrine, cardiovascular and subjective reactions.","Subjective, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions were studied in high- and low-anxious musicians performing privately and publicly. Musicians were designated as ""high-anxious"" if they reported at least one episode of performance-related tremor and as ""low-anxious"" if they never had experienced tremor while performing in public. All musicians performed privately and publicly while measurements of subjective, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions were made. Ratings of effort and distress were made prior to performance. Heart rate was monitored telemetrically before, during and after performance. Urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol were sampled after public and private performance, respectively. Situational factors influenced most measures. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, heart rate and ratings of distress but not effort increased from private to public performance. Heart rate was higher in high- than in low-anxious musicians during public performance but similar during private performance. The increase in neuroendocrine activation from private to public performance was similar in the high- and low-anxious groups. It is concluded that heart rate is a sensitive measure of both situational and individual determinants of performance-related distress.",Biological psychology,1992 May,Netherlands,1992,90
7789476,Prospective study of risk factors for early and persistent wheezing in childhood.,"The object of this study was to determine the relative importance of low birth weight, preterm birth, low maternal age, household size, exposure to maternal smoking, personal smoking at 16 yrs of age, early termination of breastfeeding and socioeconomic status in the aetiology of wheezing illness in the first 5 yrs of life, and on the persistence of this illness at 16 yrs of age. In 15,712 children born in Britain during one week of April 1970, the occurrence of wheezing by 5 yrs of age, and of wheezing in the past year at 16 yrs of age within this group were analysed in multivariate logistic regression against each potential risk factor. The independent determinants of wheezing by 5 yrs of age were male sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) for 15+ cigarettes.day-1 = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.22-1.58) and low birthweight (OR for birthweight < 2.5 kg = 1.26; 95% Cl 1.07-1.50). Of children who had wheezed by 5 yrs of age, 15% reported wheezing in the past 12 months at 16 yrs of age. The persistence of symptoms at 16 yrs of age was independently related to low maternal age (OR for 20 vs 40 yrs of age = 1.96; 95% CI 1.08-3.45) and to high social status (OR for most vs least advantaged = 1.95; 95% CI 1.13-3.38). We conclude that low birth weight and maternal smoking in pregnancy are independent risk factors for early childhood wheezing, but in 85% of children with early wheezing it resolves by 16 yrs of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",The European respiratory journal,1995 Mar,England,1995,90
9808806,Psycho-social determinants and motivational phases in smoking behavior of cardiac inpatients.,"BACKGROUND: To explore possibilities for health education, this study analyzed the differences in motives regarding smoking cessation of cardiac inpatients in various motivational phases. The Attitude-Social influence-Efficacy Model (ASE model) was used to assess motives, while motivational phases were measured with concepts from the Transtheoretical Model. METHODS: Data on smoking behavior, attitudes, social influences, self-efficacy expectations, and motivational phases were collected from a sample of 532 cardiac inpatients. A revised typology of the Transtheoretical Model was used for measuring motivational phases and resulted in four groups: smokers in precontemplation, smokers in contemplation, externally motivated actors, and internally motivated actors. Analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used to study differences in psycho-social determinants between these four groups. RESULTS: As hypothesized, externally motivated actors differed from internally motivated actors in having less positive attitudes, less social support, and lower self-efficacy expectations. Attitudes and social support were most positive among smokers in contemplation and internally motivated actors. Self-efficacy expectations were lowest among subjects in precontemplation and contemplation. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in different motivational phases differed in their psycho-social determinants. Therefore, it is recommended that stage-tailored education be developed. Finally, externally motivated actors have to be approached in a different way than internally motivated actors.",Preventive medicine,1998 Sep-Oct,United States,1998,90
12282988,The impact of taxation on the distribution of wealth in an economy with changing population.,"The authors examine the determinants of the personal distribution of income and wealth using an overlapping generations model in which all individuals are assumed to be identical except for their inherited wealth. ""It is shown that, in general, higher tax rates reduce distributive inequality as long as the rate of interest is exogenously given. In steady state, however, where the rate of interest is determined endogenously, increasing taxation and higher social security payments both diminish the capital labor ratio so that the rate of interest rises. If this interest effect is strong enough then it may outbalance the tendency toward more equality because higher interest rates enhance initial differences in the distribution of both income and wealth and, eventually, the inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in the society."" The geographical focus is on developed countries.",Journal of population economics,1990,Germany,1990,90

Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey of 1046 households (5546 individuals) sampled from locations in two counties situated in the study area. The survey included anthropometric measurements, a 24-hour dietary recall, stool tests, and childhood mortality data. Children of private farmers and ""wealthy peasants"" displayed better nutritional status, higher quality diet, lower prevalence of intestinal parasites, and a lower risk of dying than those whose parents were communal farmers, from ejidos, or ""poor peasants"". The results suggest that using volume of maize production as a classification method proved more valuable than land tenure to identify agricultural groups with different health status. It appears that the main determinants of health differentials are structural inequities in resource distribution. Thus, the impact of medical interventions on inequalities will be limited unless they are accompanied by redistribution of resources.",Cadernos de saude publica,1999 Apr-Jun,Brazil,1999,90

10472279,Trends in teenage pregnancy in England and Wales: how can we explain them?,"Teenage pregnancy is associated with adverse social and physical outcomes for both mother and child. We drew on various sources--birth and abortion statistics from the Office for National Statistics, data from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, and routinely collected data from family planning clinics--to identify trends in England and Wales and their possible determinants. The rate of teenage sexual activity has increased steadily and consistently over the past four decades, whilst the rate of teenage fertility has shown greater variation. When the teenage fertility rate is calculated against the denominator of sexually active women, rather than the total sample of teenage women, the underlying trend in teenage fertility over the past four decades has been downwards, though not consistently so. Fluctuations in the teenage fertility rate seem to track intervention-related factors such as access to, and use of, contraceptive services and the general climate surrounding the sexual health of young people.",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,1999 Jun,England,1999,90
9663916,Distribution and determinants of cardiovascular events during 20 years of successful antihypertensive treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: To define the distribution and determinants of cardiovascular disease events among participants undergoing long-term antihypertensive therapy, and to stratify them into risk groups on the basis of pretreatment clinical profiles. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of participants in a worksite-based antihypertensive treatment program in New York city (1973-1994). PATIENTS: We studied 8690 systematically treated patients who had at least 6 months of follow-up (average of 5.7 years) and, at entry, had had a systolic blood pressure of > or = 160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of > or = 95 mmHg (after 1992 > or = 140/90 mmHg), or had been being administered antihypertensive medication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure and incidence of morbid and mortal cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Blood pressure control (to 140 +/- 3/87 +/- 7 mmHg) was achieved by the first year and maintained through 18 years of therapy. In nearly 50,000 person-years of follow-up, there were 468 cardiovascular disease events [myocardial infarction including revascularization (282), strokes (93), congestive heart failure (30) and other cardiovascular deaths (63)]. Deaths from cardiovascular disease events accounted for 68% of all deaths. Myocardial infarction was most common throughout, but congestive heart failure incidence surpassed stroke incidence after 10 years. A scheme for risk stratification was constructed after analysis of the independent association of baseline factors and incident cardiovascular events. Upon the basis of ease of ascertainment and their demonstrated associations with occurrence of cardiovascular disease during treatment, we selected five pretreatment factors (history of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, age > or = 55 years and pulse pressure > or = 60 mmHg) to stratify patients into four groups. Those with no risk factor had a low risk (n=2999), those with one had a moderate risk (3042), those with two had a high risk (2237), and those with three or more had a very high risk (412). Overall, the unadjusted rates of incidence of cardiovascular disease events per 1000 person-years for patients in very high and low risk groups differed by factors of six and 14 for men and women, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that long-term control of blood pressure can be achieved in a general population. Nevertheless, cardiovascular disease events still accounted for most morbidity and mortality among these 'recovered' hypertensive patients. At entry, on the basis of readily identifiable characteristics, it was possible to stratify patients according to likelihood of subsequent events occurring despite control of blood pressure. This scheme could provide the basis for targeting more aggressive therapy where the potential for further cardioprotection is greatest.",Journal of hypertension,1998 Jun,England,1998,90
8237543,"Cognitive, psychosocial, and reported sexual behavior differences between pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents.","A wide variety of variables have been related to the occurrence of adolescent pregnancy. However, many previous studies have produced conflicting results and are univariate in nature. The purpose of this study was to assess differences in pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents on variables from three domains: cognitive, psychosocial, and reported sexual behavior. Sixty-nine pregnant adolescents and 58 comparison adolescents filled out nine questionnaires presented on microcomputers. Significant differences were found on 10 of 24 univariate tests. The strongest differences concerned areas of scholastic functioning and reported sexual behavior; pregnant teenagers were more likely than nonpregnant peers to be doing poorly in school and less likely to use contraceptives. In addition, pregnant teenagers were more likely to have a relative or friend who was an adolescent mother and to expect child rearing to be easier than did the nonpregnant adolescents. A discriminant analysis was computed which correctly classified 83% of the sample, based on variables from each of the three domains. This study has served to replicate, refute, and expand on previous findings concerning the antecedents of teenage pregnancy. More importantly, this study has empirically demonstrated the multivariate and interrelated nature of variables associated with teenage pregnancy.",Adolescence,1993 Fall,United States,1993,90
9561667,The influence of traditional religion on fertility regulation among the Kassena-Nankana of northern Ghana.,"This article presents findings from a study of the influence of traditional religion on reproductive preferences of Kassena-Nankana lineage heads in northern Ghana. Seven reproductive preference questions were administered to nine lineage heads who are primary practitioners of the cult of soothsaying. With the assistance of soothsayers, interviews were repeated in conjunction with the invocation of religious rites in order to determine the views of ancestral spirits on the seven questions. Pairs of lineage head and ancestral interviews are compared to determine the role of traditional religion in shaping male reproductive preferences. Interview pairs reflect a shared preference for sons, large compounds, and a growing lineage. Findings nonetheless show that some ancestral spirits want small families, some even wanting fewer children than corresponding lineage heads. Spiritual consultations are nondogmatic and open to external ideas and influences, suggesting that family planning introduction will not encounter systematic religious opposition among the Kassena-Nankana.",Studies in family planning,1998 Mar,United States,1998,90

Specifically, we consider the net effects of family income, age structure of the population, marital instability, female labor force participation, real alcohol price and daily life routines on total alcohol consumption. Our findings indicate that changes in the population age structure and in daily life routines were associated with predicted changes in consumption over the period studied. They also indicate associations between marital instability and female labor force participation and consumption, although in the direction contrary to our prediction. Unlike a number of previous studies in which economic variables were found to be the major determinants of consumption trends, we find that family income and the price of alcohol play a minor role in the model we estimated. These results indicate that social structural factors have greater utility for our understanding of alcohol consumption patterns, and, by implication, for attempts to reduce alcohol-related social problems, than do economic factors.",Journal of studies on alcohol,1993 Mar,United States,1993,90
9616410,Blood thiamin status and determinants in the population of Seychelles (Indian Ocean).,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Micronutrient deficiencies have become rare in industrialised countries as availability of fresh food, supplementation, and fortification have improved but a less favourable situation may still prevail in many developing countries. Blood thiamin status and determinants were therefore investigated in the Seychelles in view of the high incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy and as the staple diet is polished rice that is deficient in thiamin. DESIGN: This was a cross sectional population study using an age and sex stratified random sample. SETTING: Seychelles Islands (Indian Ocean). PARTICIPANTS: A subsample of 206 subjects aged 25-64 years from the population of Seychelles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurement of total thiamin concentration in whole blood using high performance liquid chromatography. Dietary variables measured using a face to face semi-quantitative food questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean (SD) whole blood thiamin concentration was 77.9 (22.4) nmol/l and low concentration (< 70 nmol/l) was found in 37% of the subjects (95% CI: 31%, 44%). Blood thiamin was significantly related to education and diet but not to age, sex, smoking, and body mass index. Blood thiamin was associated positively with meat, vegetable, salad, and tea intake and negatively with alcohol and fish intake. However, no combination of the examined variables could explain more than 15% of the observed variance in blood thiamin values. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the distribution of blood thiamin in the sampled population is shifted to lower values compared with that generally accepted as normal in European populations. Further research should establish the significance of such lower values in this specific population to facilitate clinical and public health action as necessary.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,1998 Apr,England,1998,90
2218623,Levels of health development: a new tool for comparative research and policy formulation.,"Levels of health development are formed by mathematically clustering countries using six health status indicators: crude birth, crude death, infant mortality and child death rates, and male and female life expectancy. Stratifying two international samples of 128 and 163 countries into levels of health development--groups with similar health status profiles--improves the results of regression analyses used to identify economic, political, social, educational, health and other health determinants. For this reason, health development levels are a systematic framework for delineation of health determinants. Earlier large scale statistical studies have been limited in their success in part because they did not partition their data sets prior to analysis, or used inappropriate criteria that blurred rather than heightened developmental differences in underlying social systems. These developmental differences regulate the way in which health status inputs are converted into health status outputs, defining the relative importance of health determinants at various developmental levels. At lowest health development levels (countries with poorer health status), the under-development of economic, health and educational infrastructures creates a vacuum which allows international intervention (aid, investment, export/import activities) to play a dominant role in health status determination. At middle health development levels, health and educational infrastructures are better developed, but still secondary in importance as health status determinants to basic economic infrastructure. Demographic problems are particularly apparent at these levels. At higher health development levels, education, women's status, and political structure are especially important health status determinants. This research has facilitated the identification of health status determinants for use in health policy analysis. Recommendations for future research include use of findings in health policymaking by individual countries and by comparative researchers, and development of appropriate health systems models for each level of health development.",Social science & medicine (1982),1990,England,1990,90
10450858,Psychological and social determinants of women's decisions to undergo genetic counseling and testing for breast cancer.,"This study examined the demand for breast cancer genetic testing and counseling among Canadian women diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50, together with some of the factors predicting both their intentions to be tested and the degree to which they act on their intentions. Participants were 110 women under the age of 50 and comprised of two groups: 1) women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC, n = 60): and 2) an index group of unaffected women from the general population (GP, n = 50). All participants completed a survey that addressed family history of breast and other cancers, demographic variables, knowledge and attitudes about breast cancer, and genetic testing. Members of the BC group were offered genetic counseling and testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 free of charge. Overall, 60% of participants indicated they would like the test, and 40% either did not want it or were uncertain. Seventy-two percent of women in the BC group wanted to be tested. Of these, only 49% had actually contacted the genetic counselor about testing at follow-up 3-15 months later. Intention to be tested was associated with presence of breast cancer, greater perceived benefits of testing, fewer perceived 'costs' of testing, and higher levels of concern about the risk of relatives developing breast cancer. Actual arranging to meet with the genetic counselor among women in the BC group was associated with fewer perceived costs of having the test. Results suggest a moderate level of interest in gene testing, though intention to be tested may not translate into actual uptake. Women who do choose to have the test may believe the potential 'costs' of using this new genetic technology to be relatively few. This has implications for genetic counselors in terms of providing balanced and complete information to women considering genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility.",Clinical genetics,1999 Jun,Denmark,1999,90

Postal questionnaires were completed by 502 of West German company doctors. About one third of those who responded, reported that they carried out the requirements of the German Work Safety Law with regard to workplace-related prevention. Multivariate analysis was applied to discover the factors that influenced compliance. We conclude that investment in supply-side factors (doctors' qualifications, experiences and recourses) are not enough to bring about compliance. More important are the demand-side regulations which directly address the health and safety culture of the companies.","Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",1993,England,1993,90

DESIGN: In a cohort of men and women, aged 30-60 years at first examination in 1982/1984, smoking behaviour was evaluated from questionnaires at baseline and at follow up 10 years later. SETTING: County of Copenhagen, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 2554 subjects from the original sample of 4581 were successfully followed. This study deals with the 1365 subjects who were smokers at the first examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Smoking status (abstinent for one year or more) at follow up. RESULTS: At follow up 15% of the baseline smokers had been abstinent for one year or more. In multivariate analysis, successful smoking cessation was associated with older age, high social status, low prior tobacco consumption, baseline motivation to stop smoking, and having a non-smoking spouse/cohabitant. The same result was obtained when the analyses were repeated separately for smokers with and without motivation to stop. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers motivated to stop are more likely to quit and remain abstinent than smokers with no such motivation. Age, social status, spouse/cohabitant's smoking behaviour, and the daily consumption of tobacco predict success in smoking cessation, irrespective of smokers' former motivation to stop.",Tobacco control,1998 Autumn,England,1998,90

8737429,Antibiotic use in a periurban community in Mexico: a household and drugstore survey.,"In developing countries, antibiotics are the most common drugs sold, and some data suggest that they are frequently misused. In order to describe the pattern of antibiotic use in a periurban community in Mexico City, 1659 randomly-selected households were visited and an interview with the housewife was carried out. Six local drugstores also were selected at random. A social worker made six visits to each pharmacy, observed the events during the purchase of the drug and applied a structured questionnaire to the customer immediately after the transaction. Of 8279 individuals, 425 (5%) said that they had used at least one antimicrobial in the preceding 2 weeks and antibiotics were the majority (29%) of the drug sales. The main perceived reasons for drug use were acute respiratory tract ailments and gastroenteritis. Interviewees reported that antibiotic therapy was given in 27% of respiratory diseases and in 37% of all diarrheal episodes. The drugs most commonly reported were: penicillins, erythromycin, metronidazole, neomycin, cotrimoxazole and tetracyclines. While self-medication and drug purchases without medical prescription were common, the majority of antibiotics were prescribed by a physician. Approximately two thirds of individuals using an antibiotic said they had used it for less than 5 days and 72% of the purchases were for insufficient quantities of drugs. Our data suggest that antibiotics are frequently misused and they support the need to assess the determinants of self-medication, health-seeking behavior and physician prescribing practices. The need for effective educational programs to improve prescribers' decisions is stressed.",Social science & medicine (1982),1996 Apr,England,1996,90

Pattern, predictors, and impact on everyday life in a 4-year follow-up.","OBJECTIVES: To assess the evolution of cognitive dysfunction in early-onset multiple sclerosis, to identify clinical predictors of mental decline, and to determine its impact on a patient's everyday life. DESIGN: The cognitive performance of 50 patients with multiple sclerosis on a neuropsychological battery was compared with that of 70 control subjects initially and again after a 4-year interval. Clinical predictors of cognitive impairment and its effect on daily life were analyzed by stepwise linear regression. SETTING: The research clinic of a university department of neurology. PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive sample of 50 inpatients and outpatients with multiple sclerosis (mean disease duration, 1.58 years) and 70 demographically matched healthy control subjects selected from the patients' relatives and friends. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean psychometric test scores of both groups at the initial and follow-up testing. Regression coefficients measuring the relationship between clinical parameters and cognitive capacity and between mental decline and performance of common tasks measured by the Environmental and the Incapacity Status scales. RESULTS: Multiple sclerosis-related deficits in verbal memory and abstract reasoning on initial testing remained more or less stable on the retest, at which time linguistic disturbances on the Set and Token tests also emerged. A patient's initial disability level predicted decreased performance on only four of 13 cognitive variables, and disease duration did so on only two. Extent of intellectual decline on initial testing, initial disability level, and progressive course were independent determinants of handicap in a patient's work and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and neurological deficits appear not to develop in parallel. Yet cognitive dysfunction proves to be a predictor of handicap in everyday life, even in patients in the incipient phase of multiple sclerosis.",Archives of neurology,1995 Feb,United States,1995,90
10641810,Primordial prevention: the path from Victoria to Catalonia.,"Primordial prevention seeks to prevent future disease by influencing its social determinants. Henry Blackburn's writings are prime portrayals of social factors causing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). His classic paper, Diet and Mass Hyperlipidemia, identified changes needed in professional attitudes, medical economics, food production, food labeling, and food advertising. The 1982 WHO report, Coronary Heart Disease (Blackburn, rapporteur), introduced the term ""primordial prevention,"" starting a cycle of initiatives, all with considerable influence worldwide. He participated in the now widely disseminated Victoria Declaration on Heart Health (1992), which contained 64 policy recommendations, many focussing on broad social forces that influence modern CVD epidemics. The path he initiated led to the Catalonia Declaration: Investing in Heart Health (1996), which echoed many of his pleas for resources necessary to influence CVD rates. Some roots of CVD's recent decline in many countries are thus clearly attributable to Blackburn's prescient wisdom and visionary scholarship.",Preventive medicine,1999 Dec,United States,1999,90

Sex differences exist for four of eight measures. For most indicators, mental health is relatively poor among youth and improves with age. Physical and mental health problems are associated. There is no independent relation between mental health and income adequacy or province of residence.

Instruments developed for use in hospital level implementation of the WHO/UNICEF baby friendly hospital initiative were used in five hospitals (two public and three private). No hospital was implementing all Ten Steps. A core hospital team on lactation management and a sufficient number of health personnel skillful in breastfeeding counselling and adequate delivery room conditions are required to implement the Ten Steps. It is very difficult to provide these conditions in public hospitals with an excessive patient load. On the other hand, the fee for service system and the policy of changing practices according to the wishes of the clients can also become barriers to successful breastfeeding, as may occur in some private hospitals.","Child: care, health and development",1997 Mar,England,1997,90
12320815,Are fertility differentials by education converging in the United States?,"""According to the theory of demographic transition, fertility differentials by education tend to become strongly negative in the early stages of transition, because family limitation tends to catch on first among the more educated. As the transition proceeds, contraceptive use diffuses to the less educated, and fertility differentials by education eventually tend to reconverge. The question addressed here is: Do fertility differentials by education disappear or become positive in advanced industrial societies? Evidence presented in this paper indicates that in the United States they do not. As late as 1990, the latest year that we consider, fertility differentials by education were still strongly negative."" (SUMMARY IN ITA AND FRE)",Genus,1996 Jul-Dec,Germany,1996,90
1619418,Preoperative psychological adjustment and surgical outcome are determinants of psychosocial status after anterior temporal lobectomy.,"This investigation evaluated the role of preoperative psychological adjustment, degree of postoperative seizure reduction, and other relevant variables (age, education, IQ, age at onset of epilepsy, laterality of resection) in determining emotional/psychosocial outcome following anterior temporal lobectomy. Ninety seven patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin were administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Washington Psychosocial Seizure Inventory (WPSI), and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) both before and six to eight months after anterior temporal lobectomy. The data were subjected to a nonparametric rank sum technique (O'Brien's procedure) which combined the test scores to form a single outcome index (TOTAL PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOME) that was analysed by multiple regression procedures. Results indicated that the most powerful predictors of patients' overall postoperative psychosocial outcome were: 1) The adequacy of their preoperative psychosocial adjustment, and 2) A totally seizure-free outcome. Additional analyses were carried out separately on the MMPI, WPSI, and GHQ to determine whether findings varied as a function of the specific outcome measure. These results were related to the larger literature concerned with the psychological outcome of anterior temporal lobectomy.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",1992 Jun,England,1992,90
8656319,Assessment and prediction of stress-related growth.,"This article reports the development of the Stress-Related Growth Scale (SRGS) and its use in a study examining determinants of stress-related positive outcomes for college students. Study 1 analyses showed that the SRGS has acceptable internal and test-retest reliability and that scores are not influenced by social desirability. Study 2 analyses showed that college students' SRGS responses were significantly related to those provided by friends and relatives on their behalf. Study 3 analyses tested the determinants of stress-related growth longitudinally. Significant predictors of the SRGS were (a) intrinsic religiousness; (b) social support satisfaction; (c) stressfulness of the negative event; (d) positive reinterpretation and acceptance coping; and (e) number of recent positive life events. The SRGS was also positively related to residual change in optimism, positive affectivity, number of socially supportive others, and social support satisfaction, lending further support to the validity of this new scale. Results have implications for current theory on stress-related positive outcomes.",Journal of personality,1996 Mar,United States,1996,90
7836655,Relationship between physical performance and self-perceived physical function.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare two methods of measuring physical function in subjects with a broad range of abilities and to evaluate the effects of cognitive, social, educational, and age factors on the relationship between the two methods. DESIGN: Multiple regression analysis was used to compare self-perceived (dependent variables) with performance measures (independent variables). Covariates included age, gender, Mini-Mental State Exam score, education, living status, and depression score. SETTING: Five community-dwelling and two nursing home sites. PARTICIPANTS: 417 community-dwelling subjects and 200 nursing home residents aged 62-98 years. MEASUREMENTS: Self-perceived physical function was assessed with the physical dimension summary score of the Sickness Impact Profile, which comprises three subscales: ambulation, mobility, and body care and movement. Physical performance was evaluated by self-selected gait speed, chair-stand time, maximal grip strength, and a balance score. RESULTS: Nursing home residents and community-dwellers were significantly different (P < .0001) in all variables except age and gender. Self-perceived and performance-based measures were moderately correlated, with a range from r = -.194 to r = -.625 (P < .05). Gait speed was the strongest independent predictor of self-perceived physical function in both groups. Symptoms of depression were also an independent predictor of self-perceived function in nursing home residents; subjects who had such symptoms report more self-perceived dysfunction than would be predicted based on performance tests. CONCLUSIONS: Self-selected gait speed is a global indicator of self-perceived physical function over a broad range of abilities. External determinants (depressive symptoms, cognitive function, marital status, etc.) affect self-perceived function in both groups, but gait speed is the greatest single predictor of self-perceived function. In nursing home residents depressive symptomatology is related to self-perceived.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,1995 Feb,United States,1995,90
10214405,"The condom conundrum: barriers to condom use among commercial sex workers in Durban, South Africa.","We examined socio-cultural and economic determinants of condom use among 100 female South African commercial sex workers. The symbolism and dynamics of condom use between sex workers and their clientele were explored. These issues were also investigated when sex workers negotiated sex with their personal partners. An additional focus was the extent to which HIV/AIDS influences women's condom use in these situations. Results demonstrate considerable contrast between factors influencing condom use in professional versus private sex situations. With clients, practical issues such as financial strain were the major obstacles to condom use. With personal sex partners, sex workers avoided condoms due to their negative symbolism. Condoms were seen as suggestive of filth, disease, infidelity, and mistrust. HIV/AIDS awareness had minimal impact on condom use. HIV/AIDS was viewed as a remote threat, overridden by immediate practical and emotional concerns. The intervention implications of condom symbolism and differential barriers to condom use are discussed.",African journal of reproductive health,1997 Mar,Nigeria,1997,90
8930590,Determinants of oral health in a group of Danish alcoholics.,"The purposes of this survey were to describe dental health in a group of alcoholics and to analyze the influence of social background, dental health behavior and alcohol-related variables on dental health among alcoholics. The dental health in a group of consecutively admitted alcoholics (n = 195) was described with respect to number of teeth present, DMFS, DS and the prevalence of dental erosion, removable dentures, edentulousness, and untreated dental decay. No major differences were found with respect to number of teeth and dental caries (DMFS), when compared to reference figures of the general population. As to untreated decay, however, 3-5 x more actual decayed surfaces were found among the alcoholics. In the multivariate analyses, neither DMFS, nor untreated decay were found to be associated with alcohol-related indicators. These variables were, however, related to variables of social background and dental health behavior. As to number of teeth present, an association was found with duration of alcoholism, but this relationship was eliminated, when the analysis was controlled with respect to social situation. In contrast, dental erosion was related to duration of alcoholism irrespective of confounding control of dental health behavior and social situation. Hence, the study indicates that oral health in alcoholics can be explained mainly by social situation and dental health behavior and not by variables associated directly with alcohol consumption. An exception was the presence of dental erosion, which was associated with the exposure to alcohol.",European journal of oral sciences,1996 Aug,England,1996,90
8180289,Effects on Navajo birthrate from loss of the intrauterine device.,"The concerns of relatively powerless groups may not be adequately addressed by health-care decisions based on market forces and on considerations of the general population. Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal. Available data are limited in their ability to assess impacts on small groups of health-policy decisions made for the population as a whole. A mechanism for surveilling such effects needs to be established to protect the interests of such groups, particularly when they have restricted alternatives.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,1994,United States,1994,90
9769664,[A theoretical approach to health and its measurement].,"INTRODUCTION: For a long period of time analyses of health status have been based on mortality data, while in this century indicators of morbidity have been introduced as well. However, these two indicators also have limitations because health of the total population was estimated on the basis of data referring to the diseased or deceased during a certain period of time. The definition of health by the World Health Organization was a progress, because the medical model of health was extended to the sociological model with emphasis on well-being, achievement of goals, functioning in the society and social rules. Subjective interpretation of health also has a significant place in assessment of health status of an individual or population groups. CONCEPTION OF HEALTH: Health has a subjective and an objective dimension. It can be analyzed as a global quality, but also as a sum of specific qualities--physical, social and psychological. Health analyses include the following parameters: mental well-being (affective status, mental functioning), physical health (ability to proceed with activities, body integrity, general physical capacity), general well-being and functioning (perceiving general health and expectations in regard to health in the future). Health is a prerequisite of social and economic status, and that is why emphasis is on social adaptation, but social support as well. HEALTH MEASUREMENT: Health measurement can be functional with diagnostic, prognostic or evaluation purpose. Health indicators can also be descriptive, focused on a certain organ, diagnostic methods, but complex as well measuring syndromes, global health and quality of life. Development of health promotion and programs of disease prevention, follow-up of their application, progress and results require various categories of measurement. Some of them identify or quantify the problem, others describe the determinants. There exists a need to measure the contents and processes of intervention and evaluation. Numerous scales of health measurement, that is different aspects of health and quality of life, have been developed, but many of them have limitations, particularly concerning validity and reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Most of existing indicators reflect the model of disease, while contemporary approach to health deals primarily with health itself. This model is oriented towards everyday life and relationships between individuals or groups of people and their physical and social environment as well as towards the way they influence health and well-being. The model also emphasizes well-being, achievement of goals, functioning in the society and social roles. Subjective assessment of health is significant in evaluation of health status, that is quality of life in regard to health, which is being done by different scales. The development of such scales is slow due to different opinions concerning the definition of health and health measurement. Efforts to develop scales which would satisfy the basic characteristics of measurement have largely focused on validity, reliability, accuracy, sensibility, specificity and feasibility.",Medicinski pregled,1998 Jul-Aug,Serbia,1998,90
9807368,"Mental illness and Irish people: stereotypes, determinants and changing perspectives.","The causes of psychological illness in Irish people have been identified with colonial rule and the catastrophic conditions deriving from famine in the nineteenth century. In particular, the scourge of unremitting emigration, resulting from famine, has formed a background against which speculative theories of inferiority, alienation and mental illness have been constructed. In particular, the long standing idea that Irish people exhibit higher rates of schizophrenia, both in Ireland and abroad, is discussed. Contemporary studies which suggest that these elevated rates do not correspond to international diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are introduced. Rather, these enhanced rates may reflect a malaise which resembles schizophrenia but which is really a product of historical dispossession. The importance of these factors is underscored by the previous neglect of Irish people, considered as an ethnic minority, as well as the particular distaste which many Irish people display towards such a notion.",Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,1998 Aug,England,1998,90
22151109,Intrathecal therapy for cancer and nonmalignant pain: patient selection and patient management.,"Intrathecal drug delivery improves pain relief, reduces suffering, and enhances quality of life in the small proportion of patients who do not respond well to oral analgesics, including oral morphine. Although morphine is the ""gold standard,"" and the only drug approved for intrathecal pain therapy in the United States, off-label use of alternative agents appears promising, particularly in patients with neuropathic pain. Careful patient selection and management are significant determinants of successful treatment outcomes. Patient selection criteria for cancer and nonmalignant pain are similar; however, a more comprehensive psychological and social assessment is required for patients with nonmalignant pain. In addition, all patients (those with cancer or nonmalignant pain) must exhibit a positive response to an epidural or intrathecal screening test. A multidisciplinary team approach, involving psychologists, nurses, physical therapists, social workers, and spiritual leaders should be used to manage patients. Current practices for patient selection and management, screening tests, and dosing guidelines for intrathecal drug delivery systems are discussed.",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,1999 Apr,United States,1999,90
12347198,The environment and refugees: theoretical and policy issues.,"""The concept of inverted question markenvironmental refugee' is not included in the definition of refugee as established by the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, which are the most widely used instruments providing the basis for granting asylum to persons in need of protection. Yet, it is increasingly being recognized that environmental factors interact with political, economic, social and biopsychological factors to generate mass movements of people which may require a humanitarian response by the international community. In order to improve our understanding of the role that environmental factors play in triggering migration, it is necessary to recognize the multivariate nature of the phenomenon under consideration, where the difference between internal and international migration is often accidental and there is a continuum between proactive and reactive migration.""",Population bulletin of the United Nations,1995,United States,1995,90
9041742,Use of the Pap test by a population group in Buenos Aires.,"The study reported here sought to assess Pap test coverage of a group of asymptomatic Argentine women from the poor urban district of La Matanza in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area Initially, all 2495 women who voluntarily enrolled in a program for early detection of breast cancer between January 1991 and June 1993 were included. After removing those who did not meet various study criteria, there remained 779 study subjects with no gynecologic or mammary symptomatology. Two subgroups of these 779 were established-women who had received a Pap test at any time and those who had received such a test within the previous three years. Using these subgroups, the influence of certain sociodemographic and other variables upon the likelihood of Pap testing was assessed. The results indicated significant associations between past Pap testing and age, formal education, parity, and a family history of cancer Likewise, significant associations were found between Pap testing within the preceding three years and age, formal education, and parity. The study findings affirm the idea that it would be advisable to seek Pap testing for all study population women once every three years instead of every year. Since the study population was not necessarily representative of Buenos Aires population, however, and the findings could have been affected by self-selection and other biases, additional studies are needed to determine actual Pap test coverage among women of the metropolitan area.",Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization,1996 Dec,United States,1996,90
7713178,Definitions and determinants of handicap in people with disabilities.,"Researchers have made a distinction between disability and its social and psychological consequences, now known as handicap, both conceptually and in terms of intervention. More work is needed in standardizing and refining the assessment of handicap and in highlighting risk factors for its development. Epidemiology has major contributions to make in understanding handicap in both aging and young populations. Data on the prevalence and incidence of handicap are scarce and difficult to obtain. Efforts are needed in the following areas: 1) contributing to the methodology of handicap assessment through the provision of valid and reliable scales; 2) defining and identifying risk factors for handicap formation, which underscores the need for analytic studies in this regard; 3) understanding the dynamics of these factors in the production of disadvantage, which calls for more qualitative and in-depth interviews with persons with handicaps; and 4) formulating critical points of intervention at the personal and community levels for handicap prevention. Such efforts will assist policy-makers in formulating appropriate and acceptable policies for safeguarding the opportunities of people with disabilities, ensuring their optimal participation in society, and enabling them to lead independent and self-sufficient lives. Efforts to evaluate the effect of legislation, both existing and recent, on handicap development are also called for. These efforts may help to reduce the gap between disabled and nondisabled people and improve the quality of life for people with disabilities and their families.",Epidemiologic reviews,1994,United States,1994,90

8567618,Impact of parent monitoring on initiation of drug use through late childhood.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether parental supervision and monitoring in middle childhood might have a sustained impact on risk of drug use later in childhood and adolescence. METHOD: An epidemiological sample of 926 urban-dwelling youths were individually interviewed annually, beginning in 1989 when the children were 8 to 10 years old, continuing through 1992. Standardized questions measured drug use, parenting behaviors, and other suspected determinants of drug use. RESULTS: Survival analysis estimates indicated that children in the lowest quartile of parent monitoring initiated drug use at earlier ages. The contrast in risk of initiating alcohol, tobacco, or other drug use across levels of parent monitoring was greatest when children were under 11 years old; at older ages there was no difference in risk. However, in analyses focused specifically on marijuana, cocaine, and inhalant drugs, we observed a sustained higher risk of starting to use these drugs among youths who had been monitored at the lowest levels in middle childhood. CONCLUSION: These results add to the chain of inference that effective supervision and monitoring in middle childhood by parents or guardians might induce a delay or prevent onset of drug use among youths living in urban areas, a hypothesis that now ought to be tested in rigorous field experiments.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,1996 Jan,United States,1996,90
