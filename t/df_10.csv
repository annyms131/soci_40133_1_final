26472402,Vascular risk factors and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: a follow-up of a national cohort of Swedish men.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the role of vascular risk factors in the genesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) using data from a large cohort of Swedish conscripts. METHODS: We used data from a nationwide cohort of 49 321 Swedish men born during 1949-1951, conscripted for compulsory military service in 1969-1970 with nearly complete follow-up to 2009. Information on surgically treated RRD between 1973 and 2009 was collected from the National Patient Register. We fitted Cox regression models stratified on myopia degree and including blood pressure levels, body mass index and cigarette smoking. Population attributable fractions of RRD were estimated through maximum likelihood methods. RESULTS: We observed 262 cases of RRD in 1 725 770 person-years. At multivariate analysis, the number of cigarettes per day showed a reverse association with the risk of RRD (p for trend 0.01). Conscripts with obesity presented a higher risk compared with normal subjects (adjusted HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.02 to 6.13). We found weak evidence of an association between blood pressure and RRD (HR for men with hypertension compared with normotension 1.41, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.13). All the observed associations were stronger when the analysis was restricted to non-myopic conscripts. In particular, the HR for hypertension was 2.33 (95% CI 1.30 to 4.19) compared with normotension. If this association is causal, we estimated that 42.0% of RRD cases (95% CI 11.5% to 62.0%) occurring among non-myopics are attributable to elevated blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular risk factors may be important determinants of RRD, particularly among non-myopics. Further investigations on the role of hypertension and obesity are needed.",The British journal of ophthalmology,2016 Jul,England,2016,10
32047718,Application of Twitter and web news mining in infectious disease surveillance systems and prospects for public health.,"Aims: With the advancements of communication technology and growing access to social networks, these networks now play an important role in the dissemination of information and news without going through the time-consuming channels of official news networks. Analysis of social networking data is a new, interesting branch of text mining science. This study aimed to develop a text mining technique for extracting information about infectious diseases from tweets and news on social media. Methods: A method called ""Fuzzy Algorithm for Extraction, Monitoring, and Classification of Infectious Diseases"" (FAEMC-ID) was developed by the use of fuzzy modeling of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type. In addition to the real-time classification, the method is able to update its vocabulary for new keywords and visualize the classified data on the world map to mark the high risk areas. Results: As an example, the monitoring was performed for measles-related news items over a 183-hour period from 01/03/2019 (01:00 am) to 08/03/2019 (12:00 pm), which were related to 2,870 tweets from 2,556 users. This monitoring showed that the number of tweets posted from each region ranged from 1 to 47, with the highest number, 47 tweets, belonging to Canada. The origins of most measles-related news were in the Americas and Europe, and they were mostly from the United States and Canada. Conclusion: The performance analysis of the developed method in comparison with other algorithms in the literature demonstrated the excellent precision of the method with a recall ratio of 88.41% and the high inter-correlation of data in each class. The proposed algorithm can also be used in the development of more effective monitoring and tracking systems for other human and even animal health hazards.",GMS hygiene and infection control,2019,Germany,2019,10
28377367,Gender-Specific Determinants and Patterns of Online Health Information Seeking: Results From a Representative German Health Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Online health information-seeking behavior (OHISB) is currently a widespread and common behavior that has been described as an important prerequisite of empowerment and health literacy. Although demographic factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), age, and gender have been identified as important determinants of OHISB, research is limited regarding the gender-specific motivational determinants of OHISB and differences between women and men in the use of online resources for health information purposes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify gender-specific determinants and patterns of OHISB by analyzing data from a representative German sample of adults (N=1728) with special attention to access and frequency of use as well as topics and sources of OHISB. METHODS: We employed a 2-step analysis, that is, after exploring differences between users and nonusers of online health information using logistic regression models, we highlighted gender-specific determinants of the frequency of OHISB by applying zero-truncated negative binomial models. RESULTS: Age (odds ratio, OR for females=0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99) and degree of satisfaction with one's general practitioner (GP) (OR for males=0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.92) were gender-specific determinants of access to OHISB. Regarding the frequency of OHISB, daily Internet use (incidence rate ratio, IRR=1.67, 95% CI 1.19-2.33) and a strong interest in health topics (IRR=1.45, 95% CI 1.19-1.77) were revealed to be more important predictors than SES (IRR for high SES=1.25, 95% CI 0.91-1.73). CONCLUSIONS: Users indicate that the Internet seems to be capable of providing a valuable source of informational support and patient empowerment. Increasing the potential value of the Internet as a source for health literacy and patient empowerment requires need-oriented and gender-specific health communication efforts, media, and information strategies.",Journal of medical Internet research,2017 Apr 4,Canada,2017,10
29922203,Maternal Burnout Syndrome: Contextual and Psychological Associated Factors.,"Background: Becoming a parent is one of the most significant experiences in a woman's life. Including substantial and long-lasting mental, social, and physical charge, the parenting experience may also be a potentially stressful and overwhelming task. Since the eighties, the notion of parental burnout syndrome has gained increasing attention, but its contextual and psychological factors need to be better identified. Aims: To investigate a large array of contextual and psychological factors associated with maternal burnout syndrome in a French community-based population in order to contribute to better operationalize the notion of parental burnout and to explore its determinants. Method: A total of 304 French-speaking mothers (mean age = 34.8 years, SD = 6.72) completed a set of questionnaires including a sociodemographic form (in order to gather general information about the mothers, their spouses, and children living at home). The Perceived Stress Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory adapted to parents (MBI-parental), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Parental Stress Index-Short Form and the Ways of Coping Checklist were used in this study. Results: Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that scores on the MBI-parental version were strongly and positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as with perceived stress related to parenthood and parenting stress levels. Moreover, using the task-oriented coping style in parenthood was strongly and positively associated with personal accomplishment. Conversely, some sociodemographic characteristics were found to be negatively associated with maternal burnout: being employed, working full time and being a mother living without a coparent. Conclusion: The construct of maternal burnout syndrome seems to be linked to a conjunction of psychological and contextual factors associated with maternal exhaustion. The implication of the results for prevention and intervention strategies are discussed.",Frontiers in psychology,2018,Switzerland,2018,10
30449156,Low income as a determinant of exercise capacity in COPD.,"Exercise capacity (EC) is a critical outcome in chronic obstructive lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). It measures the impact of the disease and the effect of specific interventions like pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). EC determines COPD prognosis and is associated with health-care utilization and quality of life. Field walking tests and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) are two ways to measure EC. The 6-minute walking test (6MWT) is the commonest and easiest field test. CPET has the advantage of assessing maximal aerobic capacity. Determinants of EC include age, gender, breathlessness, and lung function. Previous research suggests that socioeconomic status (SES), a meaningful factor in COPD, may also be associated with EC. However, those findings have not been replicated. We aimed to determine whether SES is an independent factor associated with EC in COPD. For this analysis, we used the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) database. NETT was a multicenter clinical trial where severe COPD patients were randomized to lung volume reduction surgery or medical therapy. Measures used were taken at baseline, postrehabilitation. Patients self-reported their income and were divided in two groups whether it was less or above US$30,000. Patients with a lower income had worse results in 6MWT ( p < 0.0001). We found an independent association between income and the 6MWT in patients with severe COPD after adjusting for age, gender, lung function, dyspnea, and living conditions ( p < 0.0007). One previous publication stated the relationship between income and EC. Our research confirms and extends previous publications associating EC with income by studying a large and well characterized cohort of severe COPD patients, also addressing EC by two different methods (maximal watts and 6MWT). Our results highlight the importance of addressing social determinants of health such as income when assessing COPD patients.",Chronic respiratory disease,2019 Jan-Dec,England,2019,10
26143533,Diabetes among refugee populations: what newly arriving refugees can learn from resettled Cambodians.,"A growing body of literature suggests that cardiometabolic disease generally and type 2 diabetes specifically are problems among refugee groups. This paper reviews rates of cardiometabolic disease and type 2 diabetes among refugees and highlights their unique risk factors including history of malnutrition, psychiatric disorders, psychiatric medications, lifestyle changes toward urbanization and industrialization, social isolation, and a poor profile on the social determinants of health. Promising interventions are presented for preventing and treating diabetes in these groups. Such interventions emphasize well-coordinated medical and mental health care delivered by cross-cultural and multidisciplinary teams including community health workers that are well integrated into the community. Finally, recommendations for service, policy, and research are made. The authors draw on local data and clinical experience of our collective work with Cambodian American refugees whose 30-year trajectory illustrates the consequences of ignoring diabetes and its risk factors in more recent, and soon to be arriving, refugee cohorts.",Current diabetes reports,2015 Aug,United States,2015,10
29200892,Trends and drivers of skilled birth attendant use in Nigeria (1990-2013): policy implications for child and maternal health.,"Introduction: While Nigeria accounts for only 2% of the world population, it regrettably shares 14% of global maternal death burden. Whether its reported increase in antenatal care utilization is accompanied by increased use of skilled birth attendants (SBAs) is not known. This study assessed trends in utilization of SBAs in Nigeria between 1990 and 2013 and identified its determinants. Methods: Data from four consecutive Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey reports between 1990 and 2013 were pooled. We used basic descriptive statistics, test of association, and logistic regression to assess the prevalence, relative change, and determinants of SBA use at 5% significance level. Sample weights were applied, and adjustment was made for survey design and sampling errors. Results: Nearly half (46.7%) of the respondents were aged 25-34 years, while half (50.3%) of the respondents had no formal education. The prevalence of SBA use increased only marginally across the years and characteristics studied, from 32.4% in 1990 to 38.5% in 2013, an insignificant 6% increase. Educated women used SBA more than women with no education (92.4% vs 13.1%), and their odds ratio of using SBA were thrice that of uneducated women (odds ratio =3.09, 95% confidence interval =2.17-4.38). Women involved in decisions regarding their use of health facility were 12% more likely to use SBAs than others who do not. Educational attainment, religion, tribe, rural/urban residence, and zone of residence were significant to the use of SBA. Conclusion: The use of SBA was very low throughout the study period, barely at one third usage with insignificant changes over the studied period. Women empowerment, including decision-making power and residence, were the strongest determinants of SBA use. To overturn poor child and maternal health outcomes in Nigeria through SBA use, efforts should be targeted at educating girls, sexual and reproductive health education, and accessible and improved health care facility services.",International journal of women's health,2017,New Zealand,2017,10
20728608,The social cognitive determinants of offending drivers' speeding behaviour.,"The efficacy of an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was tested in relation to offending drivers' (N=1403) speeding behaviour. Postal questionnaires were issued at Time 1 to measure intention, instrumental and affective attitude, subjective and descriptive norm, self-efficacy, perceived controllability, moral norm, anticipated regret, self-identity, and past speeding behaviour. At Time 2 (6 months later), subsequent speeding behaviour was measured, again using self-completion postal questionnaires. The extended TPB accounted for 68% of the variation in intention and 51% of the variation in subsequent behaviour. The independent predictors of intention were instrumental attitude, affective attitude, self-efficacy, moral norm, anticipated regret and past behaviour. The independent predictors of behaviour were intention, self-efficacy, anticipated regret and past behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed in relation to targeting road safety interventions.",Accident; analysis and prevention,2010 Nov,England,2010,10
25376925,Factors shaping intersectoral action in primary health care services.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine case studies of good practice in intersectoral action for health as one part of evaluating comprehensive primary health care in six sites in South Australia and the Northern Territory. METHODS: Interviews with primary health care workers, collaborating agency staff and service users (Total N=33); augmented by relevant documents from the services and collaborating partners. RESULTS: The value of intersectoral action for health and the importance of partner relationships to primary health care services were both strongly endorsed. Factors facilitating intersectoral action included sufficient human and financial resources, diverse backgrounds and skills and the personal rewards that sustain commitment. Key constraining factors were financial and time limitations, and a political and policy context which has become less supportive of intersectoral action; including changes to primary health care. CONCLUSIONS: While intersectoral action is an effective way for primary health care services to address social determinants of health, commitment to social justice and to adopting a social view of health are constrained by a broader health service now largely reinforcing a biomedical model. IMPLICATIONS: Effective organisational practices and policies are needed to address social determinants of health in primary health care and to provide a supportive context for workers engaging in intersectoral action.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2014 Dec,Australia,2014,10
30756179,Consideration of psychosocial factors in workplace risk assessments: findings from a company survey in Germany.,"PURPOSE: Work-related psychosocial risks are an increasingly important issue in occupational safety and health (OSH) policy. In Germany, as in many other European countries, employers are legally required to carry out workplace risk assessments (WRAs) and to account for psychosocial factors when doing this. The aim of this study was to expand the still scarce and sketchy empirical evidence on the extent to which employers comply with these obligations, as well as on possible determinants of compliance behaviour. METHODS: Survey data from 6500 German companies were used to calculate the prevalence of workplace risk assessments that include psychosocial factors. Furthermore, multinomial logistic regressions were performed to explore which company characteristics influence the chance of psychosocial risk assessment occurrence. RESULTS: The prevalence of psychosocial risk assessments was 21%. Next to company size (OR = 5.7, 95% CI 3.0-11.0), availability of safety specialist assistance (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 2.6-4.6), availability of occupational health specialist assistance (OR = 3.4; 95% CI 2.6-4.4) and inspection by OSH authority (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.4-4.7) were the strongest predictors of psychosocial risk assessment occurrence. Smaller (but still significant) effect sizes were found for the level of knowledge about legal OSH requirements, training of managers in OSH, economic situation of the company, presence of a works council, positive view on the benefit of OSH, affiliation with the production sector and magnitude of psychosocial risks within the company. CONCLUSIONS: The study results indicate large deficiencies in the implementation of psychosocial risk assessments, especially for small companies. Findings suggest that enhancing companies' utilisation of professional OSH experts and strengthening the advisory and control capacities of the OSH inspection authorities in the area of psychosocial risks would be beneficial for improving the current situation.",International archives of occupational and environmental health,2019 Apr,Germany,2019,10
27515881,Development and evaluation of the R-I-CAM-Q as a brief summative measure of CAM utilisation.,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates a revised version of the I-CAM-Q, the R-I-CAM-Q, which is a shorter scale, and suitable for use as a brief, summative measure of CAM utilisation. DESIGN: Online survey with an Australian sample (n=2697). ANALYSIS: The psychometric properties of the I-CAM-Q were analysed using Mokken Scaling Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling. RESULTS: A subset of items were identified as having an adequate uni-dimensional structure that can be aggregated to yield a scalar measure of CAM utilisation. Certain items, including prayer for health purposes, and chiropractic, were not indicative of general CAM use. CONCLUSIONS: The R-I-CAM-Q provides a unitary, aggregate measure of CAM utilisation that provides scope for replicable research into the determinants of CAM use. It is the first quantitative and summative measure of general CAM use, developed and tested using modern psychometric methods.",Complementary therapies in medicine,2016 Aug,Scotland,2016,10
31689134,Assessment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment outcomes in Sudan; findings and implications.,"Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has a socioeconomic impact and threatens global public health. We assessed treatment outcomes of MDR-TB and predictors of poor treatment outcomes in Sudan given current high prevalence rates.Methods: Combined retrospective and prospective cohort study at Abu-Anga hospital (TB specialized hospital in Sudan). All patients with MDR-TB between 2013 and 2017 were targeted.Results: A total of 156 patients were recruited as having good records, 117 (75%) were male, and 152 (97.4%) had pulmonary TB. Patients were followed for a median of 18 months and a total of 2108 person-months. The overall success rate was 63.5% and the mortality rate was 14.1%. Rural residency (P < 0.05) and relapsing on previous treatments (P < 0.05) were determinants of time to poor MDR-TB treatment outcomes.Conclusion: Overall, more attention needs to be given to special MDR-TB groups that are highly susceptible to poor outcomes, i.e. rural patients. As a result, it is highly recommended to maintain total coverage of medicines for all MDR-TB patients for the entire period of treatment in Sudan. It is also recommended to instigate more treatment centers in rural areas in Sudan together with programs to enhance adherence to treatments including patient counseling to improve future outcomes.",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2019 Nov,England,2019,10
21983595,Revisiting the Wilson-Jungner criteria: How can supplemental criteria guide public health in the era of genetic screening?,"PURPOSE:: Advances in technology have made newborn screening for more than 50 inborn errors of metabolism possible using a dried blood sample. A framework is proposed that public health practitioners may use when considering candidate disorders for newborn screening panels. METHODS:: The framework expands on the 10 Wilson-Jungner criteria with the addition of 11 criteria specific to newborn screening. A calculation, the ""pNBS Decision Score,"" is used to quantify results and rank candidate disorders. RESULTS:: The pNBS Decision Scores that were calculated for phenylketonuria (OMIM# 261600), cystic fibrosis (OMIM# 219700), Pompe disease (OMIM# 232300), and severe combined immunodeficiency (OMIM# 102700) support their inclusion as newborn screening disorders. The pNBS Decision Score suggests that Krabbe disease (OMIM# 245200) is not a candidate disorder for inclusion at this time. CONCLUSION:: The proposed framework adds to the ability of policy makers to quantify an essential portion of the process for adding disorders to newborn screening panels. Other factors such as ethical, legal, and social issues, clinical utility, and advocacy are also part of the policy process. The framework is not intended to replace existing nomination processes but rather to enhance those processes by encouraging iterative review of newborn screening-specific criteria. The use of the framework will provide consistency across a portion of the decision process. The public health community should take the opportunity to revisit the screening determinants of the Wilson-Jungner criteria from a 21st century perspective. The results suggest that this framework provides the public health practitioner with a consistent process for making an evidence-based decision.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2011 Oct 7,United States,2011,10
31016465,Determinants and Interventions to Promote Water Consumption Among Adolescents: a Review of the Recent Literature.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the latest scientific evidence on determinants and interventions to promote water consumption among adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 15 studies on determinants of water consumption and 11 interventions to promote water consumption among adolescents. Determinants of adolescent's water consumption included individual (e.g., physiological, demographic, psychological, and behavioral variables), social (e.g., peer influence), and environmental (e.g., availability of water at school/home, warm weather) ones and school policies. Interventions with both educational/behavioral and legislative/environmental components seem the most promising to promote water consumption among adolescents. To our knowledge, this is the first review integrating the results on both determinants of, and interventions to promote, water consumption among adolescents. Gaps in the scientific literature were identified and recommendations to improve future studies were given. Promoting water consumption among adolescents could be a promising avenue to lower obesity and promote early acquisition of healthy dietary habits.",Current nutrition reports,2019 Jun,United States,2019,10

Targeted searches on subtopics (e.g., ceremonial rites and sexual coming of age) were also performed. The PubMed search was restricted to the years 2005 and later because of the large number of records retrieved on this topic. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to May 2012. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of selected related agencies (e.g., Campbell Collaboration, Social Care Online, Institute for Healthcare Improvement).

30673111,Mortality of Haemodialysis Patients With and Without Chronic Itch: A Follow-up Study of the German Epidemiological Hemodialysis Itch Study (GEHIS).,"The GEHIS (German Epidemiological Hemodialysis Itch Study) is a representative cohort study started in 2013 with 860 haemodialysis (HD) patients in 25 German dialysis units. Chronic itch (CI) has been reported to be a poor prognostic marker for patients on HD; however, this has not been investigated in a representative patient cohort. In 2017, all HD patients were contacted again to investigate mortality in those with and without CI and to identify its determinants. Patients' characteristics, study instruments and CI were assessed, as in 2013. The response rate was 84.2% (n = 724). One-year mortality was 15.3%. Mortality was significantly higher in those with secondary scratch lesions compared with those with non-affected skin. This was also true after controlling for age and sex in a multivariate model. This study demonstrates a high mortality in HD patients; however, mortality depends on itch intensity, not on the occurrence of CI itself.",Acta dermato-venereologica,2019 Apr 1,Sweden,2019,10
21284624,Determinants of reproductive success in dominant pairs of clownfish: a boosted regression tree analysis.,"1. Central questions of behavioural and evolutionary ecology are what factors influence the reproductive success of dominant breeders and subordinate nonbreeders within animal societies? A complete understanding of any society requires that these questions be answered for all individuals. 2. The clown anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, forms simple societies that live in close association with sea anemones, Heteractis magnifica. Here, we use data from a well-studied population of A. percula to determine the major predictors of reproductive success of dominant pairs in this species. 3. We analyse the effect of multiple predictors on four components of reproductive success, using a relatively new technique from the field of statistical learning: boosted regression trees (BRTs). BRTs have the potential to model complex relationships in ways that give powerful insight. 4. We show that the reproductive success of dominant pairs is unrelated to the presence, number or phenotype of nonbreeders. This is consistent with the observation that nonbreeders do not help or hinder breeders in any way, confirming and extending the results of a previous study. 5. Primarily, reproductive success is negatively related to male growth and positively related to breeding experience. It is likely that these effects are interrelated because males that grow a lot have little breeding experience. These effects are indicative of a trade-off between male growth and parental investment. 6. Secondarily, reproductive success is positively related to female growth and size. In this population, female size is positively related to group size and anemone size, also. These positive correlations among traits likely are caused by variation in site quality and are suggestive of a silver-spoon effect. 7. Noteworthily, whereas reproductive success is positively related to female size, it is unrelated to male size. This observation provides support for the size advantage hypothesis for sex change: both individuals maximize their reproductive success when the larger individual adopts the female tactic. 8. This study provides the most complete picture to date of the factors that predict the reproductive success of dominant pairs of clown anemonefish and illustrates the utility of BRTs for analysis of complex behavioural and evolutionary ecology data.",The Journal of animal ecology,2011 May,England,2011,10
31090090,Development and initial validation of a Theory of Planned Behaviour questionnaire to assess critical care nurses' intention to use physical restraints.,"AIMS: To develop and psychometrically test a Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) questionnaire to assess nurses' intention to use physical restraints (PRs) in intubated patients. DESIGN: A psychometric instrument validation study conducted in three phases. METHODS: A theory-driven questionnaire was developed. Eight experts validated the content of the preliminary 58-item questionnaire. A pilot study was conducted including 101 critical care nurses to test the reliability of the items. Construct validity and reliability were tested in a cross-sectional study of 12 units from eight hospitals in Spain (N = 354) from October - December 2017. Participants completed the questions based on the TPB, and socio-demographic and professional variables. RESULTS: The instrument comprised 48 items. All the direct and indirect constructs exhibited acceptable reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated satisfactory fit indices for factorial structure according to the TPB. Nurses showed favourable attitudes, low perception of social pressure and modest perception of behaviour control. Perceived behavioural control and attitude were moderately positively correlated with the intention to use restraints, whereas subjective norm revealed the lowest correlation. Overall, the model explained 33% of the variance in intention. CONCLUSIONS: The Physical Restraint TPB questionnaire is a 48-item self-reporting theoretically based instrument with acceptable reliability and construct validity to identify nurses' intentions to use PRs in intubated patients. IMPACT: Unravelling the key determinants of nurses' intentions to use PRs should be examined to tailor quality improvement projects aimed at de-implementing restraints use in practice and to promote safer care.",Journal of advanced nursing,2019 Sep,England,2019,10
28161123,Enacted abortion stigma in the United States.,"RATIONALE: Abortion is a common medical procedure at the center of political debate. Yet, abortion stigma at the individual level is under-researched; the nascent research on abortion stigma has not yet documented enacted (experienced) stigma instead capturing anticipated or internalized stigma. OBJECTIVE: This study documents how women and men who disclosed abortions perceived others' reactions and determinants of those perceptions. METHOD: The study uses the American Miscarriage and Abortion Communication Survey, a survey representative of American-resident adults. Data from the sub-sample who had personal experience with abortion were analyzed (total sample, N = 1640; abortion disclosure sub-sample, n = 179). The survey captured each disclosure of the most recent abortion. Respondents had eight possible choices for articulating how the listener reacted. Cluster analyses grouped these reactions. Multinomial logistic regression identified predictors of the perceived reactions. Ordinal logistic regression revealed which disclosers perceived exclusively negative reactions, exclusively positive reactions, and a mix of negative and positive reactions. RESULTS: Each disclosure fell into one of three clusters: negative reaction, supportive reaction or sympathetic reaction. The majority of abortion disclosures received largely positive reactions (32.6% were characterized as supportive and 40.6% were characterized as sympathetic). A substantial minority of disclosures received a negative reaction (26.8%). The perceived valence of the reaction is predicted, in part, by to whom the disclosure was made and why. Across all their disclosures, most people disclosing an abortion history perceived only positive reactions (58.3%). A substantial minority of people perceived either exclusively negative reactions (7.6%) or a mix of negative and positive reactions (34.1%). Ordinal logistic regression (with people as the unit of analysis) showed perceived reactions are predicted by the number of disclosures made and the revealer's race and income. CONCLUSION: Whereas most people disclosing an abortion received support or sympathy, a substantial minority received stigmatizing reactions, which could plausibly have a negative impact on health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2017 Mar,England,2017,10
31040868,"Anxiety, depression, and oral health: A population-based study in Southeast of Iran.","Background: Depression and anxiety are two psychosocial illnesses that mostly are comorbid. The prevalence of these diseases is increasing worldwide. Both can affect general health also oral and dental health. The effects can be physiological and behavioral. Patients with these disorders are not willing to keep oral hygiene. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between depression/anxiety and oral health indices in the 15-75-year-old population of Kerman. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 5900 people aged 15-75 years through one-stage cluster sampling (Kerman coronary artery disease risk factors study, KERCADRS). Data were collected through beck questionnaires for anxiety and depression and clinical examinations. Oral health indices including decayed, missing, filled teeth, gingival index (GI), and community periodontal index (CPI) were also measured. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 software. Chi-square, t-test and regression analysis were used to determine the relationship between the variables. P </=0.05 was considered as the level of statistical significance. Results: In the study, 1975 (33.6%) of patients showed moderate-to-severe anxiety and 3502 (59.5%) got the scores as depressed. There was a significant difference between GI and CPI indices of the normal and depressed group (P < 0.01), but the difference in the anxious and normal group was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The results of the study showed a significant relationship between depression and oral health indices but not with anxiety. Therefore, the present study suggests that more attention should be paid to the oral health of people with a history of depression.",Dental research journal,2019 May-Jun,Iran,2019,10
24044469,"Predictors of obesity among Metis children: socio-economic, behavioural and cultural factors.","OBJECTIVES: To examine the socio-economic, behavioural and Metis-specific factors that predict obesity among Metis children aged 6 to 14 years. Socio-economic factors included household structure and income, parental education and food insecurity. Cultural factors included knowledge of an Aboriginal language, participation in cultural activities, time spent with Elders and parental residential school attendance. METHODS: The 2006 Aboriginal Peoples Survey, Children and Youth component collected data about Metis children, including child height and weight, reported by the person most knowledgeable about the child (PMK). Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to predict obesity, defined using IOTF BMI cut-offs. After testing for interactions, models were stratified by age (6-10, 11-14) and gender. RESULTS: An estimated 18.5% of Metis boys and 14.4% of girls were obese. The effects of socio-economic factors and region varied across age and gender groups, although living in a lone-parent family and rural residence had consistent effects. Many effects of cultural variables were unexpected. Although PMK residential schooling was positively associated with obesity generally, the effects were negative among older girls. As expected, children participating in frequent physical activity generally had lower risk, independent of other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although socio-economic factors are related to risk of obesity among Metis children, the effects may not be the same across age groups and for boys and girls. There is some evidence of independent effects of Metis-specific cultural factors, including parental residential schooling, on the risk of child obesity, but further investigation and better data are needed to understand these relationships.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2013 Jun 21,Switzerland,2013,10
23388344,Determinants of HPV vaccination intentions among Dutch girls and their mothers: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: The Dutch government recently added universal Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination for 12-year-old girls to the existing national immunization program. The participation rate for the initial catch-up campaign for girls aged 13 to 16 years in 2009 was lower (47%) than expected (70%). To inform future HPV information campaigns, this paper examines the social and psychological determinants of the HPV vaccination intentions of girls aged 13 to 16 years and their mothers who were targeted by the Dutch catch-up campaign of 2009. METHODS: A random sample of girls and their mothers was chosen from the Dutch vaccination register and received a letter inviting them to participate (n = 5,998 mothers and daughters). In addition, a random sample was recruited via an online panel by a marketing research company (n = 650 mothers; n = 350 daughters). Both groups were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire with questions on social demographic characteristics, social-psychological factors and HPV vaccination intention. Backward linear regression analyses were conducted to examine which social-psychological factors were most dominantly associated with vaccination intention. RESULTS: Data from 952 mothers (14%) and 642 daughters (10%) were available for the intended analyses. The contribution of social demographic variables to the explained variance of HPV vaccination intention was small but significant for mothers (DeltaR(2) = .01; p = .007), but not significant for daughters (DeltaR(2) = .02; p = .17) after controlling for HPV vaccination uptake and the sample. In addition, social-psychological determinants largely contributed to the explained variance of HPV vaccination intention of mothers (DeltaR(2) = .35; p < .001) and daughters (DeltaR(2) = .34; p < .001). Attitudes, beliefs, subjective norms and habit strength were significantly associated with participants' HPV vaccination intentions. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the large contribution of social-psychological variables to the explained variance of HPV vaccination intentions among the mothers and daughters, future communication strategies targeting HPV vaccination uptake should address attitudes, beliefs, subjective norms and habit strength. There is a need for longitudinal research to confirm the causality of the association between these determinants and HPV vaccination behavior indicated by this study.",BMC public health,2013 Feb 6,England,2013,10
24797435,Exposure of children with developmental delay to social determinants of poor health: cross-sectional case record review study.,"BACKGROUND: Research on child development in general has highlighted the importance that the family environment plays in mediating the pathway between exposure to low socio-economic position (SEP) and child well-being. While child developmental models in intellectual disability have highlighted the interplay between social context, family environment and child development, little empirical work has attempted to formally evaluate the evidence in support of specific mediating pathways between low SEP and child outcomes. METHODS: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional confidentialized needs analysis data collected in three Primary Care Trusts in England covering a total population of 1.25 million people. Case record reviews were undertaken for 46 023 households, 2236 (4.9%) of which contained a child in the target age range with developmental delay. RESULTS: Children with developmental delay, when compared with their non-disabled peers, were at significantly increased risk of poorer health outcomes and of being exposed to a wide range of social determinants of poor health. Controlling for between-group differences in exposure to social determinants of poor health reduced the risk of developmental delay being associated with poorer health outcomes by 45% for behaviour problems and 89% for risk of significant harm. For children with developmental delay, parenting difficulties appears to play a particularly significant role in partially mediating the effects of low SEP. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study point to the potential effectiveness of family-focused early intervention to prevent the emergence and escalation of behavioural difficulties and health problems in children with developmental delay.","Child: care, health and development",2015 Mar,England,2015,10
31661290,Organ donation attitudes and general self-efficacy: exploratory views from a rural primary care setting.,"INTRODUCTION: Behavioral determinants can enable or hinder motivation towards registration and donorship and, subsequently, action or inertia towards organ donation. Nevertheless, there is limited information about the role of self-efficacy in relation to organ donation awareness and presumed consent among individuals and their families. The aim of this study was to explore knowledge, attitudes and general self-efficacy as behavioral determinants for organ donation among rural primary care attendants, in order to tailor awareness strategies for reversing inertia within an opt-out system. METHODS: This was a prospective face-to-face survey during regularly scheduled appointments of 203 attendants at a rural primary care unit in northern Greece. Responses to a 12-item adapted 'Organ donation awareness' questionnaire measuring knowledge, attitudes and awareness were related to participants' General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale score. Hierarchical modelling of a multiple linear regression model was adopted with GSE score added. RESULTS: About one-third of respondents (34.0%) had discussed presumed consent with a partner, family member or friend. More than half (54.2%) were concerned that donated organs might be used without consent for other purposes, such as medical research. A total of 30% found organ donation unacceptable because of religious beliefs. Organ donation awareness was not influenced by respondents' specific characteristics, but was significantly related to the GSE score (standard &beta;=0.155, p=0.033). CONCLUSION: Overall, organ donation perceptions among rural primary care recipients were determined by knowledge of the presumed consent procurement system, pre-conceptions, religious beliefs, altruism and GSE scores. The association of self-efficacy with raised awareness could potentially explain the gap between high intent to consent as a donor and subsequent lack of follow-up action. Further comparative research across behavioral determinants between rural/urban groups is needed in order to tailor awareness strategies suitable for an opt-out system.",Rural and remote health,2019 Oct,Australia,2019,10
29966499,Evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally adapted behavioral family psycho-educational program for Egyptian patients with schizophrenia.,"Although a growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of behavioral family therapies for patients with schizophrenia, few studies have been carried out on the effectiveness of such programs for Egyptian patients. The current study translated and culturally adapted the Behavioral Family Psycho-Education Program (BFPEP) and conducted a preliminary efficacy evaluation for outpatients suffering from schizophrenia. Thirty patients received 14 sessions of culturally adapted Program (CA-BFPEP) and 30 received treatment as usual; all were followed up for 6 months. Pre- and post-intervention assessment included primary outcome measures that assessed the clinical, social, quality of life and attitude towards medications. The CA-BFPEP group demonstrated significant treatment effects as they had greater reductions in psychotic symptoms (PANSS), improvement of social function (SFQ), quality of life (QoL), and attitude towards medications (DAI), compared to patients in the control group. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing family therapy interventions in different cultural settings with relatively minor modifications. These promising findings invite further efforts to maximize the benefits of family therapy interventions internationally and to encourage mental health policy makers to integrate this mode of therapy in routine care management plans for patients with schizophrenia.",Transcultural psychiatry,2018 Oct,England,2018,10
29475195,Instant messaging and nursing students' clinical learning experience.,"BACKGROUND: Although learning in clinical settings is a key element of nursing education, for many learners these are challenging developmental contexts often marked by isolation and a lack of belongingness. Despite the massive appropriation of mobile instant messaging (MIM) platforms and the connective properties attendant to them, very little is known about their role in and impact on nursing students' clinical learning experiences. APPROACH AND METHODS: To address this gap, the study, which was part of a multinational research project on the use of mobile social media in health professions education in developing countries, examined the use of the instant messaging platform WhatsApp by nursing students during placements and potential associations with socio-professional indicators. The survey involved a total number of 196 nursing students from 5 schools in Oyo State, Nigeria. RESULTS: The findings suggest that students used WhatsApp relatively frequently and they perceived that this platform strongly enhanced their communication with other students and nurses. WhatsApp use during placements was positively associated with students' maintained social capital with peer students, the development of a professional identity, placement satisfaction and with reduced feelings of isolation from professional communities. The determinants that influenced WhatsApp use during placements were perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. No associations were found between WhatsApp use during placement and age, attitude, subjective norms and placement duration. CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first of its kind that points to the relevance of mobile instant messaging as part of nursing students' (inter)personal learning environments in clinical settings and, particularly, in the development setting under investigation. Further research is needed to corroborate these findings, to enhance the understanding of the impact mechanisms, and to evaluate a more systematic use of MIM in clinical learning contexts.",Nurse education today,2018 May,Scotland,2018,10

24406381,"""Injustice! That is the cause"": a qualitative study of the social, economic, and structural determinants of late diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in Egypt.","BACKGROUND: In developing countries, breast cancer is generally diagnosed late. Two companion quantitative studies found that health system shortages were a major cause of delayed diagnosis together with poor health literacy. Yet, patients' perceptions regarding the delays were missing. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a qualitative study to deepen our understanding of women's experiences with diagnosis and treatment delays and highlight nuances not identifiable in the quantitative studies. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Fifteen women recruited from the quantitative study were interviewed. Information on diagnosis/treatment delays collected in the quantitative study constituted the basis for the selection of participants, the aim being to ensure a maximum of variability in the types of delays. RESULTS: In addition to women's health literacy challenges, which likely resulted from the interactions of individual, interpersonal, and systemic factors, barriers attributable to healthcare system weaknesses and financial constraints were revealed to be key factors. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce late-stage diagnosis, tackling women's ""lack of breast cancer awareness"" is far from sufficient. Although the majority of health professionals are not in a position to address structural and policy barriers, it is nonetheless important for them to be cognizant of these barriers so that they can better advise and guide their patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our study aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and structural barriers patients face in Egypt. Such knowledge should help nurses and other health professionals develop a nonjudgmental, compassionate, and perceptive approach to care.",Cancer nursing,2014 Nov-Dec,United States,2014,10
29208482,What motivates women to breastfeed in Lebanon: An exploratory qualitative analysis.,"This exploratory qualitative study examined the influence of injunctive and descriptive norms on breastfeeding, a health-improving behaviour related to a highly committed personal decision. The research explores the different mechanisms through which social norms impact breastfeeding behaviour pre or post-adoption of breastfeeding practice. A qualitative approach was used by performing in-depth analysis of cross-sectional accounts of women in Lebanon contemplating adoption of breastfeeding practice and women who already breastfed. Interviews were also conducted with medical professionals, lactation specialists, and breastfeeding activists. On one hand, the attitude of the medical professionals and the government efforts are two mechanisms that stimulate the injunctive norms. On the other hand, the descriptive norms are defined by community attitude aggregated with societal beliefs and expectations on women's image and role in society. Both types of social norms are in constant interplay with personal norms and each type becomes more salient at different periods over time. The findings suggest that social norms are major determinants of breastfeeding behaviour. The influence of the type of social norm-descriptive or injunctive-on the decision to breastfeed varies according to the moment of life the mother is living. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",Appetite,2018 Apr 1,England,2018,10
24621359,"National and sub-national burden of infectious diseases in Iran, 1990 to 2013: the study protocol.","BACKGROUND: To assess the burden of infectious diseases, it is necessary to utilize a systematic approach for data collection and deploying the sophisticated methods to estimate the burden of infectious diseases for health policy making at national level. The present study protocol is aimed to provide a comprehensive explanation of the general structure and method used in the national and sub-national burden of selected infectious diseases study in Iran from 1990 to 2013. METHODS: The trend, burden, and geographical inequality pattern of infectious diseases will be estimated through a comprehensive review of published and unpublished data. Different sources of data including health surveys, surveillance data, hospital data surveys, death registry system, census, household expenditure survey, and published manuscripts will be synthesized to calculate the estimates. All indicators will be reported by gender, age, and geographic area. Two different statistical models include ""Spatio-Temporal"" and ""Bayesian multilevel autoregressive"" will be applied to overcome the scarcity and misalignment of the obtained data. DISCUSSION: Estimating the prevalence trend and burden of infectious diseases would be helpful to use more cost-effective interventions considering sub-national variations. Additionally, the information obtained from these studies can depict the ability of health system authorities in controlling these types of diseases. Overall, the present applied models can be deployed as a part of inputs in further studies to estimate the burden of diseases, not only in Iran but also all around the Middle East countries.",Archives of Iranian medicine,2014 Mar,Iran,2014,10
29021816,Determinants of early initiation of breastfeeding in rural Niger: cross-sectional study of community based child healthcare promotion.,"BACKGROUND: Most child deaths are preventable and caused by behaviorally modifiable factors. By promoting optimal breastfeeding, we can reduce neonatal and child mortality risks by 45%. This paper provides new family and community based perspectives to identify factors interfering with the program impact on promoting early initiation of breastfeeding among the most vulnerable populations in rural Niger. METHODS: A secondary analysis of a retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated a UNICEF behavior change program on child healthcare. The study sample is based on a post-hoc constitution of two groups exposed and unexposed to the program. All women (n = 1026) aged 14-49 years having at least one child below 24 months of age were included. We measured crude and adjusted odds ratios with chi-square and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Independent variables shown to be associated with early breastfeeding include sales activities compared to household work with no direct income (AOR 7.7; 95% CI 1.3, 47.8) and mutual decision for harvest use (AOR 8.6; 95% CI 2.0, 36.8). Antenatal care did not modify the timing of breastfeeding initiation. CONCLUSIONS: A high risk group of mothers with social and economic vulnerability are prone to suboptimal breastfeeding within the first hour of birth. Support from family and neighbors positively influenced early breastfeeding. Those who had no direct income and limited access to health services were a high-risk group, prone to delayed initiation of breastfeeding.",International breastfeeding journal,2017,England,2017,10
27894342,"Inequalities in the spiritual health of young Canadians: a national, cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Spiritual health, along with physical, emotional, and social aspects, is one of four domains of health. Assessment in this field of research is challenging methodologically. No contemporary population-based studies have profiled the spiritual health of adolescent Canadians with a focus on health inequalities. In a 2014 nationally representative sample of Canadians aged 11-15 years we therefore: (1) psychometrically evaluated a series of items used to assess the perceived importance of spiritual health and its four potential sub-domains (connections with: self, others, nature and the natural environment, and the transcendent) to adolescents; (2) described potential inequalities in spiritual health within adolescent populations, overall and by spiritual health sub-domain, by key socio-demographic factors. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of survey reports from the 2014 (Cycle 7) of the Canadian Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study (weighted n = 25,036). Principal components analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis were used to explore the psychometric properties of the spiritual health items and the associated composite scale describing perceived importance of spiritual health. Associations among this composite scale, its individual sub-domains, and key socio-demographic factors were then explored. RESULTS: The principal components analysis best supported a four-factor structure where the eight scale items loaded highly according to the original four domains. This was also supported in confirmatory factor analyses. We then combined the eight items into composite spiritual health score as supported by theory, principal components analysis findings, and acceptable tests of reliability. Further confirmatory factor analysis suggested the need for additional refinements to this scale. Based upon exploratory cross-sectional analyses, strong socio-demographic inequalities were observed in the spiritual health measures by age, gender, relative material wealth, immigration status, and province/territory. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings highlight potential inequalities in the spiritual health of young Canadians, as well as opportunities for methodological advances in the assessment of adolescent spiritual health in our population.",BMC public health,2016 Nov 28,England,2016,10
21498561,Socio-economic predictors of mortality among diabetic people.,"BACKGROUND: The present study examines the role of six aspects of socio-economic status (income, occupational position, education, unemployment, living alone and type of residential area) in mortality among types 1 and 2 diabetic people in Finland. All-cause mortality and causes of deaths (for example, alcohol diseases) are assessed. METHODS: People with diabetes aged 30-79 years in 2000-03 were identified from national registers. The data comprised 528 734 person-years and 18 841 deaths. Relative mortality risks were obtained from Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Among type 1 diabetic men, mortality differences were largest for long-term unemployed (aged 30-64 years); RR 3.85 (3.00-4.94) compared with the employed, and for low (vs. high) income group; RR 1.96 (1.78-2.17). The findings were similar for type 2 men; RR 2.58 (2.16-3.09) for unemployment and 1.61 (1.53-1.69) for income. In type 1 diabetic women, largest differences were found according to unemployment; RR 3.32 (1.88-5.88) and education (lowest vs. highest education); RR 2.35 (1.84-3.00), but in type 2 diabetes, the strongest determinants were disposable income; RR 1.55 (1.44-1.66) and education; RR 1.50 (1.33-1.70). In most socio-economic determinants, relative differences were largest in deaths due to diabetes and alcohol diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Five aspects of socio-economic position were related to mortality among diabetic people in Finland. No systematic mortality differences were, however, found for type of municipality of residence. These findings together with the role of deaths from alcohol diseases and diabetes in mortality trends, indicate that different aspects of social disadvantage are important predictors of mortality among diabetic people.",European journal of public health,2012 Jun,England,2012,10

Five neighbourhoods in the South-West sector of Montreal, with a population of 258,000, were under study. The objectives of the research program were: 1) to assess the prevalence and incidence of psychological distress, mental disorders, substance abuse, parasuicide, risky behaviour and quality of life; 2) to examine the links and interactions between individual determinants, neighbourhood ecology and mental health in each neighbourhood; 3) to identify the conditions facilitating the integration of individuals with mental health problems; 4) to analyse the impact of the social, economic and physical aspects of the neighbourhoods using a geographic information system. 5) to verify the adequacy of mental health services. METHOD: A longitudinal study in the form of a community survey was used, complemented by focused qualitative sub-studies. The longitudinal study included a randomly selected sample of 2,433 individuals between the ages of 15 and 65 in the first wave of data collection, and three other waves are projected. An overview of the methods is presented. RESULTS: The prevalence of psychological distress, mental disorders and use of mental health services and their correlates are described for the first wave of data collection. CONCLUSION: Several vulnerable groups and risk factors related to socio-demographic variables have been identified such as: gender, age, marital status, income, immigration and language.

31253495,Psychosocial and cognitive engineering contributions to blood transfusion.,"Among the research developed in social psychology, there is a field of study questioning the mechanisms that explain prosocial behaviors. In 1956, the first links between transfusion medicine and social psychology were formed, with the study of underlying motivations to blood donation behavior. Sixty years later, the number of ""fundamental"" and ""applied"" research has widely increased, and we now have a theoretical understanding of blood donation engagement's levers, as well as experimental demonstrations of methods to activate these levers. Thus, the literature offers several strategies experimentally verified to improve the recruitment and retaining of blood donors. These methods can go from specific speeches when soliciting donors, to changes in the blood donation environment, etc. They aim either at impacting the donation experience, at obtaining a change in the donor's behavior, or at changing the determinants of blood donation. Yet, it is clear that the knowledge from the research in social psychology is not really deployed on the field by the organizations that could benefit from it. In this article, we will try to develop the difficulty regarding the application of fundamental and experimental knowledge, and to underline the implications for the blood transfusion establishments. We will then present the psychosocial and cognitive engineering method, and argue its relevance to answer this problematic.",Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine,2019 Sep,France,2019,10

26515249,[A strategy for institutionalisation of health impact assessment in Andalusia (Spain)].,"Health impact assessment (HIA) aims to incorporate people's health and wellbeing as a key feature in policy-making. Many authors believe that HIA might be systematically integrated into all decision-making processes as a way to achieve that goal. To that end, there is need to overcome a number of challenges, including the fact that Andalusia (Spain) has made HIA compulsory by law, the need for awareness of all public sectors whose decisions might have substantial impacts on health and for a methodology that would enable a comprehensive approach to health determinants and inequalities, and the training of both the public health staff and professional sectors responsible for its application. In Andalusia, a law provides mandatory and binding health impact reports for most authorisation procedures in different areas: from sectoral plans to urban planning schemes, and especially projects subject to environmental assessment. Implementation of this law has required its integration into authorisation procedures, the training of interdisciplinary working groups in public health, the preparation of technical guidelines, and the organisation of dissemination and training seminars for developers.",Gaceta sanitaria,2016 Jan-Feb,Spain,2016,10

28335444,HIV Education and Welfare Services in Primary Care: An Empirical Model of Integration in Brazil's Unified Health System.,"Integration of health education and welfare services in primary care systems is a key strategy to solve the multiple determinants of chronic diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS). However, there is a scarcity of conceptual models from which to build integration strategies. We provide a model based on cross-sectional data from 168 Community Health Agents, 62 nurses, and 32 physicians in two municipalities in Brazil's Unified Health System (UHS). The outcome, service integration, comprised HIV education, community activities (e.g., health walks and workshops), and documentation services (e.g., obtainment of working papers and birth certificates). Predictors included individual factors (provider confidence, knowledge/skills, perseverance, efficacy); job characteristics (interprofessional collaboration, work-autonomy, decision-making autonomy, skill variety); and organizational factors (work conditions and work resources). Structural equation modeling was used to identify factors associated with service integration. Knowledge and skills, skill variety, confidence, and perseverance predicted greater integration of HIV education alongside community activities and documentation services. Job characteristics and organizational factors did not predict integration. Our study offers an explanatory model that can be adapted to examine other variables that may influence integration of different services in global primary healthcare systems. Findings suggest that practitioner trainings to improve integration should focus on cognitive constructs-confidence, perseverance, knowledge, and skills.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2017 Mar 14,Switzerland,2017,10
30285641,Identifying and understanding the health and social care needs of older adults with multiple chronic conditions and their caregivers: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: As the population is aging, the number of persons living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is expected to increase. This review seeks to answer two research questions from the perspectives of older adults with MCC, their caregivers and their health care providers (HCPs): 1) What are the health and social care needs of community-dwelling older adults with MCC and their caregivers? and 2) How do social and structural determinants of health impact these health and social care needs? METHODS: We conducted a scoping review guided by a refinement of the Arksey & O'Malley framework. Articles were included if participants were 55 years or older and have at least two chronic conditions. We searched 7 electronic databases. The data were summarized using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were included in this review: 28 studies included participants with MCC; 12 studies included HCPs; 5 studies included caregivers. The quality of the studies ranged from moderate to good. Five main areas of needs were identified: need for information; coordination of services and supports; preventive, maintenance and restorative strategies; training for older adults, caregivers and HCPs to help manage the older adults' complex conditions; and the need for person-centred approaches. Structural and social determinants of health such as socioeconomic status, education and access influenced the needs of older adults with MCC. CONCLUSION: The review highlights that most of the needs of older adults with MCC focus on lack of access to information and coordination of care. The main structural and social determinants that influenced older adults' needs were their level of education/health literacy and their socioeconomic status.",BMC geriatrics,2018 Oct 1,England,2018,10
21503462,Conceptual and methodological aspects in the study of hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions.,"Hospitalization rates for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions have been used to assess effectiveness of the first level of health care. From a critical analysis of related concepts, we discuss principles for selecting a list of codes and, taking the example of the Brazilian Family Health Program, propose a methodological pathway for identifying variables in order to inform statistical models of analysis. We argue that for the indicator to be comparable between regions, disease codes should be selected based on sensitivity and specificity principles, not on observed disease frequency. Rates of hospitalization will be determined, at a distal level, by the socio-economic environment and their effect on the social and demographic structure. Timely and effective care depends on the organization of health services, their availability and access barriers, which depend on the ways health and related technology are conceptualised and on their adherence to the biomedical model or to the Primary Health Care (PHC) principles; performance indicators of the health system will be the proximal determinants. This indicator is potentially useful for primary care evaluation. The historical reconstruction of PHC improves the analysis of the indicator variability.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2011,Brazil,2011,10
29554440,Reducing Indigenous Oral Health Inequalities: A Review from 5 Nations.,"Indigenous populations around the world experience a disproportionate burden in terms of oral diseases and conditions. These inequalities are likely due to a complex web of social determinants that includes poverty, historical consequences of colonialism, social exclusion, government policies of assimilation, cultural annihilation, and racism in all its forms (societal, institutional). Despite documented oral health disparities, prevention interventions have been scarce in Indigenous communities. This review describes oral health interventions and their outcomes conducted for Indigenous populations of the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. The review includes research published since 2006 that are available in English in electronic databases, including MEDLINE. A total of 13 studies were included from the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Australia. The studies reviewed provide a wide range of initiatives, including interventions for prevention and treatment of dental disease, as well as interventions that improve oral health knowledge, behaviors, and other psychosocial factors. Overall, 6 studies resulted in improved oral health in the study participants, including improvements in periodontal health, caries reduction, and oral health literacy. Preferred intervention methodologies included community-based research approaches, culturally tailored strategies, and use of community workers to deliver the initiative. Although these studies were conducted with discrete Indigenous populations, investigators reported similar challenges in research implementation. Recommendations for future work in reducing oral health disparities include addressing social determinants of health in various Indigenous populations, training future generations of dental providers in cultural competency, and making Indigenous communities true partners in research.",Journal of dental research,2018 Jul,United States,2018,10

We compare individual- with population-level interpretations of HbA1c titers. This comparison reveals that public health researchers need to pay close attention to diagnostic tests and their uses, including rhetorical uses. We also synthesize historical and current evidence to map out 2 possible scenarios for the future. In the first scenario, prevention efforts emphasize primary care and focus almost entirely downstream.

Our analysis adapts actor-network theory to strategic planning and forecasting in public health.",American journal of public health,2012 Jan,United States,2012,10
24916528,Metabolic syndrome and health-related quality of life in reproductive age and post-menopausal women: Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.,"BACKGROUND: Given the lack of data clarifying the manner in which women with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in different eras of their life perceive their health-related quality of life (HRQoL), this study aimed at investigating the association between MetS and HRQoL in reproductive age and post menopausal women. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted within the framework of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Joint Interim Statement (JIS) and HRQoL was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of poor HRQoL with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for reproductive age and post-menopausal women separately and adjusted for confounding variables. RESULTS: All 603 participants with (n = 340) and without (n = 263) MetS were studied. Overall, in both physical and mental domains, those without MetS had higher scores in all subscales of SF-36 except for vitality, role emotional and mental component summary. Unadjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for poor physical HRQoL were 2.8 (1.7-4.6); (P < 0.001) and 1.5 (0.7-3.4) for the reproductive age and post-menopausal groups, respectively. Compared to the post-menopausal group, the odds ratio of reporting poor HRQoL for reproductive age women was significantly higher, even after adjusting for age (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-3.0, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that MetS is associated with poor HRQoL in reproductive age, but not in post-menopausal women, and the association is observed mainly in relation to physical rather than mental health.",Archives of Iranian medicine,2014 Jun,Iran,2014,10
26759842,"Acute rheumatic fever in First Nations communities in northwestern Ontario: Social determinants of health ""bite the heart"".","OBJECTIVE: To document a case series of 8 young First Nations patients diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever (ARF), a preventable disease that resulted in the death of 2 patients, in northwestern Ontario in the context of late diagnosis, overcrowded housing, and inadequate public health response. DESIGN: Retrospective case series over an 18-month period. SETTING: Remote First Nations communities in northwestern Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Eight patients with ARF. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, mortality, residual rheumatic heart disease, time to diagnosis, barriers to diagnosis and treatment, housing situation of patients, patient demographic characteristics (age, sex), and investigation results. RESULTS: The incidence of ARF in this population was 21.3 per 100,000, which is 75 times greater than the overall Canadian estimated incidence. The average patient age was 9.4 years. Most cases developed joint findings, and 5 of the surviving patients had rheumatic heart disease when they received echocardiography. The average time to diagnosis was 88 days. Two 4-year-old children died from ARF. Most patients lived in inadequate and crowded housing. CONCLUSION: This rare disease still exists in remote First Nations communities. These communities demonstrate an incidence equal to that in aboriginal communities in Australia and New Zealand, which have among the highest international incidence of ARF. Primordial prevention, including improved on-reserve housing, is urgently needed. Case detection and ongoing surveillance for primary and secondary prophylaxis requires a well resourced regional strategy.",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,2015 Oct,Canada,2015,10
28356793,Heterogeneity of nutritional habits of Lithuanian ethnolinguistic groups: population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: Lithuania is a Northern European country consisting of two main ethnolinguistic groups: Samogitians and Highlanders. The objective of the paper is to investigate differences in nutritional habits of 18-65-year-old Lithuanians living in different ethnolinguistic regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative, population-based, random sample of the 18-65-year-old ethnic Lithuanian population was interviewed from 17 December 2008 to 20 May 2013. Lithuanians living in their ethnolinguistic region for at least three generations were included (n = 1,133). We analysed responses to 12 questions about nutritional habits of respondents. For the univariate analysis, we applied the chi-squared test. For the clusterisation of the survey questions, we employed a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). RESULTS: Comparing Samogitians' and Highlanders' responses according to their gender, education, and place of residence, we observed more often significant differences (p < 0.05) for the urban population, respondents without higher education, and women. The nutrition of Highlanders was more consistent with national and WHO nutritional recommendations. Significant differences were obtained in the consumption of fish (p = 1.9 . 10(-12)), milk (p = 1.8 . 10(-4)) and grain products (p = 0.01). MCA revealed that all questions fall into three groups with a different composition for Samogitians and Highlanders. We failed to demonstrate the impact of different nutritional habits on the body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: According to the univariate and multivariate analysis, the nutritional habits of Lithuanian ethnolinguistic regions are heterogeneous. Dependency on an ethnolinguistic region might be considered an important factor for the preparation of appropriate health and nutrition education and disease prevention programmes. The issue of excess weight remains equally important for both ethnolinguistic groups.",Acta medica Lituanica,2016,Lithuania,2016,10
20579999,Delivery route preferences of urban women of low socioeconomic status.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the main determinants of mode of delivery preference among urban dwelling women of lower socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Over a 12-month period, a self-completion 36-item questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 308 women within the first 3 postpartum days. Non-parametric tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: Study participants were mostly African American (>85%), single mothers (>75%), and unemployed (>/=55%). Among the women, 85.7% had vaginal delivery (VD) and 14.3% had cesarean delivery (CD). Women who preferred CD (10%) were more likely to be concerned about a vaginal tear/episiotomy during VD, forceps, and a ""big"" baby compared with women who preferred VD, for whom ""pushing the baby out myself"" and ""fear of cesarean"" were the most important factors. In the final model of 7 factors, the 3 main factors found to positively impact maternal preference for CD were a vaginal cut during VD (P<0.001), higher mean BMI (P=0.001), and cesarean as the most recent delivery type (P<0.001). The total explained variance by this model was 46%. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term complications of a VD, higher BMI, and a previous cesarean delivery are the most significant factors that impact the preferences of women of lower SES for future mode of delivery.",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,2010 Oct,United States,2010,10
27983666,Synergising Public Health Concepts with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction: A Conceptual Glossary.,"The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015) is a global strategy for addressing disaster risk and resilience that has been ratified by member countries of the United Nations. Its guiding principles emphasise building resilience through inter-sectoral collaboration, as well as partnerships that facilitate community empowerment and address underlying risk factors. Both public health and the emergency management sector face similar challenges related to developing and implementing strategies that involve structural change, facilitating community resilience and addressing individual risk factors. Familiarity with public health principles enables an understanding of the holistic approach to risk reduction that is outlined within the Sendai Framework. We present seven concepts that resonate with contemporary public health practice, namely: the social determinants of health; inequality and inequity; the inverse care law; community-based and community development approaches; hard to reach communities and services; the prevention paradox; and the inverse prevention law. These ideas from public health provide a useful conceptual base for the ""new"" agenda in disaster risk management that underpins the 2015 Sendai Framework. The relevance of these ideas to disaster risk management and research is illustrated through drawing on the Sendai Framework, disaster literature and exemplars from the 2010-2011 earthquakes in Canterbury, New Zealand.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2016 Dec 14,Switzerland,2016,10
20038510,Prerelease intent predicts smoking behavior postrelease following a prison smoking ban.,"INTRODUCTION: More than 2 million persons are incarcerated in the United States. Most are young minority men, soon to reenter the community. The majority are also lifelong smokers with high rates of health-related problems. As prisons implement smoking bans, it is not known whether health behavior change that is mandated, rather than selected, can be maintained. The Wisconsin Department of Corrections smoking ban is a unique opportunity to investigate determinants of smoking behavior after release from prison. METHODS: A convenience sample of 49 incarcerated men near release participated in two interviews (1-month prerelease, in prison, and 1-month postrelease via telephone). Descriptive analyses and multivariate modeling were conducted to determine associations with postrelease smoking. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 36.7 years, 12.4 years of education, and a 2.3-year incarceration; 47% were Black and 41% White. They had smoked 14.5 years. Most (67%) believed that their health was improved after the smoking ban. Paired t tests revealed decreases in Positive and Negative Affect Scale negative affect (p = .001) and Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression (p = .009) postrelease. Univariate analysis showed correlations of intent to smoke upon release with smoking relapse postrelease (p = .001), White race with smoking relapse postrelease (p = .045), and perceived better health since the prison smoking ban with nonsmoking on release (p = .01). There was a trend toward use of alcohol with smoking relapse on release (p = .061). DISCUSSION: Prerelease smoking intention predicted postrelease behavior. Belief in improved health after the prison smoking ban correlated with nonsmoking on release. Targeted relapse prevention interventions are needed for people reentering the community.",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,2010 Feb,England,2010,10
28266120,Prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases at individual and population level: consensus report of group 3 of joint EFP/ORCA workshop on the boundaries between caries and periodontal diseases.,"BACKGROUND: The non-communicable diseases dental caries and periodontal diseases pose an enormous burden on mankind. The dental biofilm is a major biological determinant common to the development of both diseases, and they share common risk factors and social determinants, important for their prevention and control. The remit of this working group was to review the current state of knowledge on epidemiology, socio-behavioural aspects as well as plaque control with regard to dental caries and periodontal diseases. METHODS: Discussions were informed by three systematic reviews on (i) the global burden of dental caries and periodontitis; (ii) socio-behavioural aspects in the prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases at an individual and population level; and (iii) mechanical and chemical plaque control in the simultaneous management of gingivitis and dental caries. This consensus report is based on the outcomes of these systematic reviews and on expert opinion of the participants. RESULTS: Key findings included the following: (i) prevalence and experience of dental caries has decreased in many regions in all age groups over the last three decades; however, not all societal groups have benefitted equally from this decline; (ii) although some studies have indicated a possible decline in periodontitis prevalence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that prevalence has changed over recent decades; (iii) because of global population growth and increased tooth retention, the number of people affected by dental caries and periodontitis has grown substantially, increasing the total burden of these diseases globally (by 37% for untreated caries and by 67% for severe periodontitis) as estimated between 1990 and 2013, with high global economic impact; (iv) there is robust evidence for an association of low socio-economic status with a higher risk of having dental caries/caries experience and also with higher prevalence of periodontitis; (v) the most important behavioural factor, affecting both dental caries and periodontal diseases, is routinely performed oral hygiene with fluoride; (vi) population-based interventions address behavioural factors to control dental caries and periodontitis through legislation (antismoking, reduced sugar content in foods and drinks), restrictions (taxes on sugar and tobacco) guidelines and campaigns; however, their efficacy remains to be evaluated; (vii) psychological approaches aimed at changing behaviour may improve the effectiveness of oral health education; (viii) different preventive strategies have proven to be effective during the course of life; (ix) management of both dental caries and gingivitis relies heavily on efficient self-performed oral hygiene, that is toothbrushing with a fluoride-containing toothpaste and interdental cleaning; (x) professional tooth cleaning, oral hygiene instruction and motivation, dietary advice and fluoride application are effective in managing dental caries and gingivitis. CONCLUSION: The prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases and the prevention of ultimate tooth loss is a lifelong commitment employing population- and individual-based interventions.",Journal of clinical periodontology,2017 Mar,United States,2017,10
23181146,The influence of social determinants on evidence-based behavioral interventions-considerations for implementation in community settings.,"Over the last decade, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) program funded several hundred community-based organizations (CBOs) and health departments in a wide-scale HIV prevention national diffusion effort. We interviewed six California agencies funded to implement one of three group-level DEBIs to identify facilitators and/or challenges to effective implementation. We identified several social and structural factors affecting community members' participation in DEBIs, including language issues, stigma associated with HIV and sexual orientation, homelessness, and incarceration. Age, class, and socioeconomic status also significantly influenced member participation and CBO implementation success. Although changing individual behaviors is the ultimate measure of behavioral intervention/DEBI success, attention must be given to the larger social and structural factors that significantly affect risk for HIV. In fact, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy recognizes these factors as major barriers to HIV prevention and has developed recommendations that address health disparities. We present short-term, intermediate, and long-term strategies addressing social determinants of health and offer suggestions for adapting DEBIs to meet the broader needs of persons prioritized for DEBIs.",Translational behavioral medicine,2012 Jun,England,2012,10
31634704,Antenatal determinants of early childhood talking delay and behavioural difficulties.,"The determinants of talking delay alone or its comorbidity with behavioural difficulties was examined in 5768 two-year-old members of the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal study. Using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development inventories and the total difficulties score from the preschool Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, a composite measure was created so that children were categorised as showing no language or behavioural concerns (72.5%), behavioural only difficulties (6.1%), language only difficulties (18.1%), and comorbid language and behavioural difficulties (3.3%). Analyses revealed that antenatal factors such as maternal perceived stress, inadequate folate intake, vitamin intake, alcohol consumption during the first trimester and maternal smoking all had a significant effect on child outcomes. In particular, low multivitamin intake and perceived stress during pregnancy were associated with coexisting language and behavioural difficulties. These findings support international research in showing that maternal factors during pregnancy are associated with developmental outcomes in the early childhood period, and demonstrate these associations within a NZ context. Interventions which address maternal stress management and health behaviours during pregnancy could be beneficial to offspring development.",Infant behavior & development,2019 Nov,United States,2019,10
23912202,Investigating social ecological contributors to diabetes within Hispanics in an underserved U.S.-Mexico border community.,"Hispanics bear a disproportionate burden of diabetes in the United States, yet relations of structural, socio-cultural and behavioral factors linked to diabetes are not fully understood across all of their communities. The current study examines disparities and factors associated with diabetes in adult Hispanics of Mexican-descent (N = 648) participating in a population survey of an underserved rural U.S.-Mexico border community. The overall rate of diabetes prevalence rate in the sample, based on self-report and a glucose testing, was 21%; much higher than rates reported for U.S. adults overall, for all Hispanic adults, or for Mexican American adults specifically. Acculturation markers and social determinants of health indicators were only significantly related to diabetes in models not accounting for age. Older age, greater BMI (>30), greater waist-to-hip ratio as well as lower fruit and vegetable consumption were significantly related to increased likelihood of diabetes when all structural, cultural, behavioral, and biological factors were considered. Models with sets of behavioral factors and biological factors each significantly improved explanation of diabetes relative to prior social ecological theory-guided models. The findings show a critical need for diabetes prevention efforts in this community and suggest that health promotion efforts should particularly focus on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2013 Jul 31,Switzerland,2013,10
20709252,Environmental determinants of outdoor play in children: a large-scale cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Outdoor play is a cheap and natural way for children to be physically active. PURPOSE: This study aims to identify physical as well as social correlates of outdoor play in the home and neighborhood environment among children of different age groups. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were derived from 6470 parents of children from 42 primary schools in four Dutch cities by means of questionnaires (2007-2008). Multivariate sequential Poisson GEE analyses were conducted (2010) to quantify the correlation between physical and social home and neighborhood characteristics and outdoor play among boys and girls aged 4-6 years, 7-9 years, and 10-12 years. RESULTS: This study showed that next to proximal (home) environmental characteristics such as parental education (RR=0.93-0.97); the importance parents pay to outdoor play (RR=1.32-1.75); and the presence of electronic devices in the child's own room (RR=1.04-1.15), several neighborhood characteristics were significantly associated with children's outdoor play. Neighborhood social cohesion was related to outdoor play in five of six subgroups (RR=1.01-1.02), whereas physical neighborhood characteristics (e.g., green neighborhood type, presence of water, diversity of routes) were associated with outdoor play in specific subgroups only. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood social cohesion was related to outdoor play among children of different age and gender, which makes it a promising point of action for policy development. Policies aimed at improving physical neighborhood characteristics in relation to outdoor play should take into account age and gender of the target population.",American journal of preventive medicine,2010 Sep,Netherlands,2010,10
30185088,Exposure to tobacco use in pregnancy and its determinants among sub-Saharan Africa women: analysis of pooled cross-sectional surveys.,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco use in any form and exposure to second-hand smoking are major threat to human health globally. Worse still, it is an important threat to the health of pregnant women and their children. However, the prevalence of tobacco use among pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa countries remains uncertain. This study assessed the prevalence and factors of tobacco use among pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa countries. METHODS: This study utilized data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 31 sub-Saharan Africa countries between 2008 and 2017, comprising 44,715 pregnant women (aged 15-49 years). We calculated sampling weights to account for differentials in probabilities of selection and estimated proportions and 95% CIs for tobacco use in pregnant women across various countries. The factors associated with tobacco use were examined using multivariable binary logistic regression models at a significant level of 5%. RESULTS: Prevalence of tobacco use among pregnant women was approximately 2%. In Madagascar, the prevalence of tobacco use was 11.0%, while Lesotho (5.4%), Sierra Leone (4.8%), Namibia (4.4%) and Burundi (4.2%) were among the leading countries with high tobacco use pregnancy. The results of multivariable binary logistic regression model showed that pregnant women aged 25-34 years and >/=35 years were 2.26 times (OR = 2.26; 95%CI: 1.23, 4.15) and 2.45 times (OR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.10, 5.45) as likely to use tobacco products, compared to women aged </=24 years. The religious beliefs of pregnant women, who belong to other religion besides Islam, were 2.26 times as likely to use tobacco products compared to Christian women (OR = 2.26; 95%CI: 1.19, 4.31). In addition, pregnant women from households with middle-class wealth index had 64% reduction in tobacco products use among pregnant women, compared to those from poor households (OR = 0.36; 95%CI: 0.15-0.87). CONCLUSION: Overall, tobacco use in pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa was low; however high prevalence estimates were noted in some countries. Prevention and management of tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke during pregnancy is crucial to protect maternal and child health in Africa continent. Pregnant women should be examined about their tobacco use preferably with a biochemical test and those who use tobacco products be encouraged to use cessation supports such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) where available. Health professionals should identify tobacco products users and advise to quit, most importantly by offer cessation support. When tobacco products users become pregnant, the health benefits of cessation of tobacco use should be well discussed with them especially during antenatal care. The tobacco use of other members of the household is also crucial, as having a user partner could widely predict the exposure of a pregnant woman.","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2018 Sep 26,England,2018,10

In the Public Health 3.0 era, multisectorial efforts are essential in addressing not only infectious or noncommunicable diseases but also upstream social determinants of health. In this article, we argue that actionable, geographically granular, and timely intelligence is an essential infrastructure for the protection of our health today.

24992827,"Avoidable hospitalizations in Switzerland: a small area analysis on regional variation, density of physicians, hospital supply and rurality.","BACKGROUND: Avoidable hospitalizations (AH) are hospital admissions for diseases and conditions that could have been prevented by appropriate ambulatory care. We examine regional variation of AH in Switzerland and the factors that determine AH. METHODS: We used hospital service areas, and data from 2008-2010 hospital discharges in Switzerland to examine regional variation in AH. Age and sex standardized AH were the outcome variable, and year of admission, primary care physician density, medical specialist density, rurality, hospital bed density and type of hospital reimbursement system were explanatory variables in our multilevel poisson regression. RESULTS: Regional differences in AH were as high as 12-fold. Poisson regression showed significant increase of all AH over time. There was a significantly lower rate of all AH in areas with more primary care physicians. Rates increased in areas with more specialists. Rates of all AH also increased where the proportion of residences in rural communities increased. Regional hospital capacity and type of hospital reimbursement did not have significant associations. Inconsistent patterns of significant determinants were found for disease specific analyses. CONCLUSION: The identification of regions with high and low AH rates is a starting point for future studies on unwarranted medical procedures, and may help to reduce their incidence. AH have complex multifactorial origins and this study demonstrates that rurality and physician density are relevant determinants. The results are helpful to improve the performance of the outpatient sector with emphasis on local context. Rural and urban differences in health care delivery remain a cause of concern in Switzerland.",BMC health services research,2014 Jul 3,England,2014,10
26729149,Racial Differences in Length of Stay for Patients Who Leave Against Medical Advice from U.S. General Hospitals.,"There is a paucity of published literature on the length of hospital stays (LOS) for patients who leave against medical advice (AMA) and on the factors that predict their LOS. The purpose of the study is to examine the relationship between race and the LOS for AMA patients after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) data were used to describe LOS for AMA patients aged 18 years or older. Patient characteristics included age, sex, race, marital status, insurance, and diagnosis (ICD-9-CM). Hospital characteristics consisted of ownership, region and bed size. LOS was the major outcome measure. Using data from all years 1988-2006, the expected time to AMA discharge was first examined as a function of race, then adjusting for year terms, patient and hospital characteristics, and major medical diagnoses and mental illness. The unadjusted effect of race on the expected time of leaving AMA was about twice the adjusted effect. After controlling for the other covariates, the expected time to AMA discharge is 20% shorter for Blacks than Whites. The most significant predictors included age, insurance coverage, mental illness, gender, and region. Factors identified in this study offer insights into directions for evidence based- health policy to reduce AMA discharges.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2015 Dec 31,Switzerland,2015,10
31732187,[How does employment status influence the effects of residential insecurity on health?],"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyse the effects of housing insecurity on health and whether they are modified by employment status of people belonging to the Treball als Barris programme in Barcelona (Spain) between 2015 and 2016. METHOD: We conducted a longitudinal study using a survey which included sociodemographic, employment and housing status information. This was administered to 469 individuals at baseline and after one year of follow-up. We then carried out a descriptive analysis and fitted regression models to estimate the effects of housing insecurity and employment status on health, and the interaction between them. RESULTS: Among women, we found negative effects of housing insecurity on health (the prevalence ratio [PR] of poor self-reported health among women with housing insecurity was 2.29, with a 95% confidence interval [95%CI] of 1.36-3.84, compared to those in secure housing), while, among men, the main effects on health were due to employment status (PR of poor self-reported health among men who were unemployed without subsidy was 3.16 [95%CI: 1.02-6.15] compared to those who were employed after follow-up). In addition, the results suggest an interaction between housing and employment status on mental health among men. CONCLUSION: Housing insecurity rates have increased in recent years. It produces negative effects on health and can interact with other social determinants such as employment, mainly on men's mental health.",Gaceta sanitaria,2019 Nov 12,Spain,2019,10
21485235,Non-biological factors associated with tooth retention in Irish adults.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify non-biological factors associated with retention of natural teeth and sound untreated natural teeth among adults in Ireland. DESIGN: Data were collected in the 2000/'02 epidemiological survey of the oral health of Irish adults. CLINICAL SETTING: Participants underwent a clinical oral examination in health board dental clinics and a detailed interview pertaining to oral and general health. PARTICIPANTS: The analysis is based on a random sample of adults aged 16-24 years (n = 1,196), 35-44 years (n = 978), and 65 years and older (n = 714). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dependent variables were number of natural teeth present (NT), number of sound untreated natural teeth (SUNT), likelihood of being dentate, having 21 or more NT (21+NT), 28 or more NT (28+NT), and 18 or more SUNT (18+SUNT). Socioeconomic status (SES) was based on being disadvantaged, occupation status and educational attainment. Behavioural factors included smoking, snacking, brushing frequency and dental visiting patterns. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Tooth retention decreased with increasing age group. Level of education, disadvantage status, being in employment, frequent brushing and visiting the dentist for a check-up (instead of when in need or pain) were associated with tooth retention. Attending for a check-up moderated the impact of disadvantage on tooth retention among 35-44 year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that several non-biological determinants are important for dental health in this adult population.",Community dental health,2011 Mar,England,2011,10
22799474,Are you talking to ME? The importance of ethnicity and culture in childhood obesity prevention and management.,"Childhood obesity is prevalent, is of consequence, and disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minority populations. By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence and substantial differences in many risk factors for obesity are already present, suggesting that disparities in obesity prevalence have their origins in the earliest stages of life. The reasons for racial/ethnic variation in obesity are complex and may include differences in cultural beliefs and practices, level of acculturation, ethnicity-based differences in body image, and perceptions of media, sleep, and physical activity. In addition, racial/ethnic differences in obesity may evolve as a consequence of the socio- and environmental context in which families live. The primary care setting offers unique opportunities to intervene and alter the subsequent course of health and disease for children at risk for obesity. Regular visits during childhood allow both detection of elevated weight status and offer opportunities for prevention and treatment. Greater awareness of the behavioral, social-cultural, and environmental determinants of obesity among ethnic minority populations could assist clinicians in the treatment of obesity among diverse pediatric populations. Specific strategies include beginning prevention efforts early in life before obesity is present and recognizing and querying about ethnic- and culturally specific beliefs and practices, the role of the extended family in the household, and parents' beliefs of the causative factors related to their child's obesity. Efforts to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate care, family-based treatment programs, and support services that aim to uncouple socioeconomic factors from adverse health outcomes could improve obesity care for racial/ethnic minority children.",Childhood obesity (Print),2012 Feb,United States,2012,10
25063590,Community health workers as an integral strategy in the REACH U.S. program to eliminate health inequities.,"Mounting evidence indicates that community health workers (CHWs) contribute to improved behavioral and health outcomes and reductions in health disparities. We provide an overview (based on grantee reports and community action plans) that describe CHW contributions to 22 Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) programs funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2007 to 2012, offering additional evidence of their contributions to the effectiveness of community public health programs. We then highlight how CHWs helped deliver REACH U.S. community interventions to meet differing needs across communities to bridge the gap between health care services and community members, build community and individual capacity to plan and implement interventions addressing multiple chronic health conditions, and meet community needs in a culturally appropriate manner. The experience, skills, and success gained by CHWs participating in the REACH U.S. program have fostered important individual community-level changes geared to increase health equity. Finally, we underscore the importance of CHWs being embedded within these communities and the flexibility they offer to intervention strategies, both of which are characteristics critical to meeting needs of communities experiencing health disparities. CHWs served a vital role in facilitating and leading changes and will continue to do so.",Health promotion practice,2014 Nov,United States,2014,10
29940430,Social enterprises and public health improvement in England: a qualitative case study.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the contribution of social enterprises to publicly commissioned public health improvement and assess the risks and benefits of their role. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative case study of four south London boroughs. METHODS: Documentary research; in-depth interviews with 19 key informants. RESULTS: This study identified 24 social enterprises that were currently commissioned to contribute to public health improvement. These organisations ranged in size, longevity, and structure. They were widely reported as flexible and able to rapidly develop services responsive to local community needs. Their work often addressed upstream health determinants. However, to capitalise on securing contracts, they had to bureaucratise and establish provider alliances, which risked losing the very characteristics that make them unique. Social enterprises bore the financial risk of innovative service developments. Emerging mixed economies of public health were fragmented, limiting commissioners' abilities to plan strategically and evaluate the impact. CONCLUSIONS: Social enterprises have an increasing role in providing potential solutions to intractable health improvement challenges, contributing to a broader vision around upstream action for health. However, the fragmentation and growing outsourcing of public health has risks for coherent and equitable service planning.",Public health,2018 Aug,Netherlands,2018,10
30771721,Economic sanctions threaten population health: the case of Iran.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to review evidence of the negative consequences of international economic sanctions on population health in Iran and pathways via which the sanctions affect health. STUDY DESIGN: This is a narrative review. METHODS: Data from the World Bank and the Central Bank of Iran were gathered to clarify economic consequences of sanctions. Moreover, the literature was reviewed for published data on health consequences of economic sanctions in Iran and economic crisis in other parts of the world. Finally, some mechanisms via which economic sanctions could affect health were reviewed. RESULTS: Iran experienced 11.8% reduction in gross domestic production growth in 2012 compared with 2011, besides 40% inflation and 200% depreciation of Iranian currency. Ultimately, it resulted in increased living costs and unemployment. One year after termination of sanctions, Iran's gross domestic production growth increased by 14.1% in 2016. Data revealed that mental health has been affected during sanctions. Moreover, access to essential and lifesaving medication has been compromised, similar to other countries during economic recession. CONCLUSION: Economic sanctions have had negative consequences on population health in Iran by impairing social determinants of health and access to medication and care. These sanctions widen economic inequality and health gap.",Public health,2019 Apr,Netherlands,2019,10
31528524,Linking studies to assess the life expectancy associated with eighth grade school achievement.,"Extensive evidence indicates the causal association of school outcomes and long-term health. We combined the findings of two studies by Chetty and colleagues to estimate the life expectancy associated with achievement scores in the eighth grade. We linked the dependent variable of the first study and the independent variable of the second study. The first study (of students in Tennessee) found a positive correlation between school achievement scores in eighth grade and income at age 25-27. Controlling for family background, a one percentile increase in eighth grade test score was associated with an increase of $148 (95% CI: $125, $172) in 2009 $U.S. in mean yearly wages at ages 25-27years. Based on estimated mean annual income growth of 3.35%, $148 would increase 1.59 fold to $235 (CI: $199, $273) in 14years, at age 40-$251 (CI: $213, $292) in 2012 $U.S. adjusted for inflation. The second study (of the U.S. population) found that a one percentile household income ($1500 in 2012 $U.S.) was associated with one month life expectancy at age 40. We calculate that an increase in income at age 40 attributable to one percentile increase in eighth grade test scores, i.e., $251, would increase life expectancy by 17% (i.e., $251/$1500) (CI: 14%, 19%) of one month per percentile eighth grade test score. Estimates of long-term health outcomes associated with educational outcomes can be made with caution. Applicability of findings from the Tennessee to the U.S. population is discussed.",Preventive medicine reports,2019 Dec,United States,2019,10
31194123,"Social determinants of multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations among the ageing population of England, 2002-2015.","This study explores longitudinal relationships between material, psycho-social and behavioural social determinants of health and multimorbidity of people aged 50 years or older in England. We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected biannually between 2002 and 2015. Apart from the basic measure of multimorbidity (two or more diseases within a person) we constructed two distinct measures of health in order to take into account the biology of ageing (complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations). We found that the likelihood of multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations was consistently associated with the levels of household wealth, sense of control over one's life, physical activity and loneliness. Larger health inequalities were observed when health was measured as complex multimorbidity and multiple functional limitations than basic multimorbidity. Compared to the population group with the highest wealth, those with the lowest wealth had 47% higher odds of basic multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.34-1.61), 73% higher odds of complex multimorbidity (95% C.I. 1.52-1.96) and 90% higher odds of having 10 or more functional limitations (95% C.I. 1.59-2.26). We did not find a dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption, smoking and multimorbidity but rather evidence of people in ill health actively moderating their health behaviour. We suggest that materialist models of multimorbidity and functional limitation at older age can not, on their own, explain the health inequalities as the behavioural and psycho-social factors play an important role. Policies aiming to reduce the risk of multimorbidity and functional limitation should address the issue at these three levels simultaneously, using the existing national infrastructure of General Practices.",SSM - population health,2019 Aug,England,2019,10
24077479,"The status of diabetes control in Kurdistan province, west of Iran.","BACKGROUND: Based on some estimation more than two million peoples in Iran are affected by Type 2 diabetes. The present study was designed to evaluate the status of diabetes control among Type 2 diabetes patients in Kurdistan, west of Iran and its associated factors. METHODS: In our cross sectional study conducted in 2010, 411 Type 2 diabetes patients were randomly recruited from Sanandaj, Capital of Kurdistan. Chi square test was used in univariate analysis to address the association between HgAlc and FBS status and other variables. The significant results from Univariate analysis were entered in multivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression model. RESULTS: In 38% of patients, FBS was in normal range (70-130) and in 47% HgA1c was <7% which is normal range for HgA1c. In univariate analysis, FBS level was associated with educational levels (P=0.001), referral style (P=0.001), referral time (P=0.009), and insulin injection (P=0.016). In addition, HgA1c had a relationship with sex (P=0.023), age (P=0.035), education (P=0.001), referral style (P=0.001), and insulin injection (P=0.008). After using multinomial logistic regression for significant results of univariate analysis, it was found that FBS was significantly associated with referral style. In addition HgA1c was significantly associated with referral style and Insulin injection.

29035642,"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Cancer Survival: The Contribution of Tumor, Sociodemographic, Institutional, and Neighborhood Characteristics.","Purpose Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival in the United States are well documented, but the underlying causes are not well understood. We quantified the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California. Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival disparities accounting for 24% of disparities in breast cancer, 24% in prostate cancer, and 16% to 30% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients. The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it explained only 15% to 40% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and access to health care are important contributing factors.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2018 Jan 1,United States,2018,10
30322233,A review of exposure assessment methods for epidemiological studies of health effects related to industrially contaminated sites.,"BACKGROUND: this paper is based upon work from COST Action ICSHNet. Health risks related to living close to industrially contaminated sites (ICSs) are a public concern. Toxicology-based risk assessment of single contaminants is the main approach to assess health risks, but epidemiological studies which investigate the relationships between exposure and health directly in the affected population have contributed important evidence. Limitations in exposure assessment have substantially contributed to uncertainty about associations found in epidemiological studies. OBJECTIVES: to examine exposure assessment methods that have been used in epidemiological studies on ICSs and to provide recommendations for improved exposure assessment in epidemiological studies by comparing exposure assessment methods in epidemiological studies and risk assessments. METHODS: after defining the multi-media framework of exposure related to ICSs, we discussed selected multi-media models applied in Europe. We provided an overview of exposure assessment in 54 epidemiological studies from a systematic review of hazardous waste sites; a systematic review of 41 epidemiological studies on incinerators and 52 additional studies on ICSs and health identified for this review. RESULTS: we identified 10 multi-media models used in Europe primarily for risk assessment. Recent models incorporated estimation of internal biomarker levels. Predictions of the models differ particularly for the routes 'indoor air inhalation' and 'vegetable consumption'. Virtually all of the 54 hazardous waste studies used proximity indicators of exposure, based on municipality or zip code of residence (28 studies) or distance to a contaminated site (25 studies). One study used human biomonitoring. In virtually all epidemiological studies, actual land use was ignored. In the 52 additional studies on contaminated sites, proximity indicators were applied in 39 studies, air pollution dispersion modelling in 6 studies, and human biomonitoring in 9 studies. Exposure assessment in epidemiological studies on incinerators included indicators (presence of source in municipality and distance to the incinerator) and air dispersion modelling. Environmental multi-media modelling methods were not applied in any of the three groups of studies. CONCLUSIONS: recommendations for refined exposure assessment in epidemiological studies included the use of more sophisticated exposure metrics instead of simple proximity indicators where feasible, as distance from a source results in misclassification of exposure as it ignores key determinants of environmental fate and transport, source characteristics, land use, and human consumption behaviour. More validation studies using personal exposure or human biomonitoring are needed to assess misclassification of exposure. Exposure assessment should take more advantage of the detailed multi-media exposure assessment procedures developed for risk assessment. The use of indicators can be substantially improved by linking definition of zones of exposure to existing knowledge of extent of dispersion. Studies should incorporate more often land use and individual behaviour.",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,2018 Sep-Dec,Italy,2018,10
30361160,Is Immigrant Status Associated With Cervical Cancer Screening Among Women in Canada? Results From a Cross-Sectional Study.,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer accounts for the highest mortality rate from cancer in women worldwide. Despite widespread availability of cervical cancer screening programs in Canada, immigrant women are largely underscreened. The most recently published Canadian-wide study evaluated screening uptake from 2001 to 2002. The objectives included identifying the prevalence of underscreened women in Canada, determining the risk of underscreening for cervical cancer among immigrant women, and providing an update on Canadian screening practices. METHODS: This study included women aged 20 to 69 who completed the Canadian Community Health Survey 2012. The prevalence of underscreening among Canadian-born and immigrant women was estimated. A log-binomial model was fit to estimate the relative risk (RR) of underscreening for immigrant women while controlling for age, income level, visible minority status, smoking status, and access to a regular physician. A secondary analysis compared immigrants residing in Canada for greater or less than 10 years to Canadian-born women. RESULTS: Of the 17 854women eligible for this study, 18.6% of Canadian-born women and 28.9% of immigrant women were underscreened (P < 0.05). Immigrant women were at significantly higher risk of being underscreened compared with Canadian-born women (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.20-1.45). The relative risk did not change when stratifying by length of time since immigration (RRrecent immigrant 1.32; 95% CI 1.16-1.50; and RRlong-term immigrant 1.32; 95% CI 1.19-1.47). CONCLUSION: Immigrant status continues to be associated with a significantly higher risk of underscreening, irrespective of time in Canada. Social and educational programs targeted towards immigrants are needed to mitigate the disparity in cervical cancer screening.",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,2019 Jun,Netherlands,2019,10
31223639,Dataset on adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution onto activated carbon obtained from low cost wastes by chemical-thermal activation - modelling using response surface methodology.,"The aim of this study was to produce activated carbon derived from corn stalk (AC-CS) with suitable characteristics as inexpensive, nontoxic adsorbent with good efficiency for elimination of Methylene Blue (MB) as cationic dye from aqueous solution in batch adsorption process. The morphology and functional groups of adsorbent were characterized by SEM and FTIR in this dataset. In addition, the influence of MB concentration, pH, adsorbent dosage, and contact time on the removal of dye using AC-CS was tested by central composite design (CCD) under response surface methodology (RSM). Based on results, the parameters adsorbent dose and initial dye concentration for this investigation play an important role in the adsorption studies of methylene blue. The experimental values were in good agreement with the model predicted values also the results of the study showed that maximum absorbance efficiency at initial concentration of 10 mg/l, absorbent dose of 1.4 g, contact time of 50 min and pH 11 was 90%.",Data in brief,2019 Aug,Netherlands,2019,10
30939928,Child Life Specialists' Experiences Addressing Social Determinants of Health: A Web-Based Survey.,"We used Google Forms to survey 110 child life specialists on their experiences addressing family psychosocial issues. Most respondents were female (99%) and white (95%), with mean age 34 +/- 10 years. Ninety-five percent reported addressing family psychosocial issues during the previous 3 months, including parental separation/divorce (71%), poverty/financial needs (64%), parental mental illness (59%), substance abuse at home (54%), homelessness/housing problems (54%), bullying (49%), physical neglect (46%), physical abuse (46%), unemployment (46%), emotional neglect (45%), and hunger/food insecurity (42%). Eighty-five percent of respondents reported addressing family psychosocial issues once per month or more often, with 80% providing coping strategies, 76% providing family support, 66% providing therapeutic play, and 66% providing psychological preparation. These findings indicate that child life specialists frequently address a range of family psychosocial issues.

26539366,"Estimation of a single motor unit's threshold and activation range, a study on patients with muscular disorders.","BACKGROUND: In clinical neurophysiology, threshold tracking studies are used to evaluate the functionality of a muscle through studying the functionality of its motor units (MUs) that govern the muscle. The functionality of an MU can be quantified by estimation of its excitability properties via MU's stimulus-response curve. In this study, we aim to develop a model-based approach to estimate MU's threshold mean and its activation range as indications of MU's excitability. This is a different approach from routine strategies in neurophysiology, which are mostly subjective. METHODS: To assess the excitability of a single MU, needle electromyography examination was used to obtain the axonal activity of that MU. To improve estimation, the examination was repeated several times on individuals. Replication of experiment introduces serial correlation between observations. We account for this correlation by using a mixed-effects model. We investigate the appropriateness of classical logistic mixed-effects model and its Bayesian formulation for estimation purpose. RESULTS: Both classical and Bayesian models can obtain a reliable estimation of MU's threshold. However, we found Bayesian approach to provide a better estimate of MU's activation range. Moreover, if data contain outliers both classical and Bayesian methods are vulnerable to some extent. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the classical approach, Bayesian method is more flexible in dealing with overdispersion and provides more robust estimation of MU's parameters.",International journal of applied & basic medical research,2015 Sep-Dec,India,2015,10
24479754,Marital status shows a strong protective effect on long-term mortality among first acute myocardial infarction-survivors with diagnosed hyperlipidemia--findings from the MONICA/KORA myocardial infarction registry.,"BACKGROUND: Reduction of long term mortality by marital status is well established in general populations. However, effects have been shown to change over time and differ considerably by cause of death. This study examined the effects of marital status on long term mortality after the first acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the population-based MONICA (Monitoring trends and determinants on cardiovascular diseases)/KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg)-myocardial infarction registry which assesses cases from the city of Augsburg and 2 adjacent districts located in southern Bavaria, Germany. A total of 3,766 men and women aged 28 to 74 years who were alive 28 days after their first myocardial infarction were included. Hazard ratios (HR) for the effects of marital status on mortality after one to 10 years of follow-up are presented. RESULTS: The study population included 2,854 (75.8%) married individuals. During a median follow-up of 5.3 years, with an inter-quartile range of 3.3 to 7.6 years, 533 (14.15%) deaths occurred. Among married and unmarried individuals 388 (13.6%) and 145 (15.9%) deaths occurred, respectively. Overall marital status showed an insignificant protective HR of 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-1.22). Stratified analyses revealed strong protective effects only among men and women younger than 60 who were diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. HRs ranged from 0.27 (95% CI 0.13-0.59) for a two-year survival to 0.43 (95% CI 0.27-0.68) for a 10-year survival. Substitution of marital status with co-habitation status confirmed the strata-specific effect [HR: 0.52 (95% CI 0.31-0.86)]. CONCLUSIONS: Marital status has a strong protective effect among first myocardial infarction survivors with diagnosed hyperlipidemia, which diminishes with increasing age. Treatments, recommended lifestyle changes or other attributes specific to hyperlipidema may be underlying factors, mediated by the social support of spouses. Underlying causes should be examined in further studies.",BMC public health,2014 Jan 30,England,2014,10
29601425,Predicting Risk Factors for 30-Day Readmissions Following Discharge From Post-Acute Care.,"PURPOSE OF STUDY: The specific aims of this descriptive study were to (1) examine the relationships between individual-level determinants of health using standard care admission assessments of residents admitted to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) and those residents readmitted to the hospital within 30 days from discharge from the same SNF; (2) identify and describe the risk factors of the residents readmitted to the hospital within 30 days; and (3) use the findings to inform and refine current practice to target the mutable risk factors correlated with 30-day hospital readmission. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: A 180-bed skilled nursing center in Northeastern Pennsylvania. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE: A retrospective paper medical record review of patients discharged from an SNF to community living was conducted to examine the relationship between individual determinants of health behaviors and 30-day hospital readmissions. The study sample (N = 221) included adults 65 years and older who were admitted to the SNF from January to December 2014 for subacute physical rehabilitation following an acute care hospital stay with a discharge plan to community living. RESULTS: The 30-day readmission rate was 11%. The results of the logistic regression including diagnosis at readmission showed that the odds of readmission before 30 days were nearly three times greater in patients who had congestive heart failure (p < .02). Patients who were at ""very high risk"" on the Braden Scale were 20 times more likely to be readmitted before 30 days compared with those at low risk. Age and gender were not predictors. None of the other standard screening assessments for delirium, depression, functional status, and fall risk were predictive of 30-day readmission. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: (1) Care coordination and communication with residents, caregivers, and home health can have an impact on 30-day readmissions post-SNF discharge. (2) Chronic respiratory diseases continue to be a challenge in prevention of hospital readmissions.",Professional case management,2018 May/Jun,United States,2018,10
20346183,Cost-effectiveness of a participatory return-to-work intervention for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders: design of a randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Within the working population there is a vulnerable group: workers without an employment contract and workers with a flexible labour market arrangement, e.g. temporary agency workers. In most cases, when sick-listed, these workers have no workplace/employer to return to. Also, for these workers access to occupational health care is limited or even absent in many countries. For this vulnerable working population there is a need for tailor-made occupational health care, including the presence of an actual return-to-work perspective. Therefore, a participatory return-to-work program has been developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for workers, sick-listed due to low back pain.The objective of this paper is to describe the design of a randomised controlled trial to study the (cost-)effectiveness of this newly developed participatory return-to-work program adapted for temporary agency workers and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders, compared to usual care. METHODS/DESIGN: The design of this study is a randomised controlled trial with one year of follow-up. The study population consists of temporary agency workers and unemployed workers sick-listed between 2 and 8 weeks due to musculoskeletal disorders. The new return-to-work program is a stepwise program aimed at making a consensus-based return-to-work implementation plan with the possibility of a (therapeutic) workplace to return-to-work. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome measure is duration of the sickness benefit period after the first day of reporting sick. Secondary outcome measures are: time until first return-to-work, total number of days of sickness benefit during follow-up; functional status; intensity of musculoskeletal pain; pain coping; and attitude, social influence and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-benefit is evaluated from an insurer's perspective. A process evaluation is part of this study. DISCUSSION: For sick-listed workers without an employment contract there can be gained a lot by improving occupational health care, including return-to-work guidance, and by minimising the 'labour market handicap' by creating a return-to-work perspective. In addition, reduction of sickness absence and work disability, i.e. a reduction of disability claims, may result in substantial benefits for the Dutch Social Security System.

19656308,The relation between an adverse psychological and social environment in childhood and the development of adult obesity: a systematic literature review.,"The prevalence of obesity is on a global-wide increase, but still the aetiology of adult obesity is poorly understood. It has been shown that overweight children suffer from adverse psychological events, but less is known about the potential effects of adverse psychological factors among normal weight children for later development of obesity. The purpose of this study was to systematically review current literature on associations between psychological factors in childhood and development of obesity in adulthood. A systematic search was conducted in three electronic databases MEDLINE (silverplatter 1977-2008), PsycINFO (1972-2008) and PsycINFO Weekly (week 1 January 2007-week 3 July 2008) to identify studies of interest. Six prospective and two retrospective studies were identified. Psychosocial factors related to adult obesity were lack of childhood care, abuse and childhood anxiety disorders. In addition, depression in adolescence tended to be related to adult obesity but among young girls only. Learning difficulties and scholastic proficiencies below average were also risk factors. The current literature suggests that specific psychosocial factors in childhood may act as determinants for developing obesity in adulthood.",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2010 Mar,England,2010,10

The study was operated in pilot-scale and OLRs of 0.11-1.3 gCOD/L.d. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image showed that the biofilm with a proper thickness was formed on IFAS reactor's media. The results indicated that the best removal efficiency of BOD5, COD, and TSS were 85.24, 92.52 and 90.21%, respectively, in an organic loading of 0.44 gCOD/L.d. Then, with the OLR increased, the removal efficiencies of BOD5, COD, and TSS increased as long as the organic loading reached 0.44 gCOD/L.d. But with the OLR increased more, the removal efficiency of these parameters decreased. The ANOVA statistical test results showed that the mean difference of removal efficiency in organic loadings for BOD5 (p </= 0.001) and COD (p = 0.003) was significant, while it was insignificant for TSS (p = 0.23). The best removal efficiencies of Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) were 89.60 and 86.67%, respectively, which were obtained at an OLR of 0.44 gCOD/L.d. By increasing OLR up to 0.44 gCOD/L.d, removal efficiencies of TN and TP increased, while the removal efficiency decreased with the OLR increased more, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.021). Finally, the results showed that the IFAS system provided a proper efficiency in treatment of the synthetic greywater and it could be used in a full scale.",AMB Express,2018 Jan 8,Germany,2018,10
20564687,Enabling international communication among Brazilian occupational therapists: seeking consensus on occupational terminology.,"The purpose of this study was to examine how key occupational therapy terminologies are used by Brazilian occupational therapists. A nominal group approach combined with a Delphi technique involving 31 Brazilian occupational therapists was applied. A sociolinguistic approach was adopted since it broadens our understanding of the social and cultural determinants of terminology consolidation. Brazilian occupational therapists were found to adopt the term activity more often than human action or doing. Even less often were praxis and occupation applied. No consensus was reached regarding which of the terms is most preferred. While Brazilian occupational therapists have been developing their profession from international standards, it is still embedded in local demands and policies. Additionally, the political context must be considered when building an international dialogue between members of a professional body. Such a dialogue could engage professionals from different countries in meaningful exchanges about their practices. These exchanges may lead to the development of solid professional communities that can contribute meaningfully to social change.",Occupational therapy international,2010 Sep,England,2010,10
25280826,Intention and planning predicting medication adherence following coronary artery bypass graft surgery.,"OBJECTIVE: Medication adherence rates after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are low due to intentional (e.g., deliberately choosing not to take medication) and unintentional (e.g., forgetting to take the medication) person-related factors. There is a lack of studies examining the psychological factors related to non-adherence in CABG patients. Intentions to take medication and planning when, where, and how to take medication and to overcome unintentional forgetting to take medication were hypothesized to be independently related to medication adherence. Furthermore, planning to overcome forgetting was hypothesized to be more strongly associated with medication adherence in patients who have stronger intentions to take medication, reflecting the idea that planning is a factor that specifically helps in patients who are willing to take medication, but fail to do so. METHODS: Measures of medication adherence, intention and planning were collected in a sample of (N=197) post-CABG surgery patients followed from discharge (baseline; Time 1) over a 12-month period (Time 2) in Boo-Ali Hospital in Qazvin, Iran. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed in which medication adherence at Time 2 was regressed onto socio-demographic and clinical factors, the hypothesized psychological variables (adherence-related intention and planning), and interaction terms. RESULTS: Intentions to take medication (B=.30, P<.01), action planning when, where, and how to take the medication (B=.19, P<.01), and coping planning how to avoid forgetting to take the medication (B=.16, P<.01) were independently related to medication adherence. Beyond that, action planning x intention to take medication (B=.06, P<.05) and coping planning x intention (B=.07, P<.01) interaction also significantly predicted adherence. CONCLUSION: Intention to take medication was associated with better medication adherence and action and coping planning strategies to avoid forgetting to take the medication added significantly to the prediction of adherence in the year following CABG discharge. This is in line with theory and evidence about the independent roles of intentional and unintentional predictors of non-adherence. As hypothesized, planning to overcome unintentional forgetting to take the medication was more predictive of medication adherence in those patients who reported higher intentions to take medication, reflecting the idea that planning helps patients overcome unintentional reasons of being non-adherent.",Journal of psychosomatic research,2014 Oct,England,2014,10

OBJECTIVES: Identifying major dietary patterns in Iranian young females, which associate with central obesity, can probably explain the difference between Iranian young females' pattern and those of their western peers regarding obesity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the current cross-sectional study, a total of 257 young females aged 11 - 15 years old from Talaat Intelligent Guidance School, Tabriz, Iran (2007) were selected for the study using non-probability simple sampling method. Then, usual dietary intakes of all subjects were evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire and anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, waist circumference, and Body Mass Index (BMI) using the standard protocols. Data were analyzed by inferential statistics (One-way ANOVA, Tukey test for Post-Hoc Analysis, Chi-square test, age-adjusted means, analysis of covariance with Bonferroni correction, correlation and partial correlation) by SPSS software. RESULTS: In the current study, six major dietary patterns were extracted using factor analysis method. Before and after controlling the age, subjects in the upper tertile of the Iranian Central Obesity Making Dietary Pattern (rich in cruciferous vegetables, green leafy vegetables, soft drinks, tomatoes, other vegetables and vegetable oils) had larger waist circumference in comparison with the ones in the lower tertile (before controlling for age: 64.2 +/- 9 vs. 61.6 +/- 7 P = 0.03; after: 64.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 61.5 +/- 0.8, P = 0.009). However in lacto vegetarian dietary pattern (rich in legumes, potato, other vegetables, dough, high-fat dairy products and margarine), individuals in the upper tertile had significantly lower weight, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) in comparison with the ones in the lower tertile (weight: 44.9 +/- 9.3 vs. 51.4 +/- 10.6, P < 0.01; WC: 59.9 +/- 8 vs. 64 +/- 7.9, P < 0.01; BMI: 18.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 20.6 +/- 3.5, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The current study findings suggest that the Iranian Central Obesity Making Dietary Pattern is directly associated with waist circumference (marker of central obesity), while lacto vegetarian dietary pattern is reversely associated with weight, waist circumference and BMI.

29796037,Effect of Vitamin B6 Versus Propranolol on Antipsychotic-Induced Akathisia: A pilot Comparative Double-blind Study.,"Akathisia is a common adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs and is characterized by subjective feelings of restlessness. First-line treatment usually consists of propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist. However, propranolol does not seem to be efficacious in up to 70% of patients. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin B6 versus propranolol on antipsychotic-induced akathisia (AIA). This study was a comparative, double-blind, randomized trial. In the present study, 66 adult patients with antipsychotic-induced akathisia were enrolled and randomized into three groups, and received vitamin B6 300 mg/12 h or 600 mg/12 h or propranolol 20 mg/12 h. The diagnosis of AIA was made by clinical examination and its severity was assessed by the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. Fifty one patients completed 5 days of the trial. The results showed that there was no significant difference in BARS score among the different groups which means that vitamin B6 attenuated the AIA similar to propranolol. However, there wasn't any significant difference between high or low dose of vitamin B6. In conclusion, the results of this trial suggest that vitamin B6 may be beneficial for ameliorating of antipsychotic-induced akathisia.",Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,2018 Winter,Iran,2018,10
20440973,The solution space: developing research and policy agendas to eliminate employment-related health inequalities.,"As in many other areas of social determinants of health, policy recommendations on employment conditions and health inequalities need to be implemented and evaluated. Case studies at the country level can provide a flavor of ""what works,"" but they remain essentially subjective. Employment conditions research should provide policies that actually reduce health inequalities among workers. Workplace trials showing some desired effect on the intervention group are insufficient for such a broad policy research area. To provide a positive heuristic, the authors propose a set of new policy research priorities, including placing more focus on ""solving"" and less on""problematizing"" the health effects of employment conditions; developing policy-oriented theoretical frameworks to reduce employment-related inequalities in health; developing research on methods to test the effects of labor market policies; generalizing labor market interventions; engaging, reaching out to, and holding onto workers exposed to multiple forms of unhealthy employment conditions; measuring labor market inequalities in health; planning, early on, for sustainability in labor market interventions; studying intersectoral effects across multiple interventions to reduce health inequalities; and looking for evidence in a global context.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2010,United States,2010,10
28782894,Association between dental caries experience and sense of coherence among adolescents and mothers.,"BACKGROUND: Sense of coherence (SOC) is associated with oral health. AIM: Investigate associations between dental caries experience and SOC among mothers and adolescents. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1195 adolescents and their mothers. Data were collected through a questionnaire, the short version of the SOC and oral clinical examinations. The data were statistically analyzed using bivariate analysis, Poisson regression models with robust variance, and Spearman's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of dental caries experience was 41.8%. A moderate correlation was found between the SOC of mothers and adolescents (r = 0.563; P < 0.001). A higher mother's SOC (PR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.36-0.53) and adolescent's SOC (PR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.39-0.55) were protective factors against dental caries experience in the adolescents. The prevalence of dental caries experience was higher among adolescents with visible plaque (Model 1-PR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.53-2.04; Model 2-PR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.37-1.84) and those whose families were in a lower economic class (Model 1-PR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.35-1.80; Model 2-PR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.36-1.81).

30684408,Acceptance of Mobile Health Apps for Disease Management Among People With Multiple Sclerosis: Web-Based Survey Study.,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps might have the potential to promote self-management of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) in everyday life. However, the uptake of MS apps remains poor, and little is known about the facilitators and barriers for their efficient utilization, such as technology acceptance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the acceptance of mHealth apps for disease management in the sense of behavioral intentions to use and explore determinants of utilization among people with MS based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). METHODS: Participants for this Web-based cross-sectional study were recruited throughout Germany with the support of regional MS associations and self-help groups. To identify determinants of intention to use MS apps, a measure based on the UTAUT was adapted with 4 key determinants (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions) and extended by Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) and electronic health literacy. Potential influencing effects of both MS and computer self-efficacy (C-SE) as mediators and fatigue as a moderator were analyzed using Hayes's PROCESS macro (SPSS version 3.0) for IBM SPSS version 24.0. RESULTS: A total of 98 participants (mean age 47.03 years, SD 10.17; 66/98, 67% female) with moderate fatigue levels completed the survey. Although most participants (91/98, 92%) were daily smartphone users, almost two-thirds (62/98, 63%) reported no experience with MS apps. Overall, the acceptance was moderate on average (mean 3.11, SD 1.31, minimum=1 and maximum=5), with lower scores among persons with no experience (P=.04) and higher scores among current users (P<.001). In multiple regression analysis (R(2)=63% variance explained), performance expectancy (beta=.41) and social influence (beta=.33) were identified as significant predictors of acceptance (all P<.001). C-SE was confirmed as a partial mediator in the relationship between IU and acceptance (indirect effect: B=-.095, 95% CI -0.227 to -0.01). Furthermore, a moderated mediation by C-SE was shown in the relationship between IU and behavioral intentions to use MS apps for low (95% CI -0.42 to -0.01) and moderate levels (95% CI -0.27 to -0.01) of fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this exploratory pilot study indicates for the first time that positive expectations about the helpfulness for self-management purposes and social support might be important factors to be considered for improving the acceptance of MS apps among smartphone users with MS. However, given some inconsistent findings, especially regarding the role of effort expectancy and IU and self-efficacy, the conceptual model needs replication with a larger sample of people with MS, varying more in fatigue levels, and a longitudinal assessment of the actual usage of MS apps predicted by acceptance in the sense of behavioral intentions to use.",JMIR formative research,2018 Dec 12,Canada,2018,10
25113566,What can genes tell us about the relationship between education and health?,"We use genome wide data from respondents of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to evaluate the possibility that common genetic influences are associated with education and three health outcomes: depression, self-rated health, and body mass index. We use a total of 1.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained from the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-4v1 chip from 4233 non-Hispanic white respondents to characterize genetic similarities among unrelated persons in the HRS. We then used the Genome Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) toolkit, to estimate univariate and bivariate heritability. We provide evidence that education (h(2) = 0.33), BMI (h(2) = 0.43), depression (h(2) = 0.19), and self-rated health (h(2) = 0.18) are all moderately heritable phenotypes. We also provide evidence that some of the correlation between depression and education as well as self-rated health and education is due to common genetic factors associated with one or both traits. We find no evidence that the correlation between education and BMI is influenced by common genetic factors.",Social science & medicine (1982),2015 Feb,England,2015,10
25329390,Leisure in children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a systematic review.,"UNLABELLED: The aim of this systematic review is to describe participation in social and physical leisure activities among children and adolescents with JIA, as well as identify potential determinants of leisure participation. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched for articles published up until June 2013 pertaining to participation in leisure activities among youth with JIA and other rheumatic diseases. Studies were included if they measured involvement in either social or physical leisure activities. Selection and quality appraisal of articles were completed independently by two authors. RESULTS: Eight hundred and ninety-three articles were found through electronic and reference search. One hundred and nine full articles were reviewed to assess for eligibility. Twelve articles met inclusion criteria and findings were reviewed. Most focused on describing participation in physical rather than social activities. Results suggest that youth with JIA participated less in both social and physical leisure activities as compared to healthy peers, and those with JIA did not meet national recommendations for physical activity. Potential determinants of leisure participation were socio-demographic (age, sex), anthropometric (height, weight) and disease-related (JIA subtype, disease duration, pain, number of swollen or painful joints, stiffness, fatigue, well-being) factors. CONCLUSION: Characterization of leisure activity remains limited and mostly focused on physical activity in JIA. Assessment of more comprehensive outcome measures is warranted to obtain a better description of leisure in this population. Evidence of the influence of contextual factors as potential determinants of involvement in leisure among children with pediatric rheumatologic diseases is needed.",PloS one,2014,United States,2014,10
28914178,'You just have to learn to keep moving on': young women's experiences with unplanned pregnancy in the Cook Islands.,"The Cook Islands is one of several countries in the Pacific region that has high rates of teenage pregnancy and birth. While the social determinants of pregnancy and early motherhood are well established in the global context, little is known about how Cook Islands young women who become pregnant before age 20 make sense of their experiences. Drawing on individual interviews with a purposive sample of 10 young mothers, this paper examines the phenomenology of early pregnancy from their perspectives. Structural, cultural and individual factors emerged as salient themes in participants' accounts. Qualitative analysis revealed that nearly all the pregnancies were unplanned and every participant reacted negatively when she learned she was pregnant. While some participants wanted to terminate their pregnancies, lack of access to safe, legal and affordable abortion care limited their options. Ultimately, while nearly all participants wished they had been able to delay motherhood, they expressed happiness and pride about their new-found status as mothers. These findings allow for a fuller understanding of factors shaping young women's experiences of pregnancy in the Cook Islands, which have policy implications for reproductive health and rights.","Culture, health & sexuality",2018 Jul,England,2018,10
26757996,[The epidemiological advantage of preferential targeting of tuberculosis control at the poor].,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains disproportionately concentrated among the poor, yet known determinants of TB reactivation may fail to explain observed disparities in disease rates according to wealth. Reviewing data on TB disparities in India and the wealth distribution of known TB risk factors, we describe how social mixing patterns could be contributing to TB disparities. Wealth-assortative mixing, whereby individuals are more likely to be in contact with others from similar socio-economic backgrounds, amplifies smaller differences in risk of TB, resulting in large population-level disparities. As disparities and assortativeness increase, TB becomes more difficult to control, an effect that is obscured by looking at population averages of epidemiological parameters, such as case detection rates. We illustrate how TB control efforts may benefit from preferential targeting toward the poor. In India, an equivalent-scale intervention could have a substantially greater impact if targeted at those living below the poverty line than with a population-wide strategy. In addition to potential efficiencies in targeting higher-risk populations, TB control efforts would lead to a greater reduction in secondary TB cases per primary case diagnosed if they were preferentially targeted at the poor. We highlight the need to collect programmatic data on TB disparities and explicitly incorporate equity considerations into TB control plans.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2015 Sep,United States,2015,10
31581814,Integrating Evidence-Supported Psychotherapy Principles in Mental Health Case Management: A Capacity-Building Pilot.,"OBJECTIVES: Mental health case managers comprise a large workforce who help patients who struggle with complex mental illnesses and unmet needs with respect to the social determinants of health. This mixed-methods capacity-building pilot examined the feasibility, experiences, and outcomes of training community-based mental health case managers to integrate evidence-based psychotherapy principles into their case conceptualization and management practices. METHODS: Case-based, once-weekly, group consultations and training in applied therapeutic principles from mentalizing, interpersonal psychotherapy, motivational interviewing, and other evidence-based psychotherapies were provided to case managers over 8 months. A trauma-informed and culturally sensitive approach was emphasized to improve therapeutic alliances and to foster adaptive expertise and an appreciation of individual patient differences. RESULTS: Qualitative analyses of focus groups and individualized interviews identified a shift toward being more reflective rather than reactive, with improved empathy, patient engagement, morale, and confidence resulting from the training (N = 16). Self-reported pre-post counseling self-efficacy changes revealed significant improvements overall, driven by improved microskills and an ability to deal with challenging client behaviors (N = 10; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot demonstrated that case-based consultations and training of mental health case managers within a community-of-practice in trauma-informed, culturally sensitive application of evidence-supported psychotherapy principles were feasible and acceptable with scalable potential to improve case managers' counseling self-efficacy, reflective capacity, empathy, and morale. Further research in this area is needed with a larger sample, and patient and health systems outcomes.",Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie,2019 Dec,United States,2019,10
28750899,Evaluation of the frequency of food allergens based on skin prick test in children in Kurdistan Province - Iran.,"INTRODUCTION: Food allergy refers to abnormal reactions of the body caused by an immune system response to food. This study was conducted aiming to investigate allergy to food allergens in children with food allergies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted as a cross-sectional one on 304 children aged six months to seven years with food allergies admitted to the tertiary referral hospital in Kurdistan Province - Iran, during 2014-2015. All the patients were examined for skin prick test using 49 allergens. Finally, the obtained data were analysed using SPSS15 and chi-square and t tests. RESULTS: The highest percentage of occurrence of bump reaction (wheal) and redness (flare) was due to the consumption of fish, eggs, tomatoes, and cocoa. Moreover, the lowest rate of wheal and flare was caused by exposure to allergens like latex, tea, malt, and wheat flour. The reaction most created due to the consumption of foods was flare which was higher among under three-year-olds group (p<0.05), and between the sexes, girls showed the most common allergic reactions (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Since food allergy has a high prevalence in children, it should be considered with great interest. Considering that avoiding food allergens is the first step in the treatment of food allergies, the present study may be a useful guide in this regard.",Allergologia et immunopathologia,2018 Jan - Feb,Spain,2018,10
25496000,Fractionated microneedle radiofrequency for treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: A sham control study.,"BACKGROUND/ OBJECTIVE: Primary axillary hyperhidrosis (PAH) creates social stress in patients. Although there are several options for treating PAH, only surgical modalities have conferred a permanent solution. This study evaluated the clinical effectiveness of fractionated microneedle radiofrequency (FMR) treatment for PAH. METHODS: This study is based on a single-blind, sham control comparative design. In all, 25 patients with severe PAH underwent three sessions of FMR at 3-week intervals. One side was treated with FMR while the other was sham controlled. Efficacy was evaluated using the hyperhidrosis disease severity scale (HDSS), sweating intensity visual analogue scale (VAS) and patient satisfaction at baseline, 3 weeks after each session and at 3 months after the last. Skin biopsies were obtained from two enrolled patients. RESULTS: The HDSS and VAS demonstrated significant improvement after treatment on the treated side in comparison with the control side. The mean +/- SD of the HDSS after 21 weeks were 1.87 +/- 0.61 and 3.38 +/- 0.49 (P < 0.001) for the treated and the controlled side, respectively. The follow-up evaluation revealed that 79% of the patients showed a 1 or 2-score decrease in HDSS. In total, 80% of patients reported more than 50% satisfaction at the end of the study. Histopathological findings showed a decrease of the number of the sweat glands in the treated side, confirming the above findings. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of PAH with FMR as a non-invasive modality can be a safe option with positive therapeutic effects on HDSS without any long-lasting side effects.",The Australasian journal of dermatology,2015 Nov,Australia,2015,10
29649246,Women's relative status and childbearing intentions: Empirical evidence from Iran.,"Childbearing intentions are primary predictor of childbearing behaviors, particularly in low fertility societies. This study examined the role of relative status of women in childbearing intentions in Iran where fertility has been declining since 1986 and it has been around the replacement level during the last two decades. Data from the 2010 Iran's Multiple Indicator Demographic and Health Survey (IrMIDHS) were used to estimate the effect of relative status of women on intention to have more children among women with one child and those with two children. The results showed modest effect of relative status of women on future childbearing intentions at both parity one and two controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors. One implication from this finding is that within low fertility regimes where fertility level is around or below replacement level, the relative status of women is no more as important determinant of childbearing intention as in situations of high fertility regimes. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that most of the studies showing strong effect from relative status of women on childbearing are based on data from the situations where fertility level has been at the pre-transitional level.",PloS one,2018,United States,2018,10
30565954,Do Neighborhoods Matter? A Systematic Review of Modifiable Risk Factors for Obesity among Low Socio-Economic Status Black and Hispanic Children.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity increases the risk of obesity and harmful comorbidities later in life. It is influenced by characteristics of a child's neighborhood, particularly among underserved groups. Our objective was to systematically review the evidence relating neighborhood environment and obesity risk among urban, low socioeconomic status (SES) Black and Hispanic children. METHODS: We included studies published from 1993 through early 2017 from PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Sociological Abstracts databases investigating relationships between empirically measured neighborhood characteristics and obesity risk factors in the populations of interest. Databases were last searched on May 8, 2018. Initial analysis took place during 2014 and was completed during 2017. We extracted data on study population, design, and associations between neighborhood characteristics and obesity risk factors. RESULTS: We identified 2011 unique studies; 24 were included. Few studies demonstrated consistent patterns of association. Most neighborhood characteristics were not examined across multiple studies. BMI may be related to living in a lower-income neighborhood or convenience store access. CONCLUSIONS: This review found that the body of evidence relating neighborhood exposures and obesity risk factors among urban, low SES Black (also commonly referred to in the literature as ""non-Hispanic Black"" or African American) and Hispanic children is limited. Given the high risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease among these populations throughout the life course, research on neighborhood determinants of obesity should specifically include these populations, ensuring adequate power and methodological rigor to detect differences.",Childhood obesity (Print),2019 Feb/Mar,United States,2019,10
24433943,Reorienting women's health in low- and middle-income countries: the case of depression and Type 2 diabetes.,"Women's health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has historically focused on sexual and reproductive health. However, understanding how women acquire, experience, and treat non-reproductive health conditions, such as non-communicable diseases, has become a fundamental public health concern. Special attention to the social determinants of LMIC women's health can provide socially and culturally relevant knowledge for implementation of policies and programs for women increasingly confronting these 'New Challenge Diseases'. This article uses the example of depression and Type 2 diabetes comorbidity to illustrate how attending to the social determinants of mental and physical health beyond the reproductive years contributes to a more holistic agenda for women's health. For instance, we must address the plurality of experiences that shape women's health from social determinants of depression, such as gendered subjugation within the home and public sphere, to the structural determinants of obesity and diabetes, such as poor access to healthy foods and health care. Attending to the complexities of health and social well-being beyond the reproductive years helps the women's global health agenda capture the full spectrum of health concerns, particularly the chronic and non-communicable conditions that emerge as life expectancy increases.",Global health action,2014,United States,2014,10
26169507,Beyond Trauma: Post-resettlement Factors and Mental Health Outcomes Among Latino and Asian Refugees in the United States.,"War-related traumas impact refugees' mental health. Recent literature suggests that structural and sociocultural factors related to the resettlement also become critical in shaping refugees' mental health. So far, there is limited empirical evidence to support this claim among resettled refugees. Resettlement contextual factors that influence mental health outcomes were examined using Latino and Asian refugees (n = 656) from a nationally representative survey. Linear and logistic regressions predicted factors associated with the study's outcomes (self-reported mental health, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders). Post-resettlement traumas were significantly associated with mental health outcomes, but pre-resettlement traumas were not. Unemployment, everyday discrimination, and limited English were significantly associated with mental health outcomes among both Latino and Asian refugees. The outcomes indicate that resettlement contextual factors have a significant association with refugees' mental health. Therefore, future studies with refugees must pay closer attention to structural and sociocultural factors after resettlement.",Journal of immigrant and minority health,2016 Aug,United States,2016,10
27621336,Diseases due to unhealthy environments: an updated estimate of the global burden of disease attributable to environmental determinants of health.,"Background: The update of the global burden of disease attributable to the environment is presented. The study focuses on modifiable risks to show the potential health impact from environmental interventions. Methods: Systematic literature reviews on 133 diseases and injuries were performed. Comparative risk assessments were complemented by more limited epidemiological estimates, expert opinion and information on disease transmission pathways. Population attributable fractions were used to calculate global deaths and global disease burden from environmental risks. Results: Twenty-three percent (95% CI: 13-34%) of global deaths and 22% (95% CI: 13-32%) of global disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to environmental risks in 2012. Sixty-eight percent of deaths and 56% of DALYs could be estimated with comparative risk assessment methods. The global disease burden attributable to the environment is now dominated by noncommunicable diseases. Susceptible ages are children under five and adults between 50 and 75 years. Country level data are presented. Conclusions: Nearly a quarter of global disease burden could be prevented by reducing environmental risks. This analysis confirms that eliminating hazards and reducing environmental risks will greatly benefit our health, will contribute to attaining the recently agreed Sustainable Development Goals and will systematically require intersectoral collaboration to be successful.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2017 Sep 1,England,2017,10
31569829,Unequal Protective Effects of Parental Educational Attainment on the Body Mass Index of Black and White Youth.,"BACKGROUND: Parental educational attainment is shown to be protective against health problems; the Minorities' Diminished Returns theory, however, posits that these protective effects tend to be smaller for socially marginalized groups particularly blacks than whites. AIMS: To explore racial differences in the effect of parental educational attainment on body mass index (BMI) in a national sample of US adolescents. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used baseline data of 10,701 (8678 white and 2023 black) 12-17 years old adolescents in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH; 2013). Parental educational attainment was the predictor. Youth BMI (based on self-reported weight and height) was the dependent variable. Age, gender, ethnicity, and family structure were covariates. Race was the focal moderator. RESULTS: Overall, higher parental educational attainment was associated with lower youth BMI. Race, however, moderated the effect of parental educational attainment on BMI, suggesting that the protective effect of parental educational attainment on BMI is significantly smaller for black than white youth. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, race alters the health gains that are expected to follow parental educational attainment. While white youth who are from highly educated families are fit, black youth have high BMI at all levels of parental educational attainment. This means, while the most socially privileged group, whites, gain the most health from their parental education, blacks, the least privileged group, gain the least. Economic, social, public, and health policymakers should be aware that health disparities are not all due to lower socioeconomic status (SES) of the disadvantaged group but also diminished returns of SES resources for them. Black-white health disparities exist across all high socioeconomic status (SES) levels.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 Sep 27,Switzerland,2019,10
24878648,Clinical characteristics of chronic kidney disease of nontraditional causes in Salvadoran farming communities.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease is a serious health problem in El Salvador. Since the 1990s, there has been an increase in cases unassociated with traditional risk factors. It is the second leading cause of death in men aged >18 years. In 2009, it was the first cause of in-hospital death for men and the fifth for women. The disease has not been thoroughly studied. OBJECTIVE: Characterize clinical manifestations (including extrarenal) and pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease of nontraditional causes in Salvadoran farming communities. METHODS: A descriptive clinical study was carried out in 46 participants (36 men, 10 women), identified through chronic kidney disease population screening of 5018 persons. Inclusion criteria were age 18-59 years; chronic kidney disease at stages 2, 3a and 3b, or at 3a and 3b with diabetes or hypertension and without proteinuria; normal fundoscopic exam; no structural abnormalities on renal ultrasound; and HIV-negative. Examinations included social determinants; psychological assessment; clinical exam of organs and systems; hematological and biochemical parameters in blood and urine; urine sediment analysis; markers of renal damage; glomerular and tubular function; and liver, pancreas and lung functions. Renal, prostate and gynecological ultrasound; and Doppler echocardiography and peripheral vascular and renal Doppler ultrasound were performed. RESULTS: Patient distribution by chronic kidney disease stages: 2 (32.6%), 3a (23.9%), 3b (43.5%). Poverty was the leading social determinant observed. Risk factor prevalence: agrochemical exposure (95.7%), agricultural work (78.3%), male sex (78.3%), profuse sweating during work (76.3%), malaria (43.5%), NSAID use (41.3%), hypertension (36.9%), diabetes (4.3%). General symptoms: arthralgia (54.3%), asthenia (52.2%), cramps (45.7%), fainting (30.4). Renal symptoms: nycturia (65.2%), dysuria (39.1%), foamy urine (63%). Markers of renal damage: macroalbuminuria (80.4%), ss2 microglobulin (78.2%), NGAL (26.1%). Renal function: hypermagnesuria (100%), hyperphosphaturia (50%), hypernatriuria (45.7%), hyperkaluria (23.9%), hypercalciuria (17.4%), electrolyte polyuria (43.5%), metabolic alkalosis (45.7%), hyponatremia (47.8%), hypocalcemia (39.1%), hypokalemia (30.4%), hypomagnesemia (19.6%). Imaging: Ultrasound showed fatty liver (93.5%) and vascular Doppler showed tibial artery damage (66.7%). Neurological symptoms: abnormal tendon reflexes (45.6%), Babinski sign and myoclonus (6.5%), sensorineural hearing loss (56.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This chronic kidney disease studied behaves clinically like chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy, but with systemic manifestations not attributable to kidney disease. While male agricultural workers predominated, women and adolescents were also affected. Findings support a hypothesis of multifactorial etiology with a key role played by nephrotoxic environmental agents.",MEDICC review,2014 Apr,United States,2014,10
31419873,The Economics of Personalization in Prevention and Public Health.,"Personalized prevention uses family history and predictive genetic testing to identify people at high risk of serious diseases. The availability of predictive genetic tests is a newer and still-developing phenomenon. Many observers see tremendous potential for personalized prevention to improve public health. At the same time, the emergence of these new markets raises familiar health policy concerns about costs, cost-effectiveness, and health disparities. This paper first discusses an economic framework for the analysis of personalized prevention. On the demand side, consumers use personalized prevention as a form of information that allows them to make better choices about prevention, including medical care and health behaviors like diet and exercise. On the supply side, an interplay of complex market forces and regulations will determine the prices, advertising, and insurance coverage of predictive genetic tests. Beyond the question of whether health insurance will cover the costs of predictive genetic tests, there is a great deal of concern about whether consumers' use of genetic tests might place them at risk of genetic discrimination or might lead to adverse selection. The paper also reports descriptive analysis of data from the 2000, 2005, and 2010 National Health Interview Surveys on the use of predictive genetic tests. The empirical analysis documents large socioeconomic status-related disparities in consumers having heard of genetic tests: for example, consumers with less schooling, Blacks, and Hispanics were substantially less likely to have heard of genetic tests. Evidence from other empirical studies provides little evidence that genetic testing leads to genetic discrimination in insurance markets. There is more evidence suggesting adverse selection, where genetic testing leads consumers to purchase long-term care insurance. The paper concludes with some preliminary thoughts about important directions for future research. The goal of the paper is to review relevant research to help develop an economic approach and social science research agenda into the determinants and consequences of genetic tests for prevention.",Forum for health economics & policy,2013 Sep 1,Germany,2013,10
29202665,The Social Determinants of Refugee Mental Health in the Post-Migration Context: A Critical Review.,"With the global increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers, mental health professionals have become more aware of the need to understand and respond to the mental health needs of forced migrants. This critical review summarizes the findings of recent systematic reviews and primary research on the impact of post-migration conditions on mental disorders and PTSD among refugees and asylum seekers. Historically, the focus of mental health research and interventions with these populations has been on the impact of pre-migration trauma. Pre-migration trauma does predict mental disorders and PTSD, but the post-migration context can be an equally powerful determinant of mental health. Moreover, post-migration factors may moderate the ability of refugees to recover from pre-migration trauma. The importance of post-migration stressors to refugee mental health suggests the need for therapeutic interventions with psychosocial elements that address the broader conditions of refugee and asylum seekers' lives. However, there are few studies of multimodal interventions with refugees, and even fewer with control conditions that allow for conclusions about their effectiveness. These findings are interpreted using a social determinants of health framework that connects the risk and protective factors in the material and social conditions of refugees' post-migration lives to broader social, economic and political factors.",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

METHODS: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched to indentify the relevant randomized clinical trials published up April 30(th), 2018. Two reviewers examined study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included clinical trials, individually. Heterogeneity was measured using I-square (I(2)) statistic and Cochran's Q test. Data were pooled the standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size by the random-effect model. RESULTS: 18 trials of 1681 citations were identified to be appropriate for the current meta-analysis. Findings random-effects model indicated that m-health interventions significantly decreased total- (SMD -0.54; 95% CI, -1.05, -0.03) and LDL-cholesterol levels (SMD -0.66; 95% CI, -1.18, -0.15). M-health interventions had no significant effect on triglycerides (SMD -0.14; 95% CI, -0.56, 0.28) and HDL-cholesterol levels (SMD -0.35; 95% CI, -0.81, 0.11). CONCLUSION: Overall, the current meta-analysis demonstrated that m-health interventions resulted in an improvement in total- and LDL-cholesterol, but did not affect triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol levels.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2019 May - Jun,Netherlands,2019,10
25563350,Socioeconomic inequities in health care utilization in China.,"The study assessed the present degree of inequity in health care utilization as well as the contributions of the main determinants in the context of expending health insurance coverage in China. Data were obtained from the 2008 National Health Services Survey (NHSS) in China. A concentration index was used to quantify the degree of income-related inequity in health care utilization. The need-standardized concentration indexes of outpatient care and inpatient care were 0.015 and 0.197, respectively. Income made the largest contribution to inequity favoring the better-off in the use of health care. The impacts of health insurance schemes on overall inequity varied according to the insurance memberships as well as types of services. The study revealed a pro-rich distribution of the probability of health care across income groups in China. Increased financial protection ability of medical insurance system remains a vital cornerstone to tackle the health care utilization inequity.",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,2015 May,China,2015,10
30670400,Integrating Social and Medical Care: Could it Worsen Health and Increase Inequity?,"As a result of a large and compelling body of evidence documenting the impacts of social determinants, such as income and education, on health outcomes, health care systems are beginning to incorporate social and economic risk data into health care delivery decisions. But there is a risk that some of these efforts could worsen health and widen health inequities. We highlight 3 examples- including recent policy changes in Medicaid, social needs, informed risk prediction models, and advances in precision medicine-where the inclusion of social risk information threatens to reduce care quality or health care access for some groups of patients. A new dialog is needed about both the opportunities and potential consequences of bringing information about patients' social circumstances into a market-based health care system.",Annals of family medicine,2019 Jan,United States,2019,10
30159297,A Successful implementation of an idea to a nationally approved plan: Analyzing Iran's National Health Roadmap using the Kingdon model of policymaking.,"Introduction: Hospital beds, human resources, and medical equipment are the costliest elements in the health system and play an essential role at the time of treatment. In this paper, different phases of the NEDA 2026 project and its methodological approach were presented and its formulation process was analysed using the Kingdon model of policymaking. Methods: Iran Health Roadmap (NEDA 2026) project started in March 2016 and ended in March 2017. The main components of this project were hospital beds, clinical human resources, specialist personnel, capital medical equipment, laboratory facilities, emergency services, and service delivery model. Kingdon model of policymaking was used to evaluate NEDA 2026 development and implementation. In this study, all activities to accomplish each step in the Kingdon model was described. Results: The followings were done to accomplish the goals of each step: collecting experts' viewpoint (problem identification and definition), systematic review of the literature, analysis of previous experiences, stakeholder analysis, economic analysis, and feasibility study (solution appropriateness analysis), three-round Delphi survey (policy survey and scrutinization), and intersectoral and interasectoral agreement (policy legislation). Conclusion: In the provision of an efficient health service, various components affect each other and the desired outcome, so they need to be considered as parts of an integrated system in developing a roadmap for the health system. Thus, this study demonstrated the cooperation process at different levels of Iran's health system to formulate a roadmap to provide the necessary resources for the health sector for the next 10 years and to ensure its feasibility using the Kingdon policy framework.",Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,2018,Iran,2018,10
25950574,"Enhancing workplace wellness efforts to reduce obesity: a qualitative study of low-wage workers in St Louis, Missouri, 2013-2014.","INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to examine workplace determinants of obesity and participation in employer-sponsored wellness programs among low-wage workers. METHODS: We conducted key informant interviews and focus groups with 2 partner organizations: a health care employer and a union representing retail workers. Interviews and focus groups discussed worksite factors that support or constrain healthy eating and physical activity and barriers that reduce participation in workplace wellness programs. Focus group discussions were transcribed and coded to identify main themes related to healthy eating, physical activity, and workplace factors that affect health. RESULTS: Although the union informants recognized the need for workplace wellness programs, very few programs were offered because informants did not know how to reach their widespread and diverse membership. Informants from the health care organization described various programs available to employees but noted several barriers to effective implementation. Workers discussed how their job characteristics contributed to their weight; irregular schedules, shift work, short breaks, physical job demands, and food options at work were among the most commonly discussed contributors to poor eating and exercise behaviors. Workers also described several general factors such as motivation, time, money, and conflicting responsibilities. CONCLUSION: The workplace offers unique opportunities for obesity interventions that go beyond traditional approaches. Our results suggest that modifying the physical and social work environment by using participatory or integrated health and safety approaches may improve eating and physical activity behaviors. However, more research is needed about the methods best suited to the needs of low-wage workers.",Preventing chronic disease,2015 May 7,United States,2015,10

27493919,"Is the status of diabetes socioeconomic inequality changing in Kurdistan province, west of Iran? A comparison of two surveys.","BACKGROUND: About 80% of deaths in 350 million cases of diabetes in the world occur in low and middle income countries. The aim of this study was to determine the status of diabetes socioeconomic inequality and the share of determinants of inequalities in Kurdistan Province, West of Iran, using two surveys in 2005 and 2009. METHODS: Data were collected from non-communicable disease surveillance surveys in Kurdistan in 2005 and 2009. In this study, the socioeconomic status (SES) of the participants was determined based on the residential area and assets using principal component analysis statistical method. We used concentration index and logistic regression to determine inequality. Decomposition analysis was used to determine the share of each determinant of inequality. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes expressed by individuals changed from 0.9% (95% CI: 0.6-1.3) in 2005 to 3.1% (95% CI: 2-4) in 2009. Diabetes Concentration Index changed from -0.163 (95% CI: -0.301- -0.024) in 2005 to 0.273 (95% CI: 0.101-0.445) in 2009. The results of decomposition analysis revealed that in 2009, 67% of the inequality was due to low socioeconomic status and 16% to area of residence; i.e., living in rural areas. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of diabetes significantly increased, and the diabetes inequality shifted from the poor people to groups with better SES. Increased prevalence of diabetes among the high SES individuals may be due to their better responses to diabetes control and awareness programs or due to the type of services they were provided during these years.",Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,2016,Iran,2016,10
24383614,Perceived health and gambling behavior of inmates: a review of the literature.,"PURPOSE: An integrative review was conducted to determine perceived health and gambling behavior in incarcerated adults (ages 18-49), measures of perceived health and gambling behavior, and relationships between perceived health and gambling behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Adult inmates report poorer perceived health and increased levels of gambling problems than those who are not incarcerated. No research investigating the relationships between perceived health and gambling among adult inmates was found. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Knowledge of relationships between perceived health and gambling can assist healthcare providers in understanding potential healthcare needs of the inmates and begin treatment while they are still incarcerated. Nurses in settings such as free and private clinics, homeless shelters, churches, and emergency departments need to screen for problem gambling in this population. This will facilitate appropriate referrals and continued treatment as these inmates transition back into society.",Nursing forum,2014 Oct-Dec,United States,2014,10

In this paper we analyse the influence of selected sociodemographic factors on overweight, body weight and height in the Spanish adult population. METHODS: the analysis was conducted in a subsample (25 to 64 years of age) of the ENPE study, a cross-sectional observational study on a random population sample. Information was collected on age, gender, educational level, occupation and place of residence. Social class was coded according to occupation. Individual body weight and height were measured. RESULTS: the prevalence of obesity is higher in men, increases with age and there is an inverse relationship with the level of education and social class. Higher prevalence rates were observed in Asturias, Galicia and in Andalusia. Short stature is more frequent in people with incomplete primary education and low social class, in contrast to high stature, which is also more frequent in the North-East and central regions. Low body weight is less frequent in people with very poor education and low social class. CONCLUSIONS: based on the unequal distribution of overweight and obesity, preventive strategies in Community Nutrition should consider improving the level of nutrition education and literacy of the population, with special emphasis on the most disadvantaged people.",Nutricion hospitalaria,2018 Jun 4,Spain,2018,10

26917239,The impact of a conditional cash transfer programme on determinants of child health: evidence from Colombia.,"OBJECTIVE: Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes provide income to low-income families in return for fulfilling specific behavioural conditions. CCT have been shown to improve child health, but there are few systematic studies of their impact on multiple determinants of child health. We examined the impact of a CCT programme in Colombia on: (i) use of preventive health services; (ii) food consumption and dietary diversity; (iii) mother's knowledge, attitudes and practices about caregiving practices; (iv) maternal employment; and (v) women's empowerment. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the quasi-experimental evaluation of the Familias en Accion programme. Children and families were assessed in 2002, 2003 and 2005-06. We applied a difference-in-differences approach using logistic or linear regression, separately examining effects for urban and rural areas. SETTING: Colombia. SUBJECTS: Children (n 1450) and their families in thirty-one treatment municipalities were compared with children (n 1851) from sixty-five matched control municipalities. RESULTS: Familias en Accion was associated with a significant increase in the probability of using preventive care services (OR=1.85, 95 % CI 1.03, 3.30) and growth and development check-ups (beta=1.36, 95 % CI 0.76, 1.95). It had also a positive impact on dietary diversity and food consumption. No effect was observed on maternal employment, women's empowerment, and knowledge, attitudes and practices about caregiving practices. Overall, Familias en Accion's impact was more marked in rural areas. CONCLUSION: CCT in Colombia increase contact with preventive care services and improve dietary diversity, but they are less effective in influencing mother's employment decisions, empowerment and knowledge of caregiving practices.",Public health nutrition,2016 Oct,England,2016,10
29144416,Environmental Risks Associated with Symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infection among Preschool Children in North-Western and South-Southern Nigeria Communities.,"The exposure-disease-stress model places young children in their physical and social contexts and considers the extent and intensity of associational links to symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI), taking in to account a range of biological, social, and environment components. This study uses the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey to assess the individual and environmental risks present in the North-Western and South-Southern Nigerian communities and examines their associations with ARI symptoms. The descriptive findings show that the prevalence of ARI symptoms is significantly higher among preschool children in the North-Western province (5.7%) than in the South-Southern province (1.4%) (p < 0.001). In addition to regional differences, multilevel logistic models further indicate that the increased likelihood of a child suffering from ARI symptoms is significantly associated with the dry season (aOR 1.42; 95% CI: 1.02-1.97) and household poverty (aOR 1.42; 95% CI: 1.01-1.99), even after adjusting for the cooking fuel used and various other characteristics of the children, households, and communities. These findings underscore the importance of taking into account environmental risks when addressing specific regional variations in ARI symptoms, because these determinants differ between communities in Nigeria. As it is imperative to achieve minimum levels of child health, in order to improve economic development across regions, future health policies aiming to promote child health will benefit from taking a region-specific perspective into consideration.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2017 Nov 16,Switzerland,2017,10
20919504,[Psychological determinants of quality of life in women diagnosed with depressive disorders].,"UNLABELLED: The essential element of the functioning of patients is the assessment of quality of life and its determinants. Taking into account the depression process and its specific nature this seems to be of special importance. AIM: The aim of this paper was the assessment of importance of psychological determinants of quality of life in women with depressive disorders. METHODS: The tests were carried out on the basis of the analysis of medical documentation, including the psychiatric records. The following criteria were measured: depression level (Beck Hopelessness Scale), quality of life (The Life Satisfaction Questionnaire FLZ according to Fahrenberg), personality model (NEO Five-Factor Inventory), optimism (The Life Orientation Test-Revised LOT-R by M. Scheier, ChS. Carver and M. Bridges adapted by R. Poprawa and Z. Juczynski), purpose in life (The Purpose-in-Life Test developed by Crumbaugh and Maholick according to the authorised translation by Z. Pluzek), social support (The Social Support Questionnaire by Sommer G, Fydrich T, 1989 adapted by Z. Juczynski), health satisfaction (General Health Questionnaire GHQ 28 by David Goldberg). Women diagnosed with depressive disorders were qualified for testing. The tested group of women included 80 patients in the age bracket of 40 to 60 years from the Outpatient Department of Mental Health, Regional Specialised Hospital in Zgierz. The reference group consisted of 30 women showing no symptoms of depressive disorders. RESULTS: The statistical analysis of variables taken into account in the tests showed essential statistical differences between the compared groups with regard to almost all parameters. Significant differences were found in respect of life satisfaction, personality variables, social support, health satisfaction and purpose in life. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results showed significant differences regarding the assessment of quality of life between the group of women with depressive disorders and the group of women without any symptoms of such disorders in respect of the tested psychological determinants. The only exception was the ""parent-child relationship satisfaction"" where no differences were found.",Psychiatria polska,2010 Jul-Aug,Poland,2010,10
21962926,"Validation of Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) with other venous severity assessment tools from the American Venous Forum, National Venous Screening Program.","BACKGROUND: Several standard venous assessment tools have been used as independent determinants of venous disease severity, but correlation between these instruments as a global venous screening tool has not been tested. The scope of this study is to assess the validity of Venous Clinical Severity Scoring (VCSS) and its integration with other venous assessment tools as a global venous screening instrument. METHODS: The American Venous Forum (AVF), National Venous Screening Program (NVSP) data registry from 2007 to 2009 was queried for participants with complete datasets, including CEAP clinical staging, VCSS, modified Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life (CIVIQ) assessment, and venous ultrasound results. Statistical correlation trends were analyzed using Spearman's rank coefficient as related to VCSS. RESULTS: Five thousand eight hundred fourteen limbs in 2,907 participants were screened and included CEAP clinical stage C0: 26%; C1: 33%; C2: 24%; C3: 9%; C4: 7%; C5: 0.5%; C6: 0.2% (mean, 1.41 +/- 1.22). VCSS mean score distribution (range, 0-3) for the entire cohort included: pain 1.01 +/- 0.80, varicose veins 0.61 +/- 0.84, edema 0.61 +/- 0.81, pigmentation 0.15 +/- 0.47, inflammation 0.07 +/- 0.33, induration 0.04 +/- 0.27, ulcer number 0.004 +/- 0.081, ulcer size 0.007 +/- 0.112, ulcer duration 0.007 +/- 0.134, and compression 0.30 +/- 0.81. Overall correlation between CEAP and VCSS was moderately strong (r(s) = 0.49; P < .0001), with highest correlation for attributes reflecting more advanced disease, including varicose vein (r(s) = 0.51; P < .0001), pigmentation (r(s) = 0.39; P < .0001), inflammation (r(s) = 0.28; P < .0001), induration (r(s) = 0.22; P < .0001), and edema (r(s) = 0.21; P < .0001). Based on the modified CIVIQ assessment, overall mean score for each general category included: Quality of Life (QoL)-Pain 6.04 +/- 3.12 (range, 3-15), QoL-Functional 9.90 +/- 5.32 (range, 5-25), and QoL-Social 5.41 +/- 3.09 (range, 3-15). Overall correlation between CIVIQ and VCSS was moderately strong (r(s) = 0.43; P < .0001), with the highest correlation noted for pain (r(s) = 0.55; P < .0001) and edema (r(s) = 0.30; P < .0001). Based on screening venous ultrasound results, 38.1% of limbs had reflux and 1.5% obstruction in the femoral, saphenous, or popliteal vein segments. Correlation between overall venous ultrasound findings (reflux + obstruction) and VCSS was slightly positive (r(s) = 0.23; P < .0001) but was highest for varicose vein (r(s) = 0.32; P < .0001) and showed no correlation to swelling (r(s) = 0.06; P < .0001) and pain (r(s) = 0.003; P = .7947). CONCLUSIONS: While there is correlation between VCSS, CEAP, modified CIVIQ, and venous ultrasound findings, subgroup analysis indicates that this correlation is driven by different components of VCSS compared with the other venous assessment tools. This observation may reflect that VCSS has more global application in determining overall severity of venous disease, while at the same time highlighting the strengths of the other venous assessment tools.",Journal of vascular surgery,2011 Dec,United States,2011,10
27521205,Using the Grade Approach to Support the Development of Recommendations for Public Health Interventions in Radiation Emergencies.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) guideline development policy requires that WHO guidelines be developed in a manner that is transparent and based on all available evidences, which must be synthesised and formally assessed for quality. To fulfil this requirement, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach of rating quality of evidence and grading strength of recommendations was applied when developing the WHO recommendations on public health interventions in radiation emergencies. The guideline development group (GDG) formulated 10 PICO (P: population; I: intervention; C: comparator; O: outcomes) questions to guide the development of recommendations on response interventions during the early/intermediate and late emergency phases and on risk communications for mitigating psycho-social impact of radiation emergencies. For each PICO question, an extensive evidence search and systematic review was conducted.

29608864,Structural Determinants and Children's Oral Health: A Cross-National Study.,"Much research on children's oral health has focused on proximal determinants at the expense of distal (upstream) factors. Yet, such upstream factors-the so-called structural determinants of health-play a crucial role. Children's lives, and in turn their health, are shaped by politics, economic forces, and social and public policies. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between children's clinical (number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth) and self-reported oral health (oral health-related quality of life) and 4 key structural determinants (governance, macroeconomic policy, public policy, and social policy) as outlined in the World Health Organization's Commission for Social Determinants of Health framework. Secondary data analyses were carried out using subnational epidemiological samples of 8- to 15-y-olds in 11 countries ( N = 6,648): Australia (372), New Zealand (three samples; 352, 202, 429), Brunei (423), Cambodia (423), Hong Kong (542), Malaysia (439), Thailand (261, 506), United Kingdom (88, 374), Germany (1498), Mexico (335), and Brazil (404). The results indicated that the type of political regime, amount of governance (e.g., rule of law, accountability), gross domestic product per capita, employment ratio, income inequality, type of welfare regime, human development index, government expenditure on health, and out-of-pocket (private) health expenditure by citizens were all associated with children's oral health. The structural determinants accounted for between 5% and 21% of the variance in children's oral health quality-of-life scores. These findings bring attention to the upstream or structural determinants as an understudied area but one that could reap huge rewards for public health dentistry research and the oral health inequalities policy agenda.",Journal of dental research,2018 Sep,United States,2018,10

22971859,The utilization of health care services and their determinants among the elderly population of Dhulikhel municipality.,"BACKGROUND: Population ageing is a common problem faced in many countries world-wide. Due to physiological and biochemical changes in the elderly, increased incidence of diseases is observed. There is often low use of health services by the elderly for a variety of reasons. OBJECTIVE: To examine the status of health care utilization and to determine the factors associated with utilization of health care among the elderly population of Dhulikhel Municipality. METHODS: A quantitative descriptive-cross sectional study, with a total number of 200 elderly people residing in Dhulikhel Municipality, was selected for the study. Data were collected across the months of June - July 2011 applying two-staged cluster and systematic random sampling method. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were measured. RESULTS: Sixty eight percent of the elderly visited medical personnel in the past year. Eight percent of them visited the emergency department where most of them reported with symptoms attributed to heart disease. Among 200 elderly, 12.5% of them were admitted to the hospital and 53.0% utilized diagnostic services. Age, marital status, activities of daily living, and regular medication showed significant association with health services utilization at 95% level of confidence (p >0.05). CONCLUSION: Marital status, daily living habits, existence of chronic disease, and regular medication demonstrated significant association with the utilization of health care. Social support services, informal education, and awareness programs targeting the senior citizens and studies covering a diverse population are recommended.",Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ),2012 Jan-Mar,Nepal,2012,10
30800989,Social Determinants of Health Curriculum Integrated Into a Core Emergency Medicine Clerkship.,"Introduction: Demand that health centers address health inequities has led medical schools to emphasize social determinants of health (SDH). The Emergency Department often serves as first (or sole) point of health care access, making it an ideal environment in which to identify/explore SDH. Yet there are few SDH curricula targeting core emergency medicine (EM) clerkships. We describe implementation and outcomes of a three-part SDH curriculum instituted in a 4-week EM clerkship. Methods: We created a longitudinal curriculum aimed at fourth-year medical students in their EM clerkship. Students interviewed patients to discuss social and other influences on their health care and wrote reflections. After this, they discussed their individual cases in small groups, selected one patient, and found literature and strategies/systems to fit the patient's needs. Finally, groups presented their work to student-peers and faculty for discussion. Students were assessed for each activity and surveyed for impact of the curriculum. Results: We evaluated the curriculum, with preliminary data showing a wide range of topics covered. On a 5-point scale (1 = Hardly at All, 5 = To a Very High Degree), students responded with means of 4.4 to ""I am able to recognize barriers to health that patients and families face from diverse socio-economic backgrounds"" and 4.6 to ""I feel it is important to recognize and address the social determinants of health as part of whole patient care."" Discussion: This curriculum introduces SDH, uses metacognitive skills across multiple domains, and is feasible and has been well received in an EM clerkship.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2019 Jan 4,United States,2019,10
30425965,"Evaluating Neighborhood Correlates and Geospatial Distribution of Breast, Cervical, and Colorectal Cancer Incidence.","Introduction: Though cancer research has traditionally centered on individual-level exposures, there is growing interest in the geography of both cancer and its risk factors. This geographic and epidemiological research has consistently shown that cancer outcomes and their known causal exposures exhibit geographic variation that coincide with area-level socioeconomic status and the composition of neighborhoods. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate geospatial variation for female breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer incidence in Baltimore City. Materials and Methods: Using a Maryland Cancer Registry dataset of incident breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers (N = 4,966) among Baltimore City female residents diagnosed from 2000 to 2010, spatial and epidemiological analyses were conducted through choropleth maps, spatial cluster identification, and local Moran's I. Ordinary least squares regression models identified characteristics associated with the geospatial clusters. Results: Each cancer type exhibited geographic variation across Baltimore City with the neighborhoods showing high incidence differing by cancer type. Specifically, breast cancer had significant low incidence in downtown Baltimore while cervical cancer had high incidence. The neighborhood covariates associated with the geographic variation also differed by cancer type while local Moran's I identified discordant clusters. Discussion: Cancer incidence varied geographically by cancer type within a single city (county). Small area estimates are needed to detect local patterns of disease when developing health and preventative programs. Given the observed variability of community-level characteristics associated with each cancer type incidence, local information is essential for developing place-, social-, and outcome-specific interventions.",Frontiers in oncology,2018,Switzerland,2018,10
29899056,Health inequalities in hospitalisation and mortality in patients diagnosed with heart failure in a universal healthcare coverage system.,"BACKGROUND: Information regarding the effect of social determinants of health on heart failure (HF) community-dwelling patients is scarce. We aimed to analyse the presence of socioeconomic inequalities, and their impact on hospitalisations and mortality, in patients with HF attended in a universal healthcare coverage system. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study carried out in patients with HF aged >40 and attended at the 53 primary healthcare centres of the Institut Catala de la Salut in Barcelona (Spain). Socioeconomic status (SES) was determined by an aggregated deprivation index (MEDEA). Cox proportional hazard models and competing-risks regression based on Fine and Gray's proportional subhazards were performed to analyse hospitalisations due to of HF and total mortality that occurred between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012. RESULTS: Mean age was 78.1 years (SD 10.2) and 56% were women. Among the 8235 patients included, 19.4% died during the 4 years of follow-up and 27.1% were hospitalised due to HF. A gradient in the risk of hospitalisation was observed according to SES with the highest risk in the lowest socioeconomic group (sHR 1.46, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.68). Nevertheless, overall mortality did not differ among the socioeconomic groups. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of finding a gradient that linked socioeconomic deprivation to an increased risk of hospitalisation, there were no differences in mortality regarding SES in a universal healthcare coverage system.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2018 Sep,England,2018,10
29514755,Fear of violence during armed conflict: Social roles and responsibilities as determinants of fear.,"This article investigates the prevalence and determinants of fear as a consequence of living through armed conflict. We use survey data from Nepal during the armed conflict (1996-2006) to examine how trauma, sex and gender, age, marriage, and household size affect fear of violence. We also disaggregate types of worry, and find substantial variance on whether respondents were more concerned about livelihood consequences of conflict than physical danger. We supplement quantitative analyses with discussion of in-depth interviews from the study area on these same topics. Overall, our results highlight the enduring impact of gender roles in Nepal and that conflict might disproportionately affect those who are already vulnerable and have greater social responsibilities. This article provides a unique comparison between fear of violence during armed conflict in a low-income country to the fear of crime literature based in high-income countries.",Social science research,2018 Mar,United States,2018,10

METHODS: Data of adolescents aged 12-18 years was used from the Taiwan Database of Children and Youth in Poverty (n = 2529). The asset-based index was based on a set of weighted self-reported household conditions using principal components analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to examine the association between these two indices and the mental and physical health outcomes among adolescents. RESULTS: Health outcomes were significantly associated with the asset-based SEP index but not with the monetary index. An increased trend was shown in mental illness symptoms, infections, injuries, allergies and dental problems when the regression was performed in the asset-based SEP index (P < 0.05) but not in the monetary SEP index. CONCLUSIONS: An asset-based SEP index serves as a better index associated with a social gradient in health inequality. To prioritize giving care to people in need, healthcare policymakers should consider including an assessment of household assets and resources, supplementary to the conventional monetary index.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2019 Jan 4,England,2019,10
23456413,Integrating the life course into MCH service delivery: from theory to practice.,"To describe the efforts of a community-based maternal and child health coalition to integrate the life course into its planning and programs, as well as implementation challenges and results of these activities. Jacksonville-Duval County has historically had infant mortality rates that are significantly higher than state and national rates, particularly among its African American population. In an effort to address this disparity, the Northeast Florida Healthy Start Coalition embraced the life course approach as a model. This model was adopted as a framework for (1) community needs assessment and planning; (2) delivery of direct services, including case management, education and support in the Magnolia Project, its federal Healthy Start program; (3) development of community collaborations, education and awareness; and, (4) advocacy and grass roots leadership development. Implementation experience as well as challenges in transforming traditional approaches to delivering maternal and child health services are described. Operationalizing the life course approach required the Coalition to think differently about risks, levels of intervention and the way services are organized and delivered. The organization set the stage by using the life course as a framework for its required local planning and needs assessments. Based on these assessments, the content of case management and other key services provided by our federal Healthy Start program was modified to address not only health behaviors but also underlying social determinants and community factors. Individual interventions were augmented with group activities to build interdependence among participants, increasing social capital. More meaningful inter-agency collaboration that moved beyond the usual referral relationships were developed to better address participants' needs. And finally, strategies to cultivate participant advocacy and community leadership skills, were implemented to promote social change at the neighborhood-level. Transforming traditional approaches to delivering maternal and child health services and sustaining change is a long and laborious process. The Coalition has taken the first steps; but its efforts are far from complete. Based on the agency's initial implementation experience, three areas presented particular challenges: staff, resources and evaluation. The life course is an important addition to the MCH toolbox. Community-based MCH programs should assess how a life course approach can be incorporated into existing programs to broaden their focus, and, potentially, their impact on health disparities and birth outcomes. Some areas to consider include planning and needs assessment, direct service delivery, inter-agency collaboration, and community leadership development. Continued disparities for people of color, despite medical advances, demand new interventions that purposefully address social inequities and promote advocacy among groups that bear a disproportionate burden of infant mortality. Successful transformation of current approaches requires investment in staff training to garner buy-in, flexible resources and the development of new metrics to measure the impact of the life course approach on individual and programmatic outcomes.",Maternal and child health journal,2014 Feb,United States,2014,10
21376271,Are neighborhood sociocultural factors influencing the spatial pattern of gonorrhea in North Carolina?,"PURPOSE: To determine if the spatial pattern of gonorrhea observed for North Carolina was influenced by neighborhood-level sociocultural determinants of health, including race/ethnicity. METHODS: A generalized linear mixed model with spatially correlated random effects was fit to measure the influence of socio-cultural factors on the spatial pattern of gonorrhea reported to the North Carolina State Health Department (January 1, 2005 to March 31, 2008). RESULTS: Neighborhood gonorrhea rates increased as the percent single mothers increased (25th to 75th neighborhood percentile Relative Rate 1.18, 95% CI 1.12, 1.25), and decreased as socioeconomic status increased (Relative Rate 0.89, 95% CI 0.84, 0.95). Increasing numbers of men in neighborhoods with more women than men did not change the gonorrhea rate, but was associated with decreased rates in neighborhoods with more men than women. Living in the mountains was protective for all race/ethnicities. Rurality was associated with decreased rates for Blacks and increased rates for Native Americans outside the mountains. PURPOSE: Neighborhood-level sociocultural factors, primarily those indicative of neighborhood deprivation, explained a significant proportion of the spatial pattern of gonorrhea in both urban and rural communities. Race/ethnicity was an important proxy for social and cultural factors not captured by measures of socioeconomic status.",Annals of epidemiology,2011 Apr,United States,2011,10
27744673,"Unsafe Disposal of Child Faeces: A Community-based Study in a Rural Block in West Bengal, India.","OBJECTIVES: A clean India is the responsibility of all Indians. One of the objectives of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Initiative) is to bring about behavioural changes regarding healthy sanitation practices. While large-scale programs in India have increased latrine coverage, they have to some extent failed to bring behavioural changes ensuring optimal latrine use, including the safe disposal of child faeces, which is a significant source of exposure to faecal pathogens. Hence, this study was done to explore child faeces disposal practices in rural West Bengal and to elicit the determinants of unhygienic faeces disposal. METHODS: Data collection was done using an interview method among the mothers of 502 under-5 children, following a pre-designed, semi-structured schedule during house-to-house visits in a set of villages in the Hooghly district of West Bengal. RESULTS: The prevalence of unsafe disposal of child faeces was 72.4%, and maternal education, per capita income, and water source were found to be significantly associated with unsafe child faeces disposal. CONCLUSIONS: This study draws attention to the unsafe disposal of child faeces in this area of India and raises questions about the efficiency of sanitation campaigns in rural India that focus on expanding coverage rather than emphasizing behavioural changes, which are crucial to ensure the safe disposal of child faeces. Thus, it is urgently necessary to strengthen efforts focusing on behavioural changes regarding the safe disposal of child faeces in order to minimise adverse health outcomes.",Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,2016 Sep,Korea (South),2016,10
25629249,"Analysis of TV, advertising and other behavioral determinants of overweight and obesity in childhood.","Worldwide obesity has reached the proportion of an epidemic. A well-established fact is that nowadays many low-and middle-income countries are facing a ""double burden"" of disease, dealing with under-nutrition on one side, and on the other experiencing a rapid rise in non-communicable disease risk factors such as obesity and overweight, particularly in urban settings. Behavioral components are strongly influencing obesity spread and development, especially when considering TV and advertising. There is, therefore, the need of multi-cultural and cross-cultural research, in order to gain a full understanding of the association between obesity and different risk factors, in different scenarios, providing the best evidence to decision makers, grounding prevention on evidence-based strategies rather than focusing on single factors without the recognition of their mutual influence.",Salud publica de Mexico,2014,Mexico,2014,10
30571821,Survival of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"INTRODUCTION: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) leads to a progressive deterioration of the mus cle function and premature death. There are no longitudinal studies on the course of this pathology in Chile. OBJECTIVE: To determine survival between the years 1993-2013, divided into two periods (1993-2002 and 2003-2013), and the effect of social determinants in patients with DMD admitted in Teleton Institutes of Chile (TI). PATIENTS AND METHOD: Prospective follow-up study in a clinical series of 462 patients with DMD. The information was obtained by searching for patients with DMD in OLAP cube (Online Analytical Processing). From the clinical records of the TI of Santiago, the variables corresponding to the diagnostic method, stage of DMD described in terms of muscle de terioration and function according to Swinyard classification were recorded; existence and type of tests that conclude the diagnosis and, in the cases reported, the existence of family history. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was applied, where global survival was defined between birth and age of death. The determinant factors analyzed were estimated through the Cox-Snell's proportional risk model. RESULTS: Survival at 20 years of age from TI entry was 51.7% (CI95%: 45.1-57.8), 48.5% in the period 1993-2002 and 72.8% between 2003-2013. The percentage of survival at the same age according to socioeconomic status (SES) was 82% in high SES, 67% in middle SES, and 42% in low SES, with a statistically significant difference between high and middle SES in relation to extreme poverty. Ac cording to country areas, the survival was close to 75 % at 17 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The survival information from patients with DMD from childhood to adult life is valuable for predicting the clinical course of the disease with the current medical care. There is evidence of improvement in the probability of survival at the age of 20 and marked inequity according to the socioeconomic variable.",Revista chilena de pediatria,2018 Aug,Chile,2018,10
23863888,Perceived gender inequality in the couple relationship and musculoskeletal pain in middle-aged women and men.,"AIMS: Musculoskeletal pain is a major health problem, especially in women, and is partially determined by psychosocial factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether gender inequality in the couple relationship was related to musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Participants (n=721; 364 women and 357 men) were all individuals living in a couple relationship in the Northern Swedish Cohort, a 26-year Swedish cohort study. Self-administered questionnaire data at age 42 years comprised perceived gender inequality in the couple relationship and musculoskeletal pain (in three locations, summarised into one score and median-split), concurrent demographic factors, psychological distress, and previous musculoskeletal pain at age 30 years. Associations were examined using logistic regression. RESULTS: Gender inequality was positively associated with symptoms of musculoskeletal pain in the total sample, remaining significant after addition of possible confounders and of previous musculoskeletal pain. Separate adjustment for concurrent psychological distress attenuated the association but not below significance. The association was present and of comparable strength in both women and men. CONCLUSIONS: Gender inequality in the couple relationship might contribute to the experience of musculoskeletal pain in both women and men. The results highlight the potential adverse bodily consequences of living in unequal relationships.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2013 Dec,Sweden,2013,10
23815886,Perceptions of the social determinants of health by two groups more and less affiliated with public health in Canada.,"BACKGROUND: Despite strong academic recognition of the SDOH both in Canada and internationally, acknowledgement and uptake of the SDOH in health policy and public consciousness have remained weak. This paper aims to discern reasons for limited action on the SDOH by examining the perceptions of the SDOH held by two groups more and less affiliated with public health in Canada.We conducted formal consultation with group members on their interpretation of the SDOH and their thoughts on the nature and basis of differences between those more and less aligned with the SDOH as a basis for action. Thematic analysis was used to evaluate the views of the two groups. FINDINGS: Group 1 (community/public health workers) felt overwhelmed when confronted with questions regarding action on the SDOH within the context of their professional lives. They suggested an expanded list of health determinants that included factors such as voluntarism and happiness, transcending traditional notions of ""root causes."" Furthermore, they did not articulate value-based reasons why others would oppose the SDOH; rather, in line with their professional roles, they adopted a value-neutral and pragmatic approach to working to improve health. Group 2 (child and youth advocacy organization members) seemed rooted in the 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion framework, with their recommendations aligned with strategies such as building healthy public policy and reorienting health services. Neither group made reference to issues of social justice or inequity when they made suggestions for improving health. CONCLUSIONS: We found that two groups with different affiliations to formal public health could discuss the SDOH without acknowledging the inequitable distribution of power and resources that lies at its root. We also found that those working in public health had difficulty moving beyond individual actions that they or their clients could take to improve health. For a group more focused on advocacy than direct service provision, the Ottawa Charter framework seemed more easily suited to their recommendations for action than suggesting actions that would address the SDOH. Our findings indicate that there remains work to be done in terms of translating the SDOH concept into action in Canada.",BMC research notes,2013 Jul 1,England,2013,10
26500407,Social determinants of health and oral health: An Indian perspective.,"Several conventional approaches have been tried in the past to resolve health inequities in India. However, achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is yet to be fully realized as the benefits have been meager. The recent concept of targeting social determinants of general and oral health in order to achieve health for all has shown positive results in the developed as well as the developing nations. Based on the framework recommended by the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, several policies have been introduced and suitably backed up with the intention of providing health care even to people living in remote sections of the society. This paper intends to highlight the rationale for social determinants approach in Indian context, its application and future recommendations for the same. It is considered as a radical approach, and adequate measures have been implemented by health systems to achieve the desired targets without delay. However, in order to achieve UHC, redistribution of the available resources and converting the ""normative"" needs into ""felt"" needs of the people is going to be an uphill task to accomplish.",Indian journal of occupational and environmental medicine,2015 May-Aug,India,2015,10
26762656,Socioeconomic inequalities and determinants of oral hygiene status among Urban Indian adolescents.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the socioeconomic inequalities in oral hygiene and to explore the role of various socioeconomic and psychosocial factors as determinants of these inequalities among adolescents residing in Delhi National Capital Territory. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1386 adolescents aged 12-15 years from three different socioeconomic groups according to their area of residence (middle-class areas, resettlement colonies and urban slum colonies). Level of oral hygiene was examined clinically using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), and an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to measure key socio-demographic variables and psychosocial and health-related behaviours. Logistic regression analysis tested the association between area of residence and poor oral hygiene. RESULTS: Poor oral hygiene was observed in 50.2% of the adolescents. There was a socioeconomic gradient in poor oral hygiene, with higher prevalence observed at each level of deprivation. These differences were only partly explained, and the differences between adolescent groups remained statistically significant after adjusting for various demographic variables, standard of living, social capital, social support and health-affecting behaviours (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.30-2.76; and OR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.60-3.92 for adolescents from resettlement colonies and urban slums, respectively, than middle-class adolescents). CONCLUSION: Area of residence emerged as a strong socioeconomic predictor of prevalence of poor oral hygiene among Indian adolescents. Various material, psychosocial and behavioural factors did not fully explain the observed inequalities in poor oral hygiene among different adolescent groups.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,2016 Jun,Denmark,2016,10
20843888,Capability and clinical success.,"Better outcomes for chronic diseases remain elusive because success depends on events outside the control of the health care system: patients' ability to mange their health behaviors and chronic diseases. Among the most powerful influences on self-management are the social and environmental constraints on healthy living, yet the clinical response to these environmental determinants is poorly developed. A potential approach for addressing social determinants in practice, as well as planning and evaluating community responses, is the capability framework. Defined as the real opportunity to achieve a desired lifestyle, capability focuses attention on the material conditions that constrain real opportunity and how opportunity emerges from the interaction between personal resources and the social environment. Using examples relevant to chronic disease and behavior change, we discuss the clinical application of the capability framework.",Annals of family medicine,2010 Sep-Oct,United States,2010,10
22973899,An international review of the patterns and determinants of health service utilisation by adult cancer survivors.,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to review factors related to health service utilisation by the increasing number of cancer survivors in order to inform care planning and the organisation and delivery of services. METHODS: Studies were identified via systematic searches of Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Social Science Citation Index and the SEER-MEDICARE library. Methodological quality was assessed using STROBE; and the Andersen Behavioural Model was used as a framework to structure, organise and analyse the results of the review. RESULTS: Younger, white cancer survivors were most likely to receive follow-up screening, preventive care, visit their physician, utilise professional mental health services and least likely to be hospitalised. Utilisation rates of other health professionals such as physiotherapists were low. Only studies of health service use conducted in the USA investigated the role of type of health insurance and ethnicity. There appeared to be disparate service use among US samples in terms of ethnicity and socio-demographic status, regardless of type of health insurance provision s- this may be explained by underlying differences in health-seeking behaviours. Overall, use of follow-up care appeared to be lower than expected and barriers existed for particular groups of cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Studies focussed on the use of a specific type of service rather than adopting a whole-system approach and future health services research should address this shortcoming. Overall, there is a need to improve access to care for all cancer survivors. Studies were predominantly US-based focussing mainly on breast or colorectal cancer. Thus, the generalisability of findings to other health-care systems and cancer sites is unclear. The Andersen Behavioural Model provided an appropriate framework for studying and understanding health service use among cancer survivors. The active involvement of physicians and use of personalised care plans are required in order to ensure that post-treatment needs and recommendations for care are met.",BMC health services research,2012 Sep 13,England,2012,10

This article describes a mixed-methods study examining the content validity and utility for health care providers of a poverty screening tool and companion resource guide for the pediatric palliative care population. The study found high relevance and validity of the tool. Significant barriers to implementing the screening tool in clinical practice were described by participants, including: concerns regarding time required, roles and responsibilities, and discomfort in asking about income. Implications for practice and suggestions for improving the tool are discussed. Screening and attention to the social determinants of health lie within the scope of practice of all health care providers.

29966499,Evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally adapted behavioral family psycho-educational program for Egyptian patients with schizophrenia.,"Although a growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of behavioral family therapies for patients with schizophrenia, few studies have been carried out on the effectiveness of such programs for Egyptian patients. The current study translated and culturally adapted the Behavioral Family Psycho-Education Program (BFPEP) and conducted a preliminary efficacy evaluation for outpatients suffering from schizophrenia. Thirty patients received 14 sessions of culturally adapted Program (CA-BFPEP) and 30 received treatment as usual; all were followed up for 6 months. Pre- and post-intervention assessment included primary outcome measures that assessed the clinical, social, quality of life and attitude towards medications. The CA-BFPEP group demonstrated significant treatment effects as they had greater reductions in psychotic symptoms (PANSS), improvement of social function (SFQ), quality of life (QoL), and attitude towards medications (DAI), compared to patients in the control group. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing family therapy interventions in different cultural settings with relatively minor modifications. These promising findings invite further efforts to maximize the benefits of family therapy interventions internationally and to encourage mental health policy makers to integrate this mode of therapy in routine care management plans for patients with schizophrenia.",Transcultural psychiatry,2018 Oct,England,2018,10
31235363,"Differential associations between everyday versus institution-specific racial discrimination, self-reported health, and allostatic load among black women: implications for clinical assessment and epidemiologic studies.","PURPOSE: Black women have the highest estimated allostatic load (AL). AL and self-perceived health are strong health predictors and have been linked to racial discrimination. Research suggests that everyday and institution-specific racial discrimination may predict different AL and self-reported health (SRH) outcomes. Furthermore, discrepancies between AL and self-perceived health could widen disparities. We estimated associations between everyday versus institution-specific racial discrimination with AL and SRH. METHODS: Data are from a San Francisco Bay Area community sample of 208 black women aged 30-50 years. Participation involved a questionnaire, self-interview, blood draw, and anthropometric measurements. Adjusted generalized linear regression models estimated associations of racial discrimination with AL and SRH. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic position, and medication use, institution-specific discrimination was negatively associated with AL (i.e., better health), whereas everyday experiences showed no association. Those reporting very-high (vs. moderate) institution-specific discrimination had lower AL (beta = -1.31 [95% CI: -2.41, -0.20]; AL range: 0-15). No racial discrimination-SRH association was found. CONCLUSIONS: For black women, (1) institution-specific racial discrimination may be differentially embodied compared with everyday experiences and (2) institutional racism may contribute to physiologic stress-regulation regardless of self-perceived health status. Potential factors that may contribute to an inverse racial discrimination-AL association, and future research, are discussed.",Annals of epidemiology,2019 Jul,United States,2019,10

It details some of the conceptual differences between health literacy and health disparities and explains some similarities that suggest the need for increased research collaboration. The chapter is among the first to address the structural and social determinants of health together and explain that future research needs to assess their interactions. Overall, the chapter creates a conceptual foundation as well as challenges future scholars/practitioners to take more multidimensional approaches to assess health's determinants. The chapter also attempts to demonstrate there is nothing more practical than good theory, or clear conceptual foundations. The chapter is divided into four sections that address the following topics: three conceptual frameworks about the determinants of health; opportunities in health disparities and health literacy research; seeking an expanded, multidimensional conceptual approach to health literacy and health disparities research; as well as a conclusion.

31021133,Motivational and cognitive correlates of community integration in homeless veterans entering a permanent supported housing program.,"Homelessness is a major public health problem, and serious mental illness (SMI) is highly prevalent in the homeless population. Although supported housing services-which provide permanent housing in the community along with case management-improve housing outcomes, community integration typically remains poor, and little is known about the underlying determinants of poor community integration postresidential placement. The general SMI literature has indicated that motivational and cognitive ability factors are key determinants of successful community integration, which provides a foundation for examining this issue. This study evaluated whether interview- and performance-based assessments of motivation, nonsocial and social-cognitive ability, and psychiatric symptoms were associated with community integration indices in 2 samples of homeless veterans either with (N = 96) or without (N = 80) a psychotic disorder who had recently been admitted to a supported housing program but who had not yet attained housing. Motivation indices, including experiential negative symptoms and defeatist performance attitudes, stood out as the most robust correlates (rs = -.30 to -.69) of community integration across both samples, particularly for social role participation. Demographics, general psychiatric symptoms, and nonsocial cognition showed generally weak relations with community integration, though social cognition showed a few relations. The consistent findings across samples point to the importance of motivational factors for understanding the determinants of poor community integration in this complex population. Further, interventions that target motivational challenges may have widespread usefulness for enhancing community integration outcomes beyond obtaining housing.

31738170,Impact of Social Determinants of Health and Demographics on Refill Requests by Medicare Patients Using a Conversational Artificial Intelligence Text Messaging Solution: Cross-Sectional Study.,"BACKGROUND: Nonadherence among patients with chronic disease continues to be a significant concern, and the use of text message refill reminders has been effective in improving adherence. However, questions remain about how differences in patient characteristics and demographics might influence the likelihood of refill using this channel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an SMS-based refill reminder solution using conversational artificial intelligence (AI; an automated system that mimics human conversations) with a large Medicare patient population and to explore the association and impact of patient demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, language) and social determinants of health on successful engagement with the solution to improve refill adherence. METHODS: The study targeted 99,217 patients with chronic disease, median age of 71 years, for medication refill using the mPulse Mobile interactive SMS text messaging solution from December 2016 to February 2019. All patients were partially adherent or nonadherent Medicare Part D members of Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, a large integrated health plan. Patients received SMS reminders in English or Spanish and used simple numeric or text responses to validate their identity, view their medication, and complete a refill request. The refill requests were processed by Kaiser Permanente pharmacists and support staff, and refills were picked up at the pharmacy or mailed to patients. Descriptive statistics and predictive analytics were used to examine the patient population and their refill behavior. Qualitative text analysis was used to evaluate quality of conversational AI. RESULTS: Over the course of the study, 273,356 refill reminders requests were sent to 99,217 patients, resulting in 47,552 refill requests (17.40%). This was consistent with earlier pilot study findings. Of those who requested a refill, 54.81% (26,062/47,552) did so within 2 hours of the reminder. There was a strong inverse relationship (r10=-0.93) between social determinants of health and refill requests. Spanish speakers (5149/48,156, 10.69%) had significantly lower refill request rates compared with English speakers (42,389/225,060, 18.83%; X(2)1 [n=273,216]=1829.2; P<.001). There were also significantly different rates of refill requests by age band (X(2)6 [n=268,793]=1460.3; P<.001), with younger patients requesting refills at a higher rate. Finally, the vast majority (284,598/307,484, 92.23%) of patient responses were handled using conversational AI. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors impacted refill request rates, including a strong association between social determinants of health and refill rates. The findings suggest that higher refill requests are linked to language, race/ethnicity, age, and social determinants of health, and that English speakers, whites, those younger than 75 years, and those with lower social determinants of health barriers are significantly more likely to request a refill via SMS. A neural network-based predictive model with an accuracy level of 78% was used to identify patients who might benefit from additional outreach to narrow identified gaps based on demographic and socioeconomic factors.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2019 Nov 18,Canada,2019,10
21465719,Determinants of condom use in Zambia: a multilevel analysis.,"Research on the determinants of condom use in sub-Saharan Africa has focused on the personal characteristics of individuals and, more recently, on community characteristics such as levels of development and of contraceptive availability. Two additional community characteristics, however--the restraining influence exerted by social networks and traditional community institutions (both theorized to decline with population growth) and the degree of interpersonal communication concerning HIV/AIDS--should also be factored into research. This study uses data from the 2003 Zambia Sexual Behaviour Survey and other surveys to conduct multilevel analyses to assess the influence of each of these various characteristics on condom use in Zambia. The results show that condom use increases with interpersonal communication concerning HIV/ AIDS, community infrastructural development, and access to condoms, and decreases with population growth rate and density. The findings suggest that condom-promotion efforts should be attentive to community-level social norms, population trends, and informal social relationships and interpersonal communication.",Studies in family planning,2010 Mar,United States,2010,10
31700825,The Impact of Socio Economic Factors on the Adherence of Patients with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus to Medical Recommendations.,"Background: Adherence to medical recommendations is very important to control gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as one of the most important disorders during pregnancy. In this study, we explored the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on the adherence of a cohort of GDM in Iran. Methods: In this prospective study, 230 pregnant women with confirmed GDM were followed from Feb to Jun 2013 in a referral diabetic care center in Iran. The SES of subjects were quantified using a combined score generated by principal component analysis (PSA). Medical adherence score of subjects was measured in three follow up visits in a range of 0 to 10 and were linked to SES using linear regression model. Results: The adherence scores women in the first, second, and third follow up visits were 5.06+/-2.12, 5.46+/-2.06, and 5.08+/-1, respectively. Women fourth quartile of SES (the highest level of SES) has a least compliance to medical orders in comparison to first quartile of SES (the lowest level of SES) with the OR -2.75 (95% Cl: -3.17, -2.23). Conclusion: The medical adherence of pregnant women with GDM is significantly poorer in high SES groups. Therefore, as an important determinant, we may target high SES pregnant women to control the adverse effects of the disorder more efficiently.",Iranian journal of public health,2019 Sep,Iran,2019,10

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of a nurse-initiated pain management protocol in patients with musculoskeletal injuries in an ED in Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This pre-post intervention design study was conducted on 240 patients with orthopedic injuries selected through sequential sampling over two phases. The intervention consisted of case study sessions and the implementation of the nurse-initiated pain management protocol. The outcomes were assessed based on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores, the pain management satisfaction questionnaire, the nursing performance checklist and the waiting time evaluation form. RESULTS: The mean pain intensity 30 and 60 min after triage and at discharge decreased significantly in the post-intervention group (p < .001). The patients' satisfaction with pain management (p < .01) and the nurses' performance (p < .001) improved in the post-intervention group. Waiting time: there was a significant reduction in the post-intervention group from the end of triage by the nurse to the visit by the physician, and from patient's arrival in ED to discharge or transferring, and also the time to initial analgesic. CONCLUSIONS: Education based on case study and the implementation of the nurse-initiated pain management protocol resulted in a significant increase in multimodal analgesia administration and a reduction in pain intensity, an increase in patient satisfaction, an improvement in the triage nurses' performance and the reduction of potential delays in pain management while maintaining the safety of patients with musculoskeletal trauma.",Pain management nursing : official journal of the American Society of Pain Management Nurses,2019 Dec,United States,2019,10

Therefore, this study investigates the determinants of life satisfaction among the oldest-old (i.e. individuals aged 80 or over) in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use the 2011/2012 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey data (n = 6530) for this paper. Logistic regression is used to analyse the effects of socio-demographic, economic, health, instrumental activities of daily living, family and community factors on life satisfaction and depression among the oldest-old in China. RESULTS: Our analysis confirms the significance of many factors affecting life satisfaction among the oldest-old in China. Factors that are correlated with life satisfaction include respondent's sex, education, place of residence, self-rated health status, cognitive ability (using mini mental state examination), regular physical examination, perceived relative economic status, access to social security provisions, commercialized insurances, living arrangements, and number of social services available in the community (p<0.05 for all these variables). Although life satisfaction is negatively associated with instrumental activities of daily living (beta = -0.068, 95%CI = -.093-.043), and depression (beta = -0.463, 95%CI = -.644-.282), the overall effect of self-rated health status is positive (p<0.001). This confirms the primacy of health as the determinant of well-being among the oldest-old. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the oldest-old in China rated their life satisfaction as good or very good. Our findings show that health and economic status are by far the most significant predictors of life satisfaction. Our finding on the primacy of health and relative income as determinants of well-being among the oldest-old, and the greater influence of self-rated health status over objective health measures is consistent with the findings of many past studies. Our results suggest that efforts should be directed at enhancing family support as well as health and social service provisions in the community to improve life satisfaction of older people.",PloS one,2017,United States,2017,10
24429135,The Association Between Educational Attainment and Diabetes Among Men in the United States.,"Few studies have examined the relationship between education and diabetes among men in the United States and whether this relationship differs by race/ethnicity. This study examined whether racial disparities in diabetes existed by educational attainment in 336,746 non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic men 18 years of age and older in the United States. Logistic regression models were specified to examine the odds of reporting diabetes by educational attainment. Within race/ethnicity, both White and Hispanic men who had less than a high school education (odds ratio [OR] = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.19, 1.69], and OR = 1.64, 95% CI = [1.22, 2.21], respectively) had consistently higher odds of diabetes than men with a bachelor's degree or higher level of educational attainment. Educational attainment did not appear to be associated with reporting a diagnosis of diabetes in non-Hispanic Black men. Identifying why educational attainment is associated with diabetes outcomes in some racial/ethnic groups but not others is essential for diabetes treatment and management.",American journal of men's health,2014 Jul,United States,2014,10

METHODS: We searched 11 databases for studies addressing ethical, social, and/or cultural issues associated with clinical genetic testing and/or counselling performed in LMICs. Narrative synthesis was employed to analyze findings, and resultant themes were mapped onto the social ecological model (PROSPERO #CRD42016042894). RESULTS: After reviewing 13,308 articles, 192 met inclusion criteria. Nine themes emerged: (1) genetic counseling has a tendency of being directive, (2) genetic services have psychosocial consequences that require improved support, (3) medical genetics training is inadequate, (4) genetic services are difficult to access, (5) social determinants affect uptake and understanding of genetic services, (6) social stigma is often associated with genetic disease, (7) family values are at risk of disruption by genetic services, (8) religious principles pose barriers to acceptability and utilization of genetic services, and (9) cultural beliefs and practices influence uptake of information and understanding of genetic disease. CONCLUSION: We identified a number of complex and interrelated ethical, cultural, and social issues with implications implications for further development of genetic services in LMICs.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2018 Aug 3,United States,2018,10
25500994,Manifestations of integrated public health policy in Dutch municipalities.,"Integrated public health policy (IPHP) aims at integrating health considerations into policies of other sectors. Since the limited empirical evidence available may hamper its further development, we systematically analysed empirical manifestations of IPHP, by placing policy strategies along a continuum of less-to-more policy integration, going from intersectoral action (IA) to healthy public policy (HPP) to health in all policies (HiAP). Our case study included 34 municipal projects of the Dutch Gezonde Slagkracht Programme (2009-15), which supports the development and implementation of IPHP on overweight, alcohol and drug abuse, and smoking. Our content analysis of project application forms and interviews with all project leaders used a framework approach involving the policy strategies and the following policy variables: initiator, actors, policy goals, determinants and policy instruments. Most projects showed a combination of policy strategies. However, manifestations of IPHP in overweight projects predominantly involved IA. More policy integration was apparent in alcohol/drugs projects (HPP) and in all-theme projects (HiAP). More policy integration was related to broad goal definitions, which allowed for the involvement of actors representing several policy sectors. This enabled the implementation of a mix of policy instruments. Determinants of health were not explicitly used as a starting point of the policy process. If a policy problem justifies policy integration beyond IA, it might be helpful to start from the determinants of health (epidemiological reality), systematically transform them into policy (policy reality) and set broad policy goals, since this gives actors from other sectors the opportunity to participate.",Health promotion international,2016 Jun,England,2016,10
27643696,Ethnic and Gender Disparities in Premature Adult Mortality in Belize 2008-2010.,"BACKGROUND: Data on disparities in mortality within low and middle income countries are limited, with little published data from the Caribbean or Central America. Our aim was to investigate disparities in overall and cause specific premature adult mortality in the multi-ethnic middle income country of Belize. METHODS: Mortality data from Belize 2008-2010 classified using the International Classification of Diseases 10 and the 2010 census stratified by age and ethnicity were used to calculate age, sex, and ethnic specific mortality rates for those 15-59 years, and life table analysis was used to estimate the probability of death between the ages of 15 and 59 (45q15). RESULTS: The probability of death among those aged 15 to 59 years was 18.1% (women 13.5%, men 22.7%). Creole and Garifuna ethnic groups have three times the 45q15 probability of death compared to Mayan and Mestizo groups (Creole 31.2%, Garifuna 31.1%, Mayan 10.2%, Mestizo 12.0%). This pattern of ethnic disparity existed in both sexes but was greater in men. The probability of death from injuries was 14.8% among Creole men, more than twice the rate of other ethnicities and peaks among young Creole men. These deaths are dominated by homicides and unspecified deaths involving firearms. CONCLUSIONS: Marked disparities in mortality between ethnic groups exist in this Central American/Caribbean country, from rates that are typical of high-income countries to those of low-income countries. The pattern of these extreme differences likely suggests that they reflect underlying social determinants rooted in the country's colonial past.",PloS one,2016,United States,2016,10

29570833,Online Information Sharing About Risks: The Case of Organic Food.,"Individuals have to make sense of an abundance of information to decide whether or not to purchase certain food products. One of the means to sense-making is information sharing. This article reports on a quantitative study examining online information sharing behavior regarding the risks of organic food products. An online survey among 535 respondents was conducted in the Netherlands to examine the determinants of information sharing behavior, and their relationships. Structural equation modeling was applied to test both the measurement model and the structural model. Results showed that the intention to share information online about the risks of organic food was low. Conversations and email were the preferred channels to share information; of the social media Facebook stood out. The developed model was found to provide an adequate description of the data. It explained 41% of the variance in information sharing. Injunctive norms and outcome expectancies were most important in predicting online information sharing, followed by information-related determinants. Risk-perception-related determinants showed a significant, but weak, positive relationship with online information sharing. Implications for authorities communicating on risks associated with food are addressed.",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2018 Sep,United States,2018,10

A key focus of this commentary is to offer an alternative perspective on both studies using our current understanding of the impact of social and structural determinants of health, evidence that policy, systems, and environmental interventions are needed to support behavior change at the individual level, and the significance of examining research from a racial/socioeconomic equity lens. While we strongly agree with Blackburn's conclusion urging the National Institutes of Health to invest in prevention research at a level consistent with its social and economic impact, we encourage the author to move beyond simply underscoring the methodical limitations and failure of the findings of MRFIT compared to the potential of the proposed ""JUMBO"" to consider the contribution of MRFIT to our current understanding of chronic disease prevention and treatment.",American journal of epidemiology,2019 Dec 17,United States,2019,10
29599395,Exploring factors impacting early childhood health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and communities: protocol for a population-based cohort study using data linkage (the 'Defying the Odds' study).,"INTRODUCTION: Empirical evidence on family and community risk and protective factors influencing the comparatively high rates of potentially preventable hospitalisations and deaths among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants and children is limited. As is evidence on geographical variation in these risks. The 'Defying the Odds' study aims to explore the impact of perinatal outcomes, maternal social and health outcomes and level of culturally secure service availability on the health outcomes of Western Australian (WA) Aboriginal infants and children aged 0-5 years. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study combines a retrospective cohort study that uses state-wide linked health and administrative data from 12 data sources for multiple generations within Aboriginal families in WA, with specifically collected survey data from health and social services supporting Aboriginal families in regions of WA. Data sources include perinatal/birth registration, hospital, emergency department, mental health services, drug and alcohol service use, mortality, infectious disease notifications, and child protection and family services. Multilevel regression models will be used to examine the intensity of admissions and presentations, mortality, intensity of long stays and morbidity-free survival (no admissions) for Aboriginal children born in WA in 2000-2013. Relationships between maternal (and grand-maternal) health and social factors and child health outcomes will be quantified. Community-level variation in outcomes for Aboriginal children and factors contributing to this variation will be examined, including the availability of culturally secure services. Online surveys were sent to staff members at relevant services to explore the scope, reach and cultural security of services available to support Aboriginal families across selected regions of WA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approvals have been granted for the study. Interpretation and dissemination are guided by the study team's Aboriginal leadership and reference groups. Dissemination will be through direct feedback and reports to health services in the study and via scientific publications and policy recommendations.",BMJ open,2018 Mar 28,England,2018,10

By increasing world population and water shortage in many countries, SFBW can be used as a permanent water source until the water treatment plant is working. This data article reports the practical method being used for water reuse from SFBW through different method including pre-sedimentation, coagulation and flocculation, second clarification, ultra filtration (UF) and returned settled SFBW to the beginning of water treatment plant (WTP). Also, two coagulants of polyaluminum ferric chloride (PAFCl) and ferric chloride (FeCl3) were investigated with respect to their performance on treated SFBW quality. Samples were collected from Isfahan's WTP in Iran during spring and summer season. The acquired data indicated that drinkable water can be produced form SFBW by applying hybrid coagulation-UF process (especially when PAFCl used as coagulant).",Data in brief,2017 Dec,Netherlands,2017,10
30707731,Private and social time preference for health outcomes: A general population survey in Iran.,"Despite the recent increase in economic evaluations of health care programs in low and middle income countries, there is still a surprising gap in evidence on the appropriate discount rate and the discounting of health outcomes such as quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Our study aimed to calculate the implied time preference rate for health outcomes in Iran and its key determinants. Data were gathered from one family member from each of the 650 households randomly selected in Tehran. The respondents' private and social preferences for health outcomes were calculated using the time trade-off (TTO) technique based on the discounted utility model. We investigated the main assumptions of the discounted utility model through equality of mean comparison, and the association between private time preference and key socio-economic determinants using multilevel regression analysis. The mean and median implied rates were 5.8% and 4.9% for private time preference and 25.6% and 20% for social time preference respectively. Our study confirmed that magnitude, framing and time effects have a significant impact on implied discount rates, which means that the conventional discounted utility model's main assumptions are violated in the Iranian general population. Other models of discounting which apply lower rates for far health outcomes might provide a more sensible solution to discounting health interventions with long-term impacts.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
19653103,Psychological factors discriminating between successful and unsuccessful weight loss in a behavioral exercise and nutrition education treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Psychological and behavioral characteristics that predict success or failure with weight-loss treatments are poorly understood. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether social cognitive theory-based factors discriminate between women who are successful and unsuccessful at weight loss. METHOD: Obese women (BMI = 30 to 45 kg/m(2)) who participated in a treatment of behavioral exercise support counseling and nutrition education were divided into quartiles based on percentage of body weight lost over 6 months. Factors based on social cognitive theory, both at baseline and change over 6 months, and exercise attendance were used to discriminate between the successful (highest quartile, M(change in body weight) = -9.3%; n = 40) and unsuccessful (lowest quartile, M(change in body weight) = 1.9%; n = 37) groups. RESULTS: Stepwise discriminant analyses indicated that body satisfaction and tension (anxiety) scores at baseline, and changes over 6 months in self-regulatory efficacy and body satisfaction, made significant contributions to predicting group membership (64% and 69% of cases were correctly classified, respectively). Attendance percentage of exercise sessions was significantly greater for the successful weight-loss group, and when added as a predictor, changes in self-regulatory efficacy and attendance made a significant contribution to predicting group membership (81% of cases were correctly classified). CONCLUSION: Further research may enable psychological determinants to better guide weight loss theory and treatments.",International journal of behavioral medicine,2010 Sep,England,2010,10
26178206,Examining associations between sexual behaviours and quality of life in older adults.,"BACKGROUND: while sexual behaviours are potentially important for quality of life in older adults, they are under-researched. The current study examined associations between frequency and importance of sexual behaviours and quality of life in older adults. METHOD: one hundred and thirty-three participants (mean 74 years, SD = 7.1) provided information about the frequency with which they participated in six sexual behaviours and the perceived importance of these: touching/holding hands, embracing/hugging, kissing, mutual stroking, masturbating and intercourse. Participants also completed the WHO Quality of Life scale, providing an overall quality of life score, in addition to the domains of physical health, psychological health, social relationships and environment. Participants provided information on their marital status, living arrangements and self-reported health. RESULTS: both the frequency and importance of sexual behaviours were moderately positively correlated with quality of life (r = 0.52 and 0.47, respectively, both P < 0.001). In separate regression analyses, the frequency of sexual behaviours was a significant predictor of quality of life in the social relationships domain (beta = 0.225, P < 0.05), and the importance of sexual behaviours was associated with the psychological domain (beta = 0.151, P < 0.05), independent of the presence of a spouse/partner and self-reported health. CONCLUSIONS: with ageing trends, a broader understanding of the factors that influence quality of life in older adults is increasingly important. The current findings suggest that aspects of sexual behaviour and quality of life were positively associated. Researchers are encouraged to consider aspects of sex and sexuality when exploring determinants of well-being in later life.",Age and ageing,2015 Sep,England,2015,10
30720623,Perceptions of Public Health 3.0: Concordance Between Public Health Agency Leaders and Employees.,"CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND: The newest era of public health, deemed ""Public Health 3.0,"" supports cross-sector collaborations to address social determinants of health. These activities often require collaborations with nontraditional public health entities. As this new era begins, it is important to understand perceptions of the public health workforce with regard to Public Health 3.0. OBJECTIVE: To assess perceptions of support toward Public Health 3.0 activities by the public health workforce, identify characteristics associated with support, and measure concordance in support between agency directors and the general workforce. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study utilizes the 2017 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey to understand support and concordance regarding Public Health 3.0 activities by a nationally representative sample of governmental public health employees. Logistic regression models are used to identify characteristics associated with support of each 3.0 activity and concordance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Governmental public health employees' opinions on how involved their agency should be in the K-12 education system, the economy, the built environment, transportation, housing, social connectedness, and health equity within their jurisdiction and concordance in support of involvement between agency directors and the general workforce. RESULTS: Overall, individual perceptions supporting involvement were highest for health equity and social connectedness and lowest for transportation. Supervisory status, education, and being at a local health department were associated with greater odds of supporting all 3.0 activities. Concordance with agency directors was greatest among other executives relative to nonsupervisors. CONCLUSIONS: There is overall generally high support of many 3.0 activities, but there are gaps in agreement by supervisory status, gender, race/ethnicity, education, role type, and jurisdiction. Findings may help support agency leaders in better communicating the role of their agencies in Public Health 3.0 activities, and workforce education regarding such activities may be necessary for the success of Public Health 3.0's success.",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,2019 Mar/Apr,United States,2019,10
26537480,"Low utilization of postnatal care: searching the window of opportunity to save mothers and newborns lives in Islamabad capital territory, Pakistan.","BACKGROUND: Each year an estimated 289,000 maternal deaths occur worldwide; of which 50 % of maternal deaths occur around labor, delivery and immediate postpartum period. Postnatal care (PNC) is crucial but relatively neglected component in the continuum of care, and hence a missing link toward safe motherhood. Despite the significant improvement in child health and safe motherhood interventions, maternal mortality ratio, perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality still remain a challenge in achieving the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 in Pakistan. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross sectional study carried out in the four union councils of Islamabad capital territory, to understand the determinants of postnatal health care seeking. The study sample comprised 225 postpartum women with a child 0 to 1 month of age, and the health care providers from both public and private sector. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. One focus group discussion with health care providers was conducted, using open ended questions guide. RESULTS: Only 30 % women received PNC; amongst which 68 % went to a government health facility. According to the health service providers, 90 % women are not interested in PNC, and that is because they lack awareness, face mobility and transportation issues, and cannot afford the cost of health care. Besides many other determinants, women's education was significantly associated with the PNC utilization. CONCLUSION: More robust and culturally sensitive campaign on importance of PNC must be thought out by the national MNCH program to inform the less literate and peri urban inhabitants of Islamabad. Health providers ought to be sensitized and trained for promoting PNC to save maternal and newborn lives.",BMC research notes,2015 Nov 4,England,2015,10
30939787,Gendered Working Environments as a Determinant of Mental Health Inequalities: A Protocol for a Systematic Review.,"Both gender and employment are critical and intersecting social determinants of mental and physical health. This paper describes the protocol used to conduct a systematic literature review of the relationship between ""gendered working environments"" and mental health. Gendered working environments (GWE) are conceptualised as involving: (1) differences in selection into work, and more specifically, occupations; (2) variation in employment arrangements and working hours; (3) disparities in psychosocial exposures at work, and; (4) differences in selection out of work. Methods/design: The review will adhere to a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search procedure. Key words will be identified that are specific to each of the four domains of GWE. The databases used for the search will be Scopus, Pubmed, Proquest, and Web of Science. Keywords will be adapted for the specific requirements of each electronic database. Inclusion criteria are: Using a validated scale to measure mental health (outcome); including exposures related to the four domains of GWE; reporting estimates for both men and women; and use of a cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional design. Studies will be excluded if they were published more than 10 years ago, are not in English or do not present extractable data on the relationship between GWE and mental health. Discussion: The proposed review will provide evidence about the numerous and complex ways in which employment and gender intersect (and are reinforced) to influence mental health over the life course.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 Apr 1,Switzerland,2019,10
29016702,A Commentary on the Limits of Alcoholic Beverage Policies.,"Providing one set of policy measures for all countries as if they were a single, homogeneous entity does not appear to be evidence-based, according to recent research on the effectiveness of alcoholic beverage control policies. Contextual and cultural determinants-social, economic, demographic, cultural and political-appear to be major factors of influencing change in drinking trends, drinking patterns and drinking-related harms. The variable interplay between contextual determinants and alcohol control policy measures implies diverse impacts on consumption and harm according to time, and to the different countries and groups of countries. In addition, epidemiology research manifests some limitations when applied to alcohol drinking and results are transferred from one culture to another. The conditions of individual cultures and countries should be considered when planning and evaluating alcohol control policies.","Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)",2017 Nov 1,England,2017,10
25226107,Food security: who is being excluded? A case of older people with dementia in long-term care homes.,"OBJECTIVES: PURPOSE: To explore the extent of food security among older people, particularly those with cognitive impairments residing in Canadian long-term care homes (LTCHs) through a focused review of literature. METHOD: Databases including Medline, Nursing and Health Sciences (SAGE), Psych Info, Social Sciences Abstract, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and HealthSTAR were searched for peer-reviewed articles related to food experiences of older individuals in industrialized countries including Canada. Only articles that were published in English between 1997-2012 were included. RESULTS: Sixty two studies met the inclusion criteria. Of those 17 focused on older adults in LTCHs. The review found that food security has rarely been examined among older persons living in LTCHs, and has never been examined within the context of cognitive impairment. While a few studies have focused on residents' satisfaction with foods that are provided to them in LTCHs, none have explored the extent of food security in this population. Furthermore, food satisfaction surveys in the LTCH are limited to the assessment of foods that are served to residents, and do not capture residents' food accessibility beyond the food dispensing routines of the organization. Thus, food quality, food preferences, and the traditional meanings and rituals associated with food consumption are not purposefully evaluated. In addition, LTCHs are not required to monitor residents' food satisfaction using a consistent, regular, and standardized approach and there is no regulation in the LTCH Act that requires LTCHs to assess their residents' food security. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the need for: 1) expansion of food security research to non-community-based settings including LTCHs; 2) re-conceptualization of food security and modification of measurement tools to assess the extent and determinants of food security among older adults in LTCHs; 3) mandatory monitoring of food security via standardized and regular surveys tailored to meet the unique preferences and needs of the older population, particularly those with dementia; and 4) education of healthcare professionals regarding food security and its assessment in LTCHs.","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2014 Jul,France,2014,10

24511516,Long term outcomes after pediatric liver transplantation.,"Long term outcomes after liver transplantation are major determinants of quality of life and of the value of this heroic treatment. As short term outcomes are excellent, our community is turning to take a harder look at long term outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to review these outcomes, and highlight proposed treatments, as well as pressing topics needing to be studied. A systemic review of the English literature was carried in PubMed, covering all papers addressing long term outcomes in pediatric liver transplant from 2000-2013. Late outcomes after pediatric liver transplant affect the liver graft in the form of chronic liver dysfunction. The causes include rejection particularly humoral rejection, but also de novo autoimmune hepatitis, and recurrent disease. The metabolic syndrome is a major factor in long term cardiovascular complication risk. Secondary infections, kidney dysfunction and malignancy remain a reality of those patients. There is growing evidence of late cognitive and executive function delays affecting daily life productivity as well as likely adherence. Finally, despite a good health status, quality of life measures are comparable to those of children with chronic diseases. Long term outcomes are the new frontier in pediatric liver transplantation. Much is needed to improve graft survival, but also to avoid systemic morbidities from long term immunosuppression. Quality of life is a new inclusive measure that will require interventions and innovative approaches respectful not only on the patients but also of their social circle.","Pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology & nutrition",2013 Dec,Korea (South),2013,10
26264235,Geographic Disparities in Access to Agencies Providing Income-Related Social Services.,"Geographic location is an important factor in understanding disparities in access to health-care and social services. The objective of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate disparities in the geographic distribution of income-related social service agencies relative to populations in need within Boston. Agency locations were obtained from a comprehensive database of social services in Boston. Geographic information systems mapped the spatial relationship of the agencies to the population using point density estimation and was compared to census population data. A multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate factors associated with categories of income-related agency density. Median agency density within census block groups ranged from 0 to 8 agencies per square mile per 100 population below the federal poverty level (FPL). Thirty percent (n = 31,810) of persons living below the FPL have no access to income-related social services within 0.5 miles, and 77 % of persons living below FPL (n = 83,022) have access to 2 or fewer agencies. 27.0 % of Blacks, 30.1 % of Hispanics, and 41.0 % of non-Hispanic Whites with incomes below FPL have zero access.

24976348,Determinants of career satisfaction among pediatric hospitalists: a qualitative exploration.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize determinants of career satisfaction among pediatric hospitalists working in diverse practice settings; to develop a framework to conceptualize factors influencing career satisfaction. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with community and tertiary care hospitalists, using purposeful sampling to attain maximum response diversity. We used closed- and open-ended questions to assess levels of career satisfaction and its determinants. Interviews were conducted by telephone, recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Emergent themes were identified and analyzed using an inductive approach to qualitative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 30 interviews were conducted with community and tertiary care hospitalists, representing 20 hospital medicine programs and 7 Northeastern states. Qualitative analysis yielded 657 excerpts, which were coded and categorized into 4 domains and associated determinants of career satisfaction: 1) professional responsibilities; 2) hospital medicine program administration; 3) hospital and health care systems; and 4) career development. Although community and tertiary care hospitalists reported similar levels of career satisfaction, they expressed variation in perspectives across these 4 domains. Although the role of hospital medicine program administration was consistently emphasized by all hospitalists, community hospitalists prioritized resource availability, work schedule, and clinical responsibilities, while tertiary care hospitalists prioritized diversity in nonclinical responsibilities and career development. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate how hospitalists in different organizational settings prioritize both consistent and unique determinants of career satisfaction. Given associations between physician satisfaction and health care quality, efforts to optimize modifiable factors within this framework, at both community and tertiary care hospitals, may have broad impacts.",Academic pediatrics,2014 Jul-Aug,United States,2014,10
29095995,Interventions to improve social determinants of health among elderly ethnic minority groups: a review.,"Background: Like the European general population, ethnic minorities are aging. In this group, important social determinants of health (social participation, social isolation and loneliness) that lead to negative health outcomes frequently occur. Interventions targeting these determinants may decrease negative health outcomes. The goal of this article was to identify effective interventions that improve social participation, and minimise social isolation and loneliness in community dwelling elderly ethnic minorities. Methods: An electronic database (PubMed) was systematically searched using an extensive search strategy, for intervention studies in English, French, Dutch of German, without time limit. Additional articles were found using references. Articles were included if they studied an intervention aimed to improve social participation or minimise social isolation or loneliness and were focusing on community dwelling elderly ethnic minorities. Data regarding studies characteristics and results were extracted. Results: Six studies (three randomized controlled trials, three non-controlled intervention studies) were included in the review. All studies were group-based interventions and had a theoretical basis. Five out of six studies showed improvement on a social participation, -isolation or loneliness outcome. Type of intervention included volunteering-, educational- and physical activities. In three studies active participation of the participant was required, these interventions were not more effective than other interventions. Conclusion: Some interventions improved the included social determinants of health in community dwelling elderly ethnic minorities. Investment in further development and implementation of these interventions may help to improve social determinants of health in these populations.

METHODS.: A population sample of N = 2,675 women aged 17-67 years from Qazvin City of Iran and two clinical population samples (women with sexual dysfunctions N = 295 and women with type 2 diabetes N = 449) participated in the study. A self-constructed demographic questionnaire, the SQOL-F, the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) were used for data collection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.: Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were examined. Correlations between the SQOL-F, SF-36, and FSFI were assessed with convergent validity. Furthermore, known-groups comparison analysis was conducted to compare differences in SQOL-F scores between healthy women and those with sexual problems and diabetes. Confirmatory factor analysis assessed the factor structure of the SQOL-F. RESULTS.: Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.84 to 0.98. Significant correlations between the SQOL-F, SF-36, and FSFI scores were found (ranging from r = 0.4 to r = 0.72). The SQOL-F scores were significantly different between women with and without a clinical condition (P < 0.05). A unifactorial model provided the best fit to the data. CONCLUSION.: The questionnaire represents a suitable measure to assess sexuality-related quality of life to sexual function in healthy women, as well as in women suffering from a chronic medical condition. Application of the scale to other clinical samples needs to be further explored.",The journal of sexual medicine,2013 Apr,Netherlands,2013,10
30739209,"The association of gastrointestinal cancers (esophagus, stomach, and colon) with solar ultraviolet radiation in Iran-an ecological study.","Iran has variations in the incidence of cancer in its different provinces. Moreover, it is one of the countries with a high incidence of gastrointestinal cancers in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between the incidence of esophageal, stomach, and colon cancers with ultraviolet radiation. This is an ecological study. The age-standardized incidence of cancer from 2004 to 2008 was obtained from the National Cancer Registry of Iran for all provinces. UV index data was taken from the world weather site. The altitude and latitude of cities were obtained from the National Topography Organization. Demographic variables were taken from the STEPS report of the Ministry of Health. In this study, lung cancer were used as the index of the effects of smoking. Data were analyzed using the SPSS22 software and through linear regression. UV emission levels showed a strong negative correlation with the incidence of esophageal and gastric cancers, in both genders, in all years. However, this correlation was stronger in men. UV radiation showed a significant correlation with colon cancer among both genders as well. There was no relation between altitude and incidence of cancer. Linear regression results showed that with a unit increase in UV, the incidence of gastric and esophagus cancers in males decreases by beta = -4.99 and beta = - 3.16 significant coefficients, respectively. Cities with higher levels of UV index have a relatively lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancers. Ultraviolet radiation may act as a protective factor against these cancers.",Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 Feb 9,Netherlands,2019,10
25954041,Behavioral and mechanical determinants of collective subsurface nest excavation.,"Collective construction of topologically complex structures is one of the triumphs of social behavior. For example, many ant species construct underground nests composed of networks of tunnels and chambers. Excavation by these 'superorganisms' depends on the biomechanics of substrate manipulation, the interaction of individuals, and media stability and cohesiveness. To discover principles of robust social excavation, we used X-ray computed tomography to monitor the growth in three dimensions of nests built by groups of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) in laboratory substrates composed of silica particles, manipulating two substrate properties: particle size and gravimetric moisture content. Ants were capable of nest construction in all substrates tested other than completely dry or fully saturated; for a given particle size, nest volume was relatively insensitive to moisture content. Tunnels were deepest at intermediate moisture content and the maximum tunnel depth correlated with measured yield force on small rod-shaped intruders (a proxy for cohesive strength). This implies that increased cohesive strength allowed creation of tunnels that were resistant to perturbation but did not decrease individual excavation ability. Ants used two distinct behaviors to create pellets composed of wetted particles, depending on substrate composition. However, despite the ability to create larger stable pellets in more cohesive substrates, pellet sizes were similar across all conditions. We posit that this pellet size balances the individual's load-carrying ability with the need to carry this pellet through confined crowded tunnels. We conclude that effective excavation of similarly shaped nests can occur in a diversity of substrates through sophisticated digging behaviors by individuals which accommodate both differing substrate properties and the need to work within the collective.",The Journal of experimental biology,2015 May,England,2015,10
26321434,Preventing Cardiovascular and Renal Disease in Canada's Aboriginal Populations.,"Cardiovascular and renal disease are highly prevalent in Canada's Aboriginal population even though rates of cardiovascular disease are falling in the rest of the country. High and rising prevalence rates of diabetes must be addressed to impact significantly on global cardiovascular and renal risk. Type 2 diabetes is occurring in Aboriginal youth, putting them at greater risk of long-term complications. The reasons for the sudden upswing in diabetes rates in the past 60 years are a result in large part to social determinants of health, which for Aboriginal people include the multigenerational effects of colonization and consequences of the residential school system. Addressing cardiovascular and renal risk therefore requires the knowledge and skills to implement clinical practice guideline-based interventions, the ability to create culturally safe chronic disease management programs in partnership with Aboriginal communities, and advocacy across sectors for improvements in the social determinants of health.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2015 Sep,England,2015,10
29445671,A seroprevalence and relationship survey of brucellosis between pregnant women and women with spontaneous abortion in Iran.,"Background: Brucellosis is one of the most prevalent diseases common between humans and animals. It is also called Malta fever, Undulant fever and Mediterranean fever. This disease is spread by consuming milk and its unpasteurized derivatives. Clinical symptoms of brucellosis in humans are fever, chills, headache, muscular pain, tiredness, loss of appetite, joint pain, weight loss, constipation, sore throat, and dry cough. The present study aimed at surveying the seroprevalence of brucellosis in pregnant women and those women who suffered from spontaneous abortion. Methods: This case- control study was conducted in Sanandaj (Iran) in 2016 and included 2 groups of pregnant women: one group included 160 pregnant women and the other included 160 women who suffered from spontaneous abortion. Then, the participants were asked to fill out the questionnaire. After receiving permission from an obstetrician, a 10-cc blood sample was taken from each person to be used in the Rose Bengal, Wright, 2ME, and Coombs tests. Independent samples t test and Chi-square test were used to analyze the data and compare the groups. Results: Mean+/-SD age of women in the case group was 30.9+/-7.3 years, while it was 27.74+/-5.41 years in control women. The Rose Bengal, Wright, and 2ME prevalence for both groups was negative, but the Coombs and Wright tests score was 33 (20.6%) in pregnant women and it was 27 (16.9%) in women who experienced spontaneous abortion. No meaningful relationship was observed between spontaneous abortion and brucellosis (p= 0.39). Conclusion: Even though the present study did not find a meaningful relationship between spontaneous abortion and brucellosis (p=0.39), high brucella seroprevalence rates between both groups of women indicated that screening tests should be considered before gestation as an appropriate therapeutic strategy.",Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,2017,Iran,2017,10
23070757,Policy approaches to address the social and environmental determinants of health inequity in Asia-pacific.,"Asia Pacific is home to over 60% of the world's population and the fastest growing economies. Many of the leadership in the Asia Pacific region is becoming increasingly aware that improving the conditions for health would go a long way to sustaining economic prosperity in the region, as well as improving global and local health equity. There is no biological reason why males born in Cambodia can expect to live 23 years less than males born in Japan, or why females born in Tuvalu live 23 years shorter than females in New Zealand or why non-Indigenous Australian males live 12 years longer than Indigenous men. The nature and drivers of health inequities vary greatly among different social, cultural and geo-political contexts and effective solutions must take this into account. This paper utilizes the CSDH global recommendations as a basis for looking at the actions that are taking place to address the structural drivers and conditions of daily living that affect health inequities in the Asia Pacific context. While there are signs of action and hope, substantial challenges remain for health equity in Asia Pacific. The gains that have been made to date are not equally distributed and may be unsustainable as the world encounters new economic, social and environmental challenges. Tackling health inequities is a political imperative that requires leadership, political courage, social action, a sound evidence base and progressive public policy.",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,2012 Nov,China,2012,10
30880732,"Oral health-related quality of life among elderly patients visiting special clinics in public hospitals in Delhi, India: A cross-sectional study.","Background: Oral health is recognized as an integral component of general health, and poor oral health is reflected in general health and quality of life (QoL). India has seen a profound shift in the elderly population and is currently home to 103.9 million elders. General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) is a self-reported oral health assessment index used in elderly population and has been tested in multiple countries. Objective: The study aimed to assess the oral health-related QoL (OHRQoL) using GOHAI and various factors affecting it, among elderly patients visiting special Sunday geriatric clinics at Delhi public hospitals. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among four purposively selected special geriatric public clinics in Delhi, India, and a convenience sample of 145 elderly patients was obtained. OHRQoL was measured using a prevalidated instrument (GOHAI) along with other variables (sociodemographic factors, self-perceived oral health, utilization of medical/dental services, dental problems in the past 12 months, and prosthetic status/need). Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 21, and descriptive results were obtained. Results: The sample consisted of 66 males (45.5%) and 79 females (55.5%), and around 58% (n = 84) of the participants were illiterate. Around 39% (n = 57) of the elderly had never visited a dentist and 48% (n = 69) were financially dependent (no income) on others. The mean GOHAI score for the population was 26.69 + 4.44 (median = 25, interquartile range = 23-27). GOHAI score was compared for age, oral hygiene practices, dental problems in the past 12 months, self-reported oral health, and prosthetic need, and a statistically significant difference was observed. Conclusions: The current study assessed GOHAI score and highlighted important determinants of OHRQoL in elderly population visiting the special clinics in Delhi. Thus, OHRQoL should be considered as a surrogate measure to clinical oral examination.",Indian journal of public health,2019 Jan-Mar,India,2019,10
30520810,New Educator Roles for Health Systems Science: Implications of New Physician Competencies for U.S. Medical School Faculty.,"To address gaps in U.S. health care outcomes, medical education is evolving to incorporate new competencies, as well as to align with care delivery transformation and prepare systems-ready providers. These new health systems science (HSS) competencies-including value-based care, quality improvement, social determinants of health, population health, informatics, and systems thinking-require formal education and role modeling in both classroom and clinical settings. This is challenging because few faculty had formal training in how to practice or teach these concepts. Thus, these new competencies require both expanding current educators' skills and a new cohort of educators, especially interprofessional clinicians. Additionally, because interprofessional teams are the foundation of many clinical learning environments, medical schools are developing innovative experiential activities that include interprofessional clinicians as teachers. This combination of a relative ""expertise vacuum"" within the current cohort of medical educators and expanding need for workplace learning opportunities requires a reimagining of medical school teachers. Based on experiences implementing HSS curricula at two U.S. medical schools (Penn State College of Medicine and University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, starting in 2013), this Perspective explores the need for new educator competencies and the implications for medical education, including the need to identify and integrate ""new"" educators into the education mission, develop faculty educators' knowledge and skills in HSS, and acknowledge and reward new and emerging educators. These efforts have the potential to better align the clinical and education missions of academic health centers and cultivate the next generation of physician leaders.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2019 Apr,United States,2019,10
31414132,"Association of Rising Violent Crime With Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Risk: Longitudinal Evidence From Chicago, 2014-2016.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal association between rising violent crime and elevated blood pressure (BP). METHODS: We analyzed 217,816 BP measurements from 17,783 adults during a temporal surge in violent crime in Chicago (2014-2016). Serial observations were abstracted from the electronic health record at an academic medical center and paired to the City of Chicago Police Data Portal. The violent crime rate (VCR) was calculated as the number of violent crimes per 1,000 population per year for each census tract. Longitudinal multilevel regression models were implemented to assess elevated BP (systolic BP >/= 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP >/= 90 mm Hg) as a function of the VCR, adjusting for patient characteristics, neighborhood characteristics, and time effects. Secondary dependent measures included elevated heart rate, obesity, missed outpatient appointments, all-cause hospital admissions, and cardiovascular hospital admissions. RESULTS: At baseline, the median VCR was 41.3 (interquartile range: 15.2-66.8), with a maximum rise in VCR of 59.1 over the 3-year surge period. A 20-unit rise in the VCR was associated with 3% higher adjusted odds of having elevated BP (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.06), 8% higher adjusted odds of missing an outpatient appointment (95% CI: 1.03-1.13), and 6% higher adjusted odds of having a cardiovascular-related hospital admission (95% CI: 1.01-1.12); associations were not significant for elevated heart rate and obesity.

28279627,Making New Connections: Insights from Primate-Parasite Networks.,"Social interactions are important in everyday life for primates and many other group-living animals; however, these essential exchanges also provide opportunities for parasites to spread through social groups. Network analysis is a unique toolkit for studying pathogen transmission in a social context, and recent primate-parasite network studies shed light on linkages between behavior and infectious disease dynamics, providing insights for conservation and public health. We review existing literature on primate-parasite networks, examining determinants of infection risk, issues of network scale and temporal dynamics, and applications for disease control. We also discuss analytical and conceptual gaps that should be addressed to improve our understanding of how individual and group-level factors affect infection risk, while highlighting interesting areas for future research.",Trends in parasitology,2017 Jul,England,2017,10
25969705,Innovation of High-risk Infants Follow-up Surveillance System in Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Early childhood development is one of the most social determinants of health that must be notified in order to reducing social gap and inequity. In spite of increasingly developing intensive neonatal care wards and decreasing neonatal mortality rate, there is no follow-up surveillance system to identify high-risk infants (HRI) and their health problems for timely intervention after discharge. This study was carried out to design and pilot high-risk infant follow-ups (HRIFs) surveillance system, in Alzahra Hospital, a tertiary level center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (TUOMS), in 2012-2013. METHODS: In this qualitative research after studying international documents, consensus about criteria of HRIs accomplished by focus group discussion. Then, Delphi agreement technique was used to finalizing assessment timetable. In the second phase, we piloted the designed surveillance system in Alzahra Hospital, a tertiary level center of TUOMS. Pilot study was implemented by follow-up team organized in designed model at the first phase of the study. Then, the findings of the pilot study were being assessed by an expert panel. If the members agreed on made decisions, they were being placed on the agenda of the national committee of development care of newborns for final approval. RESULTS: High-risk infants follow-up surveillance system was designed in following steps: Defining of evidence-based criteria of HRIs, organizing the follow-up team, regulating the organs and neurodevelopment assessment timetable, publishing a health certificate notebook for HRIs, and designing Access database software for data collection, report and evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: We designed and piloted HRIFs surveillance system, so this system was institutionalized in Alzahra Hospital, finally. It can be prepared to apply in the whole country, after detecting the quantitative outcomes and developing the program in East Azarbijan.",International journal of preventive medicine,2015,Iran,2015,10
23220374,Understanding interactions with the food environment: an exploration of supermarket food shopping routines in deprived neighbourhoods.,"Despite a sustained academic interest in the environmental determinants of diet, relatively little is known about the ways in which individuals interact with their neighbourhood food environment and the use of its most important element, the supermarket. This qualitative study explores how residents of deprived neighbourhoods shop for food and how the supermarket environment influences their choices. Go-along interviews were conducted with 26 residents of Sandwell, a uniformly deprived metropolitan borough in the West Midlands, UK. Routine approaches to food shopping are characterised in terms of planning and reliance on the supermarket environment. Four distinct routines are identified: chaotic and reactive; working around the store; item-by-item; and restricted and budgeted. This suggests that residents of deprived neighbourhoods do not have uniform responses to food environments. Responses to supermarket environments appear to be mediated by levels of individual autonomy. A better understanding of how residents of deprived neighbourhoods interact with their food environment may help optimise environmental interventions aimed at improving physical access to food in these places.",Health & place,2013 Jan,England,2013,10

24261614,"Do societal wealth, family affluence and gender account for trends in adolescent cannabis use? A 30 country cross-national study.","AIMS: To examine cross-national changes in frequent adolescent cannabis use (40+ times consumed over life-time at age 15) over time and relate these trends to societal wealth, family affluence and gender. DESIGN: Data from three cycles (2002, 2006, 2010) of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study were used for cross-sectional and trend analyses of adolescent cannabis use. SETTING: Representative surveys in 30 European and North American countries. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 160 606 15-year-old students. MEASUREMENTS: Respondents' life-time cannabis use, demographics, family affluence (FAS) and frequency of peer contacts were measured individually. Indicators of wealth (gross domestic product per capita, GDP) and perceived availability of cannabis were obtained from national public data bases. FINDINGS: The frequency of life-time cannabis use decreased over time among adolescents in Europe and North America, particularly in western European countries and the United States (relative risk (RR) = 0.86: confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.93). This trend was not observed consistently in rapidly developing countries in eastern, central and southern Europe. Over time (2002-10), cannabis use became: (i) less characteristic of high GDP countries in contrast to lower GDP countries (RR = 0.74: CI 0.57-0.95); (ii) less characteristic of youth from high FAS families in contrast to youth from low FAS families (RR = 0.83: CI 0.72-0.96); and (iii) characterized by an increasing gender gap, i.e. consumption was higher among males (RR 1.26: CI 1.04-1.53). Perceived availability of cannabis and peer contacts remained strong predictors of frequent cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: Among 30 European and North American countries, cannabis use appears to have 'trickled down' over time, with developing countries taking on the former (heavier) use pattern of richer countries, and less affluent youth taking on the former (heavier) use pattern of more affluent youth. Cannabis use continues to be more common among adolescent males than females.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2014 Feb,England,2014,10
31105012,L-dopa responsiveness in early Parkinson's disease is associated with the rate of motor progression.,"BACKGROUND: L-dopa responsiveness in Parkinson's disease (PD) varies, but the clinical correlates and significance of this are ill-defined. METHODS: Patients were assessed before and after their usual morning L-dopa dose, using the MDS Unified PD Rating Scale Part 3 (MDS UPDRS 3), and rated as definite responders (>/=24.5% improvement) or limited responders (<24.5%). RESULTS: 1007 cases, mean age 66.1 years (SD 9.1) at diagnosis, were assessed 3.4 (SD 0.9) years after diagnosis. The L-dopa response was definite in 614 cases (61.0%), median reduction in MDS UPDRS 3 scores was 42.0%, (IQR 33.3, 53.1), and was limited in 393 cases (39.0%), median reduction in MDS UPDRS 3 scores 11.5% (IQR 4.3, 18.2). Definite responders were younger (66.3yearsat study entry, SD 9.3) than limited responders (69.2 years, SD 8.4, p<0.001). The MDS UPDRS 3 score at study entry in definite responders (21.0, SD 10.5) was significantly lower than in limited responders (24.7, SD 13.4, p<0.001). The MDS UPDRS 3 increase over 18 months was less in definite responders at 3.0 (SD 10.4), compared to limited responders (6.4, SD 11.0, p<0.001). The levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was not significantly different at study entry (definite responders 317mg, SD 199, vs limited responders 305mg, SD 191, p=0.53). However, LEDD was significantly higher at the time of the L-dopa challenge test in definite responders (541mg, SD 293) compared to limited responders (485mg, SD 215, p=0.01). Responsiveness to L-dopa was unaffected by the challenge test dose (p=0.54). CONCLUSIONS: The main determinants of variation in the L-dopa response in early PD are age and motor severity. A limited L-dopa response is associated with faster motor progression.",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2019 Aug,England,2019,10

This study aims at identifying factors associated with the odds of having no GP within the general population and especially among people with migration background. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis was based on the ""German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults"" (DEGS1) conducted by the Robert Koch Institute. Descriptive analyses as well as multiple logistic regression models were performed to analyse the impact of a migration background, age, gender, residential area, socioeconomic status (SES) and other factors on having no GP among 7755 participants. RESULTS: 9.5% of the total study population and 14.8% of people with a migration background had no GP, especially men, adults living in big cities and without chronic diseases. The odds of not having a GP were higher for people with a two-sided migration background (aOR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.42-2.55). Among the population with a migration background, particularly young adults, men, people living in big cities and having a private health insurance showed higher odds to have no GP. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to investigate the causes of the differing utilization of healthcare of people with a migration background and, if necessary, to take measures for an equal access to healthcare for all population groups. Further research needs to be done to evaluate how to get young people into contact with a GP.",BMC health services research,2018 Oct 3,England,2018,10
27220748,"""There's a housing crisis going on in Sydney for Aboriginal people"": focus group accounts of housing and perceived associations with health.","BACKGROUND: Poor housing is widely cited as an important determinant of the poor health status of Aboriginal Australians, as for indigenous peoples in other wealthy nations with histories of colonisation such as Canada, the United States of America and New Zealand. While the majority of Aboriginal Australians live in urban areas, most research into housing and its relationship with health has been conducted with those living in remote communities. This study explores the views of Aboriginal people living in Western Sydney about their housing circumstances and what relationships, if any, they perceive between housing and health. METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with clients and staff of an Aboriginal community-controlled health service in Western Sydney (n = 38). Inductive, thematic analysis was conducted using framework data management methods in NVivo10. RESULTS: Five high-level themes were derived: the battle to access housing; secondary homelessness; overcrowding; poor dwelling conditions; and housing as a key determinant of health. Participants associated their challenging housing experiences with poor physical health and poor social and emotional wellbeing. Housing issues were said to affect people differently across the life course; participants expressed particular concern that poor housing was harming the health and developmental trajectories of many urban Aboriginal children. CONCLUSIONS: Housing was perceived as a pivotal determinant of health and wellbeing that either facilitates or hinders prospects for full and healthy lives. Many of the specific health concerns participants attributed to poor housing echo existing epidemiological research findings. These findings suggest that housing may be a key intervention point for improving the health of urban Aboriginal Australians.",BMC public health,2016 May 24,England,2016,10
22902779,Social determinants of cardiovascular disease risk factor presence among rural and urban Black and White men.,"BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health are increasingly being addressed as a causal factor for disparities in health. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of specified social determinants of health on cardiovascular disease (CVD) clinical risk factors in Black and White men residing in rural and urban Georgia. METHODS: Self-report data were collected on a total of 548 Black and White men aged >18 years from 2004-2005. Data were derived from a random telephone survey. Separate logistic regression models were conducted to examine the effects of specified social determinants on the presence of two or more CVD clinical risk factors. In addition, differences within rural and urban men were also assessed. RESULTS: Lower education, unemployment, lower income, and higher general stress were all significantly related to the presence of two or more CVD clinical risk factors. As expected, the covariates of age, race, and residential location also played a significant role in cardiovascular health. Rural men were nearly twice as likely to have two or more CVD risk factors compared to their urban men (P <0.01). Models examining location separately found urban Black men to be 2.6 times as likely to have more than two CVD risk factors (P <0.02). CONCLUSION: Findings reveal social determinants are associated with CVD risk factor differences between Black and White men and between rural and urban residents. It is important for policymakers and the healthcare industry to address these social determinants of health as they try to improve the health of the people they serve.",Journal of men's health,2012 Jun 1,Canada,2012,10

26468002,"Prevalence and determinants of unintended double medication of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and hypoglycemic drugs in Austria: a nationwide cohort study.","PURPOSE: Double medication is defined as the unintended overlapping prescription of two identical substances with the same route of administration by two different prescribers to the same patient. Consequences of double medication are reduced patient safety and excess healthcare costs. Based on nationwide prescription data from 2011 covering 97% of Austria's population, we estimated double medication prevalences for treatment of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We investigated prescriptions of 88 antihypertensive, 16 lipid-lowering and 29 hypoglycemic substances in 7,971,323 persons in 2011. Prevalence of double medication was calculated patientwise (prevalence by patients) and timewise (prevalence by patient-years). Risk factors for double medication were identified by logistic regression. RESULTS: For antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and hypoglycemic subtances, overall 15.0% (men: 15.1%, women: 15.0%), 13.1% (13.7%, 12.5%), and 13.0% (13.0%, 13.4%) of patients were doubly medicated, respectively. Corresponding prevalences by patient-years were 1.6%, 2.0%, and 1.2%. Logistic regression confirmed lower age and copayment waiver as independent risk factors of double medication. Furthermore, double medication occurred more often with prescriptions from hospitals or internal medicine specialists compared with general practitioners, as well as in August compared with earlier or later in the calendar year. CONCLUSION: While appropriate care or comanagement of patients by internal medicine specialists and general practitioners may explain some of the double prescriptions, our data indicate that unintended double medication is frequent. In Austria, lack of financial incentives of patients to avoid filling duplicate prescriptions explains a considerable fraction of double medication occurrences.",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,2016 Jan,England,2016,10

They also compared UMed and non-UMed outcomes from the same classes, using graduation data and data from two surveys: Medical Students' Attitudes Toward the Underserved (MSATU) and the Intercultural/Professional Assessment. RESULTS: UMed students were more likely than non-UMed students to endorse MSATU constructs (""Universal medical care is a right"" [P = .01], ""Access to basic medical care is a right"" [P = .03], ""Access is influenced by social determinants"" [P = .03]); to be selected for the Gold Humanism Honor Society (P < .0001); to complete joint degrees (P < .0001); and to enter primary care residencies (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Early outcomes reveal that a longitudinal, experiential curriculum can provide students with competencies that may prepare them for leadership roles in advocacy, research, and policy making. Contact with diverse communities inculcates-in medical students with predispositions toward helping underserved populations-the self-efficacy and skills to positively influence underserved, urban communities.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2015 Dec,United States,2015,10
30739299,Decolorization and biodegradation of reactive Red 198 Azo dye by a new Enterococcus faecalis-Klebsiella variicola bacterial consortium isolated from textile wastewater sludge.,"The present study investigated biodegradation and removal of Reactive Red 198 (RR198) dye from aqueous environments using a new bacterial consortium isolated from textile wastewater sludge on laboratory scale via batch study. Two bacterial species, Enterococcus faecalis (EF) and Klebsiella variicola (KV), were identified after isolation, through biochemical assays, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. To determine their ability to biodegrade RR198 dye, physicochemical parameters, including bacterial concentration, time, pH, and temperature, were tested; the results showed that the best conditions included a bacterial concentration of 3.5 mL x 10(5) cells/mL and incubation time of 72 h. Under such conditions, the removal efficiency of RR198 dye at an initial concentration of 10-25 mg/L was more than 98%; however, for concentrations of 50, 75, and 100 mg/L, removal efficiency was reduced to 55.62%, 25.82%, and 15.42%, respectively (p = 0.005). The highest removal efficiency occurred at pH 8.0, reaching 99.26% after 72 h of incubation. With increasing the incubation temperature from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C, removal efficiency increased from 71.71 to 99.26% after 72 h of incubation, and increasing the temperature from 37 to 45 degrees C, the removal efficiency was reduced (p </= 0.001). Therefore, the EF-KV bacterial consortium can be used for efficient removal of RR198 dye from textile effluent.",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2019 Feb 9,Germany,2019,10
27048319,The utility of resilience as a conceptual framework for understanding and measuring LGBTQ health.,"BACKGROUND: Historically, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) health research has focused heavily on the risks for poor health outcomes, obscuring the ways in which LGBTQ populations maintain and improve their health across the life course. In this paper we argue that informing culturally competent health policy and systems requires shifting the LGBTQ health research evidence base away from deficit-focused approaches toward strengths-based approaches to understanding and measuring LGBTQ health. METHODS: We recently conducted a scoping review with the aim of exploring strengths-based approaches to LGBTQ health research. Our team found that the concept of resilience emerged as a key conceptual framework. This paper discusses a subset of our scoping review findings on the utility of resilience as a conceptual framework in understanding and measuring LGBTQ health. RESULTS: The findings of our scoping review suggest that the ways in which resilience is defined and measured in relation to LGBTQ populations remains contested. Given that LGBTQ populations have unique lived experiences of adversity and discrimination, and may also have unique factors that contribute to their resilience, the utility of heteronormative and cis-normative models of resilience is questionable. Our findings suggest that there is a need to consider further exploration and development of LGBTQ-specific models and measures of resilience that take into account structural, social, and individual determinants of health and incorporate an intersectional lens. CONCLUSIONS: While we fully acknowledge that the resilience of LGBTQ populations is central to advancing LGBTQ health, there remains much work to be done before the concept of resilience can be truly useful in measuring LGBTQ health.",International journal for equity in health,2016 Apr 6,England,2016,10
27840340,The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on Quality of Life in Women with Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: The women with breast cancer experience high rates of morbidity due to different treatments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of aerobic exercise in the quality of life (QoL) among women suffering from breast cancer in Hamadan, western Iran. METHODS: Participants who had consummated the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in exercise group (n=30) and control group (n=30). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The mean age was 42.70 +/-9.6 and 43.50 +/-8.60 yr old in exercise and control groups, respectively. The quality of life was assessed by two widely used standard questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23). The exercise group received supervised exercise 2 days per week for 10 weeks. Through two stages (before and after intervention) these groups were evaluated. Analyzing the data was performed by SPSS/20.0, using t-test, chi-squared and ANCOVA. P<0.05 was regarded as significant level. RESULTS: The global health status QoL, based on EORTC QLQ-C30, developed significantly in the exercise group (48.76+/-24.96 vs. 81.79+/-16.34) in comparison with the controls (47.75 +/-15.73 vs. 52.88 +/-14.51) (P<0.001). The exercise intervention was associated with substantial development in total score of functions and symptoms of QoL using EORTC QLQ-BR23 (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The statistically and clinically crucial developments were indicated in functions and symptoms of QoL in response to exercise in breast cancer women.",Journal of research in health sciences,2016 Summer,Iran,2016,10
27774688,Social determinants of health and local government: understanding and uptake of ideas in two Australian states.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the awareness and perceptions of local government staff about the social determinants of health (SDoH) and health inequity and use of these ideas to shape policy and practice. METHODS: 96 staff at 17 councils in South Australia or New South Wales responded to questions in a pilot online survey concerning: sources of knowledge about, familiarity with the evidence on, attitudes towards, and uses of ideas about the social determinants of health. Eight of 68 SA councils and 16 of 152 NSW councils were randomly selected stratified by state and metropolitan status. Differences between states and metropolitan/non-metropolitan status were explored. RESULTS: The majority of respondents (88.4%) reported some familiarity with ideas about the broad determinants of health and 90% agreed that the impact of policy action on health determinants should be considered in all major government policy and planning initiatives. Research articles, government/professional reports, and professional contacts were rated as important sources of knowledge about the social determinants of health. CONCLUSION: Resources need to be dedicated to systematic research on practical implementation of interventions on social determinants of health inequities and towards providing staff with more practical information about interventions and tools to evaluate those interventions. IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest there is support for action addressing the social determinants of health in local government. The findings extend similar research regarding SDoH and government in NZ and Canada to Australian local government.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2017 Apr,Australia,2017,10
30892484,Practice of exclusive breastfeeding and its associated factors in a suburban area in Angola: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding for six months is one of the measures with highest impact on prevention of child deaths. The determinants of breastfeeding practices are complex and differ between populations. This study aimed to identify factors associated with the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in a suburban area in Angola. DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based cross-sectional study in the municipality of Cacuaco, Luanda. METHODS: A random sample of children under two years of age and their mothers was included. -Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson regression based on a hierarchical model. RESULTS: 749 children and their mothers were surveyed, including 274 children under six months. Theprevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among children under six months was 51.5% (95% confidence interval, CI, 46.3-56.6%). Four variables were positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding at ages of under six months: number of prenatal visits (PR 1.11 for each visit after the first one; 95% CI 1.04-1.18), maternal occupation (other occupations versus self-employed) (PR 1.54; 95% CI 1.05-2.26), younger child age (PR 0.77 for each month; 95% CI 0.71-0.84) and female child (PR 1.34; 95% CI 1.02-1.76). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding at six months was satisfactory, according to international recommendations. Factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices that had never been surveyed before in Angola were identified through this study. These data are particularly relevant in the context of high infant mortality and may be useful in planning actions aimed at improving child health through promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, in Angola and other countries.",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,2018 Nov-Dec,Brazil,2018,10
25389470,Disclosure of HIV Status and Social Support Among People Living With HIV.,"BACKGROUND: Disclosure of HIV is important for improving self-care behaviors, psychological well-being, commitment to the treatment, and reducing risk of transmission. One of the major benefits of disclosure is social support, which is an essential resource for effective coping with HIV infection. However, receiving any social support requires disclosing of HIV status. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the disclosure of HIV status and its related factors such as social support in addition to demographic and disease characteristics among people living with HIV in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study, using simple random sampling, was carried out on 175 people with HIV/AIDS who referred to Behavioral Counseling Centers. The self-administrated, Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire was used to measure social support. Disclosure of HIV status was assessed with an investigator-designed questions. Multiple logistic regression analysis with backward Likelihood Ratio method was applied to identify the adjusted odds ratio between disclosure as dependent variable and demographic variables, social support as independent variables. RESULTS: Participants were often disclosed their HIV status to family members. But there were differences about disclosure of HIV status within the context of the family. Family members were perceived as more supportive. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrates that the gender (adjusted OR = 0.181; 95% CI .068-0.479), CD4 cell count (adjusted OR = 0.997; 95% CI 0.994-0.999), route of transmission (injection-drug user [adjusted OR = 9.366; 95% CI 3.358-26.123] and other routes [tattooing, mother to child, dental services, etc.], [adjusted OR = 3.752; 95% CI 1.157-12.167]), and functional support variable (adjusted OR = 1.007; 95% CI 1.001-1.013) remained in the model as significant predictors for disclosure. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study regarding disclosure of HIV status and its relations to social support and some demographic variables can provide an understanding based on the evidence for promotion of knowledge and coping interventions about people living with HIV/AIDS and their perceived social support status.",Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,2014 Aug,Iran,2014,10
30042713,Organizational Justice and Readiness for Change: A Concomitant Examination of the Mediating Role of Perceived Organizational Support and Identification.,"Survival in today's global economy requires organizations to be flexible and adapt readily to the ever-changing marketplace. However, more than 70% of organizational change initiatives fail, mostly due to employees' resistance to change. The literature has identified readiness for change (RFC) as an important cognitive precursor of resistance. A body of research has accordingly investigated the determinants of employees' RFC. In particular, RFC has been shown to be positively predicted by employees' perceptions of fair treatment. Little is known, however, on the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Relying on social exchange theory and social identity theory, this paper investigates the concomitant mediating role of perceived organizational support (POS) and organizational identification (OID) between overall justice and RFC. One hundred and forty-five employees of a company located in France participated in a survey-based study. Results of the path analyses indicated that POS mediates the positive effect of organizational justice on RFC, while OID does not act as a mediator in this relationship. As a whole, these results show the relevance of social exchange theory to better understand how employees become ready to change in organizational settings.",Frontiers in psychology,2018,Switzerland,2018,10
27430983,Typologies in GPs' referral practice.,"BACKGROUND: GPs' individual decisions to refer and the various ways of working when they refer are important determinants of secondary care use. The objective of this study was to explore and describe potential characteristics of GPs' referral practice by investigating their opinions about referring and their self-reported experiences of what they do when they refer. METHODS: Observational cross-sectional study using data from 128 Norwegian GPs who filled in a questionnaire with statements on how they regarded the referral process, and who were invited to collect data when they actually referred to hospital during one month. Only elective referrals were recorded. The 57 participants (44,5 %) recorded data from 691 referrals. The variables were included in a principal component analysis. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to identify typologies with GP's age, gender, specialty in family medicine and location as independent variables. RESULTS: Eight principal components describe the different ways GPs think and work when they refer. Two typologies summarize these components: confidence characterizing specialists in family medicine, mainly female, who reported a more patient-centred practice making priority decisions when they refer, who confer easily with hospital consultants and who complete the referrals during the consultation; uncertainty characterizing young, mainly male non-specialists in family medicine, experiencing patients' pressure to be referred, heavy workload, having reluctance to cooperate with the patient and reporting sparse contact with hospital colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: Training specialists in family medicine in patient-centred method, easy conference with hospital consultant and cooperation with patients while making the referral may foster both self-reflections on own competences and increased levels of confidence.",BMC family practice,2016 Jul 18,England,2016,10
26075291,Current Trends in the study of Gender Norms and Health Behaviors.,"Gender norms are recognized as one of the major social determinants of health and gender norms can have implications for an individual's health behaviors. This paper reviews the recent advances in research on the role of gender norms on health behaviors most associated with morbidity and mortality. We find that (1) the study of gender norms and health behaviors is varied across different types of health behaviors, (2) research on masculinity and masculine norms appears to have taken on an increasing proportion of studies on the relationship between gender norms and health, and (3) we are seeing new and varied populations integrated into the study of gender norms and health behaviors.",Current opinion in psychology,2015 Oct 1,Netherlands,2015,10
26148647,Topographical distribution of anopheline mosquitoes in an area under elimination programme in the south of Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major vector-borne disease in tropical and sub-tropical countries caused by Plasmodium infection. It is one the most important health problem in south and southeast of Iran. Since Iran has recently launched to the elimination phase of malaria and vector control is one of the main strategies for elimination, this study was conducted to determine the topographical distribution of malaria vectors in Minab County, one of the important malaria endemic areas in south of Iran. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, six villages in three topographically different sites namely coastal plain, foothill and mountainous areas were selected by simple random sampling. The anopheline larvae were collected using the standard dipping method. The specimens were identified using a morphology based-key. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver.16 software. RESULTS: In total, 3,841 anopheles larvae were collected from 24 larval habitats. They consisted of ten species: Anopheles moghulensis (25.23%), Anopheles stephensi (24.47%), Anopheles dthali (19.14%), Anopheles culicifacies (9.63%), Anopheles fluviatilis (7.52%), Anopheles superpictus (5.62%), Anopheles turkhudi (5.55%), Anopheles pulcherrimus (1.93%), Anopheles multicolor (0.47%), and Anopheles apoci (0.44%). Most species were distributed in different topographies and only An. Stephensi and An. culicifacies, the main malaria vectors in Iran, were significantly associated with the altitude of studied areas. An. moghulensis, An. stephensi and An. dthali were the most widespread species and were, respectively predominant in Coastal plain, foothill and mountainous areas. CONCLUSION: Results of this study have revealed that there are many malaria vectors that are distributed in Minab County and some of them are expected to be predominant in areas with special topographic characteristics. This finding can provide a basis for effective planning and implementation of evidence-based malaria vector intervention strategies towards vector control, which may help in malaria elimination in the study area.",Malaria journal,2015 Jul 7,England,2015,10
28486082,Bereavement of Israeli Arab Muslim widows: Determinants of adjustment and supporting attributes.,"Cultural-specific determinants of coping with widowhood were investigated by the Two-Track Model of Bereavement. Participants were 93 middle-aged and middle-class Israeli Arab Muslim widows. Factor analysis emitted 4 factors of adjusting to widowhood. The suffering and resilience factors and the total scale score were consistently correlated with personality attributes, whereas demographics were associated mainly with the suffering factor and the total scale score. The factors differed from the factors characteristic of Israeli Jewish bereaved, which emphasize the need to examine models of bereavement in cross-cultural perspective and to account for the interaction of cultural effects with psychological processes.",Death studies,2018 Jan,United States,2018,10
30833114,[Association between socioeconomic determinants and environmental tobacco smoke exposure in children].,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and different socioeconomic determinants among Spanish children. METHOD: We analyzed the data of 5495 children included in the 2011-2012 Spanish National Health Survey. We estimated the prevalence of exposure to ETS and adjusted logistic regression models to identify variables related to exposure to ETS: total exposure and exposure in the home in addition to ETS exposure in enclosed public places/transport. RESULTS: Total exposure to ETS among children aged 15 and younger was 11.8%, 11.5% of whom were exposed at home and 0.8% in enclosed public places/transport. The prevalence odds ratio (POR) of exposure at home increased with age (6-9 years: 2.19; 10-14 years: 2.28), in children with parents of low or medium education levels (1.97 and 1.29), of social class IV-VI (1.42), among those living in a household with a composition other than a ""couple with children"" (1.43), and in smaller-sized homes (1.39). Total exposure results were similar to home exposure results. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ETS is higher among children younger than 15 years with a more difficult economic situation. These inequalities must be considered in the establishment and development of public health policies.",Gaceta sanitaria,2019 Mar 1,Spain,2019,10
25001551,Psychosocial determinants of mental health and risk behaviours in adolescents.,"This study aimed at identifying the prevalence of emotional problems among children and adolescents in Portugal. Gender, developmental aspects, their psychosocial determinants, and the time trends over 8 years were also explored. The three waves of a cross-sectional survey obtained from the HBSC nationally representative samples of 10-17 year old children and adolescents in 1998, 2002, and 2006, were used. Specific composite indexes included emotional and somatic symptoms, substances' use, demographic and psychosocial factors. Girls reported more emotional symptoms, and boys reported more substances' use. Emotional symptoms and substances' use increased with age, in contrast school commitment and perception of safe neighbourhood decreased with age. With age, the communication with the family tends to become more difficult, while communication with the friends tends to become easier. Along the three waves, substances' use and emotional symptoms have shown a general pattern of decrease. Results were discussed according to literature and their consequences for the understanding of emotional problems and substance use in childhood and adolescence. Mental health promotion includes both the prevention of emotional problems and risk behaviours; determinants include individual factors and a range of psychosocial factors. Mental health problems have a huge impact on adolescents' well-being; however it is often a poorer area of intervention in school based interventions. Gender differences are highlighted.",Global journal of health science,2014 Apr 1,Canada,2014,10
22595335,Physical activity and psychosocial and mental health of older caregivers and non-caregivers.,"Few studies have been conducted on physical activity (PA) in older caregivers, a population at risk for mental and physical decline. To assess and compare PA, PA preferences, psychosocial determinants of PA, and mental health indicators between older non-exercising caregivers and non-caregivers. Caregivers (N = 24) and non-caregivers (N = 48) completed questionnaires and wore an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Few significant differences were noted in objectively measured or subjectively reported PA between caregivers and non-caregivers. Non-caregivers reported greater social support to exercise from family members. Caregivers reported significantly greater anxiety, depression, stress, and negative health symptoms. Caregivers were significantly more likely to prefer exercise in 10-min bouts. Caregivers are in need of interventions to increase PA and health. Efforts to help caregivers participate in multiple shorter bouts of exercise during the day could be more effective than recommending one continuous 30-minute bout.","Geriatric nursing (New York, N.Y.)",2012 Sep-Oct,United States,2012,10
31636818,Community Health Center Engagement and Training During Obstetrics and Gynecology Residency.,"Background: Community health centers (CHCs) and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are critical health care access points for medically underserved areas in the United States. They also provide opportunities for residents to learn about health system challenges, including workforce shortages, social determinants of health, and health equity. Objective: We sought to describe current obstetrics and gynecology (OB-GYN) resident engagement and training in community health settings. Methods: We conducted a website review and survey to identify the prevalence and types of OB-GYN resident exposure to CHCs, including FQHCs. We reviewed 241 program websites to identify community health electives or rotations. We then surveyed program administrators regarding departmental affiliations with CHCs, types of resident involvement, and barriers to resident rotations at CHCs. Results: The website review revealed that 18% (44 of 241) of programs offered a community health rotation. Of the 241 programs surveyed, 78 program administrators responded (32%). Forty-three programs (55%) had at least 1 affiliated CHC, and 34 programs (44%) allowed residents to rotate at a CHC. The most common barrier to resident rotations at a CHC was inadequate resident coverage of hospital-based clinical responsibilities. Respondents reported that among 782 graduating residents in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 academic years, 76 (10%) planned to pursue a position at a CHC. Conclusions: According to their websites, a small percentage of US OB-GYN residency programs offered a CHC rotation. Of programs responding to a survey on the topic, less than half offered CHC rotations and less than 1 in 10 residents planned to work in CHCs after graduation.",Journal of graduate medical education,2019 Oct,United States,2019,10

Aim: This study explored the lived experiences of Filipinos recovering from drug addiction and sought to understand the occupational justice determinants of drug addiction to better develop substance addiction rehabilitation programs in the Philippines. Method: Using a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth interviews guided by the Occupational Justice Health Questionnaire to 24 participants. Data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: We found four emerging themes: living with drugs, living around rules, living for the future, and living amidst the war on drugs. Each theme represented a ""period of participation"" exposing occupational injustices that activated the first enablement skill ""raise consciousness of occupational injustice"" from the Participatory Occupational Justice Framework. Conclusion and Significance: Understanding the participants' lived experiences raised consciousness of the injustices that exist before and during rehabilitation which uncovered pointers to improve local substance addiction rehabilitation programs: use of occupation-based social participation interventions, limitation of occupational therapy services due to lack of human resources reinforcing interprofessional collaboration, a participatory approach is essential in discussing and addressing injustices, and deliberate use of political activities of daily living.",Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy,2019 Jul 19,England,2019,10
24364464,'Theory of incomprehensibility'--the social and biological determinants of mental disorders.,"Karl Jaspers' theory on the incomprehensibility of psychotic disorders has become the reference point for many critical studies in the field of contemporary psychopathology. According to Jaspers, it is impossible to understand any of the serious mental disorders often referred to as 'psychosis' because of their unreasonableness, a truth that is revealed when one attempts to empathize with the mental states of patients afflicted with a particular mental disorder. These elements are psychologically inaccessible and closed to any form of empathy. The theory of incomprehensibility is the starting point for many contemporary discussions on the nature of mental illness. It refers to the pathogenic causes of mental disorder and, at the same time, leads to the marginalization of 'pathoplastic'--personal, family related and environmental factors responsible for mental distress. The presented article criticizes the theory of incomprehensibility in light of the contemporary discussion within the (new) philosophy of psychiatry about the role and function of psychiatry and psychopathology. Many authors criticize the theory of incomprehensibility, particularly its implications for understanding and explaining mental disorders. The views presented in the article--post-psychiatry, the psychiatry of common sense, the socio-cultural approach and engaged epistemology/embodied cognition--aim to reveal the broader dimensions of human pathological experience. Particularly appreciated by the author, engaged epistemology and embodied cognition aim to connect social and experiential points of view with the more scientific neuropsychiatric research, and refer to the hidden levels of our experience while always placing such elements in the social context, as well as describing human pathological symptoms against this social background. The basic aim of the presented paper is to stress the need for a review of dogmatic assumptions on the nature of mental illness, and to discuss the possibility of explaining the mental and neurobiological aspects of psychopathology within the social and experiential context.",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,2013,Poland,2013,10
31546313,The Future for Health in Portugal-Everyone Has a Role to Play.,"Abstract-Portugal's Gulbenkian Foundation set up an independent commission to look forward 25 years to create a new vision for health and health care and make recommendations how that vision could be achieved and sustained. The Commission recognized the wide public support for the health system and the good clinical skills of its health professionals. It noted that Portugal had an aging population, high levels of chronic diseases (particularly diabetes, obesity, and mental health problems), low fertility rates, and high levels of migration. The Commission also noted that Portugal's health system had wide variability in performance and outcomes, did not use evidence systematically, and duplicated many specialist services. The Commission's final report proposed a two-part approach of tackling the social determinants of health and seeking to improve health care delivery. It did not treat finance as a separate strategy or variable but as an integral part of both of these approaches. Thus, for example, on sustainability the report concluded that whilst incentives and financial mechanisms could help, the sustainability of the system would be dependent on politicians being willing to introduce health into all policies and action by citizens, wider society and health professionals. This Commission's report is relevant to other countries that need to address both improving the health of their population and improving health care. In Portugal, a program of activities is underway after publication of the Commission's report. The Gulbenkian Foundation is promoting these activities by supporting three Gulbenkian Challenges: reducing hospital infections, preventing 50,000 people from getting diabetes in the next five years, and improving child health.",Health systems and reform,2015 Feb 17,United States,2015,10
28468612,The barriers and facilitators that indigenous health workers experience in their workplace and communities in providing self-management support: a multiple case study.,"BACKGROUND: The inequality in health outcomes between Indigenous (Throughout the paper, the term Indigenous will be used to represent both Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander Australians.) and non-Indigenous Australians continues to be a major public health issue. Chronic conditions are responsible for the majority of the gap in life expectancy for this population. Evidence suggests that chronic condition management models focusing on self-management have led to improved health outcomes in Indigenous populations. The Flinders Closing the Gap Program (FCTGP) is a chronic condition care planning tool which aims to engage Indigenous people in self-managing their chronic conditions. Indigenous health workers (IHWs) can provide culturally appropriate self-management support; however there is paucity in current literature describing specific barriers and facilitators that they may experience when attempting to deliver this support. This study aimed to explore IHWs' perceptions of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the FCTGP, as an evidence-based example of self-management support, and to explore the barriers and facilitators that IHWs experience in their workplace and communities in providing self-management support. METHODS: In-depth interviews were undertaken with five IHWs, drawn from five different states in Australia. Their selection was aided by key informants from the FCTGP training unit. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The following themes were identified. IHWs reported that the FCTGP was appropriate, flexible and acceptable in their communities. Facilitators included factors improving client and worker empowerment, and activities around sharing knowledge. Barriers included competing priorities that clients experience relating to social determinants of health, and negative experiences within mainstream health services. IHW burnout from time pressures, lack of support, and high staff turnover were also considered important barriers. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes an insight into the experiences of IHWs who are considered important stakeholders in implementation and sustainability of chronic condition management programs, including the FCTGP. Recommendations focus on supporting and supplementing the role of IHWs and identify the FCTGP as a facilitator in providing self-management support to a population with complex needs.",BMC health services research,2017 May 3,England,2017,10

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Paediatrics, Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) and Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK), from January 2009 to December 2010. METHODOLOGY: All children suffering from nutritional neglect suggested by weight and height less than the third centile for age, and their mothers were recruited in the study through non-probability consecutive sampling. A team comprising of paediatrician, psychologist, medical social worker and social motivator interviewed the mothers and children suffering from nutritional neglect. Information about demographic, social, economic and psychological factors was obtained. The results were analyzed and described as frequency distribution and percentage. RESULTS: A total of 658 children suffering from nutritional neglect were inducted. Around 75% of children were below 5 years of age, 51% were females. Other determinants of nutritional neglect were, large family size (family of > 5 members (84%), young mother (60%), uneducated parents (67% father and 77% mothers being illiterate), low income (77% earning less than Rs. 7000/month), addiction (23%), tobacco smoking (50%) and non-nutritive substance use (51%). Psychological indicators identified in mothers were depression (70%), anxiety (73%), helplessness (70%), displaced aggression (50%) and insecurity (36%). Psychological factors identified in children as a secondary outcome were aggression (80%), rebellious behaviour (75%), lack of confidence (70%), lack of social interaction (70%) and paranoid tendencies (60%). CONCLUSION: Psycho-social and economic factors are important determinants of neglect. A holistic approach and intervention at multiple levels is required to address these issues.",Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,2014 May,Pakistan,2014,10

However, learning procedural skills in clinical settings is less widely considered. This study aimed to explore the Iranian undergraduate medical students' perception of learning procedural skills and its outcomes in three universities of medical sciences in Iran. Methods: A descriptive exploratory qualitative methodology with an in-depth unstructured, face-to-face interview, and content analysis was used in this study. Sixteen students in clinical phases of general medical education programs from educational hospitals were selected using purposive sampling. According to the preferences of the participants, the interviews were conducted in medical schools or in hospitals. Results: The students participating in this study included 7 females and 9 males (totally 16 people) with a mean age of 23.7 years old with a range of 21-27 years. The three main themes of this study were ""the gap of transferring formal teaching from skill lab to clinical placement"", ""learning self-leading procedural skills in clinical settings"", and ""students' dissatisfaction with patients' vulnerability"" with 8 subthemes which were extracted and explained based on the students' perception. Conclusion: Unsupervised and self-learning by medical students and weakness in controlling the learning process have undesirable results for patients and students.",Journal of advances in medical education & professionalism,2019 Oct,Iran,2019,10
25155566,The assessment of strategic plans of a developing country for solving barriers to access evidence-based information sources.,"OBJECTIVE: Most developing societies attempt to eliminate physicians and medical students' barriers to the use of evidence-based information to ensure about delivering the best practice. Hence, health sector of Iran has conducted numerous educational interventions and has provided information technology infrastructure through strategic plans to provide opportunity for physicians and medical students to use research-based information in their clinical decision from 2005. The aim of this study is to reply a question. Have the reforms of a developing country eliminated the physicians and medical assistants and students' barriers to the use of research and evidence-based information resources? METHODS: A descriptive study was performed among 315 physicians, assistants, and medical students in the affiliated hospitals of Semnan University of medical sciences in 2012. RESULTS: The results reflected actual world scenarios in developing countries, and obviously showed that the investments could not overcome the main obstacles to the extent that was hoped. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers organizational and cultural approaches and information management to simplify the usage of evidence-based information sources in practice in developing countries.",Journal of evidence-based medicine,2014 Feb,England,2014,10
29034647,Seasonality in Violent and Nonviolent Methods of Suicide Attempts: A Cross-Sectional Study on Systematic Registry Data.,"Little attention has been paid to seasonality in suicide in Iran. Time pattern in suicide deaths and suicide attempts for some related factors such as gender, mental disorders has been found. In present study, we focus on suicide methods and the association with seasonality and other putative covariates such as gender. Through a cross-sectional study, overall identified suicide attempts and suicide deaths in the province of Ilam from 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014 were enrolled. We used Edwards' test for test of seasonality in suicide methods. Seasonal effect (peak/trough seasons) and (deaths/attempts suicide) was explored by ratio statistics, the null hypothesis being that the attempted suicides in each method group are evenly distributed over a year. More suicide attempts by hanging 29.4% and self-immolation 41.4% were observed in spring and differ by season pattern in both genders. The overall distribution of suicides by violent and non-violent methods was (males x2=6.3, P=0.041, females x2=7.7, P=0.021) and (males x2=44.5, P=0.001, females x2=104.7, P=0.001), respectively. The peak and trough seasons was observed in taking medications and self-poisoning for spring and winter. Suicide with alcohol was no differ by season pattern (x2=1.0, P=0.460). Suicide in Ilam illustrates a significant seasonality for both violent and non-violent methods of suicide, in both genders, the two peaks were observed in spring and autumn for violent suicides, and spring and summer in non-violent suicides.",Acta medica Iranica,2017 Aug,Iran,2017,10
29789496,Determinants of Inappropriate Admissions in County Hospitals in Rural China: A Cross-Sectional Study.,Inappropriate admissions have contributed to the rapid increase in hospitalisations in rural China. This study characterised the degree and determinants of inappropriate admissions in county hospitals. We used expert consultation to develop an appropriateness evaluation protocol that included nine requirements for services and 21 indicators of disease severity. A total of 2230 medical records from 2014 were collected from five county hospitals by stratified cluster sampling and evaluated for appropriateness using the protocol in 2016. The determinants of inappropriate admissions were analysed by two-level logistic regression. The overall inappropriate admission rate was 15.2%.

31679600,Prescription Opioid Misuse Among Adolescents.,"Although recent spikes in overdose deaths are largely attributable to heroin and fentanyl, prescription opioids still account for a significant percentage of overdose deaths. Additionally, overdose deaths are not a problem solely for adults; roughly 8% of all overdose deaths occur in persons aged 15 to 24. In addition to identifying factors that increase risk for misuse and negative outcomes among adolescents, research must examine the causal mechanisms that link these factors to increased risk. Finally, the extant research must serve as the foundation for prevention/intervention strategies and identify treatments that are effective among adolescents with opioid use disorders.",Pediatric clinics of North America,2019 Dec,United States,2019,10
29120320,Adapting maternal health practice to co-morbidities and social inequality: A systematic approach.,"The process of adapting universal guidelines to local institutional and cultural settings is recognized as important to their implementation and uptake. However, clarity on what, why and how to adapt in an evidence-based manner is still somewhat elusive. Health providers in low and middle income country contexts often have to deal with widely present co-morbidities and social inequalities among pregnant women. Since neither of these problems finds adequate discussion within the usual guidelines, and given the continual pressures posed by resource scarcity, health providers respond through ad hoc adaptations inimical to maternal safety and equity. We argue for, and describe, a grounded process of systematic adaptation of available guidelines through the example of a handbook on maternal risks for primary care doctors and staff nurses. The systematic adaptation in this practical, action-oriented handbook builds on research for a long-standing community-based project on maternal safety and rights. It takes a case-based problem-solving approach. Reiterating guidelines and best practices in diagnostic decision-making and risk management, it indicates how these can respond to co-morbidities and social inequality via complex clinical cases and new social science information.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2017 Nov 9,Switzerland,2017,10
25216714,Parents' views on care of their very premature babies in neonatal intensive care units: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: The admission of a very premature infant to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is often a difficult time for parents. This paper explores parents' views and experiences of the care for their very premature baby on NICU. METHODS: Parents were eligible if they had a baby born before 32 weeks gestation and cared for in a NICU, and spoke English well. 32 mothers and 7 fathers were interviewed to explore their experiences of preterm birth. Although parents' evaluation of care in the NICU was not the aim of these interviews, all parents spoke spontaneously and at length on this topic. Results were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Overall, parents were satisfied with the care on the neonatal unit. Three major themes determining satisfaction with neonatal care emerged: 1) parents' involvement; including looking after their own baby, the challenges of expressing breast milk, and easy access to their baby; 2) staff competence and efficiency; including communication, experience and confidence, information and explanation; and 3) interpersonal relationships with staff; including sensitive and emotional support, reassurance and encouragement, feeling like an individual. CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of positive experiences of care were generally consistent with previous research. Specifically, provision of information, support for parents and increasing their involvement in the care of their baby were highlighted by parents as important in their experience of care.",BMC pediatrics,2014 Sep 13,England,2014,10
29770032,Advancing health equity to improve health: The time is now(dagger).,"Health inequities, or avoidable inequalities in health between groups of people, are increasingly recognized and tackled to improve public health. Canada's interest in health inequities goes back over 40 years, with the landmark 1974 Lalonde report, and continues with the 2011 Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, which affirmed a global political commitment to implementing a social determinants of health approach to reducing health inequities. Research in this area includes documenting and tracking health inequalities, exploring their multidimensional causes, and developing and evaluating ways to address them. Inequalities can be observed in who is vulnerable to infectious and chronic diseases, the impact of health promotion and disease prevention efforts, how disease progresses, and the outcomes of treatment. Many programs, policies and projects with potential impacts on health equity and determinants of health have been implemented across Canada. Recent theoretical and methodological advances in the areas of implementation science and population health intervention research have strengthened our capacity to develop effective interventions. With the launch of a new health equity series this month, the journals Canada Communicable Disease Report (CCDR) and Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada: Research, Policy and Practice (HPCDP Journal) will continue to reflect and foster analysis of social determinants of health and focus on intervention studies that advance health equity.",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,2016 Feb 18,Canada,2016,10
30714769,Who has low health literacy and does it matter for depression? Findings from aggregated and disaggregated racial/ethnic groups.,"OBJECTIVES: Health literacy is an important factor related to health outcomes and, ultimately, health disparities. Of the research that has been done, results have been mixed, which may be a reflection of how previous research primarily explored these relationships within aggregated groups. Thus, the present study sought to fill this gap in literature by exploring the relationships between determinants, health literacy, and depression within both aggregated and disaggregated groups. METHOD: Data from the 2007 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) was used, which included information collected from 51,048 adult participants. A model of the determinants of health, health literacy, and depression was constructed based on Andersen's Model of Health Utilization and fit within both an aggregated ethnic/racial and immigration status group, as well as within disaggregated groups. RESULTS: Results indicated that when comparing ethnic/racial groups, Latinx and AAPI groups had the lowest levels of health literacy. When comparing nativity groups, immigrants had lower health literacy levels than U.S.-born. Finally when looking at disaggregated groups, Latinx and AAPI immigrants had the lowest health literacy levels among all groups. Furthermore, health literacy determinants as well as the relationship between health literacy and depression differed depending on group demographics. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that aggregated data analyses may obscure nuanced within-group differences, highlighting the importance of exploring health literacy within disaggregated groups. The results can be used to help inform the development of intervention or prevention-based programs that seek to improve health literacy and depression.

23404696,Determinants of childhood obesity: need for a trans-sectoral convergent approach.,"The emerging burden of non communicable diseases is likely to erode the ""Demographic-Dividend"" of India and compromise the national growth and development. Increasing rates of childhood obesity globally and in India is a cause for serious public health concern. It is becoming increasingly apparent that obesity is result of complex interplay between multiple genes, environmental factors and human behavior. Clear comprehension of this interaction and pathway is still not clear, making the prevention and management of obesity especially challenging. Globalization and rapid economic growth has led to dramatic changes in the life style of the population including food intake, physical activity, market, environmental factors and social structures. A growing economy, urbanization and motorized transport have increased physical inactivity. A systematic multi-sectoral approach with population health as the center of discourse and attention is the only key to tackle this problem.",Indian journal of pediatrics,2013 Mar,India,2013,10
29239783,Early adulthood determinants of mid-life leisure-time physical inactivity stability and change: Findings from a prospective birth cohort.,"OBJECTIVES: Physical inactivity is highly prevalent. Knowledge is needed of influences on inactive lifestyles. We aimed to establish whether early adult factors predict subsequent inactivity patterns in mid-adulthood. DESIGN: Leisure-time inactivity (activity frequency<1/week) was assessed at 33y and 50y in the 1958 British Birth cohort (N=12,271). METHODS: We assessed associations of early adult (23-33y) physical status, mental function, social, family and neighbourhood circumstances with four 33-50y patterns (never inactive, persistently inactive, deteriorating or improving) using multinomial logistic regression with and without adjustment for childhood factors (e.g. social class). RESULTS: Inactivity prevalence was similar at 33y and 50y ( approximately 31%), but 17% deteriorated and 18% improved with age. Factors associated with persistent vs never inactive were: limiting illness (relative risk ratio (RRR):1.21(1.04,1.42) per number of ages exposed (0,1 or 2 times across ages 23y and 33y), obesity (1.33(1.16,1.54) per number of ages exposed), height (0.93(0.89,0.98) per 5cm), depression (1.32(1.19,1.47) per number of ages exposed); education (1.28(1.20,1.38) per decrease on 5-point scale) and neighbourhood (1.59(1.37,1.86) in 'industrial/local authority housing areas' and 1.33(1.12,1.58) in 'growth/metropolitan inner areas' vs 'suburbs, service, rural or seaside areas'). Associations were broadly similar for inactivity deterioration. Industrial/local authority housing areas (0.75(0.61,0.91)) and longer obesity exposure (0.78(0.64,0.95)) were associated with lower RRRs for improvement. Number of children was associated with improvement, although associations varied by age. Associations remained after adjustment for childhood factors. CONCLUSIONS: Several early adult factors are associated with inactivity persistence and deterioration; fewer with improvement. Obesity duration and neighbourhood lived in during young adulthood had long-lasting associations with inactivity patterns in mid-life.",Journal of science and medicine in sport,2018 Jul,Australia,2018,10
26138093,"Spatiotemporal variation and social determinants of suicide in China, 2006-2012: findings from a nationally representative mortality surveillance system.","BACKGROUND: Suicide in China has declined since the 1990s. However, there has been limited investigation of the potential spatiotemporal variation and social determinants of suicide during subsequent periods. METHOD: Annual suicide counts from 2006 to 2012 stratified by county, 5-year age group (15 years) and gender were obtained from the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points system. Trends and geographic differentials were examined using multilevel negative binomial regression models to explore spatiotemporal variation in suicide, and the role of key sociodemographic factors associated with suicide. RESULTS: The suicide rate (per 100 000) in China decreased from 14.7 to 9.1, 2006-2012. Rates of suicide were higher in males than females and increased substantially with age. Suicide rates were higher in rural areas compared with urban areas; however, urban-rural disparities reduced over time with a faster decline for rural areas. Within both urban and rural areas, higher rates of suicide were evident in areas with lower socio-economic circumstances (SEC) [rate ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-2.62]. Suicide rates varied more than twofold (median RR 2.06) across counties, and were highest in central and southwest regions of China. A high proportion of the divorced population, especially for younger females, was associated with lower suicide rates (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Geographic variations for suicide should be taken into account in policy making, particularly for older males living in rural areas and urban areas with low SEC. Measures to reduce disparities in socio-economic level and alleviate family relation stress are current priorities.",Psychological medicine,2015 Nov,England,2015,10
30472346,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation attenuates harmaline-induced cognitive impairments in rats.,"Cognitive and motor disturbances are serious concerns of the tremors induced by motor disorders. Despite the lack of effective clinical treatment, some potential therapeutic agents have been used to alleviate the cognitive symptoms in the animal models of tremor. Recent studies have shown that PPAR-gamma agonists have neuroprotective effects. In the current study, the effects of pioglitazone (PIO), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, on harmaline-induced motor and cognitive impairment were studied. Male Wistar rats were divided into vehicle (normal saline), PIO (20mg/kg i.p.), harmaline (10mg/kg, i.p.) and PIO+harmaline (PIO injected 2h before harmaline) groups. Open field, rotarod, wire grip, foot print and Morris water maze tests were used to evaluate the motor and cognitive performance. The results indicated that administration of PIO attenuated harmaline-induced locomotor, anxiety-like behaviors, and spatial learning and memory impairments, but it partially decreased the tremor score. The neuroprotective and anxiolytic effects of PIO demonstrated in the current study can offer the PPAR-gamma receptor agonism as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of patients with tremor that manifest mental dysfunction.",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 Jan,Scotland,2019,10
29455052,An instrumental variables approach to assess the effect of class size reduction on student screen time.,"An emerging area of research considers links between characteristics of the school setting and health. The existing small evidence base assessing the association between class size and health is inconclusive. This quasi-experimental study uses an instrumental variables approach based on North Carolina's elementary class size reduction policy to assess the relationship between class size and student screen time. Specifically, data are from public school students in North Carolina, USA, who were in 3rd grade any time between fall 2005 and spring 2011. There was no association between class size and screen time (measured as recreational television and/or electronic device use), after accounting for grade size and school size, year fixed effects, and clustering at the school and district level. These findings suggest that, in statewide policy implementation settings, there may not be any immediate spillover benefits of class size reduction policies on student screen time.",Social science & medicine (1982),2018 Mar,England,2018,10
29406324,Socioeconomic Position and Age-Related Disparities in Regional Cerebral Blood Flow Within the Prefrontal Cortex.,"OBJECTIVE: Socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with cerebrovascular health and brain function, particularly in prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe regions that exhibit plasticity across the life course. However, it is unknown whether SEP associates with resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), an indicator of baseline brain function, in these regions in midlife, and whether the association is (a) period specific, with independent associations for childhood and adulthood SEP, or driven by life course SEP, and (b) explained by a persistent disparity, widening disparity, or the leveling of disparities with age. METHODS: To address these questions, we analyzed cerebral perfusion derived by magnetic resonance imaging in a cross-sectional study of healthy adults (N = 443) who reported on childhood and adult SEP. Main effects were examined as an index of persistent disparity and age by SEP interactions as reflecting widening or leveling disparities. RESULTS: Stable high SEP across the lifespan was associated with higher global CBF and regional CBF (rCBF) in inferior frontal gyrus. However, childhood SEP was associated with rCBF in middle frontal gyrus, as moderated by age (beta = 0.04, p = .035): rCBF was inversely associated with age only for those whose parents had a high school education or below. No associations were observed for the hippocampus or amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Life course SEP associations with rCBF in prefrontal cortex are suggestive of persistent disparities, whereas the age by childhood SEP interaction suggests that childhood disadvantage relates to a widening disparity, independent of global differences. These differential patterns in midlife may relate to disparities in later-life cerebrovascular and neurocognitive outcomes.",Psychosomatic medicine,2018 May,United States,2018,10
28161668,Early-life and adult socioeconomic determinants of myocardial infarction incidence and fatality.,"Social inequalities in coronary heart disease mortality have roots in childhood conditions, but it is unknown whether they are associated both with the incidence of the disease and the following survival. We studied how several different early-life socioeconomic factors, together with later socioeconomic attainment, were associated with myocardial infarction (MI) incidence and fatality in Finland. The data was based on a register-based sample of households from a census in 1950 that also provided information on childhood circumstances. MI hospitalizations and mortality in 1988-2010 were studied in those who were up to 14 years of age at the time of the census and resident in Finland in 1987 (n = 94,501). Parental education, occupation, household crowding, home ownership, and family type were examined together with adulthood education and income. Hazard and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox regression (incidence and long-term fatality) and logistic regression (short-term fatality) models. Lower parental education, occupational background and greater household crowding were associated with MI incidence. In models adjusted for adulthood variables, crowding increased the risk by 16% (95% CI 5-29%) in men and 25% (95% CI 3-50%) in women. Short-term survival was more favourable in sons of white-collar parents and daughters of owner-occupied households, but most aspects of childhood circumstances did not strongly influence long-term fatality risk. Socioeconomic attainment in adulthood accounted for a substantial part of the effects of childhood conditions, but the measured childhood factors explained little of the disparities by adulthood education and income. Moreover, income and education remained associated with MI incidence when adjusted for unobserved shared family factors in siblings. Though social and economic development in society seems to have mitigated the disease burden associated with poor childhood living conditions in Finland, low adult socioeconomic resources have remained a strong determinant of MI incidence and fatality.",Social science & medicine (1982),2017 Mar,England,2017,10
29685083,Follow-up and Time to Treatment in an Urban Cohort of Children with Sleep-Disordered Breathing.,"Objective To evaluate follow-up and timing of sleep-disordered breathing diagnosis and treatment in urban children referred from primary care. Study Design Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis. Setting Tertiary health system. Subjects and Methods Pediatric outpatients with sleep-disordered breathing, referred from primary care for subspecialty appointment or polysomnography in 2014, followed for 2 years. Timing of polysomnography or subspecialty appointments, loss to follow-up, and sleep-disordered breathing severity were main outcomes. Chi-square and t-test identified differences in children referred for polysomnography, surgery, and loss to follow-up. Logistic regression identified predictors of loss to follow-up. Days to polysomnography or surgery were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, with Cox regression comparing estimates by polysomnography receipt and disease severity. Results Of 216 children, 188 (87%) had public insurance. Half (109 [50%]) were lost to follow-up after primary care referral. More children were lost to follow-up when referred for polysomnography (50 [76%]) compared with subspecialty evaluation (35 [32%]; P < .001). Children referred to both polysomnography and subspecialty were more likely to be lost to follow-up (odds ratio = 2.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.29-5.78; P = .009). For children who obtained polysomnography, an asymmetric distribution of obstructive sleep apnea severity was not observed ( P = .152). Median time to polysomnography and surgery was 75 and 226 days, respectively. Obstructive sleep apnea severity did not influence time to surgery ( P = .410). Conclusion In this urban population, half of the children referred for sleep-disordered breathing evaluation are lost to follow-up from primary care. Obstructive sleep apnea severity did not predict follow-up or timeliness of treatment. These findings suggest social determinants may pose barriers to care in addition to the clinical burden of sleep-disordered breathing.",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2018 Aug,England,2018,10
31352596,Effects of detergents on natural ecosystems and wastewater treatment processes: a review.,"Among the different contaminants, detergent as an important pollutant has serious risks to natural ecosystems. Furthermore, detergents can pass into the wastewater treatment plants and have bad effect on their performance. They are part of human life and consumed for different aims especially hygienic purposes. Therefore, detergent components can enter to soil and water bodies from different sources. Detergents affect fauna and flora, and they have direct and indirect effects on ecosystems. Eutrophication, foaming, and altering parameters such as temperature, salinity, turbidity, and pH are more important, and their effects need to be managed and controlled. Researchers confirmed that aerobic processes are able to degrade the most of detergents but anaerobic degradation is not possible because of restricted metabolic pathways and toxicity of them. Therefore, production of environment-friendly detergent is an important issue around the world.

27768900,Is chronic toxoplasmosis a risk factor for diabetes mellitus? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies.,"INTRODUCTION: The global protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, infects many warm-blooded animals and humans by employing different transmission routes. There have been some recent studies on the probable relevance of infectious agents and diabetes. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the possible association between chronic toxoplasmosis and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This study was conducted following the general methodology recommended for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Nine English literature databases (Google scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, Science Direct, Ovid, ProQuest, IngentaConnect, and Wiley Online Library) were searched, up to January 2016. Random effects model was used to determine odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Our review resulted in a total of seven publications meeting the inclusion criteria. Because of significant heterogeneity, we estimated a common OR by a random effects model at 1.10 (95% CI=0.13-9.57) with p=0.929 and 2.39 (95% CI=1.20-4.75) with p=0.013 for type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations such as low number of studies, this meta-analysis suggests chronic toxoplasmosis as a possible risk factor for type 2 DM. However, based on random effects model no statistically significant association was observed between T. gondii and type 1 DM. It is highly recommended for researchers to carry out more accurate studies aiming to better understand this association.",The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,2016 Nov - Dec,Brazil,2016,10

The goal of this study was to use the latent class analysis (LCA) modeling to define unhealthy diet habits among an Iranian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted within the framework of Amol (North of Iran) cohort health study (Phase 1). The participants aged 10 to 90 years. All participants provided written informed consent. Latent class analysis was used to classify the participants of the study. All analyses were conducted by PROC LCA in SAS 9.2 software. Significance level was set at 0.05. Results: The mean age of the participants was 42.58+/-17.23 years. Four classes of individuals with different diet habits were identified using LCA modeling: class 1: individuals with healthy diet patterns (92.6%); class 2: individuals with slightly unhealthy diet habits (6.3%); class 3: individuals with relatively unhealthy diet habits (0.8%); and class 4: individuals with unhealthy diet habits (0.2%). Being female and alcohol consumption increased the odds of membership in latent classes 2,3, and 4 compared to class 1. Physical activity decreased the odds of membership in classes 3 and 4 compared to class 1. Conclusion: Overall, almost more than 7.4% of all participants had some degree of unhealthy dietary habits, and some variables acted as risk factors for membership in risky classes. Therefore, focusing on these variables may help design and execute effective preventive interventions in groups with unhealthy dietary habits.",Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,2018,Iran,2018,10
29952239,Barriers to Health Care Services Among Palestinian Women Denied Family Unification in Israel.,"Family unification received public and political attention following recent global immigration crises, though less within health research. In Israel, under the Family Reunification Order, about 20,000 Palestinian women from the Occupied Palestinian Territories are denied residency and the right to universal health care services (HSC) after marrying Palestinian citizens and moving to Israel. To better understand the relationship between lacking residency and barriers to accessing HCS, we conducted in-depth interviews with 21 Palestinian women (ages 22-59) denied family unification. Our findings revealed that in addition to hindering access to HCS, lacking residency intersects with other political, social, and economic determinants of these women's health and disrupts normal family life. Lacking residency intensifies poverty (via private health insurance and legal fees, permit extensions) and leads to family separations and risky crossings at military checkpoints into the West Bank for medical treatment. Restrictions on freedom of movement engender fear of deportation and precarity. Denial of residency also exacerbates gender inequality (increased dependence on husbands) and can endanger child custody when mothers' lack of residency passes to children, violating children's basic rights. Allowing family unification to Palestinian women would remove barriers to HCS access, allow normal family life, and permit social integration.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2018 Oct,United States,2018,10

This study was conducted to assess the farmers' perception toward deferred grazing system of enclosures (Ngitili), examine the perceived benefits of Ngitili and define the socio-economic variables that potentially explain adoption of Ngitili. The study was conducted in Maswa district; involving a sample of 228 households. Data were collected through household survey, key informant interviews and field observation. Data analysis techniques included descriptive statistics, principal component analysis and binary logistic regression. The study findings show that 75% of farmers had adopted Ngitili. Farmers associated Ngitili system with increase in access to livelihood needs. The main benefits obtained from the system included supply of dry season forages, improved land condition and provision of household energy. The realization of benefits was generally a function of number of years a household had established Ngitili. The likelihood of establishing Ngitili was higher for household heads who were male (p=0.05), and for those who had formal education (p=0.04) and access to extension support services (p=0.02). Other factors that contributed favourably to the adoption of this system were ownership of more than 20 tropical livestock units (p=0.01) and possession of more than three plots of land (p=0.02) located closer (<3km) to homesteads (p=0.01). Factors such as land fragmentation, agricultural expansion and poor enforcement of Ngitili protection measures had negative influence on the system. Overall, this paper identifies the key drivers of Ngitili system adoption necessary to enhance land conservation and environmental protection in the semi-arid areas. To ensure sustainability of the Ngitili system, there is a definite need to promote the factors that enhance community participation in land conservation, improve provision of education and extension services and build strong institutions that help to regulate access and use of resources in restored areas.",Journal of environmental management,2019 Nov 15,England,2019,10
28483892,A Hepatitis C Treatment Program Based in a Safety-Net Hospital Patient-Centered Medical Home.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem. Urban safety-net hospitals are a prime location for HCV treatment delivery. Showing that physicians in primary care settings can deliver HCV infection care is important to expand treatment; models doing so in the era of newer oral HCV medications are needed. This article describes an innovative and successful HCV primary care treatment program in a patient-centered medical home based at an urban, safety-net hospital. The program is public health oriented in that a central team member is a public health social worker who performs population management and addresses underlying social determinants of health to facilitate engagement in HCV treatment. Other team members include general internists trained to treat HCV infections, a pharmacist, and a pharmacy technician. The program is funded with revenue generated by the 340b drug discount program, which allows providers to generate revenue when patients fill prescriptions at pharmacies in safety-net settings, as insurance reimbursements for medications exceed the cost at which safety-net providers purchase medications. During the course of 1 year, the program received 302 referrals. Of these approximately 23% have received treatment.",Annals of family medicine,2017 May,United States,2017,10
20488966,"Successes and challenges of teaching the social determinants of health in secondary schools: case examples in Seattle, Washington.","This article describes a new curriculum developed by Just Health Action (JHA), which teaches the social determinants of health (SDOH) as a strategy to promote health equity. Motivated by the mounting evidence that improvements in health ultimately require taking action on the social, political, and economic determinants of health, JHA has worked since 2004 to teach adolescents critical health literacy, which combines the understanding of the SDOH with skills to take action. This article explains JHA's curricular methodology, provides two case examples of school-based partnerships, and discusses the successes and challenges the authors have experienced in their efforts. JHA's teaching has been enthusiastically received, but its biggest barrier in teaching the SDOH in secondary schools is general lack of awareness of the SDOH and their impact on health outcomes. The authors echo international and national calls to raise awareness of the SDOH through training and education. Incorporating the SDOH into secondary school curriculum first requires a citizenry convinced by its importance who will in turn influence curriculum change. The authors recommend that the SDOH be taught to health professionals in continuing education, as a required course in schools of public health, and in the new initiative to teach public health in undergraduate education.",Health promotion practice,2010 May,United States,2010,10
27809707,Can an Educational Intervention Improve Iodine Nutrition Status in Pregnant Women? A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Because of their increased need for iodine, pregnant women are among the high-risk groups for iodine deficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program on the iodine nutrition status of pregnant women. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 100 pregnant women were randomly selected from five healthcare centers in the southern region of Tehran, the capital of Iran. In the intervention group, pregnant women received a four-month educational program, which included two face-to-face educational sessions, using a researcher-designed educational pamphlet in the second and third trimesters, and two follow-up telephone calls. Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores, urinary iodine concentration (UIC), and salt iodine content were assessed at baseline and four months after the intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, there were significant associations between knowledge and attitude (r = 0.38, p = 0.03) between practice and UIC (r = 0.28, p = 0.01) and between UIC and iodine content of salt (r = 0.24, p = 0.009). Although a significant difference was found in mean KAP scores between the two groups after the educational intervention, scores were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with controls (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in UIC and iodine content of salt between the two groups at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Despite educational intervention increasing KAP among women regarding the importance of iodine and iodized salt consumption during pregnancy, their iodine status did not improve. Considering the main socio-environmental determinants of iodine deficiency, in particular, the monitoring of salt fortification, prescribing iodine containing supplements as well as improving health literacy in pregnant women seem essential strategies.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,2017 Mar,United States,2017,10
24642376,A study of early complementary feeding determinants in the Republic of Ireland based on a cross-sectional analysis of the Growing Up in Ireland infant cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: Early complementary feeding has been shown to increase the risk of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases later in life. Poor compliance with current guidelines on complementary feeding has been reported by Irish studies. The aim of the present paper is to identify predictors of early complementary feeding in order to help health professionals target population groups in greater need of dietary intervention as well as to provide effective advice. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the national, longitudinal Growing Up in Ireland study. SETTING: Data were derived from the first wave (2007-2008) of the Growing Up in Ireland infant cohort. SUBJECTS: A cohort of mothers (n 11 134) from the Republic of Ireland, interviewed when their infants were 9 months of age. RESULTS: Of the infants, 1469 (13.5 %) had been regularly taking solids in the period between 12 and 16 weeks; this percentage increased to 47.0 % of the sample in the period between 16 and 20 weeks. Timing of formula feeding commencement, high maternal BMI and choosing a relative as the infant's minder were strongly associated with early introduction of solids both in bivariate and multivariate analysis. Those infants who started formula feeding at >4 months were 88.4% less likely to be introduced to solids early compared with those who started at <2 months (OR = 0.116; 95% CI 0.072, 0.186; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that biological, social and behavioural aspects exert an important role in infant feeding practices. These findings are relevant to the design of policies and intervention programmes aimed at educating parents.",Public health nutrition,2015 Feb,England,2015,10
20637026,Mental health problems among labour children in the Gaza Strip.,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing international concern over the rising number of children involved in labour, particularly in developing countries. Despite the multitude of related risk factors, and some evidence on their social needs, there has been limited research on these children's mental health. METHODS: The aim of this study was to establish the association between labour-related variables and mental health problems among 780 children in labour (aged 9-18 years, mean 15.8) in the Gaza Strip. Measures included a demographic checklist, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and the Depression Self-rating Scale for Children. RESULTS: Children came from large families (73.2% had eight or more siblings), mainly worked to increase family income, worked an average 6.8 h per day (range 1-16), and only 37.1% had regular rest. Ratings of mental health problems were predicted by different factors, i.e. total difficulties scores by poor friendship relationships and lack of health insurance; anxiety scores by selling in the streets, working to help family, low family income and lack of health insurance; and depression scores by parents' dissatisfaction with the job and longer working hours. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems of children in labour are likely to be associated with socio economic determinants, as well as factors related to their under age employment. Policy, legislation and preventive programmes from statutory and voluntary agencies should adopt an integrated approach in meeting their mental health needs, by enhancing protective factors such as return to school.","Child: care, health and development",2011 Jan,England,2011,10
30984698,"Prevalence of medication adherence and its associated factors among patients with noncommunicable disease in rural Puducherry, South India - A facility-based cross-sectional study.","Background: Trends in morbidity and mortality due to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are rising because of poor control status. Medication nonadherence is one of the most common and modifiable causes of inadequate control status. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of drug adherence among patients with NCD in rural Puducherry. Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was done among 260 patients with NCD receiving treatment from rural primary health center in Puducherry during February and March 2018. Information regarding sociodemographic profile and household was collected using pretested semi-structured questionnaire. Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was done to assess the adherence. We calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) to identify the factors associated with medication adherence. Results: Among the 260 participants, 42.7% belonged to elderly age group; 66.2% were females; 44% did not have any formal education; 70% were unemployed. The majority were suffering from hypertension (71.2%) followed by diabetes (56.2%). This study found that almost one-third (32.7%) of the study participants were not properly adherent to medications. Elderly [aPR 2.51 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.70-3.70] and female participants (aPR 1.64 95% CI: 1.04-2.58) were found to have more chance being nonadherent to medications after adjusting for possible confounding variables. Conclusion: This study reported that almost one-third of the study participants were nonadherent to medications. Elderly age group and female gender were found to be the determinants of nonadherence. Corrective measures need to be started at patient level first by motivating and educating them regarding the importance of drug intake.",Journal of family medicine and primary care,2019 Feb,India,2019,10
30984706,"The effect of willpower workshop on anxiety, depression, and the excitement components in the students of Shiraz university of medical sciences.","Introduction and Aim: The current study aimed at evaluating the effect of willpower workshop on anxiety, depression, and the Granovsky excitement components among the students of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in the academic year 2016--2017. Materials and Methods: Students (140) were selected by the simple random sampling method and allocated into two equal groups of intervention (willing) and control, each of 52 individuals. Data collection instruments were the Garnefski cognitive emotion regulation scale and the Beck depression and anxiety inventories. The data were collected twice, before intervention and after the intervention (9 months after the study completion and holding the workshops). The control subjects received no intervention but were interviewed every 3 months. Results: The results of the current study indicated no significant differences in demographic variables and pretest scores between the groups, which indicate the homogeneity of the groups. In other words, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding demographic characteristics before the intervention (P > 0.05). In addition, to compare the intervention and control groups, the Mann--Whitney U test was used and the results showed a significant difference in posttest results between the study groups (P < 0.05). Also, there was a significant difference between the pretest and posttest results of each group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Results of the current study indicated that training the stress, coping and willpower strengthening skills, based on the Granovsky excitement components, could promote psychophysical health and reduce anxiety and stress among the studied students.",Journal of family medicine and primary care,2019 Feb,India,2019,10

23181146,The influence of social determinants on evidence-based behavioral interventions-considerations for implementation in community settings.,"Over the last decade, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) program funded several hundred community-based organizations (CBOs) and health departments in a wide-scale HIV prevention national diffusion effort. We interviewed six California agencies funded to implement one of three group-level DEBIs to identify facilitators and/or challenges to effective implementation. We identified several social and structural factors affecting community members' participation in DEBIs, including language issues, stigma associated with HIV and sexual orientation, homelessness, and incarceration. Age, class, and socioeconomic status also significantly influenced member participation and CBO implementation success. Although changing individual behaviors is the ultimate measure of behavioral intervention/DEBI success, attention must be given to the larger social and structural factors that significantly affect risk for HIV. In fact, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy recognizes these factors as major barriers to HIV prevention and has developed recommendations that address health disparities. We present short-term, intermediate, and long-term strategies addressing social determinants of health and offer suggestions for adapting DEBIs to meet the broader needs of persons prioritized for DEBIs.",Translational behavioral medicine,2012 Jun,England,2012,10
26455727,"Toward improved survivorship: supportive care needs of esophageal cancer patients, a literature review.","The growing prevalence of esophageal cancer survivors represent a population typified by an extensive treatment regime, significant postsurgical long-term effects, and a dismal prognosis. Despite this, little is known of the supportive care needs of this patient group and the extent to which these are being met in practice. This review provides a synthesis of the research evidence to date; emphasizing opportunities for clinical application and setting a future agenda with research priorities. A literature search was performed using Medline/Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Search headings used included; [esophagus] or [esopohageal] or [upper gastrointestinal] or [upper GI] AND [cancer] or [carcinoma] or [squamous cell] AND [supportive care] or [survivorship] or [psychological] or [emotional] or [information] or [social] or [communication] or [spiritual] or [health-related-quality-of-life] or [HRQL] or [qualitative] or [patient narrative] or [clinical nurse specialist] or [CNS]. Related articles in English were reviewed, with additional articles harvested from reference sections. Esophageal cancer survivors report significant late-term effects posttreatment, encompassing sustained impairment in most areas of health-related quality of life. With a necessitated change in eating behavior, survivors find it particularly challenging to adjust to a new social identity and as a cancer population report high levels of psychological morbidity. Although the determinants of psychological morbidity are largely unknown, illness representations may be a key contributor. Several multidisciplinary supportive care interventions have been developed with promising results. The research summarized in this paper provides valuable insight into the psychosocial well-being of the esophageal cancer survivor. However, knowledge gaps remain, alongside a dearth of applied examples in meeting supportive care need.",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,2016 Nov,United States,2016,10

31828186,A survey dataset on determinants of administrative corruption.,"This data article describes a survey dataset on administrative corruption and its main determinants (culture, organizational culture, political instability, and institutional weakness) in addition to social class. Prior research was consulted to determine indicators of the constructs of administrative corruption. Each construct has four reflective indicators while social class has formative variables. All items are measured using a seven-point Likert scale and semantic differential scale types. Through Google Form, I collected 677 responses that reflect the perspective of the general public in Basra, Iraq. The paper shows how to build observed indicators for administrative corruption and its main causes, and a summary of the raw data. The dataset can be reused by other researchers and easily downloaded from the Mendeley Data repository (https://doi.org/10.17632/xh22fsmvmc.2). While the dataset is prepared for building and testing a model using a structural equation modeling approach, it sheds light on the debate regarding an increasingly important topic internationally, and especially in Middle Eastern countries, such as Iraq, that experience high rates of corruption and political instability.",Data in brief,2019 Dec,Netherlands,2019,10

BACKGROUND: Older adults comprise a vulnerable population for social isolation and its associated health risks. DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Canada's Population Health Promotion Model was chosen as a comprehensive tool to understand and prevent social isolation. Research studies were sought to identify key health determinants and evidence-based options for preventing social isolation. RESULTS: Around 1 out of 6 older persons are socially isolated and three health determinants are of prime importance: (i) income and social status; (ii) personal health practices and coping skills and (iii) social support networks. Evidence-based interventions targeted to these health determinants are suggested. CONCLUSION: Nurses are a key group to advocate for actions needed to prevent social isolation.

28718499,[Meeting contraceptive needs of HIV-positive women: effect on elimination of vertical transmission of HIV].,"Nearly 38% of unplanned pregnancies occur because of unmet contraceptive needs. In HIV-positive women, these figures triple, a phenomenon explained by social determinants such as poverty, access to health services, violence, and forced displacement, all of which are frequent elements in the lives of these women. Unplanned pregnancies represent a psychological burden related to women's fear of transmitting the infection to their children, orphanhood, and assuming risks during pregnancy, in addition to family and social consequences that are expressed in lack of prenatal care, neglect of their health, and an increased likelihood of vertical transmission. Technical assistance for differentiated contraception counseling integrated into HIV care and control services is basic to achieving short- and medium-term elimination of vertical transmission of HIV. These women's characteristics are different from those of the general population, as expressed in their reproductive lives, desires, and intentions regarding motherhood; and their unplanned pregnancies represent a greater psychological, social, and economic burden than that of other women. Recognizing this would allow contraception counseling to be provided by HIV care and follow-up programs, in the same place and time, with trained personnel, capable of understanding and meeting their reproductive needs within a rights-based framework, ensuring that health systems, based on the responsibility they have to society, would be capable of offering quality reproductive care counseling, aimed at meeting the specific needs of HIV-positive women.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2016 Dec,United States,2016,10
27760532,"How do children travel to school in urban India? A cross-sectional study of 5,842 children in Hyderabad.","BACKGROUND: Millions of children travel to school every day in India, yet little is known about this journey. We examined the distribution and determinants of school travel in Hyderabad, India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. School travel questionnaires were used to collect data from children aged 11-14 years, attending private, semi-private and government funded schools in Hyderabad. We used Google Earth to estimate the distance from home to school for each child and modelled the relationship between distance to school and mode of travel, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Forty five of the 48 eligible schools that were selected agreed to participate, providing a total sample of 5842 children. The response rate was 99 %. Most children walked (57 %) or cycled (6 %) to school but 36 % used motorised transport (mostly bus). The proportion using motorised transport was higher in children attending private schools (41 %) than in those attending government schools (24 %). Most (90 %) children lived within 5km of school and 36 % lived within 1km. Greater distance to school was strongly associated with the use of motorised transport. Children living close to school were much more likely to walk or cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Most children in Hyderabad walk (57 %) or cycle (6 %) to school. If these levels are to be maintained, there is an urgent need to ensure that walking and cycling are safe and pleasant. Social policies that decrease distances to school could have a large impact on road traffic injuries, air pollution, and physical activity levels.",BMC public health,2016 Oct 19,England,2016,10
28239598,"General self-efficacy and diabetes management self-efficacy of diabetic patients referred to diabetes clinic of Aq Qala, North of Iran.","BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy is one of the factors involved in successful self-care of diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate general self-efficacy and diabetes management self-efficacy and to determine their association with glycemic control in diabetic individuals, referred to the diabetes clinic of Aq Qala city, North of Iran. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 251 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were enrolled using census method. Data collection tools consisted of Sherer General Self-Efficacy Scale (SGSES) and Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSES) with minor demographic adjustments and hemoglobin A1C test. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analytical techniques include independent t-test, Spearman correlation coefficient and linear regression were applied for further data analysis. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation age of subjects was 56.17 +/- 10.45 years. The mean level of HbA1C of studied subject was 8.35 +/- 2.02%. There was a negative correlation between age and general self-efficacy and diabetes self-efficacy while, there was a positive correlation between general self-efficacy and diabetes self-efficacy (P < 0.001). Results of the regression analysis showed that duration of the disease was the only variable which had a significant effect on the level of hemoglobin A1C (P < 0.001), so that for each year of having the disease, the level of hemoglobin A1C increased by 0.084% (CI 95% = 0.048-0.121). CONCLUSIONS: General self-efficacy and diabetes self-efficacy does not affect glycemic control in diabetic individuals. The duration of the disease is the only affecting variable on glycemic control by its worsening in diabetic individuals. Interventions are recommended to help glycemic control in individuals who are having this disease for longer periods. Moreover, further studies on the affecting factors on poor glycemic control of diabetic patients as well as the role of time variable, are recommended.",Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders,2017,Switzerland,2017,10

We conducted a systematic overview of systematic reviews of intervention studies to provide an overview of the evidence on the impact of housing and neighbourhood interventions on health and health inequalities. There is relatively strong evidence for interventions aimed at improving area characteristics and compelling evidence for warmth and energy efficiency interventions targeted at vulnerable individuals. However, the health impacts of area-level internal housing improvement interventions are as yet unclear. We found no reviews of interventions aimed at altering housing tenure. This remains an important area for further research and potentially new evidence syntheses.",Health & place,2011 Jan,England,2011,10
20649365,Making sense by making sentient: effectance motivation increases anthropomorphism.,"People commonly anthropomorphize nonhuman agents, imbuing everything from computers to pets to gods with humanlike capacities and mental experiences. Although widely observed, the determinants of anthropomorphism are poorly understood and rarely investigated. We propose that people anthropomorphize, in part, to satisfy effectance motivation-the basic and chronic motivation to attain mastery of one's environment. Five studies demonstrated that increasing effectance motivation by manipulating the perceived unpredictability of a nonhuman agent or by increasing the incentives for mastery increases anthropomorphism. Neuroimaging data demonstrated that the neural correlates of this process are similar to those engaged when mentalizing other humans. A final study demonstrated that anthropomorphizing a stimulus makes it appear more predictable and understandable, suggesting that anthropomorphism satisfies effectance motivation. Anthropomorphizing nonhuman agents seems to satisfy the basic motivation to make sense of an otherwise uncertain environment.",Journal of personality and social psychology,2010 Sep,United States,2010,10
31081376,A System of Prevention: Applying a Systems Approach to Public Health.,"Among public health and health care practitioners, there is growing understanding that individuals make choices about their health not in a vacuum but based on the social, physical, and economic environments surrounding them and the resources available to them. Furthermore, we know that we, as a society, have designed these environments and resource allocation processes and that those in turn can produce better or worse health outcomes. In recognition of this, some practitioners are turning toward systems thinking as a way of understanding the many sectors and factors that influence health, and as a strategy for influencing broad and sustained health interventions. In October 2018, Prevention Institute released System of Prevention, a book that uses graphic design to illustrate Prevention Institute's framework for a systems approach to population health that can achieve health equity. The book draws upon learning in the primary prevention arena and presents it in an innovative format designed to be accessible to the many sectors outside of public health that collectively shape the social and community determinants of health. It aims to spark dialogue and catalyze collaboration among the sectors and stakeholders that can together work for a healthy and equitable future for all communities.",Health promotion practice,2019 Jul,United States,2019,10
23849946,Social determinants of health-related quality of life.,"The concept of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) considers patient's perspective as an essential component of the health care relationship. HRQoL is often assimilated to a set of existing tools aimed at measuring the perspective of patient, more particularly the consequences of ill-health condition on patient's everyday life. Patients' reports of their health is however diverse, as social factors such as age, gender, professional status are likely to impact on health self-perception and reporting. Social aspects of HRQoL are somehow underexplored. This paper presents a secondary analysis of epidemiological HRQoL data issued from two national surveys (Barometre Sante 2005; Enquete Decennale Sante 2002-2003). The data analysis showed the existence of social determinants of HRQoL. It more specifically demonstrated that four social indicators are determinants of HRQoL namely living in couple, level of education, occupational status and net income per household, independently of age and gender known effect. Social mechanisms governing the impact of social determinants on quality of life could be further explored by adopting a multidisciplinary and mutilevel research approach of HRQoL as well as considering the ability of individuals to engage with social aspect of their health conditions.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,2013 Aug,France,2013,10
27267370,"HIV infection, viral hepatitis and liver fibrosis among prison inmates in West Africa.","BACKGROUND: Prisoners represent a vulnerable population for blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections which can potentially lead to liver fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. However, little is known about the prevalence of liver fibrosis and associated risk factors among inmates in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Screening of liver fibrosis was undertaken in a randomly selected sample of male inmates incarcerated in Lome, Togo and in Dakar, Senegal using transient elastography. A liver stiffness measurement >/=9.5 KPa was retained to define the presence of a severe liver fibrosis. All included inmates were also screened for HIV, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. Substances abuse including alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use were assessed during face-to-face interviews. Odds Ratio (OR) estimates were computed with their 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) to identify factors associated with severe liver fibrosis. RESULTS: Overall, 680 inmates were included with a median age of 30 years [interquartile range: 24-35]. The prevalence of severe fibrosis was 3.1 % (4.9 % in Lome and 1.2 % in Dakar). Infections with HIV, HBV and HCV were identified in 2.6 %, 12.5 % and 0.5 % of inmates, respectively. Factors associated with a severe liver fibrosis were HIV infection (OR = 7.6; CI 1.8-32.1), HBV infection (OR = 4.8; CI 1.8-12.8), HCV infection (OR = 52.6; CI 4.1-673.8), use of traditional medicines (OR = 3.7; CI 1.4-10.1) and being incarcerated in Lome (OR = 3.3; CI 1.1-9.8) compared to Dakar. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection and viral hepatitis infections were identified as important and independent determinants of severe liver fibrosis. While access to active antiviral therapies against HIV and viral hepatitis expands in Africa, adapted strategies for the monitoring of liver disease need to be explored, especially in vulnerable populations such as inmates.",BMC infectious diseases,2016 Jun 6,England,2016,10
23254525,Measuring potentially avoidable and ambulatory care sensitive hospitalisations in New Zealand children using a newly developed tool.,"OBJECTIVES: To use a newly developed tool to measure Potentially Avoidable (PAH) and Ambulatory Care Sensitive (ACSH) Hospitalisations in New Zealand children. To consider whether these tools provide any insights into the role policies or programmes which address the underlying determinants of health (e.g. poor housing, exposure to cigarette smoke, child poverty) might play in reducing hospitalisations in this age group. METHODS: All acute and semi acute (<1 week of referral) hospitalisations in New Zealand children aged 29 days-14 years, during 2000-2009 were included, along with all hospitalisations for selected dental conditions. The newly developed PAH and ACSH tools were used to determine category membership, with explanatory variables including age, gender, ethnicity and NZ Deprivation index decile. RESULTS: During 2005-2009, 47.4% of all acute paediatric hospitalisations were considered to be PAH, 34.3% to be ACSH, and 9.7% to be non-avoidable. A further 42.9% were for non-classified conditions. Dental conditions and gastroenteritis were the leading causes of both PAH and ACSH. PAH and ACSH were highest in infants and one year olds, while non-avoidable hospitalisations were more evenly distributed throughout childhood. PAH and ACSH were higher for those from deprived areas and for Pacific and Maori children. Socioeconomic differences for non-avoidable hospitalisations were less marked, with rates being lowest in Maori and Asian children. DISCUSSION: Large social gradients in ACSH suggest that New Zealand needs to implement policies to increase access to primary care for Pacific and Maori children and those living in more deprived areas. With the majority of presentations being for acute onset infectious and respiratory diseases, such policies must take into account the need for immediate (i.e. same day) and after hours access to primary care. The narrow windows of opportunity (hours-days) available for primary care to prevent hospitalisations for ambulatory sensitive conditions also suggests that New Zealand needs to develop policies and strategies to reduce the underlying burden of disease in the community.",The New Zealand medical journal,2012 Nov 23,New Zealand,2012,10
31017061,Iranian hospital efficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper (systematic review and meta-analysis) is to synthesize and analyze studies that assessed Iranian hospital efficiency. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A systematic literature search was conducted using both international (the Institute for Scientific Information, Scopus and PubMed) and Iranian scientific (Magiran, IranMedex and Scientific Information Database) databases. The review included original studies that used the Pabon Lasso Model to examine Iranian hospital performance, published in Persian or English. A self-administered checklist was used to collect data. In total, 12 questions were used for quality assessment. FINDINGS: In total, 34 studies met our inclusion criteria. The fixed-effects meta-analysis indicated that 19.2 percent (95% confidence interval (CI): 15.6-23.2 percent) of hospitals were in Zone 1 (poor performance: low bed turnover rate (BTR) and bed occupancy rate (BOR) and high average hospital stay (ALoS)), 23.7 percent (95% CI: 20.1-27.8 percent) were in Zone 2, 31.7 percent (95% CI: 27.7-36 percent) in Zone 3 (good performance: high BTR and BOR and low ALoS) and 25.4 percent (95% CI: 21.7-29.5 percent) in Zone 4. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results help Iranian health policymakers to understand hospital performance, which, in turn, may lead to promoting greater awareness and policy attention to improve Iranian hospital efficiency. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This study indicated that most Iranian hospitals had sub-optimal performance. Further studies are required to understand factors that explain the country's hospital inefficiency.",International journal of health care quality assurance,2019 Mar 11,England,2019,10
27103768,Review: Increasing Awareness and Education on Health Disparities for Health Care Providers.,"The focus of this review is to highlight health care disparities and trends in several common diseases in selected populations while offering evidence-based approaches to mitigating health care disparities. Health care disparities cross many barriers and affect multiple populations and diseases. Ethnic minorities, the elderly, and those of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are more at-risk than others. However, many low SES Whites and higher SES racial minorities have poorer health than their racial or SES peers. Also, recent immigrant groups and Hispanics, in particular, maintain high health ratings. The so-called Hispanic Paradox provides an example of how culture and social background can be used to improve health outcomes. These groups have unique determinants of disparity that are based on a wide range of cultural and societal factors. Providing improved access to care and reducing the social determinants of disparity is crucial to improving public health. At the same time, for providers, increasing an understanding of the social determinants promotes better models of individualized care to encourage more equitable care. These approaches include increasing provider education on disparities encountered by different populations, practicing active listening skills, and utilizing a patient's cultural background to promote healthy behaviors.",Ethnicity & disease,2016 Apr 21,United States,2016,10
26949300,The Role of Empowerment in the Association between a Woman's Educational Status and Infant Mortality in Ethiopia: Secondary Analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys.,"BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status at national, sub-national, household, and individual levels explains a significant portion of variation in infant mortality. Women's education is among the major determinants of infant mortality. The mechanism through which a woman's own educational status, over her husband's as well as household characteristics, influences infant mortality has not been well studied in developing countries. The objective of this study was to explore the role of woman's empowerment and household wealth in the association between a woman's educational status and infant mortality. METHODS: The association between a woman's educational status and infant death, and the role of woman's empowerment and household wealth in this relationship, were examined among married women in Ethiopia through a secondary, serial cross-sectional analysis utilizing data on birth history of married women from three rounds of the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the association between woman's education and infant death, and the possible mediation or moderation roles of woman empowerment and household wealth. RESULTS: Female education and empowerment were inversely associated with infant death. The results indicated mediation by empowerment in the education-infant death association, and effect modification by household wealth. Both empowerment and education had strongest inverse association with infant death among women from the richest households. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest an important role of female empowerment in the education-infant death relation, and the complexity of these factors according to household wealth. Woman empowerment programs may prove effective as a shorter term intervention in reducing infant mortality.",Ethiopian journal of health sciences,2015 Oct,Ethiopia,2015,10
22698024,The social determinants of health and pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza severity.,"OBJECTIVES: We explored the effects of social determinants of health on pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza severity and the role of clinical risk factors in mediating such associations. METHODS: We used multivariate logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to examine the associations between individual- and ecological-level social determinants of health and hospitalization for pandemic H1N1 2009 illness in a case-control study in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: During the first pandemic phase (April 23-July 20, 2009), hospitalization was associated with having a high school education or less and living in a neighborhood with high material or total deprivation. We also observed the association with education in the second phase (August 1-November 6, 2009). Clinical risk factors for severe pandemic H1N1 2009 illness mediated approximately 39% of the observed association. CONCLUSIONS: The main clinical risk factors for severe pandemic H1N1 2009 illness explain only a portion of the associations observed between social determinants of health and hospitalization, suggesting that the means by which the social determinants of health affect pandemic H1N1 2009 outcomes extend beyond clinically recognized risk factors.",American journal of public health,2012 Aug,United States,2012,10
26975311,Evidence for Health I: Producing evidence for improving health and reducing inequities.,"In an ideal world, researchers and decision-makers would be involved from the outset in co-producing evidence, with local health needs assessments informing the research agenda and research evidence informing the actions taken to improve health. The first step in improving the health of individuals and populations is therefore gaining a better understanding of what the main health problems are, and of these, which are the most urgent priorities by using both quantitative data to develop a health portrait and qualitative data to better understand why the local population thinks that addressing certain health challenges should be prioritized in their context. Understanding the causes of these health problems often involves analytical research, such as case-control and cohort studies, or qualitative studies to better understand how more complex exposures lead to specific health problems (e.g. by interviewing local teenagers discovering that watching teachers smoke in the school yard, peer pressure, and media influence smoking initiation among youth). Such research helps to develop a logic model to better map out the proximal and distal causes of poor health and to determine potential pathways for intervening and impacting health outcomes. Rarely is there a single 'cure' or stand-alone intervention, but rather, a continuum of strategies are needed from diagnosis and treatment of patients already affected, to disease prevention, health promotion and addressing the upstream social determinants of health. Research for developing and testing more upstream interventions must often go beyond randomized controlled trials, which are expensive, less amenable to more complex interventions, and can be associated with certain ethical challenges. Indeed, a much neglected area of the research cycle is implementation and evaluation research, which often involves quasi-experimental research study designs as well as qualitative research, to better understand how to derive the greatest benefit from existing interventions and ways of maximizing health improvements in specific local contexts. There is therefore a need to alter current incentive structures within the research enterprise to place greater emphasis on implementation and evaluation research conducted in collaboration with knowledge users who are in a position to use the findings in practice to improve health.",Health research policy and systems,2016 Mar 14,England,2016,10
31148312,Health promotion for mild frailty based on behaviour change: Perceptions of older people and service providers.,"Mild frailty is common among older people, but it is potentially reversible with health promotion interventions. Behaviour change may be a key to preventing progression of frailty; however, we know little about what interventions work best and how a behaviour change approach would be perceived by this group. The aim of this study was to explore how mildly frail older people perceive health promotion based on behaviour change and what factors affect engagement with this approach. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 older people with mild frailty who received a pilot home-based behaviour change health promotion service, including a dyad of older person/family carer, and two service providers delivering the service in two diverse areas of South England. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. The concept of goal setting was acceptable to most participants, though the process of goal setting needed time and consideration. Goals on maintaining independence, monitoring of progress and receiving feedback were reported to increase motivation. Physical/mental capability and knowledge/perception of own needs were main determinants of the type of goals chosen by participants as well as the approach used by the project workers. Older people with complex needs benefited from care coordination, with a combination of goal setting and elements of social, practical and emotional support in varying proportions. Mildly frail older people responded well to a behaviour change approach to promote health and well-being. Further consideration is needed of the most effective strategies based on complexity of needs, and how to overcome barriers among people with cognitive impairment.",Health & social care in the community,2019 Sep,England,2019,10
23894210,Mass Media and Rural Out-Migration in the Context of Social Change: Evidence from Nepal.,"This work examines the influence of mass media on rural out-migration using historical and contemporary data from a setting experiencing massive social and economic development in the last half-century. Data come from the Chitwan Valley Family Study, an ongoing study of an agrarian region in rural Nepal. Media are hypothesized to affect migration by inducing attitudinal and behavioral changes similar to those of other determinants of migration. As their influence differs from other determinants in important ways, media represent a unique form of influence that should be taken into account. I find that movie and television exposure are significant determinants of out-migration in historical contexts, although television exposure was important in more contemporary contexts. Differences in these effects probably indicate the timing of the spread of each type of media and changing preferences among media consumers.","International migration (Geneva, Switzerland)",2013 Jun 1,Switzerland,2013,10
30464855,Exploring community capacity: Karen refugee women's mental health.,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe Karen refugee women's experience of resettlement and the factors which structured community capacity to support their mental health and well-being. Design/methodology/approach: A postcolonial and feminist standpoint was used to bring Karen women's voice to the knowledge production process. Data were collected through ethnographic field observation, in-depth semi-structured individual and focus group interviews with Karen women as well as healthcare and social service providers. Findings: Three interrelated themes emerged from the data: Karen women's construction of mental health as ""stress and worry""; gender, language and health literacy intersected, shaping Karen women's access to health care and social resources; flexible partnerships between settlement agencies, primary care and public health promoted community capacity but were challenged by neoliberalism. Research limitations/implications: Karen women and families are a diverse group with a unique historical context. Not all the findings are applicable across refugee women. Practical implications: This paper highlights the social determinants of mental health for Karen women and community responses for mitigating psychological distress during resettlement. Social implications: Public health policy requires a contextualized understanding of refugee women's mental health. Health promotion in resettlement must include culturally safe provision of health care to mitigate sources of psychological distress during resettlement. Originality/value: This research brings a postcolonial and feminist analysis to community capacity as a public health strategy.",International journal of human rights in healthcare,2018,England,2018,10
25807916,"Determinants of spatial behavior of a tropical forest seed predator: The roles of optimal foraging, dietary diversification, and home range defense.","Specialized seed predators in tropical forests may avoid seasonal food scarcity and interspecific feeding competition but may need to diversify their daily diet to limit ingestion of any given toxin. Seed predators may, therefore, adopt foraging strategies that favor dietary diversity and resource monitoring, rather than efficient energy intake, as suggested by optimal foraging theory. We tested whether fine-scale space use by a small-group-living seed predator-the bald-faced saki monkey (Pithecia irrorata)-reflected optimization of short-term foraging efficiency, maximization of daily dietary diversity, and/or responses to the threat of territorial encroachment by neighboring groups. Food patches across home ranges of five adjacent saki groups were widely spread, but areas with higher densities of stems or food species were not allocated greater feeding time. Foraging patterns-specifically, relatively long daily travel paths that bypassed available fruiting trees and relatively short feeding bouts in undepleted food patches-suggest a strategy that maximizes dietary diversification, rather than ""optimal"" foraging. Travel distance was unrelated to the proportion of seeds in the diet. Moreover, while taxonomically diverse, the daily diets of our study groups were no more species-rich than randomly derived diets based on co-occurring available food species. Sakis preferentially used overlapping areas of their HRs, within which adjacent groups shared many food trees, yet the density of food plants or food species in these areas was no greater than in other HR areas. The high likelihood of depletion by neighboring groups of otherwise enduring food sources may encourage monitoring of peripheral food patches in overlap areas, even if at the expense of immediate energy intake, suggesting that between-group competition is a key driver of fine-scale home range use in sakis.",American journal of primatology,2016 May,United States,2016,10
31537370,Do effects of early life interventions on linear growth correspond to effects on neurobehavioural development? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Faltering in linear growth and neurobehavioural development during early childhood are often assumed to have common causes because of their consistent association. This notion has contributed to a global focus on the promotion of nutrition during pregnancy and childhood to improve both conditions. Our aim was to assess whether effects of interventions on linear growth are associated with effects on developmental scores and to quantify these associations. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomised trials done during pregnancy and in children aged 0-5 years that reported effects of any intervention on length-for-age or height-for-age Z scores (LAZ or HAZ) and on any of the following outcomes: motor, cognitive or mental, language, and social-emotional or behavioural development. We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and PsycINFO (EBSCO) from database inception to June 25, 2019. Study-level data were extracted and, when required, authors were contacted for missing information. We calculated weighted meta-regression coefficients of the association between standardised effect sizes of interventions on LAZ or HAZ and developmental outcome scores and calculated pooled effect sizes for different types of intervention. FINDINGS: Of the 7207 studies identified, we included 75 studies with 122 comparisons between intervention and control groups and outcomes reported for 72 275 children. Across all interventions, effect sizes on LAZ or HAZ were significantly associated with effect sizes on social-emotional scores (beta 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.41; p=0.02), but not on cognitive (0.18, -0.36 to 0.72; p=0.51), language (0.12, -0.07 to 0.31; p=0.21), or motor development scores (0.23, -0.05 to 0.50; p=0.11). In studies that provided nutritional supplements, we observed positive significant pooled effect sizes on all five outcomes of LAZ or HAZ (effect size 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.09; p=0.01; n=50), cognitive or mental (0.06, 0.03-0.10; p<0.01; n=38), language (0.08, 0.03-0.13; p=0.01; n=21), motor (0.08, 0.04-0.12; p<0.01; n=41), and social-emotional (0.07, 0.02-0.12; p=0.01; n=20) scores. The effect sizes of nutritional supplementation on LAZ or HAZ scores were significantly associated with effect sizes on cognitive (beta 0.40, 95% CI 0.04-0.77; p=0.049) and motor (0.43, 0.11-0.75; p=0.01) scores. In the 14 interventions promoting responsive care and learning opportunities, the pooled effect size on LAZ or HAZ score was not significant (-0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.05; p=0.74), but pooled effect sizes on cognitive, language, and motor scores were 4 to 5 times larger (range 0.38-0.48) than the pooled effect sizes of nutritional supplementation (0.05-0.08). INTERPRETATION: In nutritional supplementation interventions, improvements in linear growth were associated with small improvements in child development, whereas nurturing and stimulation interventions had significant effects on child development but no effects on linear growth. The determinants of linear growth and neurodevelopment are only partly shared. To nurture thriving individuals and communities, interventions should specifically target determinants of neurodevelopment and not simply linear growth.

26955913,Does early communication mediate the relationship between motor ability and social function in children with cerebral palsy?,"BACKGROUND: Children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental conditions such as cerebral palsy (CP) are at risk of experiencing restrictions in social activities negatively impacting their subsequent social functioning. Research has identified motor and communication ability as being unique determinants of social function capabilities in children with CP, to date, no research has investigated whether communication is a mediator of the relationship between motor ability and social functioning. AIMS: To investigate whether early communication ability at 24 months corrected age (ca.) mediates the relationship between early motor ability at 24 months ca. and later social development at 60 months ca. in a cohort of children diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD: A cohort of 71 children (43 male) diagnosed with CP (GMFCS I=24, 33.8%, II=9, 12.7%, III=12, 16.9%, IV=10, 14.1%, V=16, 22.5%) were assessed at 24 and 60 months ca. Assessments included the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), the Communication and Symbolic Behaviour Scales-Developmental Profile (CSBS-DP) Infant-Toddler Checklist and the Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). A mediation model was examined using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Early communication skills mediated the relationship between early motor abilities and later social functioning, b=0.24 (95% CI=0.08-0.43 and the mediation model was significant, F (2, 68)=32.77, p<0.001, R(2)=0.49. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION: Early communication ability partially mediates the relationship between early motor ability and later social function in children with CP. This demonstrates the important role of early communication in ongoing social development. Early identification of communication delay and enriched language exposure is crucial in this population.",Research in developmental disabilities,2016 Jun-Jul,United States,2016,10
31701806,The regulation of recurrent negative emotion in the aftermath of a lost election.,"For some American voters, the news of Mr. Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election caused recurrent emotions that were negative, persistent, and intense enough to elicit repeated attempts at emotion regulation. This afforded a rare opportunity to analyse the regulation of recurrent emotions in a natural, non-laboratory context. The regulation of recurrent emotion involves additional considerations relative to single-instance emotion, such as representations of past and future encounters with the emotion-eliciting variables, ongoing consequences of each regulatory episode, and a tendency to repeatedly deploy emotion regulation strategies that one is most familiar with in the context of the particular recurrent emotion. Despite the ubiquitous nature of recurrent emotions, its associated regulatory processes have been infrequently examined and are not well-understood. Over eight days (11/10/16-11/18/16), we administered four surveys to 202 participants who voted against Mr. Trump. We examined the determinants and outcomes of regulatory strategies in the context of recurrent emotion. We found that (1) reappraisal (compared to distraction and acceptance) was associated with greater decline in emotion intensity, (2) high-intensity emotions were more likely to be distracted, whereas low-intensity emotions were more likely to be reappraised, and (3) strategy variability was associated with greater affective adaptation.",Cognition & emotion,2019 Nov 8,England,2019,10
29028237,The epidemiological transition in Eastern and Western Europe: a historic natural experiment.,"Background: The continent of Europe has experienced remarkable changes in the past 25 years, providing scope for natural experiments that offer insight into the complex determinants of health. Methods: We analysed trends in life expectancy at birth in three parts of Europe, those countries that were members of the European Union (EU) prior to 2004, countries that joined the European Union since then, and the twelve countries that emerged from the Soviet Union to form the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The contribution of deaths at different ages to these changes was assessed using Arriaga's method of decomposing changes in life expectancy. Results: Europe remains divided geographically, with an East-West gradient. The former Soviet countries experienced a marked initial decline in life expectancy and have only recovered after 2005. However, the situation for those of working ages is little better than in 1990. The pre-2004 EU has seen substantial gains throughout the past 25 years, although there is some evidence that this may be slowing, or even reversing, at older ages. The countries joining the EU in 2004 subsequently began to see some improvements in the early 1990s, but have experienced larger gains since 2000. Conclusions: Europe offers a valuable natural laboratory for understanding the impact of political, economic, and social changes on health. While the historic divisions of Europe are still visible, there is also evidence that individual countries are doing better or worse than their neighbours, providing many lessons that can be learned from.",European journal of public health,2017 Oct 1,England,2017,10
30641822,Association Between dietary patterns and the risk of metabolic syndrome among Iranian population: A cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: The role of dietary patterns in metabolic syndrome has not been investigated sufficiently among Iranian population. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of major dietary patterns with the risk of metabolic syndrome and its components among healthy individuals of Iran. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that was performed on 5895 men and women who participated in MASHAD study project. Factor analysis was employed to determine major dietary patterns with regard to a validated 65-item food frequency questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using international diabetes federation (IDF). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between dietary patterns and metabolic syndrome risk to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Three major dietary patterns (Balanced, Western and high carbohydrate) were identified. The Western pattern showed a positive association with metabolic syndrome (OR [95%CI] for highest vs. lowest tertile: 1.58 [1.21-2.06]; p value=0.001). The high carbohydrate dietary pattern was associated with higher metabolic syndrome risk (OR [95%CI] for highest vs. lowest tertile: 1.17 [1.02-1.33]; P value=0.022). The Balanced dietary pattern was unrelated to metabolic syndrome, but was related to some individual risk factors for metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Western and high carbohydrate patterns are associated with an increased risk for metabolic syndrome among Iranian adults. The causality of these associations needs to be confirmed.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2019 Jan - Feb,Netherlands,2019,10

Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Community-based health programs (CBHPs) with participatory approaches has been recognized as an important tool in health promotion. The goal of this study was to understand the nature of participation practice in CBHP and to use the data to advocate for more participation-friendly policies in the community, academy and funding organizations. METHODS: In this qualitative study, 13 CBHPs, which were active for last 5 years have been assessed using semi-structural in-depth interviews with programs principal and managers and focus group discussions with volunteers and service users. Data analysis was based on the deductive-inductive content analysis considering the participatory approaches in these programs. RESULTS: The results show that, the main category of participation was divided to community participation and intersectional collaboration. The community participation level was very different from ""main,"" ""advisory"" or ""supporting"" level. The process of recruitment of volunteers by the governmental organization was centralized and in non-governmental organizations was quite different. According to respondents opinion, financial and spiritual incentives especially tangible rewards, e.g., learning skills or capacity building were useful for engaging and maintaining volunteers' participation. For intersectional collaboration, strong and dedicated partners, supportive policy environment are critical. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that maintaining partnership in CBHP takes considerable time, financial support, knowledge development and capacity building.",International journal of preventive medicine,2014 Jun,Iran,2014,10
27228112,"Immigration Stress and Alcohol Use Severity Among Recently Immigrated Hispanic Adults: Examining Moderating Effects of Gender, Immigration Status, and Social Support.","OBJECTIVE: Identifying and understanding determinants of alcohol use behavior among Hispanic immigrants is an increasingly significant public health concern. Although prior research has examined associations of cultural stressors with alcohol use among Hispanics, few studies have tested these associations among recent adult immigrants. As such, this study aimed to examine (a) the association of immigration stress on alcohol use severity among recently immigrated Hispanic adults (</= 1 year in the United States) and (b) the moderating effects of gender, immigration status, and social support. METHOD: A hierarchical multiple regression and moderation analyses were conducted on a sample of 527 participants in South Florida. RESULTS: Results indicated that, after controlling for demographic variables, preimmigration drinking behavior, and dimensions of social support, the association of higher immigration stress with higher alcohol use severity was statistically significant. Moderation analyses indicated that immigration stress had a statistically significant association with alcohol use severity among men, but not women. Also, dimensions of social support consistently reduced the deleterious effect of immigration stress on alcohol use severity. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the scarce literature on cultural stressors and alcohol use among recent Hispanic immigrants. Findings suggest that it may be important to design gender-specific interventions and that increasing levels of social support may offset the effects of immigration stress on alcohol use.",Journal of clinical psychology,2017 Mar,United States,2017,10
28877862,Effectiveness of a Web-Based Tailored Intervention With Virtual Assistants Promoting the Acceptability of HPV Vaccination Among Mothers of Invited Girls: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: In 2010, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was introduced in the Dutch National Immunization Program for 12-year-old girls, aiming to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in women. HPV vaccination uptake turned out to be lower than expected: 61% versus 70%, respectively. Mothers were shown to play the most important role in the immunization decision about this vaccination. They had also expressed their need for interactive personal information about the HPV vaccination over and above the existing universal general information. To improve the effectiveness of the existing education about the HPV vaccination, we systematically developed a Web-based tailored intervention with virtual assistants providing mothers of girls to be invited with tailored feedback on their decision making about the HPV vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Web-based tailored intervention for promoting HPV vaccination acceptance by means of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: Mothers were recruited via the Dutch vaccination register (Praeventis) (n=36,000) and three Web-based panels (n=2483). Those who gave informed consent (N=8062) were randomly assigned to the control (n=4067) or intervention condition (n=3995). HPV vaccination uptake, as registered by Praeventis once the HPV vaccination round was completed, was used as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were differential scores across conditions between baseline (before the provided access to the new tailored intervention) and follow-up (just before the first vaccination) regarding the mothers' degree of informed decision making (IDM), decisional conflict, and critical determinants of HPV vaccination uptake among which are intention, attitude, risk perception, and outcome beliefs. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis (N=8062) showed a significant positive effect of the intervention on IDM, decisional conflict, and nearly all determinants of HPV vaccination uptake (P<.001). No effect was found on uptake (P=.60). This may be attributed to the overall high uptake rates in both conditions. Mothers evaluated the intervention as highly positive, including the website as well as the virtual assistants that were used to deliver the tailored feedback. CONCLUSIONS: This computer-tailored intervention has the potential to improve HPV vaccination acceptability and IDM and to decrease decisional conflict among mothers of invited girls. Implications for future research are discussed.

30560946,"Temporal and spatial distribution of under-five mortality and factors associated with multiple cases of under-five deaths within a family in the rural area of Khuzestan, Southern Iran.","Under-five mortality (U5M) is an important indicator of the overall health and development of society. There is a wide gap in U5M among different countries and also within the countries. This study was carried out to assess the prevalence, as well as the socio-demographic, and health-related causes of U5M in the region of study. A cross-sectional study was conducted among all registered cases of U5M in rural areas of Khuzestan province, Iran, during the years 2011 to 2015. To assess the socio-demographic determinants of U5M, the sample surveyed consists of 320 families with at least one under-five death using a multistage random sampling method. Also, this study evaluated the number of variables, which may increase the chance of families to have more than one U5M. U5M was 26 per 1000 live births in 2011, but decreased to 22 per 1000 live births in 2015. With the highest cumulative incidence of 43 in Masjed Soleyman and the lowest of 15 in Dehdez, infant mortality constitutes 76% of all U5M. Prematurity and congenital anomalies were responsible for 46% of all causes of mortality (that is, U5). Maternal age at delivery <18 years or >35 years (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 1.29-6.22), marriage duration >9 years (1.85, 1.06-3.21), spouse age gap >5 years (2.32, 1.20-4.50), cesarean section (3.85, 1.19-5.74), delivery interval <3 years (2.83, 1.22-5.58), non-Arab ethnicity (2.58, 1.50-4.44), and mother working in agriculture or animal husbandry (3.93, 1.41-6.94) were the most important determinants associated with more than one child death per family. Spatially, there was a great disparity in U5M with different reduction rate during the 5 years of the study. Marriage age, cesarean delivery, delivery interval, and mother field activity were associated with U5M. This may have implications for the preventive health program.",Scientific reports,2018 Dec 18,England,2018,10

We used adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess VS by race/ethnicity and generalized estimating equations to investigate factors associated with not achieving VS and ART non-adherence. Among 426 women (median age = 46 years), at baseline, VS was less prevalent among black women (63%) compared with Hispanic women/Latinas (73%) and white women (78%). In the multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with not achieving VS included the following social and behavioral determinants of care: using public insurance (aPR = 1.69, CI 1.01-2.82, p = 0.044) compared to using private insurance, seeking care in a public clinic (aPR = 1.60, CI 1.03-2.50, p = 0.037) compared to seeking care in a private clinic, and ART non-adherence (aPR = 2.79, CI 1.81-4.29), p < 0.001). Although race was not a significant factor in not achieving VS, race was associated with ART non-adherence; black women were more likely to miss a dose of ART medication (aPR = 2.07, CI 1.19-3.60, p = 0.010) when compared to white women and Hispanic women/Latinas.

The sample of this study is composed of 500 people, randomly selected from the major day centers for the elderly in the province of Granada (Spain). Method: For the inferential analysis, we used the CUBRECAVI questionnaire, which is a multidimensional scale of health and quality of life, along with the Katz and Garcia measure questionnaires, which are also applied to quality of life. Through the technique of the interview, we have distributed the participants into two groups: experimental and control. Results and Conclusions: Once the tests have been completed, we have concluded from the meta-analysis and validation tests that the participants have a good perception of their quality of life, considering health, leisure, environmental quality, functional capacity, level of satisfaction, social support, social networks, and positive social interactions as the determinants of their well-being, although social contact reduces as the age advances. We conclude that multidimensional evaluation is an effective tool to evaluate the quality of life and the objective and subjective health of the elderly.

In the quantitative part, the psychometric properties of the questionnaire were evaluated. Findings The initial questionnaire with 128 items was reviewed by the research team and taking into account the cut-off point 1.5 for the item impact and 0.62 for the content validity ratio (CVR), the number of questions fell to 82 items. S-CVR and S-content validity index (CVI) rations were 0.83 and 0.91, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis led to 74 items in seven dimensions. The alpha Cronbach's coefficient for the whole questionnaire was 0.895 and the intra-cluster correlation coefficient was 0.91. Conclusion The questionnaire developed in this study is reliable and valid for assessing female adolescents' sexual and reproductive self-care.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2019 Apr 11,Germany,2019,10
25667156,Are hospital process quality indicators influenced by socio-demographic health determinants.,"BACKGROUND: This population-level health service study aimed to address whether hospitals assure the same quality of care to people in equal need, i.e. to see if any associations exist between social determinants and adherence to four hospital process indicators clearly identified as being linked to better health outcomes for patients. PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study based on administrative data collected in the Veneto Region (northeast Italy). We included residents of the Veneto Region hospitalized for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), hip fracture, or cholecystitis, and women giving birth, who were discharged from any hospital operating under the Veneto Regional Health Service between January 2012 and December 2012. METHOD: The following quality indicator rates were calculated: patients with STEMI-AMI treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, elderly patients with hip fractures who underwent surgery within 48 h of admission, laparoscopic cholecystectomies and women who underwent cesarean section. A multilevel, multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to test the association between age, gender, formal education or citizenship and the quality of hospital care processes. RESULTS: All the inpatient hospital care process quality indicators measured were associated with an undesirable number of disparities concerning the social determinants. CONCLUSION: Monitoring the evidence-based hospital health care process indicators reveals undesirable disparities. Administrative data sets are of considerable practical value in broad-based quality assessments and as a screening tool, also in the health disparities domain.",European journal of public health,2015 Oct,England,2015,10
27439229,INCREASING DIVERSITY IN OUR SCHOOLS OF NURSING.,"This article will review one school's quest to address the multi-level social, historical, environmental and structural determinants faced by under-represented ethnic minorities (UREM) and disadvantaged background (DB) students as they seek entrance into a nursing program. Nursing Network Careers and Technology (NN-CAT) provides a nursing career network for underrepresented and disadvantaged students in western North Carolina and has increased the number of underrepresented and disadvantaged students who are admitted, retained and graduate with a bachelor's degree in nursing from Western Carolina University. Initial data from this NN-CAT program have demonstrated that addressing social determinants and eliminating barriers can increase the number of UREM and educationally disadvantaged students who successfully matriculate in our schools of Nursing and subsequently graduate. These nurses then enter the workforce and provide culturally meaningful care in their local communities.",Journal of cultural diversity,2016 Summer,United States,2016,10
28218688,Determinants of Health Care Services Utilization among First Generation Afghan Migrants in Istanbul.,"There is insufficient empirical evidence on the correlates of health care utilization of irregular migrants currently living in Turkey. The aim of this study was to identify individual level determinants associated with health service and medication use. One hundred and fifty-five Afghans completed surveys assessing service utilization including encounters with primary care physicians and outpatient specialists in addition to the use of prescription and nonprescription medicines. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to examine associations between service use and a range of predisposing, enabling, and perceived need factors. Health services utilization was lowest for outpatient specialists (20%) and highest for nonprescription medications (37%). Female gender and higher income predicted encounters with primary care physicians. Income, and other enabling factors such as family presence in Turkey predicted encounters with outpatient specialists. Perceived illness-related need factors had little to no influence on use of services; however, asylum difficulties increased the likelihood for encounters with primary care physicians, outpatient services, and the use of prescription medications. This study suggests that health services use among Afghan migrants in Turkey is low considering the extent of their perceived illness-related needs, which may be further exacerbated by the precarious conditions in which they live.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2017 Feb 17,Switzerland,2017,10
31208708,"""We're doing the best job we can"": maternal experiences of facilitators and barriers to preschoolers sleeping well in Aotearoa/New Zealand.","OBJECTIVES: This study considered sleep from a social determinants of health and socioecological perspective. It aimed to explore facilitators and barriers to 4-year-old children sleeping well, as experienced by Maori and non-Maori mothers, with low and high socioeconomic position (SEP), in Aotearoa/New Zealand. DESIGN: Experiential qualitative research involving face-to-face, semistructured individual interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen Maori (low SEP=7; high SEP=8) and 16 non-Maori (low SEP=7; high SEP=9) mothers of preschoolers. MEASUREMENTS: Interviews were guided by questions about how preschoolers slept and what mothers thought made a difference to their child's sleep. Data were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: ""health, activity, and diet""; ""sleep-promoting physical environments""; ""consistency""; and ""doing it our way."" Children being healthy and active, sleep-conducive bedroom spaces, consistent routines, and supportive social environments assisted preschoolers to sleep well. However, broader contextual factors beyond mothers' control influenced the degree of autonomy they had over implementing sleep-supporting strategies that worked for their families. External influences included access to financial resources; parental work patterns; early childhood education service practices; access to quality housing; and affordable, culturally responsive, and respectful professional sleep advice. CONCLUSION: Efforts aimed at facilitating healthy sleep among preschoolers and effective preschooler sleep interventions must go beyond simply recommending individual-focused sleep-promoting tips to include actions on the social determinants of sleep and the sociopolitical drivers that influence these.",Sleep health,2019 Jun,United States,2019,10
27229682,'Let's Move It' - a school-based multilevel intervention to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour among older adolescents in vocational secondary schools: a study protocol for a cluster-randomised trial.,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) has been shown to decline during adolescence, and those with lower education have lower levels of activity already at this age, calling for targeted efforts for them. No previous study has demonstrated lasting effects of school-based PA interventions among older adolescents. Furthermore, these interventions have rarely targeted sedentary behaviour (SB) despite its relevance to health. The Let's Move It trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of a school-based, multi-level intervention, on PA and SB, among vocational school students. We hypothesise that the intervention is effective in increasing moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), particularly among those with low or moderate baseline levels, and decreasing SB among all students. METHODS: The design is a cluster-randomised parallel group trial with an internal pilot study. The trial is conducted in six vocational schools in the Helsinki Metropolitan area, Finland. The intervention is carried out in 30 intervention classes, and 27 control classes retain the standard curriculum. The randomisation occurs at school-level to avoid contamination and to aid delivery. Three of the six schools, randomly allocated, receive the 'Let's Move It' intervention which consists of 1) group sessions and poster campaign targeting students' autonomous PA motivation and self-regulation skills, 2) sitting reduction in classrooms via alterations in choice architecture and teacher behaviour, and 3) enhancement of PA opportunities in school, home and community environments. At baseline, student participants are blind to group allocation. The trial is carried out in six batches in 2015-2017, with main measurements at pre-intervention baseline, and 2-month and 14-month follow-ups. Primary outcomes are for PA, MVPA measured by accelerometry and self-report, and for SB, sedentary time and breaks in sedentary time (accelerometry). Key secondary outcomes include measured body composition, self-reported well-being, and psychological variables. Process variables include measures of psychosocial determinants of PA (e.g. autonomous motivation) and use of behaviour change techniques. Process evaluation also includes qualitative interviews. Intervention fidelity is monitored. DISCUSSION: The study will establish whether the Let's Move It intervention is effective in increasing PA and reducing SB in vocational school students, and identify key processes explaining the results.

31639012,Depression in ankylosing spondylitis and the role of disease-related and contextual factors: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have a higher prevalence of depression compared to the general population. Comorbid depression in AS likely has a multifactorial origin. While several disease-related and contextual factors have been associated with depressive symptoms in AS, a comprehensive model of their interrelations is currently lacking. Such a model could help understand the mechanisms leading to, or maintaining, depression in AS. The objectives of the current study were to determine which factors are associated with depressive symptoms in AS and to understand their underlying relationships. METHODS: Data from a cross-sectional survey-based multicentre study were used. Potential determinants included both contextual and disease-related factors. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Subscale (HADS-D). Direct and indirect associations between risk factors and the latent depressive symptom outcome were explored using structural equation modelling. A final model was selected based on model fit criteria and clinical plausibility. RESULTS: Among 245 patients, median HADS-D score was 3 (interquartile range 1-6), and 44 patients (18%) had a HADS-D score >/= 8, indicating possible depression. In the final model, contextual factors significantly associated with depressive symptoms were male gender, being employed, lower income, lower mastery and worse satisfaction with social role participation. Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) was the only disease-related factor that was associated with depressive symptoms, acted only indirectly via mastery, and its standardized total effect on depressive symptoms was smaller than that of several contextual factors. Mastery had a central role in the path diagram and mediated the effects of BASDAI, income and satisfaction with social role participation on depressive symptoms. The final model explained 64% of the variance in the depression outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Both contextual and disease-related factors are associated with depressive symptoms in AS. Mastery, the extent to which one feels in control over life and disease, has a key role in this process. Results support a relevance of self-efficacy in disease management and patient education. In order to improve patients' mental health, research is warranted whether mastery and its relation with depression can be modified.",Arthritis research & therapy,2019 Oct 21,England,2019,10
22682665,Sociodemographic and cultural determinants of sleep deficiency: implications for cardiometabolic disease risk.,"Sleep is a biological imperative associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. As such, a thorough discussion of the sociocultural and demographic determinants of sleep is warranted, if not overdue. This paper begins with a brief review of the laboratory and epidemiologic evidence linking sleep deficiency, which includes insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, with increased risk of chronic cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Identification of the determinants of sleep deficiency is the critical next step to understanding the role sleep plays in human variation in health and disease. Therefore, the majority of this paper describes the different biopsychosocial determinants of sleep, including age, gender, psychosocial factors (depression, stress and loneliness), socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity. In addition, because sleep duration is partly determined by behavior, it will be shaped by cultural values, beliefs and practices. Therefore, possible cultural differences that may impact sleep are discussed. If certain cultural, ethnic or social groups are more likely to experience sleep deficiency, then these differences in sleep could increase their risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Furthermore, if the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of sleep deficiency in certain populations can be identified, interventions could be developed to target these mechanisms, reduce sleep differences and potentially reduce cardiometabolic disease risk.",Social science & medicine (1982),2013 Feb,England,2013,10
26526164,County Health Rankings: Relationships Between Determinant Factors and Health Outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: The County Health Rankings (CHR) provides data for nearly every county in the U.S. on four modifiable groups of health factors, including healthy behaviors, clinical care, physical environment, and socioeconomic conditions, and on health outcomes such as length and quality of life. The purpose of this study was to empirically estimate the strength of association between these health factors and health outcomes and to describe the performance of the CHR model factor weightings by state. METHODS: Data for the current study were from the 2015 CHR. Thirty-five measures for 45 states were compiled into four health factors composite scores and one health outcomes composite score. The relative contributions of health factors to health outcomes were estimated using hierarchical linear regression modeling in March 2015. County population size; rural/urban status; and gender, race, and age distributions were included as control variables. RESULTS: Overall, the relative contributions of socioeconomic factors, health behaviors, clinical care, and the physical environment to the health outcomes composite score were 47%, 34%, 16%, and 3%, respectively. Although the CHR model performed better in some states than others, these results provide broad empirical support for the CHR model and weightings. CONCLUSIONS: This paper further provides a framework by which to prioritize health-related investments, and a call to action for healthcare providers and the schools that educate them. Realizing the greatest improvements in population health will require addressing the social and economic determinants of health.",American journal of preventive medicine,2016 Feb,Netherlands,2016,10
31679073,"Incidental Alcohol Appearances in Advertisements on City Buses in Manhattan, New York City: A Descriptive Study.","This paper describes incidental exposure to alcohol in advertisements on buses in Manhattan, New York City. From April to July 2019, researchers observed advertisements on all bus lines in Manhattan and coded the content of these advertisements, including the kinds of products and services advertised and whether alcoholic beverages or images were present. Despite a ban on direct alcohol beverage advertising within the Metropolitan Transit Authority in 2017 (and expanded in 2019), almost one in five of the 136 advertisements observed (n = 25) included incidental exposure to images of alcohol portrayed in a favorable way and/or associated with well-known movie stars and television personalities. Advertisements on city buses are unlike any other, as they traverse the city streets and create considerable exposure to residents, including youth. This study demonstrates that banning advertisements for alcohol will not necessarily restrict favorable images containing alcohol and that youth continue to be exposed to these images.",Journal of community health,2019 Nov 2,Netherlands,2019,10
23842129,The increase in global HIV epidemics in MSM.,"Epidemics of HIV in MSM continue to expand in most low, middle, and upper income countries in 2013 and rates of new infection have been consistently high among young MSM. Current prevention and treatment strategies are insufficient for this next wave of HIV spread. We conducted a series of comprehensive reviews of HIV prevalence and incidence, risks for HIV, prevention and care, stigma and discrimination, and policy and advocacy options. The high per act transmission probability of receptive anal intercourse, sex role versatility among MSM, network level effects, and social and structural determinants play central roles in disproportionate disease burdens. HIV can be transmitted through large MSM networks at great speed. Molecular epidemiologic data show marked clustering of HIV in MSM networks, and high proportions of infections due to transmission from recent infections. Prevention strategies that lower biological risks, including those using antiretrovirals, offer promise for epidemic control, but are limited by structural factors including, discrimination, criminalization, and barriers to healthcare. Subepidemics, including among racial and ethnic minority MSM in the United States and UK, are particularly severe and will require culturally tailored efforts. For the promise of new and combined bio-behavioral interventions to be realized, clinically competent healthcare is necessary and community leadership, engagement, and empowerment are likely to be key. Addressing the expanding epidemics of HIV in MSM will require continued research, increased resources, political will, policy change, structural reform, community engagement, and strategic planning and programming, but it can and must be done.","AIDS (London, England)",2013 Nov 13,England,2013,10

26377091,Experience and lessons from health impact assessment for human rights impact assessment.,"As globalisation has opened remote parts of the world to foreign investment, global leaders at the United Nations and beyond have called on multinational companies to foresee and mitigate negative impacts on the communities surrounding their overseas operations. This movement towards corporate impact assessment began with a push for environmental and social inquiries. It has been followed by demands for more detailed assessments, including health and human rights. In the policy world the two have been joined as a right-to-health impact assessment. In the corporate world, the right-to-health approach fulfils neither managers' need to comprehensively understand impacts of a project, nor rightsholders' need to know that the full suite of their human rights will be safe from violation. Despite the limitations of a right-to-health tool for companies, integration of health into human rights provides numerous potential benefits to companies and the communities they affect. Here, a detailed health analysis through the human rights lens is carried out, drawing on a case study from the United Republic of Tanzania. This paper examines the positive and negative health and human rights impacts of a corporate operation in a low-income setting, as viewed through the human rights lens, considering observations on the added value of the approach. It explores the relationship between health impact assessment (HIA) and human rights impact assessment (HRIA). First, it considers the ways in which HIA, as a study directly concerned with human welfare, is a more appropriate guide than environmental or social impact assessment for evaluating human rights impacts. Second, it considers the contributions HRIA can make to HIA, by viewing determinants of health not as direct versus indirect, but as interrelated.",BMC international health and human rights,2015 Sep 16,England,2015,10
27032097,"Hepatitis B Infection, Viral Load and Resistance in HIV-Infected Patients in Mozambique and Zambia.","BACKGROUND: Few data on the virological determinants of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are available from southern Africa. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive HIV-infected adult patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) at two urban clinics in Zambia and four rural clinics in Northern Mozambique between May 2013 and August 2014. HBsAg screening was performed using the Determine(R) rapid test. Quantitative real-time PCR and HBV sequencing were performed in HBsAg-positive patients. Risk factors for HBV infection were evaluated using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests and associations between baseline characteristics and high level HBV replication explored in multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight of 1,032 participants in Mozambique (7.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1-9.3) and 90 of 797 in Zambia (11.3%, 95% CI: 9.3-13.4) were HBsAg-positive. HBsAg-positive individuals were less likely to be female compared to HBsAg-negative ones (52.3% vs. 66.1%, p<0.001). Among 156 (92.9%) HBsAg-positive patients with an available measurement, median HBV viral load was 13,645 IU/mL (interquartile range: 192-8,617,488 IU/mL) and 77 (49.4%) had high values (>20,000 UI/mL). HBsAg-positive individuals had higher levels of ALT and AST compared to HBsAg-negative ones (both p<0.001). In multivariable analyses, male sex (adjusted odds ratio: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.22-5.53) and CD4 cell count below 200/mul (2.58, 1.20-5.54) were associated with high HBV DNA. HBV genotypes A1 (58.8%) and E (38.2%) were most prevalent. Four patients had probable resistance to lamivudine and/or entecavir. CONCLUSION: One half of HBsAg-positive patients demonstrated high HBV viremia, supporting the early initiation of tenofovir-containing ART in HIV/HBV-coinfected adults.",PloS one,2016,United States,2016,10
27599912,Investigation into effects of work-related quality of life and some related factors on cognitive failures among nurses.,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive failure is one of the factors which can be influenced by personal and professional characteristics. This research was carried out to study the effect of work-related quality of life (WRQoL) and some related factors on cognitive failures (CF) among nurses. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses working in intensive care units, critical care units and emergency units in 2014. RESULTS: In total, 750 nurses participated in the study. The mean +/- SD for the total CF and WRQoL was 40.5 +/- 12.7 and 75.8 +/- 13.7 respectively. The results show that CF have a statistically significant difference among the age groups, experience groups and working units. Multiple regression tests show that age, income and WRQoL have a significant effect on CF. Based on the results, for a unit increase in WRQoL we expect a 0.26 unit decrease in CF. Analysis of variance results show that the emergency ward had changed the overall effect of WRQoL on CF, after the effect of WRQoL was controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Overall results from the present research indicated that, despite the high level of WRQoL among the studied nurses, the rate of CF was not at an appropriate level. Development of supportive and interventional strategies is highly recommended.",International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,2017 Sep,England,2017,10
25270828,Forgoing dental care for economic reasons in Switzerland: a six-year cross-sectional population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: While oral health is part of general health and well-being, oral health disparities nevertheless persist. Potential mechanisms include socioeconomic factors that may influence access to dental care in the absence of universal dental care insurance coverage. We investigated the evolution, prevalence and determinants (including socioeconomic) of forgoing of dental care for economic reasons in a Swiss region, over the course of six years. METHODS: Repeated population-based surveys (2007-2012) of a representative sample of the adult population of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. Forgone dental care, socioeconomic and insurance status, marital status, and presence of dependent children were assessed using standardized methods. RESULTS: A total of 4313 subjects were included, 10.6% (457/4313) of whom reported having forgone dental care for economic reasons in the previous 12 months. The crude percentage varied from 2.4% in the wealthiest group (monthly income >/= 13,000 CHF, 1 CHF approximately 1$) to 23.5% among participants with the lowest income (<3,000 CHF). Since 2007/8, forgoing dental care remained stable overall, but in subjects with a monthly income of <3,000 CHF, the adjusted percentage increased from 16.3% in 2007/8 to 20.6% in 2012 (P trend = 0.002). Forgoing dental care for economic reasons was independently associated with lower income, younger age, female gender, current smoking, having dependent children, divorced status and not living with a partner, not having a supplementary health insurance, and receipt of a health insurance premium cost-subsidy. CONCLUSIONS: In a Swiss region without universal dental care insurance coverage, prevalence of forgoing dental care for economic reasons was high and highly dependent on income. Efforts should be made to prevent high-risk populations from forgoing dental care.",BMC oral health,2014 Sep 30,England,2014,10
26515684,Association of rule of law and health outcomes: an ecological study.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore whether the rule of law is a foundational determinant of health that underlies other socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that have been associated with health outcomes. SETTING: Global project. PARTICIPANTS: Data set of 96 countries, comprising 91% of the global population. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The following health indicators, infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, life expectancy, and cardiovascular disease and diabetes mortality rate, were included to explore their association with the rule of law. We used a novel Rule of Law Index, gathered from survey sources, in a cross-sectional and ecological design. The Index is based on eight subindices: (1) Constraints on Government Powers; (2) Absence of Corruption; (3) Order and Security; (4) Fundamental Rights; (5) Open Government; (6) Regulatory Enforcement, (7) Civil Justice; and (8) Criminal Justice. RESULTS: The rule of law showed an independent association with infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, life expectancy, and cardiovascular disease and diabetes mortality rate, after adjusting for the countries' level of per capita income, their expenditures in health, their level of political and civil freedom, their Gini measure of inequality and women's status (p<0.05). Rule of law remained significant in all the multivariate models, and the following adjustment for potential confounders remained robust for at least one or more of the health outcomes across all eight subindices of the rule of law. Findings show that the higher the country's level of adherence to the rule of law, the better the health of the population. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to start considering the country's adherence to the rule of law as a foundational determinant of health. Health advocates should consider the improvement of rule of law as a tool to improve population health. Conversely, lack of progress in rule of law may constitute a structural barrier to health improvement.",BMJ open,2015 Oct 29,England,2015,10
23202764,Addressing social determinants of health by integrating assessment of caregiver-child attachment into community based primary health care in urban Kenya.,"A principle strategic insight of the Final Report for WHO's Commission on Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) is that the nurturant qualities of the environments where children grow up, live, and learn matter the most for their development. A key determinant of early childhood development is the establishment of a secure attachment between a caregiver and child. We report initial field-tests of the integration of caregiver-child attachment assessment by community health workers (CHWs) as a routine component of Primary Health Care (PHC), focusing on households with children under 5 years of age in three slum communities near Nairobi, Kenya. Of the 2,560 children assessed from July-December 2010, 2,391 (90.2%) were assessed as having a secure attachment with a parent or other caregiver, while 259 (9.8%) were assessed as being at risk for having an insecure attachment. Parent workshops were provided as a primary intervention, with re-enforcement of teachings by CHWs on subsequent home visits. Reassessment of attachment by CHWs showed positive changes. Assessment of caregiver-child attachment in the setting of routine home visits by CHWs in a community-based PHC context is feasible and may yield valuable insights into household-level risks, a critical step for understanding and addressing the SDOH.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2012 Oct 12,Switzerland,2012,10
24217855,Dynamic social networks in recovery homes.,"Acute treatment aftercare in the form of sober living environments-i.e., recovery houses-provide an inexpensive and effective medium-term treatment alternative for many with substance use disorders. Limited evidence suggests that house-situated social relationships and associated social support are critical determinants of how successful these residential experiences are for their members, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying these relationships. This study explored the feasibility of using dynamic social network modeling to understand house-situated longitudinal associations among individual Alcoholics Anonymous related recovery behaviors, length of residence, dyadic interpersonal trust, and dyadic confidant relationship formation processes. Trust and confidant relationships were measured 3 months apart in U.S. urban-area recovery houses, all of which were part of a network of substance use recovery homes. A stochastic actor-based model was successfully estimated from this data set. Results suggest that confidant relationships are predicted by trust, while trust is affected by recovery behaviors and length of residence. Conceptualizing recovery houses as a set of independent, evolving social networks that can be modeled jointly appears to be a promising direction for research.",American journal of community psychology,2014 Jun,England,2014,10
30167700,"Global Mortality From Firearms, 1990-2016.","Importance: Understanding global variation in firearm mortality rates could guide prevention policies and interventions. Objective: To estimate mortality due to firearm injury deaths from 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries and territories. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used deidentified aggregated data including 13812 location-years of vital registration data to generate estimates of levels and rates of death by age-sex-year-location. The proportion of suicides in which a firearm was the lethal means was combined with an estimate of per capita gun ownership in a revised proxy measure used to evaluate the relationship between availability or access to firearms and firearm injury deaths. Exposures: Firearm ownership and access. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cause-specific deaths by age, sex, location, and year. Results: Worldwide, it was estimated that 251000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 195000-276000) people died from firearm injuries in 2016, with 6 countries (Brazil, United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala) accounting for 50.5% (95% UI, 42.2%-54.8%) of those deaths. In 1990, there were an estimated 209000 (95% UI, 172000 to 235000) deaths from firearm injuries. Globally, the majority of firearm injury deaths in 2016 were homicides (64.0% [95% UI, 54.2%-68.0%]; absolute value, 161000 deaths [95% UI, 107000-182000]); additionally, 27% were firearm suicide deaths (67500 [95% UI, 55400-84100]) and 9% were unintentional firearm deaths (23000 [95% UI, 18200-24800]). From 1990 to 2016, there was no significant decrease in the estimated global age-standardized firearm homicide rate (-0.2% [95% UI, -0.8% to 0.2%]). Firearm suicide rates decreased globally at an annualized rate of 1.6% (95% UI, 1.1-2.0), but in 124 of 195 countries and territories included in this study, these levels were either constant or significant increases were estimated. There was an annualized decrease of 0.9% (95% UI, 0.5%-1.3%) in the global rate of age-standardized firearm deaths from 1990 to 2016. Aggregate firearm injury deaths in 2016 were highest among persons aged 20 to 24 years (for men, an estimated 34700 deaths [95% UI, 24900-39700] and for women, an estimated 3580 deaths [95% UI, 2810-4210]). Estimates of the number of firearms by country were associated with higher rates of firearm suicide (P < .001; R2 = 0.21) and homicide (P < .001; R2 = 0.35). Conclusions and Relevance: This study estimated between 195000 and 276000 firearm injury deaths globally in 2016, the majority of which were firearm homicides. Despite an overall decrease in rates of firearm injury death since 1990, there was variation among countries and across demographic subgroups.",JAMA,2018 Aug 28,United States,2018,10

AIMS: To explore the differences in various psychosocial work exposures between 31 European countries. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 14,881 male and 14,799 female workers from the 2005 European Working Conditions Survey. Eighteen psychosocial work factors were studied: low decision latitude (skill discretion and decision authority), high psychological demands, job strain, low social support, iso-strain, physical violence, sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination, work-family imbalance, long working hours, high effort, job insecurity, low job promotion, low reward and effort-reward imbalance. Covariates were age, number of workers in household, occupation, economic activity, self-employed/employee, public/private sector and part/full time work. Statistical analysis was performed using multilevel logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in all psychosocial work factors were observed between countries. The rank of the countries varied according to the exposure considered. However, some countries, especially Denmark, Netherlands and Norway, displayed a significantly lower prevalence of exposure to four factors or more, while some Southern and Eastern countries, especially Czech Republic, Greece, Lithuania and Turkey, had a higher prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in psychosocial work exposures were found between countries. This study is the first to compare a large set of psychosocial work exposures between 31 European countries. These findings may be useful to guide prevention policies at European level.","Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",2012 Apr,England,2012,10
28732433,The Effect of Salt Space on Clinical Findings and Peak Expiratory Flow in Children with Mild to Moderate Asthma: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"The asthma treatment and control might be associated with significant burden on family and community' thus exploring other therapeutic plans could be desirable. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of salt space on clinical findings and peak expiratory flow rate among children with asthma. In this randomized crossover trial, 34 patients aged 6-14 years old with mild to moderate asthma were selected and randomly divided into two groups. The first group went through a period of salt therapy by staying in the salt room for one hour, three times a week for 3 consecutive weeks and then was under observation for three weeks. This process was reversed for the second group (three weeks under observation followed by salt therapy). The wash-out period was one week. During the study, the morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), the frequency of coughing, wheezing, dyspnea and use of rescue medications were measured. Salt therapy had a significant effect on raising the morning and evening PEF in the second week in both groups (p=0.028 and p=0.032, respectively). However, there was no significant effect on PEF variabilities' cough' wheezing, dyspnea, and the frequency of rescue medication (p>0.05). No side effect was observed during salt therapy. This study showed the significant effect of salt therapy on PEF rate of the patients in the second week. However, further studies with different frequency and time of salt therapy on respiratory disorders are recommended.","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",2017 Jun,Iran,2017,10
21713523,Determinants of 40-year all-cause mortality in the European cohorts of the Seven Countries Study.,"If a few risk factors had predictive power for all-cause mortality in different geographical-cultural areas, then preventive efforts might be concentrated on these. Thirteen potential risk factors were measured in 6,554 men aged 40-59 around 1960 in Northern, Southern and Eastern European areas of the Seven Countries Study. In 40 years 85.3% of men died in the pooled areas (87.9, 81.8 and 87.9% in Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe, respectively). Six risk factors were significant predictors of events in all three areas: directly for age, smoking habits, mean blood pressure, heart rate and ECG abnormalities; inversely for forced expiratory volume. In a pooled model also father and mother life status, socio-economic status, and arm circumference (the last one in an inverse way) had significant coefficients that were not heterogeneous across areas (except for socio-economic status). Serum cholesterol was around significance. ROC curves had values of 0.833, 0.806 and 0.819 respectively in Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe, and 0.827 in the pooled areas. Correlation coefficients between observed and expected cases in deciles of estimated risk were between 0.98 and 0.99. Survivors after 40 years in the lower half of the estimated risk were 10.7, 23.6 and 13.3% in Northern, Southern and Eastern Europe, respectively. Under- or over-estimate of cross-applying risk functions did not exceed 15%. All-cause mortality and survival in middle aged men during 40 years were strongly associated with a few, mainly cardiovascular, risk factors, whose predictive power was similar in different cultures across Europe.",European journal of epidemiology,2011 Aug,Netherlands,2011,10
30783033,"Burden, Access, and Disparities in Kidney Disease.","Kidney disease is a global public health problem, affecting over 750 million persons worldwide. The burden of kidney disease varies substantially across the world. In many settings, rates of kidney disease and the provision of its care are defined by socioeconomic, cultural, and political factors leading to significant disparities. World Kidney Day 2019 offers an opportunity to raise awareness of kidney disease and highlight disparities in its burden and current state of global capacity for prevention and management. Here, we highlight the need for strengthening basic infrastructure for kidney care services for early detection and management of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease across all countries and advocate for more pragmatic approaches to providing renal replacement therapies. Achieving universal health coverage worldwide by 2030 is a World Health Organization Sustainable Development Goal. While universal health coverage may not include all elements of kidney care in all countries, understanding what is locally feasible and important with a focus on reducing the burden and consequences of kidney disease would be an important step towards achieving kidney health equity.",Nephron,2019,Switzerland,2019,10
30225337,Inequalities in mental health and well-being in a time of austerity: Follow-up findings from the Stockton-on-Tees cohort study.,"In response to the 2007/8 financial crisis and the subsequent 'Great Recession', the UK government pursued a policy of austerity, characterised by public spending cuts and reductions in working-age welfare benefits. This paper reports on a case study of the effects of this policy on local inequalities in mental health and wellbeing in the local authority of Stockton-on-Tees in the North East of England, an area with very high spatial and socio-economic inequalities. Follow-up findings from a prospective cohort study of the gap in mental health and wellbeing between the most and least deprived neighbourhoods of Stockton-on-Tees is presented. It is the first quantitative study to use primary data to intensively and longitudinally explore local inequalities in mental health and wellbeing during austerity and it also examines any changes in the underpinning social and behavioural determinants of health. Using a stratified random sampling technique, the data was analysed using linear mixed effects model (LMM) that explored any changes in the gap in mental health and wellbeing between people from the most and least deprived areas, alongside any changes in the material, psychosocial and behavioural determinants. The main findings are that the significant gap in mental health between the two areas remained constant over the 18-month study period, whilst there were no changes in the underlying determinants. These results may reflect our relatively short follow-up period or the fact that the cohort sample were older than the general population and pensioners in the UK have largely been protected from austerity. The study therefore potentially provides further empirical evidence to support assertions that social safety nets matter - particularly in times of economic upheaval.",SSM - population health,2018 Dec,England,2018,10
26060682,Use of Health Care Services and Associated Factors among Women.,"BACKGROUND: To estimate the prevalence and analyze factors associated with both public and private health services utilization in women population in a western district of Iran. METHOD: A cross-sectional study with 1200 individuals aged 18-49 years carried out in different districts of Sanandaj City, western Iran, in 2012. The main outcome variable was use of health service in the previous 12 months. The in-dependent variables were age, education level, place of residence, marital and pregnancy status, household wealth, oc-cupation and duration time of employment, and rating of quality of health services. RESULTS: The prevalence of public and private health services utilization were 60.8% [95%CI: 57.8, 63.8] and 53.8% [95%CI: 50.8%, 56.8%], respectively (P=0.001). After controlling other investigated factors using logistic regression; the academic educational level (OR=1.36, 95%CI: 1.03, 1.80; OR=1.76, 95%CI: 1.33, 2.33), residents of urban (OR=1.65, 95%CI: 1.10, 2.47; OR=1.60, 95%CI: 1.10, 2.42), pregnancy status (OR=2.38, 95%CI: 1.60, 3.55; OR=2.36, 95%CI: 1.61, 3.47), and high level of quality of health services (OR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.15, 2.27; OR=1.70, 95%CI: 1.20, 2.40) were found to be predictors of utilization of both public and private health care respectively. There was also statistically relation between high level of household wealth (OR=3.01, 95% CI: 2.00, 4.57) and private health services utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of health services utilization varied according to the individual and social factors of popula-tion studied.

21178189,Realizing human rights-based approaches for action on the social determinants of health.,"Health inequities are clear evidence of violations of the right to health. Yet despite this common ground, action on the social determinants of health aiming to reduce health inequities is sometimes disconnected from implementation of human rights-based approaches. This is explained in part by differing histories, disciplines, and epistemologies. The capacity of human rights instruments to alter policies on social determinants can seem limited. An absolutist focus on individuals and processes can seem at odds with the attention to differences in population health outcomes central to the concern for health equity. However, developments in rights-based approaches have seen the terrain of human rights increasingly address social determinants. Human rights provide a firm legal basis for tackling the inequities in power and resources that the Commission on Social Determinants of Health identifies as fundamental to achieving health equity. Indicators and benchmarks developed for rights-based approaches to health systems can be developed further within health sectors and translated to other sectors and disciplines. The discourse and evidence base of social determinants can also contribute to implementing rights-based approaches, as its resultant policy momentum can provide essential levers to realize the right to health. Therefore, there is no clear-cut delineation between the human rights and health equity movements, and both may constructively work together to realize their goals. Such constructive collaboration will not prove straightforward; it will, instead, require profound engagement and innovations in both theory and practice. Yet this effort represents an important opportunity for those who seek social justice in health.",Health and human rights,2010 Dec 15,United States,2010,10
28209168,The impact of preterm birth <37 weeks on parents and families: a cross-sectional study in the 2 years after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the quality of life of parents and families of preterm infants after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Our aims were (1) to describe the impact of preterm birth on parents and families and (2) and to identify potentially modifiable determinants of parent and family impact. METHODS: We surveyed 196 parents of preterm infants <24 months corrected age in 3 specialty clinics (82% response rate). Primary outcomes were: (1) the Impact on Family Scale total score; and (2) the Infant Toddler Quality of Life parent emotion and (3) time limitations scores. Potentially modifiable factors were use of community-based services, financial burdens, and health-related social problems. We estimated associations of potentially modifiable factors with outcomes, adjusting for socio-demographic and infant characteristics using linear regression. RESULTS: Median (inter-quartile range) infant gestational age was 28 (26-31) weeks. Higher Impact on Family scores (indicating worse effects on family functioning) were associated with taking >/=3 unpaid hours/week off from work, increased debt, financial worry, unsafe home environment and social isolation. Lower parent emotion scores (indicating greater impact on the parent) were also associated with social isolation and unpaid time off from work. Lower parent time limitations scores were associated with social isolation, unpaid time off from work, financial worry, and an unsafe home environment. In contrast, higher parent time limitations scores (indicating less impact) were associated with enrollment in early intervention and Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to reduce social isolation, lessen financial burden, improve home safety, and increase enrollment in early intervention and Medicaid all have the potential to lessen the impact of preterm birth on parents and families.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2017 Feb 16,England,2017,10
22856179,Determinants of managerial competencies for primary care managers in Southern Thailand.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is first, to identify the critical managerial competencies of primary care managers; and second, to determine the relationship between personality and motivation, and managerial competency. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A survey was conducted involving distribution of questionnaires to 358 rural primary care managers in Southern Thailand. FINDINGS: The survey found six critical managerial competencies: visionary leadership; assessment, planning, and evaluation; promotion of health and prevention of disease; information management; partnership and collaboration; and communication. Both personality and motivation are found to significantly influence primary care managers' managerial competency. In particular, conscientiousness (i.e. perseveres until the task is finished, does a thorough job, full of energy, does things efficiently, and a lot of enthusiasm) is related to all managerial competencies. It is clear that extrinsic and intrinsic factors (i.e. quality of supervision and leadership, organizational policy and administration, interpersonal relationship, working conditions, work itself, amount of responsibility, and job recognition) are influential in primary care manager motivation that can significantly improve morale. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The short version of the personality instrument may limit the generalization of some of the findings. Future research is needed to assess the relationship between managerial competency and performance. Further research could be done in other countries to see if this conclusion is in fact correct. It would also be useful to research if the findings apply to other health and social areas. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Personality and motivation are able to co-predict managerial competency whereby motivation tends to have a stronger influence than personality. These findings will be useful to policy makers and to those responsible for the human development in the preparation of management training and development programs. Moreover, top management should not overlook the motivational system as a way to encourage managers to be competent in their job. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper contributes to our understanding of managerial competency within the context of rural primary care sectors. The success of any organized health program depends upon effective management, but health systems worldwide face a lack of competent management at all levels. Management development for health systems, particularly at the first line of supervision, must be given much higher priority for investment.",Journal of health organization and management,2012,England,2012,10
28691564,"Concerns and hopes about outsourcing decisions regarding health information management services at two teaching hospitals in Semnan, Iran.","BACKGROUND: Changes in health programs in Iran have led to an increase in administrative costs. One cost-saving option available to hospital administrators is to outsource administrative services. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the attitudes of hospital staff towards outsourcing health information management services in advance of a decision being taken, to assist healthcare organisations to assess the potential benefits and challenges of outsourcing such services. METHOD: Six hundred and four clinical and allied health employees in two hospitals in Iran, who had had prior experience with outsourcing hospital services, responded to a survey designed to measure staff attitudes towards outsourcing health information management services, based on their perceptions of potential costs and benefits for the organisation and their own employment prospects. A 16-item attitude scale, developed by the researchers, was used in the study and demographic data were also collected. RESULTS: Summary statistics showed that approximately one third of the sample (34.53%) had a negative view of outsourcing, one third (35.16%) had a positive view, and 30.31% were neutral. An exploratory factor analysis of items on the attitude scale identified three underlying constructs, labelled: data security and management; workplace environment; and staff and customer satisfaction. One item (concern about the impact of outsourcing on staffing levels) did not load on any of the factors. A separate analysis of this single item showed a significant relationship between the sex of participants and their views on the impact of outsourcing on the number of hospital staff employed (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: While results of this study indicated that staff in hospitals surveyed held both positive and negative views of outsourcing, a large number of staff in these hospitals (a third of the total sample) had reservations about the skills of outside providers to securely manage hospital data, and did not consider that outsourcing health information management services would be positive for the organisation, their working environment or for staff and patient satisfaction. These findings have important implications for healthcare organisations planning to outsource health information services. Further research that focuses on communication skills of senior managers and their ability to provide team leadership is needed, as is research into the impact of geographical location and current market forces that impact on outsourcing tasks.",Health information management : journal of the Health Information Management Association of Australia,2016 Apr,Australia,2016,10
21440351,"They say it runs in the family: diabetes and inheritance in Oaxaca, Mexico.","The globalization of genetic discourses, especially where ethnicity is treated as a ""risk factor"" for disease, deserves special attention and concern. In countries such as Mexico, with large indigenous populations, the consequences of the Thrifty Genotype hypothesis and/or the attribution of type 2 diabetes to ""family history"" may be especially detrimental to poor rural communities, playing as they do into existing racial hierarchies. Based on semi-structured interviews with doctors and patients in a public clinic in a community near Oaxaca, Mexico, the study examines etiologies for type 2 diabetes. While notions of genetic inheritance and family history figure prominently in government and public health discourse, the ""explanatory model"" of patients places most emphasis on strong emotions, traumatic events, and dietary factors. Clinic doctors emphasize diet and lifestyle factors. The diffusion of ""genetic risk"" has had little impact on doctor-patient interactions in this community, but can be clearly seen in academic research, government policy, and medical specialties in the region, raising concerns about whether or not interventions will be directed at the social determinants of this growing health concern.",Social science & medicine (1982),2011 Jun,England,2011,10
30168879,Inactive lifestyles in peri-urban Australia: A qualitative examination of social and physical environmental determinants.,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Australians living in peri-urban areas are insufficiently active, sedentary and experience poorer health than people in major cities. There are health benefits attributable to active lifestyles that could contribute to the improved health and well-being of this population. To support the adoption of active lifestyles, it is important to understand the unique context in which behaviour occurs. METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify characteristics of the social and physical peri-urban environment that may impact active lifestyles. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in peri-urban southern Queensland. Data were analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: The natural environment, weather, distance, accessibility and walkability were features of the physical environment relevant to active lifestyles. Social factors included social capital and crime. Activity-supportive characteristics (eg, community spirit) were identified, in addition to active lifestyle barriers (eg, lack of public transport). CONCLUSIONS: Despite activity-supportive social and environmental characteristics, most participants reported inactive lifestyles. The barriers to active lifestyles in peri-urban environments may negate these activity-supportive features. Some barriers are difficult to modify (eg, distance and accessibility). However, some may be alleviated through the adoption of activity-supportive policy and urban design (eg, pedestrian mobility infrastructure). SO WHAT?: Strategies to support active lifestyles in peri-urban environments must take into account unmodifiable contextual barriers, whilst encouraging utilisation of existing activity-supportive infrastructure and resources. The enhancement of activity-supportive environments through improved neighbourhood walkability and the usability of public transport may encourage some peri-urban residents to undertake more active forms of transport and recreational physical activity.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2019 Apr,Australia,2019,10
29291686,African American Women's Perceived Influences on and Strategies to Reduce Sedentary Behavior.,"We conducted three focus groups to examine African American women's perceptions of factors influencing and proposed strategies for reducing sedentary behavior (SB). QSR NVivo 9 facilitated coding and organization of themes. Although participants ( n = 32, 53.6 +/- 6.0 years, 75% obese) were unfamiliar with the term SB prior to focus groups, they described spending large amounts of time in SB at work and home. Participants viewed leisure-time SB as necessary and important but were amenable to decreasing SB at work. Participants also identified personal, social, and environmental factors contributing to SB as well as novel strategies for reducing SB. Results suggest that messages aimed at reducing SB in African American women should be positively framed, viewed within a socioecologic framework, and target nonleisure time SB. SB was viewed as a form of stress reduction; thus, future research might want to emphasize alternative stress management techniques that simultaneously reduce SB.",Qualitative health research,2018 Jun,United States,2018,10
29627424,Asthma across the lifespan: Time for a paradigm shift.,"We have a unique opportunity to significantly reduce the worldwide burden of asthma in children and affect respiratory outcomes in adults. However, this will require a paradigm shift that is directed at altering the natural history of asthma, reducing asthma exacerbations, and preventing long-term adverse outcomes of childhood asthma. Attention should continue to be directed toward minimizing risk, as well as impairment, with a goal to achieve optimal control. Based on several National Institutes of Health studies conducted over the last 10 years, we now have the tools necessary to accomplish this goal. The tools include assessment of lung function over time or defining trajectories of lung growth, the Composite Asthma Severity Index score, a panel of useful biomarkers, the Seasonal Asthma Exacerbation Prediction Index score, and rapidly advancing technology that includes adherence monitoring. Future guideline revisions should consider incorporating recommendations to follow spirometry over time and defining trajectories of lung growth to assess risk for reduced lung growth and early decline, asthma burden by using biomarkers to select and monitor therapy, assessment of social determinants of health, evaluation of risk for seasonal exacerbations, and consideration of electronic adherence monitoring for difficult-to-manage asthma. Guidelines should continue to include a core dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of intermittent and mild and moderate persistent asthma and include additional sections dedicated to the management of severe asthma.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2018 Sep,United States,2018,10
25660485,Are secondhand smoke-related diseases of children associated with parental smoking cessation? Determinants of parental smoking cessation in a population-based cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about whether secondhand smoke (SHS)-related diseases of young children, such as asthma, induce parental smoking cessation during the early child-rearing period. Our objective was therefore to show the association in addition to other potential determinants of parental cessation. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Survey of Newborns in the 21st Century in Japan, from 0.5years (N=47,015) to 4.5years (N=39,817), having selected participants whose parents smoked at baseline (maternal smoking N=8,037; paternal smoking N=28,486). Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to calculate the prevalence ratios for parental smoking cessation according to the onset of SHS-related diseases of their children, using inverse probability weight to account for non-response at follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 16.7% of smoking mothers and 14.5% of smoking fathers had stopped smoking at follow-up. The onset of SHS-related children's diseases was not statistically significantly associated with either maternal or paternal smoking cessation after multivariable adjustments. Strong determinants were, for example, number of cigarettes smoked per day and partner's smoking status during follow-up. CONCLUSION: SHS-related children's diseases were not associated with parental smoking cessation. It may therefore be necessary to provide additional support for parental smoking cessation within their child's medical care setting.",Preventive medicine,2015 Apr,United States,2015,10
31164103,Association of a genetic variant in the angiopoietin-like protein 4 gene with metabolic syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors that include: abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and glucose intolerance. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is a circulating peptide that is an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase, a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of ANGPTL4 gene variants (E40K) with fasting serum triglyceride levels and with cardiovascular risk factors, that included the presence of MetS in 817 subjects recruited from the Mashhad stroke and heart Atherosclerosis Disorders (MASHAD) cohort Study. METHOD: ANGPTL4 genotypes were determined using a TaqMan genotyping based real time PCR method. The association of the genetic variant with the risk of metabolic syndrome and its relationship with lipid profile were determined. RESULT: The frequency of GG, GA and AA genotypes were 96.9, 2.7 and 0.4% in individuals with MetS, and 78.8, 20.8, 0.4%, in those without MetS. The GA genotype of the rs116843064 polymorphism was associated with a lower risk for MetS (e.g., OR in Codominant genetic model: 0.14, 95% CI: (0.06-0.33), p < 0.0001). Subject with an A allele had a higher risk for MetS (OR: 6.72, 95% CI: (3.05-14.82), p < 0.0001). There was a significant difference in fasted lipid profiles across the genotypes for ANGPTL4. Carriers of the AG genotype had higher levels of serum HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and lower TG, compared to the GG homozygotes genotype. CONCLUSION: The G allele at the rs116843064 polymorphic locus of the ANGPTL4 gene was associated with a lower prevalence of MetS.",BMC medical genetics,2019 Jun 4,England,2019,10
21732709,A Congolese-US participatory action research partnership to rebuild the lives of rape survivors and their families in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.,"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains an all-too-potent reminder of how war, human rights violations and their related health and economic impacts can devastate a society. The last decade has seen the use of rape as a weapon of war in the DRC, where rebels and soldiers subject women and girls to brutalising attacks, rape, torture and mutilation. Survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) are often further traumatised by infections, disease, poverty, stigma and social isolation. Substantial evidence exists showing an association between social determinants (e.g., poverty, stress and trauma, stigma, lack of access to health care) and health; however, limited research has been conducted to elucidate these relationships or to develop and test interventions to change social determinants of health, especially in conflict and post-conflict settings such as the DRC. The purpose of this article is to present a Congolese-US community-academic research partnership to obtain evidence to develop and implement a sustainable intervention to begin to address the social determinants of health, including poverty and traumatic stress for survivors of SGBV and their families in the South Kivu province of eastern DRC.",Global public health,2012,England,2012,10
28609120,Understanding supplement use: an application of temporal self-regulation theory.,"Vitamin and mineral supplement use is increasing worldwide. As evidence of the effects of these practices are equivocal at best, it is important to determine why individuals engage in vitamin and mineral supplement use through the application of a theoretical framework. The aim of this study was to employ temporal self-regulation theory (TST) to establish the determinants of supplement use. A cross-sectional design was used with a sample of 121 individuals who consume vitamins or minerals as dietary supplements. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine the influence of intention, habit, self-control, and the interaction between intention and habit and self-control on the frequency of supplement use. The model accounted for a significant proportion of variance in behaviour (R(2) = .44) with intention and habit significantly related to supplement use. Self-control moderated the relationship between intention and behaviour indicating that intention was not related to behaviour when self-control was low. The TST model offers a satisfactory account of supplement use and provides avenues for interventions aimed at increasing safe and beneficial supplement use and decreasing potentially harmful supplement use.","Psychology, health & medicine",2018 Feb,England,2018,10
28360010,Food as a social determinant of mental health among household heads in the Upper West Region of Ghana.,"According to the World Health Organization, mental distress and related illnesses are becoming leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Despite the influence of food insecurity on mental health, empirical understanding of this relationship in sub-Saharan Africa, where incidence of food insecurity is relatively high, is almost non-existent. This study contributes to the literature by examining the association between food insecurity and mental health in the Upper West Region of Ghana. We used Ordinary Least Square (OLS) to analyze cross-sectional data collected on household heads (n = 1438) in 2014 using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and the DUKE Health Profile. The results show that heads of severely food insecure (beta = 0.934, p </= 0.001) and moderately food secure households (beta = 0.759, p </= 0.001) were more likely to report elevated mental distress compared to those from food secure households. We also found that female household heads were more likely to report elevated mental distress (beta = 0.164, p </= 0.05) compared to their male counterparts. Our findings suggest the need to improve food security as a strategy targeted at improving overall mental health in the Ghanaian context.",Social science & medicine (1982),2017 May,England,2017,10
26690363,Risk of thyroid cancer among Caribbean Hispanic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited form of colorectal cancer characterized by hundreds of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. FAP is also associated with thyroid cancer (TC), but the lifetime risk is still unclear. This study reports the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of TC in Hispanic FAP patients. TC incidence rates in patients with FAP between the periods of January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2013 were compared with the general population through direct database linkage from the Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry (PRCCR) and the Puerto Rico Familial Colorectal Cancer Registry (PURIFICAR). The study population consisted of 51 Hispanic patients with FAP and 3239 with TC from the general population. The SIR was calculated using the Indirect Method, defined as observed TC incidence among patients with FAP in PURIFICAR's cohort (2006-2013) divided by the expected TC incidence based on the PR population rates (2006-2010). SIR values were estimated by sex (male, female, and overall). This study received IRB approval (protocol #A2210207). In Hispanic patients with FAP, the SIR (95% CI) for TC was 251.73 (51.91-735.65), with higher risk for females 461.18 (55.85-1665.94) than males 131.91 (3.34-734.95). Hispanic FAP patients are at a high risk for TC compared to the general population. Our incidence rates are higher than previous studies, suggesting that this community may be at a higher risk for TC than previously assumed. Implementation of clinical surveillance guidelines and regular ultrasound neck screening in Hispanic FAP patients is recommended.",Familial cancer,2016 Apr,Netherlands,2016,10
25103544,Independent effects of socioeconomic and psychological social determinants of health on self-care and outcomes in Type 2 diabetes.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the independent effects of socioeconomic and psychological social determinants of health on diabetes knowledge, self-care, diabetes outcomes and quality of life. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional sample of 615 adults from two adult primary care clinics in the southeastern United States. Primary outcome variables were diabetes knowledge, self-care behaviors (diet, exercise, medication adherence, blood sugar testing, foot care) and diabetes outcomes (HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein, blood pressure, physical component summary score of SF12 quality of life, mental component summary score of SF12 quality of life). Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, health literacy and comorbidity. Linear regression models were used to assess independent associations controlling for covariates. RESULTS: In final adjusted models, significant associations for HbA1c included education [beta = -0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.36 to -0.08], income (beta = -0.66, CI: -1.30 to -0.16), self-efficacy (beta = -0.12, CI: -0.15 to -0.08) and diabetes distress (beta = 0.43, CI: 0.14 to 0.72). Significant associations for self-care included medication adherence with diabetes distress (beta = -0.58, CI: -0.91 to -0.25) and perceived stress (beta = -0.12, CI: -0.18 to -0.05) and exercise with depression (beta = -0.06, CI: -0.10 to -0.01) and self-efficacy (beta = 0.06, CI: 0.01 to 0.10). Significant associations for quality of life included depression (beta = -0.08, CI: -0.12 to -0.03), serious psychological distress (beta = -0.09, CI: -0.12 to -0.05), social support (beta = 0.01, CI: 0.001 to 0.02) and perceived stress (beta = -0.12, CI: -0.19 to -0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants of health were significantly associated with diabetes self-care and outcomes with socioeconomic factors being most often associated with diabetes outcomes and psychological factors, specifically self-efficacy and perceived stress being most often associated with self-care and quality of life.",General hospital psychiatry,2014 Nov-Dec,United States,2014,10
22682665,Sociodemographic and cultural determinants of sleep deficiency: implications for cardiometabolic disease risk.,"Sleep is a biological imperative associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. As such, a thorough discussion of the sociocultural and demographic determinants of sleep is warranted, if not overdue. This paper begins with a brief review of the laboratory and epidemiologic evidence linking sleep deficiency, which includes insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, with increased risk of chronic cardiometabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Identification of the determinants of sleep deficiency is the critical next step to understanding the role sleep plays in human variation in health and disease. Therefore, the majority of this paper describes the different biopsychosocial determinants of sleep, including age, gender, psychosocial factors (depression, stress and loneliness), socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity. In addition, because sleep duration is partly determined by behavior, it will be shaped by cultural values, beliefs and practices. Therefore, possible cultural differences that may impact sleep are discussed. If certain cultural, ethnic or social groups are more likely to experience sleep deficiency, then these differences in sleep could increase their risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Furthermore, if the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of sleep deficiency in certain populations can be identified, interventions could be developed to target these mechanisms, reduce sleep differences and potentially reduce cardiometabolic disease risk.",Social science & medicine (1982),2013 Feb,England,2013,10
21792747,Modeling alcohol self-administration in the human laboratory.,"This review focuses on 27 studies employing experimental alcohol self-administration (ASA) in humans which were published between 1989 and 2010. Twelve studies enrolling healthy, non-dependent social drinkers (HSD) were aimed at evaluating physiological and behavioral determinants of alcohol-induced reward or modeling situations of increased risk to develop alcohol use disorders. The remaining 15 studies tested the effect of medications such as naltrexone, nalmefene, nicotine, mecamylamine, varenicline, gabapentin, aripiprazole, and rimonabant on ASA. The participants were either HSD or non-treatment-seeking alcoholics (NTSA). In 25 of these studies, the subjects ingested alcohol orally and reached a mean peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) during baseline conditions between 43 and 47 mg% (0.043-0.047%). Two recent studies employed computer-assisted self-infusion of ethanol (CASE), where subjects press a button to request multiple sequential alcohol exposures intravenously instead of drinking. This method has been demonstrated to be safe and provides increased experimental control of BAC and keeps subjects blind concerning the amount already self-administered. Peak exposures in the CASE studies ranged from 60 to 80 mg% in HSD and up to 240 mg% in NTSA.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2013,Germany,2013,10
28513891,Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for severe combined immunodeficiency: Long-term health outcomes and patient perspectives.,"AIM: To examine the long-term follow-up and health outcomes of patients who have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). METHODS: Through a structured questionnaire, we examined follow-up arrangements and long-term health outcomes in 22 children who have had a successful HSCT for SCID during the period of 1984-2012 at the Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia. RESULTS: Most children considered themselves healthy and 'cured' from SCID. Whilst many children enjoy relatively good bio-social health outcomes, specific negative health outcomes and absenteeism from school were perceived negatively. Two-thirds of children see their general practitioner or specialist regularly; however, there did not appear to be consistency with the nature of this follow-up. CONCLUSION: The findings from our study highlight the complex bio-psychosocial health needs of post-HSCT SCID children and encourage SCID centres to consider a multidisciplinary approach to their follow-up. Further studies into the determinants of patients' perceptions of their health are needed.",Journal of paediatrics and child health,2017 Aug,Australia,2017,10
26081477,"Dietary fat, fat subtypes and hepatocellular carcinoma in a large European cohort.","The role of amount and type of dietary fat consumption in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood, despite suggestive biological plausibility. The associations of total fat, fat subtypes and fat sources with HCC incidence were investigated in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, which includes 191 incident HCC cases diagnosed between 1992 and 2010. Diet was assessed by country-specific, validated dietary questionnaires. A single 24-hr diet recall from a cohort subsample was used for measurement error calibration. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models. Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV/HCV) status and biomarkers of liver function were assessed separately in a nested case-control subset with available blood samples (HCC = 122). In multivariable calibrated models, there was a statistically significant inverse association between total fat intake and risk of HCC (per 10 g/day, HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.99), which was mainly driven by monounsaturated fats (per 5 g/day, HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.92) rather than polyunsaturated fats (per 5 g/day, HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.68-1.25). There was no association between saturated fats (HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.88-1.34) and HCC risk. The ratio of polyunsaturated/monounsaturated fats to saturated fats was not significantly associated with HCC risk (per 0.2 point, HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.73-1.01). Restriction of analyses to HBV/HCV free participants or adjustment for liver function did not substantially alter the findings. In this large prospective European cohort, higher consumption of monounsaturated fats is associated with lower HCC risk.",International journal of cancer,2015 Dec 1,United States,2015,10
21131349,Childhood socio-economic position and adult smoking: are childhood psychosocial factors important? Evidence from a British birth cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Childhood socio-economic position (SEP) is associated with adult smoking status. Previous studies have investigated mediation by educational attainment. The aim of this study is to examine whether childhood psychosocial factors (cognitive ability, psychosocial adjustment and parental involvement) are important in the association between childhood SEP and adult smoking status over and above educational attainment in a large prospective birth cohort study. METHODS: Data on 7709 participants from the National Child Development Study birth cohort from Great Britain were used in this study. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the associations of childhood SEP and childhood psychosocial factors with adult smoking status, both bivariate and mutually adjusted, and then additionally adjusted for confounders and participant's educational attainment. Analyses were conducted separately for men and women. RESULTS: Childhood SEP is an important determinant of adult smoking status, even after adjustment for childhood psychosocial factors and educational attainment. Parental involvement, cognitive ability and psychosocial adjustment were all associated with adult smoking status for both men and women. Also parental involvement for men, and both parental involvement and psychosocial adjustment for women, remain important determinants of adult smoking status over and above childhood SEP, other childhood psychosocial factors and educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to the evidence base that childhood disadvantage is associated with adult smoking behaviours and highlights the importance of the early childhood social environment for the development of these.",European journal of public health,2011 Dec,England,2011,10
28728457,Educated but anxious: How emotional states and education levels combine to influence online health information seeking.,"This study combined conceptual frameworks from health information seeking, appraisal theory of emotions, and social determinants of health literatures to examine how emotional states and education predict online health information seeking. Nationally representative data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 4, Cycle 3) were used to test the roles of education, anxiety, anger, sadness, hope, happiness, and an education by anxiety interaction in predicting online health information seeking. Results suggest that women, tablet owners, smartphone owners, the college educated, those who are sad some or all of the time, and those who are anxious most of the time were significantly more likely to seek online health information. Conversely, being angry all of the time decreased the likelihood of seeking. Furthermore, two significant interactions emerged between anxiety and education levels.

28040736,Adverse childhood experiences and disability pension in early midlife: results from a Swedish National Cohort Study.,"Background: Few studies have examined the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and disability pension (DP). The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between different ACEs, cumulative ACEs, and DP, and the mediating role of school performance. We used a Swedish cohort of 522 880 individuals born between 1973 and 1978. ACEs included parental death, parental substance abuse and psychiatric disorder, substantial parental criminality, household public assistance, parental DP and child welfare intervention. Estimates of risk of DP in 2008 were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 2.3% (3.0% females, 1.7% males) received DP in 2008. All studied ACEs increased the odds for DP, particularly child welfare intervention and household public assistance. Cumulative ACEs increased the odds of DP in a graded manner. Females exposed to 4+ ACEs had a 4-fold odds (OR: 4.0, 95% CI 3.5-4.5) and males a 7-fold odds (OR: 7.1, 95% CI: 6.2-8.1). School performance mediated the ACEs-DP association. This study provides evidence that ACEs is associated with increased odds of DP, particularly when accumulated. The effects of ACEs should be taken into account when considering the determinants of DP, and when identifying high-risk populations.",European journal of public health,2017 Jun 1,England,2017,10

29176809,Association between social support and health-related quality of life among Chinese seafarers: A cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Seafarers have reported impaired health and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Social support might increase HRQOL, but little is known about this association among Chinese seafarers. The aim of this study was to describe social support and explore its association with HRQOL among Chinese seafarers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the ports of Nantong and Rugao, China, from April to December 2013. A total of 917 Chinese seafarers were interviewed on social support, mental distress, perceived occupational stress, and HRQOL using the following self-administered questionnaires: The Social Support Rating Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, Occupational Stress Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Hierarchical linear regression modelling was used to analyze the association between seafarers' subjective level of social support and their HRQOL. RESULTS: Of the 917 male Chinese seafarers included in the study, 40.7% perceived high levels of social support, and 39.1% were highly satisfied with their overall quality of life (QOL). Hierarchical regression analysis showed significant associations between level of social support and all health dimensions in the WHOQOL-BREF, even after adjusting for depressive symptoms, occupational stress, occupational activities, sleep duration, and other relevant covariates. Compared with the medium or low level social support group, seafarers with a high level of social support had better QOL scores in the general facet health and QOL (beta = 2.43, p<0.05), and the physical health (beta = 3.23, p<0.001), psychological health (beta = 5.56, p<0.001), social relation (beta = 6.07, p<0.001), and environment domains (beta = 4.27, p<0.001). In addition, depression, occupational stress, occupational activities, and sleep duration were found to be determinants of seafarers' HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese seafarers have poorer HRQOL than the general population, but social support has a significant positive effect on their HRQOL. Efforts to improve social support should be undertaken.",PloS one,2017,United States,2017,10
30470208,"Prevalence, patterns, and predictors of diarrhea: a spatial-temporal comprehensive evaluation in India.","BACKGROUND: Spatial analysis has been vital in mapping the spread of diseases and assisting in policy making. Targeting diarrhea transmission hotspots is one of the potential strategies for reducing diarrhea cases. This study aimed to examine the spatial-temporal variations and to identify the modifiable determinants of diarrhea while controlling for the spatial dependence in the data. METHODS: An ecological study on diarrhea data from DLHS-3 and NFHS- 4 in India. Moran's I and LISA were used to detect the spatial clustering of diarrhea cases and to test for clustering in the data. Spatial regression was used to identify the modifiable factors associated with the prevalence of diarrhea. The study comprised of the prevalence of diarrhea among the children below the age of five years (U-5 s) across different states in India. The determinants of diarrhea were obtained using spatial lag models. The software used were GeoDa 1.6.6 and QGIS 2.0. RESULTS: The presence of spatial autocorrelation in DLHS-3 and NFHS-4 (Moron's I = 0.577 and 0.369 respectively) enforces the usage of geographical properties while modeling the diarrhea data. The geographic clustering of high-prevalence districts was observed in the state of UP consistently. The spatial pattern of the percentage of children with diarrhea was persistently associated with the household with a sanitation facility (%) (p = 0.023 and p = 0.011). Compared to the diarrhea cases in the period 2007-2008, no much reduction was observed in the period 2015-2016. The prevalence of diarrhea and percentage of household with sanitation were ranging between 0.1-33.8% and 1.3-96.1% in the period 2007-2008 and 0.6-29.1% and 10.4-92.0% in the period 2015-2016 respectively. The least and highest prevalence of diarrhea being consistently from Assam and UP respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite improvements in controlling spread of diarrheal disease, the burden remains high. Focus on widespread diarrheal disease control strategy by addressing the social determinants of health like basic sanitation is crucial to reduce the burden of diarrhea among U-5 s in India. The identification of hotspots will aid in the planning of control strategies for goal setting in the targeted regions.",BMC public health,2018 Nov 23,England,2018,10
25542080,Estimating community health needs against a Triple Aim background: What can we learn from current predictive risk models?,"INTRODUCTION: To support providers and commissioners in accurately assessing their local populations' health needs, this study produces an overview of Dutch predictive risk models for health care, focusing specifically on the type, combination and relevance of included determinants for achieving the Triple Aim (improved health, better care experience, and lower costs). METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study combining document analyses, interviews and a Delphi study. Predictive risk models were identified based on a web search and expert input. Participating in the study were Dutch experts in predictive risk modelling (interviews; n=11) and experts in healthcare delivery, insurance and/or funding methodology (Delphi panel; n=15). RESULTS: Ten predictive risk models were analysed, comprising 17 unique determinants. Twelve were considered relevant by experts for estimating community health needs. Although some compositional similarities were identified between models, the combination and operationalisation of determinants varied considerably. CONCLUSIONS: Existing predictive risk models provide a good starting point, but optimally balancing resources and targeting interventions on the community level will likely require a more holistic approach to health needs assessment. Development of additional determinants, such as measures of people's lifestyle and social network, may require policies pushing the integration of routine data from different (healthcare) sources.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2015 May,Ireland,2015,10
20579055,Who intermarries in Britain? Explaining ethnic diversity in intermarriage patterns.,"This paper investigates trends, patterns and determinants of intermarriage (and partnership) comparing patterns among men and women and among different ethnic groups in Britain. We distinguish between endogamous (co-ethnic), majority/minority and minority/minority marriages. Hypotheses are derived from the theoretical literatures on assimilation, segmented assimilation and opportunity structures. The empirical analysis is based on the 1988-2006 General Household Surveys (N = 115,494). Consistent with assimilation theory we find that, for all ethnic minority groups, the propensity to intermarry is higher in the second generation than in the first. Consistent with ideas drawn from segmented assimilation theory, we also find that substantial differences in propensity to form majority/minority marriages persist after controls for individual characteristics such as age, educational level, generation and length of residence in Britain, with men and women of Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi background having higher propensities to form endogamous partnerships. However, we also find that opportunity structures affect intermarriage propensities for all groups alike, with individuals in more diverse residential areas (as measured by the ratio of majority to minority residents in the area) having higher likelihood to form majority/minority partnerships. We conclude then that, beginning from very different starting points, all groups, both minority and the majority groups exhibit common patterns of generational change and response to opportunity structures. Even the groups that are believed to have the strongest community structures and the strongest norms supporting endogamy appear to be experiencing increasing exogamy in the second generation and in more diverse residential settings. This suggests that a weak rather than a strong version of segmented assimilation provides the best account of British patterns.",The British journal of sociology,2010 Jun,England,2010,10
28717729,Middle Eastern Conflicts: Implications for Refugee Health in the European Union and Middle Eastern Host Countries.,"Until very recently, health care in conflict settings was based on a model developed in the second half of the twentieth century. Things have changed, and present civil wars, such as those that are currently taking place in the Middle East, do not address the complexity of the ongoing armed conflicts in countries such as Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. These conflicts have caused a significant increase in the number of refugees in the region, as well as in Europe. Hundreds of thousands of refugees succeed in settling in mid- and north-European countries, and their health issues are becoming of great importance. Refugees in Europe in the twenty-first century do not suffer so much from infectious diseases but more from noninfectious chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiac disease, and cancer. These facts profoundly alter the demographics and disease burden of hostility-derived migrants. Thus, host European countries face situations they have never faced before. Hence, new approaches and strategies are urgently needed to cope with this new situation. The efforts to absorb refugees of different traditions and cultural backgrounds often cause increasing ethnic and religious tensions, which frequently escort the emergence of social violence. To date, little attention has been paid to the overall load of distress being experienced, especially among the first-generation refugees. The current ongoing hostilities in the Middle East induce a long-term health impact on people expelled from their homes, communities, traditions, and cultural environment. The realization of collective suffering forces communities and governmental health agencies to develop new programs that include social determinants to overcome the severe cultural gaps of the newcomers in their new European host countries.",Journal of global oncology,2016 Dec,United States,2016,10
23767813,Aboriginal Families Study: a population-based study keeping community and policy goals in mind right from the start.,"BACKGROUND: Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are between two to five times more likely to die in childbirth than non-Aboriginal women, and two to three times more likely to have a low birthweight infant. Babies with a low birthweight are more likely to have chronic health problems in adult life. Currently, there is limited research evidence regarding effective interventions to inform new initiatives to strengthen antenatal care for Aboriginal families. METHOD/DESIGN: The Aboriginal Families Study is a cross sectional population-based study investigating the views and experiences of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women having an Aboriginal baby in the state of South Australia over a 2-year period. The primary aims are to compare the experiences and views of women attending standard models of antenatal care with those accessing care via Aboriginal Family Birthing Program services which include Aboriginal Maternal Infant Care (AMIC) Workers as members of the clinical team; to assess factors associated with early and continuing engagement with antenatal care; and to use the information to inform strengthening of services for Aboriginal families. Women living in urban, regional and remote areas of South Australia have been invited to take part in the study by completing a structured interview or, if preferred, a self-administered questionnaire, when their baby is between 4-12 months old. DISCUSSION: Having a baby is an important life event in all families and in all cultures. How supported women feel during pregnancy, how women and families are welcomed by services, how safe they feel coming in to hospitals to give birth, and what happens to families during a hospital stay and in the early months after the birth of a new baby are important social determinants of maternal, newborn and child health outcomes. The Aboriginal Families Study builds on consultation with Aboriginal communities across South Australia. The project has been implemented with guidance from an Aboriginal Advisory Group keeping community and policy goals in mind right from the start. The results of the study will provide a unique resource to inform quality improvement and strengthening of services for Aboriginal families.",International journal for equity in health,2013 Jun 14,England,2013,10
29958597,Understanding sociodemographic factors related to health outcomes in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea.,"OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and successful treatment of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with adenotonsillectomy (T&A). (2) To explore sociodemographic factors and medical comorbidities that separate OSA and refractory OSA populations in children. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric OSA patients (ages 0-18). Patients evaluated for OSA by pediatric otolaryngology between January 2014 and December 2015 were included. OSA was defined as requiring T&A. Refractory OSA (ROSA) was defined as recurring, polysomnography-proven, OSA after T&A, ultimately requiring another intervention, such as a multi-level airway operation. Clinical data were complemented with sociodemographic data. ZIP codes were used to approximate median household income. RESULTS: Our cohort included 105 ROSA and 53 OSA patients. These patients came from similar rates of single parent households and coverage by public insurance. Median household income for OSA patients was $47,086 (IQR $36,395-$60,196), compared to $45,696 (IQR $37,669-$56,203) for ROSA patients. Over 60% of all patients fell below the national household income average. Nearly half of the cohort resided in the three largest metro counties closest to our institution. These patients represented higher rates of single-parent households (p=0.045) and public insurance (p=0.002), and trends towards lower rates of ROSA (p=0.138). CONCLUSION: Our results identified sociodemographic factors that may influence healthcare compliance and subsequently overall health outcomes. We identified no statistically significant difference in measures of SES between patients with refractory vs non-refractory OSA. Patients living closest to our medical center had lowest rates of ROSA, suggesting that access to care may affect outcomes of pediatric OSA.",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,2018 Aug,Ireland,2018,10
24307167,"Assessing health literacy in rural settings: a pilot study in rural areas of Cluj County, Romania.","Health literacy improves knowledge and builds skills to help individuals make appropriate decisions regarding their health. Over the past 20 years, several studies have described associations between health literacy and health outcomes. With respect to Romania, evidence is scarce on the level of health literacy, as well as on its determinants. Thus, the objectives of this study were to briefly screen functional health literacy levels in a sample of rural inhabitants, to assess the relationship between health literacy and reported health status, as well as to explore health literacy determinants within this population. Data were collected between September-November 2010, in four villages in Cluj County, Romania, using a cross-sectional survey. The mean age of respondents in the sample was 56 years, with roughly half of respondents being retired. The brief screening of health literacy suggested inadequate to marginal levels within the sample. Significant associations were observed between health literacy score and education, and self-perceived health status, whereas the relationship between health literacy and gender, and the presence of a chronic disease was not statistically significant. Limited health literacy has been shown to be common in people who rated their health as poor, those who attended only middle school, and individuals lacking basic information about their body. In order to minimize the adverse effects of low health literacy on health and health outcomes, efforts should be invested in identifying and addressing the health needs of adults with low and marginal health literacy, especially in underserved areas such as rural and remote settings, where access to health-related information is limited.",Global health promotion,2013 Dec,England,2013,10
29635635,A Healthy Eating Identity is Associated with Healthier Food Choice Behaviors Among U.S. Army Soldiers.,"Introduction: Promoting healthy eating among Soldiers is a priority to the Army due to the link between nutrition and performance. The Army typically uses nutrition education to encourage Soldiers to make healthier food choices with low emphasis on other psychosocial determinants of food choice behaviors. Materials and Methods: Drill Sergeant Candidates (n = 575) completed surveys assessing nutrition knowledge, eating identity type, and food choice behaviors including fruit and vegetable intake, skipping meals, and eating out frequency. In multiple linear regression models using full-information maximum likelihood estimation while controlling for race/ethnicity, education, and marital status, we examined relationships between nutrition knowledge, a healthy eating identity, and Soldiers' food choice behaviors. The study was approved by the Department of Defense and University of South Carolina's Institutional Review Boards. Results: A healthy eating identity was positively associated with greater fruit and vegetable consumption (p < 0.05), and negatively associated with skipping meals and eating out frequency (p < 0.05). Nutrition knowledge was negatively associated with skipping meals (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Findings suggest that fostering a healthy eating identity may be more effective for promoting healthy food choice behaviors than nutrition education alone. Determining if various points in a Soldier's career could be leveraged to influence a healthy eating identity and behaviors could be an important strategy to improve compliance with health promotion programs.",Military medicine,2018 Nov 1,England,2018,10
30816239,"Air pollutants associated with smoking in indoor/outdoor of waterpipe cafes in Tehran, Iran: Concentrations, affecting factors and health risk assessment.","Despite increasingly growth in waterpipe smoking in Tehran, so far no study has been conducted on the air quality of the waterpipe and cigarette cafes. Thirty-six cafes were selected and the concentration of three pollutants including formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and nicotine were measured in both indoor and outdoor air of cafes two times (week-day and weekend's session). Air sampling was performed for 180 min for each pollutant. It was observed that the concentration of pollutants inside the cafes was higher during weekend session (with a higher number of ""active waterpipe heads"") compared with findings during the week-day sessions. Furthermore, the concentration of pollutants in the indoor air of the cafes was significantly higher than that of the outdoors (p < 0.05). According to path analysis, the number of ""active waterpipe heads"" had the maximum impact on generation of pollutants inside the cafes, followed by the type of tobacco as the second influential factor. The average of lifetime cancer risk (LTCR) resulted by formaldehyde exposure through inhalation in waterpipe (WS), cigarette (CS), waterpipe and cigarette (WCS) and none-smoking (NS) cafes in week-day and weekend sessions were estimated to be 111 x 10(-5) and 61.2 x 10(-5), 33.7 x 10(-5) and 39.4 x 10(-5), 271 x 10(-5) and 322 x 10(-5), and 4.80 x 10(-5) and 5.90 x 10(-5), respectively, which exceed the limit value by the U.S.EPA and WHO. The concentration of pollutants in the indoor air of smoking cafes in Tehran is significantly high, such that it can pose serious risks for the health of both personnel and customers. Therefore, decision makers are expected to enact applicable and strict policies so as to abate this public health risk.",Scientific reports,2019 Feb 28,England,2019,10

METHODS: A national Lithuanian retrospective study gathered data on all patients treated in outpatient/inpatient treatment facilities. Adjusted Incidence Ratios (AIRs) of AOMIs were calculated separately for each type of infection and for each year. Administrative districts (ADs) were grouped into low, medium, and high thirds based on the regional determinants: socio-economic index (R-SEI), access to basic (R-BDCI) or specialized dental care (R-SDCI) and index of systemic diseases (R-ISD). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant geographical differences in the distribution of TFs providing care for patients with AOMIs. Numbers of treatment facilities consistently increased from 2009 to 2013, but there was no consistent increase/decrease in the incidence of AOMIs (-1%). Regions with the highest R-SEI tended to have a higher incidence of AOMIs as compared to regions with medium or low R-SEI. When controlled for other determinants, lower R-BDCI/R-SDCI scores were associated with a higher incidence of AOMIs. CONCLUSIONS: High annual incidences (-1% of a total population) were diagnosed and treated for AOMIs, but there was no consistent time trend for these infections.",Community dental health,2015 Dec,England,2015,10
28963743,Community Health Centre-Based Outreach Clinic for undergraduate dental education: Experience in Helsinki over 8 years.,"INTRODUCTION: The University Dental Clinic of the City of Helsinki (UDC) developed a Community Health Centre-Based Outreach Clinic, with emphasis on paediatric dentistry. This study aimed to summarise the experiences and explore the student perspectives of the health centre-based outreach teaching clinic. METHODS: The study data were from the years 2010 to 2016. The dental procedures carried out by the third- to fifth-year dental students were based on electronic health record of patients. The students' self-perceived benefits and free-text comments on the outreach training were collected as part of a yearly questionnaire survey. RESULTS: A vast majority of the paediatric dental procedures that are required for competencies of dental students were performed in the outreach clinic. The most common procedures were fillings with local anaesthesia followed by preventive procedures. The majority of the students were very motivated to participate in the outreach training and reported that it was a useful educational approach to broaden their understanding of oral diseases and clinical experience. CONCLUSION: The outreach clinic gives dental students a chance to gain valuable clinical experience through the number and diversity of the dental procedures they carry out. They gain confidence and get an opportunity to get acquainted with the primary healthcare system and social determinants of oral diseases.

26942516,Exploring models for the roles of health systems' responsiveness and social determinants in explaining universal health coverage and health outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Intersectoral perspectives of health are present in the rhetoric of the sustainable development goals. Yet its descriptions of systematic approaches for an intersectoral monitoring vision, joining determinants of health, and barriers or facilitators to accessing healthcare services are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To explore models of associations between health outcomes and health service coverage, and health determinants and health systems responsiveness, and thereby to contribute to monitoring, analysis, and assessment approaches informed by an intersectoral vision of health. DESIGN: The study is designed as a series of ecological, cross-country regression analyses, covering between 23 and 57 countries with dependent health variables concentrated on the years 2002-2003. Countries cover a range of development contexts. Health outcome and health service coverage dependent variables were derived from World Health Organization (WHO) information sources. Predictor variables representing determinants are derived from the WHO and World Bank databases; variables used for health systems' responsiveness are derived from the WHO World Health Survey. Responsiveness is a measure of acceptability of health services to the population, complementing financial health protection. RESULTS: Health determinants' indicators - access to improved drinking sources, accountability, and average years of schooling - were statistically significant in particular health outcome regressions. Statistically significant coefficients were more common for mortality rate regressions than for coverage rate regressions. Responsiveness was systematically associated with poorer health and health service coverage. With respect to levels of inequality in health, the indicator of responsiveness problems experienced by the unhealthy poor groups in the population was statistically significant for regressions on measles vaccination inequalities between rich and poor. For the broader determinants, the Gini mattered most for inequalities in child mortality; education mattered more for inequalities in births attended by skilled personnel. CONCLUSIONS: This paper adds to the literature on comparative health systems research. National and international health monitoring frameworks need to incorporate indicators on trends in and impacts of other policy sectors on health. This will empower the health sector to carry out public health practices that promote health and health equity.",Global health action,2016,United States,2016,10
28510463,"Factors Associated with Incidence of Induced Abortion in Hamedan, Iran.","BACKGROUND: There is limited reliable information on abortion in Iran, where abortion is illegal and many women of reproductive age seek clandestine abortion to end their unintended pregnancy. This study aims to examine the determinants of induced abortion in the city of Hamedan, Iran. METHODS: The study utilizes recent data from the 2015 Hamedan Survey of Fertility, conducted in a representative sample of 3,000 married women aged 15-49 years in the city of Hamedan, Iran. Binary logistic regression models are used to examine factors associated with the incidence of abortion. RESULTS: Overall, 3.8% of respondents reported having had an induced abortion in their life. Multivariate results showed that the incidence of abortion was strongly associated with women's education, type of contraceptive and family income level, after controlling for confounding factors. Women using long-acting contraceptive methods, those educated under high school diploma or postsecondary education, and those with high level of income were more likely to report having an induced abortion. CONCLUSION: The high incidence of abortion among less or more educated women and those with high income level signifies unmet family planning needs among these women, which must be addressed by focused reproductive health and family planning programs.",Archives of Iranian medicine,2017 May,Iran,2017,10
29180547,The Full Scope of Family Physicians' Work Is Not Reflected by Current Procedural Terminology Codes.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to characterize the content of family physician (FP) clinic encounters, and to count the number of visits in which the FPs addressed issues not explicitly reportable by 99211 to 99215 and 99354 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes with current reimbursement methods and based on examples provided in the CPT manual. METHODS: The data collection instrument was modeled on the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Trained assistants directly observed every other FP-patient encounter and recorded every patient concern, issue addressed by the physician (including care barriers related to health care systems and social determinants), and treatment ordered in clinics affiliated with 10 residencies of the Residency Research Network of Texas. A visit was deemed to include physician work that was not explicitly reportable if the number or nature of issues addressed exceeded the definitions or examples for 99205/99215 or 99214 + 99354 or a preventive service code, included the physician addressing health care system or social determinant issues, or included the care of a family member. RESULTS: In 982 physician-patient encounters, patients raised 517 different reasons for visit (total, 5278; mean, 5.4 per visit; range, 1 to 16) and the FPs addressed 509 different issues (total issues, 3587; mean, 3.7 per visit; range, 1 to 10). FPs managed 425 different medications, 18 supplements, and 11 devices. A mean of 3.9 chronic medications were continued per visit (range, 0 to 21) and 4.6 total medications were managed (range, 0 to 22). In 592 (60.3%) of the visits the FPs did work that was not explicitly reportable with available CPT codes: 582 (59.3%) addressed more numerous issues than explicitly reportable, 64 (6.5%) addressed system barriers, and 13 (1.3%) addressed concerns for other family members. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: FPs perform cognitive work in a majority of their patient encounters that are not explicitly reportable, either by being higher than the CPT example number of diagnoses per code or the type of problems addressed, which has implications for the care of complex multi-morbid patients and the growth of the primary care workforce. To address these limitations, either the CPT codes and their associated rules should be updated to reflect the realities of family physicians' practices or new billing and coding approaches should be developed.",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,2017 Nov-Dec,United States,2017,10

20042562,Patient participation: current knowledge and applicability to patient safety.,"Patient participation is increasingly recognized as a key component in the redesign of health care processes and is advocated as a means to improve patient safety. The concept has been successfully applied to various areas of patient care, such as decision making and the management of chronic diseases. We review the origins of patient participation, discuss the published evidence on its efficacy, and summarize the factors influencing its implementation. Patient-related factors, such as acceptance of the new patient role, lack of medical knowledge, lack of confidence, comorbidity, and various sociodemographic parameters, all affect willingness to participate in the health care process. Among health care workers, the acceptance and promotion of patient participation are influenced by other issues, including the desire to maintain control, lack of time, personal beliefs, type of illness, and training in patient-caregiver relationships. Social status, specialty, ethnic origin, and the stakes involved also influence patient and health care worker acceptance. The London Declaration, endorsed by the World Health Organization World Alliance for Patient Safety, calls for a greater role for patients to improve the safety of health care worldwide. Patient participation in hand hygiene promotion among staff to prevent health care-associated infection is discussed as an illustrative example. A conceptual model including key factors that influence participation and invite patients to contribute to error prevention is proposed. Further research is essential to establish key determinants for the success of patient participation in reducing medical errors and in improving patient safety.",Mayo Clinic proceedings,2010 Jan,England,2010,10
21331054,Racism and hypertension: a review of the empirical evidence and implications for clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND: Despite improved hypertension (HTN) awareness and treatment, racial disparities in HTN prevalence persist. An understanding of the biopsychosocial determinants of HTN is necessary to address racial disparities in the prevalence of HTN. This review examines the evidence directly and indirectly linking multiple levels of racism to HTN. METHODS: Published empirical research in EBSCO databases investigating the relationships of three levels of racism (individual/interpersonal, internalized, and institutional racism) to HTN was reviewed. RESULTS: Direct evidence linking individual/interpersonal racism to HTN diagnosis is weak. However, the relationship of individual/interpersonal racism to ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) is more consistent, with all published studies reporting a positive relationship of interpersonal racism to ABP. There is no direct evidence linking internalized racism to BP. Population-based studies provide some evidence linking institutional racism, in the forms of residential racial segregation (RRS) and incarceration, to HTN incidence. Racism shows associations to stress exposure and reactivity as well as associations to established HTN-related risk factors including obesity, low levels of physical activity and alcohol use. The effects vary by level of racism. CONCLUSIONS: Overall the findings suggest that racism may increase risk for HTN; these effects emerge more clearly for institutional racism than for individual level racism. All levels of racism may influence the prevalence of HTN via stress exposure and reactivity and by fostering conditions that undermine health behaviors, raising the barriers to lifestyle change.",American journal of hypertension,2011 May,United States,2011,10
28738799,Prevalence of head lice infestation and pediculicidal effect of permethrine shampoo in primary school girls in a low-income area in southeast of Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Head lice infestation is a common public health problem that is most prevalent in primary school children throughout the world, especially in developing countries including different parts of Iran. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with head lice infestation and pediculicidal effect of 1% permethrin shampoo in primary schools girls of Bashagard County, one of the low socioeconomic areas in southeast of Iran. METHODS: In this interventional study six villages with similar demographical situations were selected and randomly assigned into intervention and control areas. In each area 150 girl students aged 7-12 years were selected randomly and screened for head lice infestation by visual scalp examination. In intervention area, treatment efficacy of 1% permethrin shampoo was evaluated via re-examination for infestation after one, two, and three weeks. Pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic and associated factors of head lice infestation. RESULTS: The prevalence of head lice infestation was 67.3%. There was significant association between head lice infestation and school grade, family size, parents' literacy, bathing facilities, frequency of hair washing, and use of shared articles (p < 0.05). The effectiveness of 1% permethrin shampoo for head lice treatment was 29.2, 68.9, and 90.3% after the first, second, and third weeks, respectively. CONCLUSION: The head lice infestation is a health problem in primary school girls of Bashagard County. Improvement of socioeconomic status and providing appropriate educational programs about head lice risk factors and prevention can be effective for reduction of infestation in this area.

28722217,Personal and situational predictors of everyday snacking: An application of temporal self-regulation theory.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims at testing predictions derived from temporal self-regulation theory (TST) in relation to discretionary food choices (snacks). TST combines a motivational sphere of influence (cognitions and temporal valuations resulting in intentions) with a momentary sphere (encompassing social and physical environmental cues). This dual approach differs from current health behaviour theories, but can potentially improve our understanding of the interplay of personal and environmental factors in health behaviour self-regulation. DESIGN: A mixed event-based and time-based (Ecological Momentary Assessment) study in 61 adults aged between 18 and 64, with a BMI range between 18.34 and 39.78 (M = 25.66, SD = 4.82) over two weeks. METHODS: Participants recorded their food and drink intake for two weeks in real time using electronic diaries. Participants also responded to non-consumption assessments at random intervals throughout each day. Momentary cues (individual, situational, and environmental factors) were assessed both during food logs and non-consumption assessments. Motivational factors, past behaviour, and trait self-regulation were assessed during baseline. RESULTS: Multilevel logistic regression analyses showed that across all snack types, environmental cues and negative affect were associated with an increased likelihood of snacking. Perceiving a cost of healthy eating to occur before eating was associated with an increased likelihood of snacking, whereas intentions and self-regulation were not. CONCLUSIONS: Discretionary food intake is largely guided by momentary cues, and motivational-level factors, such as intention and self-regulation, are less important in the initiation of discretionary food intake. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Overweight and obesity are a result of prolonged periods of energy imbalance between energy intake and expenditure (Hill & Peters, ). One of the key behavioural determinants of energy imbalances results from food intake, specifically from discretionary food choices (snacking). Temporal self-regulation theory (Hall & Fong, ) takes into account both deliberate and momentary influences on health behaviour, which is especially relevant to exploring the drivers of snacking. What does this study add? Offers new insight into the application of TST in explaining momentary eating behaviours. Snacking initiation is guided by momentary cues, not person-level factors. Dietary interventions should acknowledge the momentary cues that are associated with snacking.",British journal of health psychology,2017 Nov,England,2017,10
27754518,Determinants of tuberculosis in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.,"Objectives To explore the relationships among social, economic, environmental, and health services determinants of tuberculosis (TB) morbidity and mortality, and to identify the mechanisms that mediate such associations in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods This was an ecological study of 26 LAC countries that had accurate data available on 38 selected variables for the year 2010. The countries represented 99% of the TB burden in LAC. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify associations among determinants of health and TB morbidity and mortality. Results TB-HIV coinfection and multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) in previously treated cases were found to be positively associated to TB morbidity and negatively associated to improved basic sanitation and water coverage-pointing to an increase of TB morbidity in the first two variables and a decrease of TB morbidity in the last two. Regarding TB mortality, indigenous people and MDR-TB in previously treated cases were positively associated. In contrast, literacy among women, basic sanitation, water coverage, and nutritional status were negatively associated to mortality, denoting that improvements in these areas could reduce TB mortality. Conclusions The study findings support intersectoral actions that address social, economic, environmental, and health services determinants within the Stop TB strategy. The mechanisms by which social determinants of health affect current trend outcomes extend beyond medical interventions to control TB, but more research is needed to understand how and to develop actionable recommendations.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2016 Feb,United States,2016,10
27614465,"Workplace Interventions to Prevent Disability from Both the Scientific and Practice Perspectives: A Comparison of Scientific Literature, Grey Literature and Stakeholder Observations.","Purpose The significant individual and societal burden of work disability could be reduced if supportive workplace strategies could be added to evidence-based clinical treatment and rehabilitation to improve return-to-work (RTW) and other disability outcomes. The goal of this article is to summarize existing research on workplace interventions to prevent disability, relate these to employer disability management practices, and recommend future research priorities. Methods The authors participated in a year-long collaboration that ultimately led to an invited 3-day conference, Improving Research of Employer Practices to Prevent Disability, held October 14-16, 2015, in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, USA. The collaboration included a topical review of the literature, group conference calls to identify key areas and challenges, drafting of initial documents, review of industry publications, and a conference presentation that included feedback from peer researchers and a question/answer session with an expert panel with direct employer experience. Results Evidence from randomized trials and other research designs has shown general support for job modification, RTW coordination, and organizational support, but evidence is still lacking for interventions at a more granular level. Grey literature reports focused mainly on job re-design and work organization. Panel feedback focused on organizational readiness and the beliefs and values of senior managers as critical factors in facilitating changes to disability management practices. While the scientific literature is focused on facilitating improved coping and reducing discomforts for individual workers, the employer-directed grey literature is focused on making group-level changes to policies and procedures. Conclusions Future research might better target employer practices by tying interventions to positive workplace influences and determinants, by developing more participatory interventions and research designs, and by designing interventions that address factors of organizational change.",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,2016 Dec,Netherlands,2016,10
23991005,HIV testing and tolerance to gender based violence: a cross-sectional study in Zambia.,"This paper explores the effect of social relations and gender-based conflicts on the uptake of HIV testing in the South and Central provinces of Zambia. We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study of 1716 randomly selected individuals. Associations were examined using mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression. A total of 264 men (64%) and 268 women (56%) had never tested for HIV. The strongest determinants for not being tested were disruptive couple relationships (OR = 2.48 95% CI = 1.00-6.19); tolerance to gender-based violence (OR = 2.10 95% CI = 1.05-4.32) and fear of social rejection (OR = 1.48 95% CI = 1.23-1.80). In the Zambian context, unequal power relationships within the couple and the community seem to play a pivotal role in the decision to test which until now have been largely underestimated. Policies, programs and interventions to rapidly increase HIV testing need to urgently address gender-power inequity in relationships and prevent gender-based violence to reduce the negative impact on the lives of couples and families.",PloS one,2013,United States,2013,10
29020375,Food insecurity in Denmark-socio-demographic determinants and associations with eating- and health-related variables.,"Background: Food insecurity and its consequences have not received much attention in the Nordic, social-democratic welfare states. This study reports the prevalence of low and very low food security in Denmark, identifies its socio-demographic determinants and examines its associations with eating-related and health-related outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a mixed-mode response format (telephone interviewing or Internet). A disproportional stratified random sampling design was employed (N = 1877). Main measure was the 6-item gradient food security construct adapted from the US. Results: Prevalence of low and very low food security was 6.0% (95% CI:5.4-8.5%) and 2.4% (95% CI:1.3-3.3%), respectively. Prevalence was highest in households with disposable income below OECD's poverty threshold, households receiving benefits or disability pensions, and single-parent households. After socio-demographic adjustment, adults from low/very low food secure households had a higher probability of eating an unhealthy diet (women: adj.RR 2.82 P < 0.001; men: adj.RR 2.15 P < 0.01). Adults from low/very low food secure households had lower life satisfaction (women: adj.RR 0.49, P < 0.05; men: adj.RR 0.09 P < 0.001) and higher risk of psychological distress (women: adj.RR 2.42 P < 0.05; men: adj.RR 8.95 P < 0.001). Obesity was more prevalent in low/very low food secure women (RR 2.44 P < 0.05), but not after socio-demographic adjustment. Conclusion: Food insecurity in Denmark is associated with adverse factors such as unhealthy diet, obesity, life satisfaction, and psychological distress. It is important to widen food insecurity research to non-liberal welfare states since low/very low food security is negatively associated with unhealthy eating and other health indicators, even in a social-democratic welfare state.",European journal of public health,2018 Apr 1,England,2018,10
21512798,Contextual determinants of the social-transfer-of-learning effect.,"A recent study (Milanese et al. in Cogn 116(1):15-22, 2010) showed that performing a spatial compatibility task with incompatible S-R links (i.e., the practice task) alongside a co-actor eliminates the Simon effect in a subsequent joint Simon task (i.e., the transfer task). In the present study, we conducted three experiments to individuate which elements of the practice task need to remain constant for this social-transfer-of-learning to occur. In Experiment 1, participants performed the practice task alongside a co-actor and the Simon task with a different co-actor; in Experiment 2, they performed the practice task alongside a co-actor and the Simon task with the same co-actor after exchanging their seats. Results showed a modulation of the joint Simon effect in Experiment 1 only. In Experiment 2, we found a regular joint Simon effect. These results indicate that, while co-actor identity is not crucial, other elements of the context, such as keeping the same position across tasks, are necessary for the social-transfer-of-learning to occur. On the whole, our data suggest that the social-transfer-of-learning effect is not tuned to a specific co-actor and depends on spatial parameters of the practice and transfer tasks.",Experimental brain research,2011 Jun,Germany,2011,10

Despite the advances in the Mexican health system which has greatly improved the health conditions of the population, there is a lag in investment in health, with the major investment challenges as such, coordination between all levels, distribution of human, technological and financial resources, the autonomy of professional practice, the innovation of attention schemes, and modernization of trade unions.",Gaceta medica de Mexico,2011 Nov-Dec,Mexico,2011,10
22704817,Determinants of participation in organized colorectal cancer screening in Isere (France).,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In France, participation in organized colorectal cancer screening remains low. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of participation in colorectal cancer screening in Isere, a French administrative entity. METHODS: This study examined the target population invited for screening between 2007 and 2008 in Isere. The statistical analysis method was based on a two-level logistic regression model: the first was the individual level relative to the individuals invited for screening and the second was an aggregate level corresponding to the socioeconomic level of an invited person's residence area (IRIS: ""Ilot regroupe pour l'Information Statistique""; Regrouped statistical information block). The evaluation of the socioeconomic level was based on the Townsend deprivation. RESULTS: Participation varied depending on sex, age, and health insurance plan. The people residing in the least deprived IRISes participated more than individuals residing in the most deprived IRISes. The multilevel analysis showed a 24% difference in participation between the least and the most deprived IRISes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of socioeconomic data on the IRIS geographical unit has identified, socially and geographically, the populations that participate the least, although this reflects ""mean"" behaviors. These results could be used to set up targeted actions to encourage participation in these populations.",Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,2013 Apr,France,2013,10
29211765,Impact of multisectoral health determinants on child mortality 1980-2010: An analysis by country baseline mortality.,"INTRODUCTION: Some health determinants require relatively stronger health system capacity and socioeconomic development than others to impact child mortality. Few quantitative analyses have analyzed how the impact of health determinants varies by mortality level. METHODS: 149 low- and middle-income countries were stratified into high, moderate, low, and very low baseline levels of child mortality in 1990. Data for 52 health determinants were collected for these countries for 1980-2010. To quantify how changes in health determinants were associated with mortality decline, univariable and multivariable regression models were constructed. An advanced statistical technique that is new for child mortality analyses-MM-estimation with first differences and country clustering-controlled for outliers, fixed effects, and variation across decades. FINDINGS: Some health determinants (immunizations, education) were consistently associated with child mortality reduction across all mortality levels. Others (staff availability, skilled birth attendance, fertility, water and sanitation) were associated with child mortality reduction mainly in low or very low mortality settings. The findings indicate that the impact of some health determinants on child mortality was only apparent with stronger health systems, public infrastructure and levels of socioeconomic development, whereas the impact of other determinants was apparent at all stages of development. Multisectoral progress was essential to mortality reduction at all baseline mortality levels. CONCLUSION: Policy-makers can use such analyses to direct investments in health and non-health sectors and to set five-year child mortality targets appropriate for their baseline mortality levels and local context.",PloS one,2017,United States,2017,10
24489695,Determinants of public attitudes to genetically modified salmon.,"The objective of this paper is to assess the attitude of Malaysian stakeholders to genetically modified (GM) salmon and to identify the factors that influence their acceptance of GM salmon using a structural equation model. A survey was carried out on 434 representatives from various stakeholder groups in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia. Public attitude towards GM salmon was measured using self-developed questionnaires with seven-point Likert scales. The findings of this study have confirmed that public attitudes towards GM salmon is a complex issue and should be seen as a multi-faceted process. The most important direct predictors for the encouragement of GM salmon are the specific application-linked perceptions about religious acceptability of GM salmon followed by perceived risks and benefits, familiarity, and general promise of modern biotechnology. Encouragement of GM salmon also involves the interplay among other factors such as general concerns of biotechnology, threatening the natural order of things, the need for labeling, the need for patenting, confidence in regulation, and societal values. The research findings can serve as a database that will be useful for understanding the social construct of public attitude towards GM foods in a developing country.",PloS one,2014,United States,2014,10
25604180,[A first analysis of research on social determinants of health in Mexico: 2005-2012].,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the research on social determinants of health (SDH) produced in Mexico during the period 2005-2012, based on the characterization of the national health research system and the scientific production on this topic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-stage analyses: Review of Mexican documents and official sources on health research and systematic bibliographic review of the literature on SDH. RESULTS: Although SDH were mentioned in the Specific Action Plan for Health Research 2007-2012, they are not implemented in strategies and goals, as the emphasis is put mostly in infrastructure and administrative aspects of research. In the period studied, 145 articles were published on SDH topics such as health conditions, health systems and nutrition and obesity.

26555443,Why Wait? Early Determinants of School Dropout in Preventive Pediatric Primary Care.,"BACKGROUND: To answer the question of what bio-psychosocial determinants in infancy, early and middle childhood, and adolescence predict school drop-out in young adulthood, we approached the complex process towards school dropout as a multidimensional, life-course phenomenon. The aim is to find signs of heightened risks of school dropout as early as possible which will eventually help public health workers in reducing these risks. METHODS: In a case-control design, we used data from both the Preventive Pediatric Primary Care (PPPC) files (that contain information from birth onwards) and additional questionnaires filled out by 529 youngsters, aged 18-23 years, and living in the South-east of the Netherlands. We first conducted univariate logistic regression analyses with school-dropout as the dependent variable. Backward and forward stepwise analyses with the significant variables were done with variables pertaining to the 0 to 4 year period. Remaining significant variables were forced into the next model and subsequently variables pertaining to respectively the 4 to 8, 8 to 12 and 12 to 16 year period were introduced in a stepwise analysis. All analyses were cross-validated in an exploratory and confirmatory random half of the sample. RESULTS: One parent families and families with a non-Western background less often attended the health examinations of the PPPC and such less attendance was related to school dropout. The birth of a sibling (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.93) in infancy and self-efficacy (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74) in adolescence decreased the odds of school dropout; externalizing behavior (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.53-5.14) in middle childhood and (sickness) absence (OR 5.62, 95% CI 2.18-14.52) in adolescence increased the risks. CONCLUSION: To prevent school dropout, PPPC professionals should not wait until imminent dropout, but should identify and tackle risk factors as early as possible and actively approach youngsters who withdraw from public health care.",PloS one,2015,United States,2015,10
31452520,Characterizing Participation and Perceived Engagement Benefits in an Integrated Digital Behavioral Health Recovery Community for Women: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Research suggests that digital recovery support services (D-RSSs) may help support individual recovery and augment the availability of in-person supports. Previous studies highlight the use of D-RSSs in supporting individuals in recovery from substance use but have yet to examine the use of D-RSSs in supporting a combination of behavioral health disorders, including substance use, mental health, and trauma. Similarly, few studies on D-RSSs have evaluated gender-specific supports or integrated communities, which may be helpful to women and individuals recovering from behavioral health disorders. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the SHE RECOVERS (SR) recovery community, with the following 3 aims: (1) to characterize the women who engage in SR (including demographics and recovery-related characteristics), (2) describe the ways and frequency in which participants engage with SR, and (3) examine the perception of benefit derived from engagement with SR. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional survey to examine the characteristics of SR participants. Analysis of variance and chi-square tests, as well as univariate logistic regressions, were used to explore each aim. RESULTS: Participants (N=729, mean age 46.83 years; 685/729, 94% Caucasian) reported being in recovery from a variety of conditions, although the most frequent nonexclusive disorder was substance use (86.40%, n=630). Participants had an average length in recovery (LIR) of 6.14 years (SD 7.87), with most having between 1 and 5 years (n=300). The most frequently reported recovery pathway was abstinence-based 12-step mutual aid (38.40%). Participants reported positive perceptions of benefit from SR participation, which did not vary by LIR or recovery pathway. Participants also had high rates of agreement, with SR having a positive impact on their lives, although this too did vary by recovery length and recovery pathway. Participants with 1 to 5 years of recovery used SR to connect with other women in recovery at higher rates, whereas those with less than 1 year used SR to ask for resources at higher rates, and those with 5 or more years used SR to provide support at higher rates. Lifetime engagement with specific supports of SR was also associated with LIR and recovery pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Gender-specific and integrated D-RSSs are feasible and beneficial from the perspective of participants. D-RSSs also appear to provide support to a range of recovery typologies and pathways in an effective manner and may be a vital tool for expanding recovery supports for those lacking in access and availability because of geography, social determinants, or other barriers.",JMIR mental health,2019 Aug 26,Canada,2019,10
25105125,Gender inequalities in the health of immigrants and workplace discrimination in Czechia.,"This study analyses the relationship between immigrants' self-reported/rated health (SRH) and their perceived working conditions in Czechia materialized via discrimination, based on the example of Ukrainian immigrants analyzed by gender dimension. The role of age, education, and marital status is also analyzed. A sample of native-born Czechs serves as a reference frame. A cross-sectional design was applied. Using data from two surveys of Ukrainian immigrants in Czechia and a countrywide health interview survey for Czechs, we analyse inequalities in SRH and workplace discrimination loads. Four binary logistic regression models were computed separately for women and men from Ukraine and Czechia to identify the determinants of fair/poor SRH. We found that only Ukrainian immigrant females were heavily exposed to all four measured types of workplace discrimination, thereby modifying and worsening the quality of their SRH. Determinants which are behind respondents' SRH differ between Ukrainian immigrants vis-a-vis Czechs with one exception. The ""oldest age group"" (41-62) contributes to poorer assessment of SRH among Ukrainian females, Czech females, and Czech males too. The lowest educational level (primary education) correlates with poor SRH within the sample of Czech males.",BioMed research international,2014,United States,2014,10
31516048,The built environment and health: fostering interprofessional collaboration for better policy recommendations.,"This paper describes the initiation and proceedings of a national consultation organized to appraise issues in the local built environment affecting public health, using an interprofessional and intersectoral approach. The consultation was hosted as a part of the onsite session of an international fellowship program in interprofessional education and practice, organized by the Manipal FAIMER Institute for Leadership in Interprofessional Education, India. One hundred and eight delegates from across academic disciplines including the health professions, management, public health, architecture, and engineering, participated in this event. Plenary lectures and case studies highlighted the theoretical basics of built environment. Participants were also introduced to fundamental parameters for evaluating health-related aspects of the built environment. Delegates were then grouped into 18 teams and assigned to visit predetermined locations which they appraised and provided recommendations for. These were then thematically coded and synthesized for communication to relevant local municipal authorities. The consultation scope was limited by involving only academics in the appraisal process, and next steps include the engagement of local citizens and policy-makers to ensure the implementation of recommendations. This event illustrates how engaging interprofessional stakeholders can facilitate knowledge-driven development for promoting health equity, through action on the social determinants of health.",Journal of interprofessional care,2019 Sep 13,England,2019,10
28604146,Clients and carers perception of mental illness and factors that influence help-seeking: Where they go first and why.,"OBJECTIVE: In Northern Malawi, the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is longer than that in high-income countries. The reasons for the delay in help-seeking are not known, although studies show multiple reasons. This research was conducted to establish health care help-seeking behaviours and identify barriers that exist between service users and health care providers. The study also intended to establish the beliefs that clients and family members have regarding the causes of mental illness which profoundly shape help-seeking, care giving process and outcomes. METHODOLOGY: The study employed the exploratory phenomenological method, utilizing focus group discussions (FGDs) in the sampled population. The Health Belief Model and Disease Explanatory Models were conveniently chosen a priori by researchers to develop guide questions to explore clients' and carers' perceptions of the illness and their health care help-seeking behaviours. RESULTS: Results show a bio-psycho-social inclination of disease causation and help-seeking behaviour. Causes of mental illness are understood in three categories, namely: physical/biological, psychological and socio-cultural. The majority of participants attributed mental illness to socio-cultural factors, with witchcraft, spirit possession and curses as main determinants. Causal perceptions also influenced help-seeking pathways. Many participants reported consulting traditional healers first, for diagnosis and to know who was responsible. CONCLUSION: In this study, it has been found that help-seeking is influenced by the understanding of the source of the illness - which has a bio-psychosocial inclination. The socio-cultural explanation of witchcraft and spirit possession is dominant and a determinant of help-seeking behaviour. While participants noted benefits to hospital treatment, barriers and bio-psychosocial in nature were also noted. Guardians and not clients hold the key to choice of treatment modality and therefore a potential ally in all treatment interventions promotive, preventive and curative. There is need for strengthening of a bio-psychosocial intervention model in the treatment of mental illness.",The International journal of social psychiatry,2017 Aug,England,2017,10
28188120,Suicide rate in relation to the Human Development Index and other health related factors: A global ecological study from 91 countries.,"There has been no worldwide ecological study on suicide as a global major public health problem. This study aimed to identify the variations in suicide specific rates using the Human Development Index (HDI) and some health related variables among countries around the world. In this ecological study, we obtained the data from the World Bank Report 2013. The analysis was restricted to 91 countries for which both the epidemiologic data from the suicide rates and HDI were available. Overall, the global prevalence of suicide rate was 10.5 (95% confidence intervals: 8.8, 12.2) per 100,000 individuals, which significantly varied according to gender (16.3 in males vs. 4.6 in females, p<0.001) and different levels of human development (11.64/100,000 individuals in very high development countries, 7.93/100,000 individuals in medium development countries, and 13.94/100,000 individuals in high development countries, p=0.004). In conclusion, the suicide rate varies greatly between countries with different development levels. Our findings also suggest that male gender and HDI components are associated with an increased risk of suicide behaviors. Hence, detecting population subgroups with a high suicide risk and reducing the inequality of socioeconomic determinants are necessary to prevent this disorder around the world.",Journal of epidemiology and global health,2017 Jun,France,2017,10
26060702,Persistence of Hemorrhage and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) as the Main Causes of Maternal Mortality: Emergence of Medical Errors in Iranian Healthcare System.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess factors affecting substandard care and probable medical errors associated with obstetric hemorrhage and HDP at a Northwestern Iranian health care system. METHODS: In a community-based descriptive cross-sectional study, data on all maternal deaths occurred at West Azerbaijan Province, Iran during a period of 10 years from March 21, 2002 to March 20, 2011 was analyzed. The principal cause of death, main contributory factors, nature of care, main responsible staff for sub-standard care and medical error were determined. The data on maternal deaths was obtained from the national Maternal Mortality Surveillance System (MMSS) which were covered all maternal deaths. The ""Three delays model"" was used to recognize contributing factors of maternal deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage and HDP. RESULTS: There were 183 maternal deaths, therefore the Mean Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in the province was 32.8 per 100 000 live births (95% CI, 32.64-32.88). The most common causes of maternal deaths were obstetric hemorrhage in 36.6% of cases and HDP in 25.7%. The factors that most contributed to the deaths were all types of medical errors and substandard care with different proportions in management of obstetric hemorrhage and HDP. CONCLUSION: A substandard care and medical error was the major contributing factor in both obstetric hemorrhage and HDP leading to maternal mortality, therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of health care at all levels especially hospitals.",Iranian journal of public health,2014 Oct,Iran,2014,10

30197817,"Examining Joint Effects of Air Pollution Exposure and Social Determinants of Health in Defining ""At-Risk"" Populations Under the Clean Air Act: Susceptibility of Pregnant Women to Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy.","Pregnant women are uniquely susceptible to adverse effects of air pollution exposure due to vulnerabilities and health consequences during pregnancy (e.g., hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [HDP]) compared to the general population. Because the Clean Air Act (CAA) creates a duty to protect at-risk groups, the regulatory assessment of at-risk populations has both policy and scientific foundations. Previously, pregnant women have not been specially protected in establishing the margin of safety for the ozone and particulate matter (PM) standards. Due to physiological changes, pregnant women can be at greater risk of adverse effects of air pollution and should be considered an at-risk population. Women with preexisting conditions, women experiencing poverty, and groups that suffer systematic discrimination may be particularly susceptible to cardiac effects of air pollutants during pregnancy. We rigorously reviewed 11 studies of over 1.3 million pregnant women in the United States to characterize the relationship between ozone or PM exposure and HDP. Findings were generally mixed, with a few studies reporting a joint association between ozone or PM and social determinants or pre-existing chronic health conditions related to HDP. Adequate evidence associates exposure to PM with an adverse effect of HDP among pregnant women not evident among non-gravid populations.",World medical & health policy,2018 Mar,United States,2018,10
25409647,Social determinants of death among the elderly: a systematic literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims at working on a systematic review of articles published on social determinants associated with the elderly mortality. METHODS: We searched articles published in Portuguese, English and Spanish language periodicals from January 1st 2007 to December 31st 2009, by means of Lilacs and Pubmed databases. Twenty cohort studies were identified, having most of them been developed in European, North-American and Asian countries. RESULTS: The articles analysed provided determinant social factors significantly associated with the elderly mortality: urban/rural and intercontinental variation, be part of ethnic minorities, financial stress, living conditions, schooling, social participation, gender and race discrimination, smoking, alcoholism, physical activities, instrumental activities of daily living, leisure, marital status, equality and healthy lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Mortality amongst the elderly is influenced by social determinants in many levels of reach, from determinants linked to lifestyle to socioeconomic macro-determinants. The actions on these determinants must be guided by the intersectorial perspective and regarded as a priority in the health sector, seeking to provide extended longevity with good quality of life for the population.",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,2014,Brazil,2014,10
22998808,Perceived unfairness and socioeconomic inequalities in functional decline: the Dutch SMILE prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: People in lower socioeconomic positions report worse health-related functioning. Only few examined whether perceptions of unfairness are particularly common in these people and whether this perceived unfairness relates to their subsequent poor health outcomes. We thus set out to examine the contribution of perceived unfairness to the higher risks of physical and mental dysfunction in men and women with a lower socioeconomic position. METHODS: Seven-year prospective cohort data from the Dutch SMILE study among 1,282 persons, 55 years old and older, were used. Physical and mental health-related functioning was measured with the SF-36, socioeconomic status with income and education, and the perception of unfairness with an extended new measure asking for such perceptions in both work and non-work domains. RESULTS: Perceived unfairness was more common in lower socioeconomic positions. Such perpection was related to both physical (odds ratio = 1.57 (95% confidence interval: 1.17-2.11)) and mental (1.47 (1.07-2.03)) decline, while low socioeconomic position was only related to mental decline (1.33 (1.06-1.67)). When socioeconomic position and perceived unfairness were simultaneously controlled, odds ratios for both determinants decreased only very little. Socioeconomic position and perceived unfairness were for the largest part independently related to longitudinal health-related decline. CONCLUSIONS: The general perception of unfairness, at work and beyond work, might have implications for functional decline in middle and older age. We recommend that - rather than addressing and changing individual perceptions of unfairness--more research is needed to find out whether specific environments can be defined as unfair and whether such environments can be effectively tackled in an attempt to truly improve public health.",BMC public health,2012 Sep 22,England,2012,10
27624991,Parental pre-pregnancy BMI influences on offspring BMI and waist circumference at 21 years.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prospective association between parental pre-pregnancy BMI and adult male and female offspring BMI and waist circumference (WC). METHODS: Sub-sample of 2,229 parent-offspring pairs with parental pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring BMI and WC at 21 years were used from the MUSP (Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy cohort). Multivariable results were adjusted for maternal factors around pregnancy (e.g. gestational weight and smoking during pregnancy) and offspring factors in early life (e.g. birth weight) and at 14 years (e.g. sports participation and mealtime with family). RESULTS: After adjustments for confounders, each unit increase in paternal and maternal BMI, the BMI of young adult offspring increased by 0.33kg/m(2) and 0.35kg/m(2) , and the WC increased by 0.76 cm and 0.62 cm, respectively. In the combination of parents' weight status, offspring at 21 years were six times the risk being overweight/obese (OW/OB) when both parents were OW/OB, compared to offspring of healthy weight parents. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal parental BMI are independently related to adult offspring BMI and WC. IMPLICATIONS: Both prenatal paternal-maternal weight status are important determinants of offspring weight status in long-term. Further studies are warranted to investigate the underlying mechanisms.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2016 Dec,Australia,2016,10
26936057,A Canadian qualitative study exploring the diversity of the experience of family caregivers of older adults with multiple chronic conditions using a social location perspective.,"BACKGROUND: A little-studied issue in the provision of care at home by informal caregivers is the increase in older adult patients with chronic illness, and more specifically, multiple chronic conditions (MCC). We know little about the caregiving experience for this population, particularly as it is affected by social location, which refers to either a group's or individual's place/location in society at a given time, based on their intersecting demographics (age, gender, education, race, immigration status, geography, etc.). We have yet to fully comprehend the combined influence of these intersecting axes on caregivers' health and wellbeing, and attempt to do this by using an intersectionality approach in answering the following research question: How does social location influence the experience of family caregivers of older adults with MCC? METHODS: The data presented herein is a thematic analysis of a qualitative sub-set of a large two-province study conducted using a repeated-measures embedded mixed method design. A survey sub-set of 20 survey participants per province (n = 40 total) were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. In the first stage of data analysis, Charmaz's (2006) Constructivist Grounded Theory Method (CGTM) was used to develop initial codes, focused codes, categories and descriptive themes. In the second and the third stages of analysis, intersectionality was used to develop final analytical themes. RESULTS: The following four themes describe the overall study findings: (1) Caregiving Trajectory, where three caregiving phases were identified; (2) Work, Family, and Caregiving, where the impact of caregiving was discussed on other areas of caregivers' lives; (3) Personal and Structural Determinants of Caregiving, where caregiving sustainability and coping were deliberated, and; (4) Finding Meaning/Self in Caregiving, where meaning-making was highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The intersectionality approach presented a number of axes of diversity as comparatively more important than others; these included gender, age, education, employment status, ethnicity, and degree of social connectedness. This can inform caregiver policy and programs to sustain health and well-being.",International journal for equity in health,2016 Mar 2,England,2016,10
26555443,Why Wait? Early Determinants of School Dropout in Preventive Pediatric Primary Care.,"BACKGROUND: To answer the question of what bio-psychosocial determinants in infancy, early and middle childhood, and adolescence predict school drop-out in young adulthood, we approached the complex process towards school dropout as a multidimensional, life-course phenomenon. The aim is to find signs of heightened risks of school dropout as early as possible which will eventually help public health workers in reducing these risks. METHODS: In a case-control design, we used data from both the Preventive Pediatric Primary Care (PPPC) files (that contain information from birth onwards) and additional questionnaires filled out by 529 youngsters, aged 18-23 years, and living in the South-east of the Netherlands. We first conducted univariate logistic regression analyses with school-dropout as the dependent variable. Backward and forward stepwise analyses with the significant variables were done with variables pertaining to the 0 to 4 year period. Remaining significant variables were forced into the next model and subsequently variables pertaining to respectively the 4 to 8, 8 to 12 and 12 to 16 year period were introduced in a stepwise analysis. All analyses were cross-validated in an exploratory and confirmatory random half of the sample. RESULTS: One parent families and families with a non-Western background less often attended the health examinations of the PPPC and such less attendance was related to school dropout. The birth of a sibling (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.93) in infancy and self-efficacy (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74) in adolescence decreased the odds of school dropout; externalizing behavior (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.53-5.14) in middle childhood and (sickness) absence (OR 5.62, 95% CI 2.18-14.52) in adolescence increased the risks. CONCLUSION: To prevent school dropout, PPPC professionals should not wait until imminent dropout, but should identify and tackle risk factors as early as possible and actively approach youngsters who withdraw from public health care.",PloS one,2015,United States,2015,10
31307408,"Obstetric determinants of preterm delivery in a regional hospital, Accra, Ghana 2016.","BACKGROUND: Globally, prematurity is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality contributing 30-40% of neonatal mortality. The consequences of preterm deliveries are enormous with developmental and childhood complications as well as high economic and psycho-social burden on the parents (family) and society. Some risk factors include ever having preterm delivery, multiple births and some medical conditions like sexually transmitted infection and urinary tract infections but these have not been ascertained in our study area. Much research into these risk factors is needed in Ghana. We assessed the obstetric determinants of preterm delivery. METHODS: We conducted a 1:2 unmatched case-control study in Greater Accra Regional Hospital (GARH) -Ridge, a secondary referral facility in Accra, Ghana (from October, 2015 -May, 2016). A case was a mother who delivered between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation (preterm) and a control was a mother who delivered after 37 to 42 completed weeks (term). We used structured questionnaire to collect data, reviewed maternal and foetal records using a checklist. Categorical variables were analysed and expressed as frequencies and proportions. We determined the association between obstetric factors and preterm delivery with multiple logistic regression. Significance level of the strength of association was determined at 95% CI and p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: We recruited 390 mothers, 130 had preterm deliveries (cases) and 260 had term deliveries (controls). Experiencing premature rupture of membrane (aOR: 2.3; 95% CI:1.0-5.5), pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (aOR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.0-11.9) were found to be associated with preterm delivery. However, four or more ANC visit was protective factor for preterm delivery (aOR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.4). CONCLUSION: Premature rupture of membrane, hypertensive complications and antepartum haemorrhage were found to be risk factors associated with preterm delivery in Ridge Hospital. Health workforce providing ANC services need to identify risk factors and refer these mothers to the doctor for early management and improved outcome decreasing preterm delivery.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2019 Jul 15,England,2019,10

24903322,"Personality, psychosocial and health-related predictors of quality of life in old age.","OBJECTIVES: Beyond its well-documented association with depressive symptoms across the lifespan, at an individual level, quality of life may be determined by multiple factors: psychosocial characteristics, current physical health and long-term personality traits. METHOD: Quality of life was assessed in two distinct community-based age groups (89 young adults aged 36.2 +/- 6.3 and 92 older adults aged 70.4 +/- 5.5 years), each group equally including adults with and without acute depressive symptoms. Regression models were applied to explore the association between quality of life assessed with the World Health Organization Quality of Life - Bref (WHOQOL-Bref) and depression severity, education, social support, physical illness, as well as personality dimensions as defined by the Five-Factor Model. RESULTS: In young age, higher quality of life was uniquely associated with lower severity of depressive symptoms. In contrast, in old age, higher quality of life was related to both lower levels of depressive mood and of physical illness. In this age group, a positive association was also found between quality of life and higher levels of Openness to experience and Agreeableness personality dimensions. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that, in contrast to young cohorts, where acute depression is the main determinant of poor quality of life, physical illness and personality dimensions represent additional independent predictors of this variable in old age. This observation points to the need for concomitant consideration of physical and psychological determinants of quality of life in old age.",Aging & mental health,2015,England,2015,10
30781459,A Case Study in Personal Identification and Social Determinants of Health: Unregistered Births among Indigenous People in Northern Ontario.,"Under international law, birth registration is considered a human right because it determines access to important legal protections as well as essential services and social supports across the lifespan. Difficulties related to birth registration and the acquisition of personal identification (PID) are largely regarded as problems specific to low-income countries. For Indigenous people in northern and rural Canada, however, lack of PID, like birth certificates, is a common problem that is rooted in the geography of the region as well as historical and contemporary settler colonial policies. This communication elucidates the complicated terrain of unregistered births for those people living in northern Ontario in order to generate discussion about how the social determinants of health for Indigenous people in Canada are affected by PID. Drawing on intake surveys, qualitative interviews and participant observation field notes, we use the case study of ""Susan"" as an entry point to share insights into the ""intergenerational problem"" of unregistered births in the region. Susan's case speaks to how unregistered births and lack of PID disproportionately impacts the health and well-being of Indigenous people and communities in northern Ontario. The implications and the need for further research on this problem in Canada are discussed.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 Feb 16,Switzerland,2019,10
28182041,Assessment of health-related quality of life and its determinants in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Health-related quality of life is an important, yet neglected aspect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) care. We evaluated the quality of life and its determinants across CKD 3 to 5D using a kidney disease specific tool (Kidney Disease Quality of Life-SF) in an underprivileged, predominantly rural population with high rates of illiteracy and unemployment. The scores of individual domains were summarized to three composite scores - physical composite summary (PCS), mental composite summary (MCS), and kidney disease component summary score (KDCS)(.) A total number of 204 participants were recruited from nephrology outpatient clinics. About 68.1% of participants were males. The mean age of the study population was 49.14 +/- 13.63 years. There was a high proportion of illiteracy (36.3%) and unemployment (80.9%). KDCS showed a significant decline (P = 0.01) from CKD 3 to CKD 5D whereas MCS and PCS showed a nonsignificant decrease. There was no difference in KDCS, PCS, or MCS scores between patients treated by hemodialysis and CAPD. Illiteracy and unemployment were associated with significantly lower KDCS, PCS, and MCS scores. Age >/=50 years was associated with poor PCS (29.49 +/- 8.20 vs. 34.17 +/- 9.99; P < 0.001). Hemoglobin <10 g/dL was associated with poor KDCS (58.93 +/- 13.09 vs. 65.55 +/- 13.38; P < 0.001) and PCS (29.56 +/- 8.13 vs. 33.37 +/- 9.82; P < 0.001). The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension had no impact on the composite scores. KDCS, MCS, or PCS scores did not vary among patients having high serum phosphorus (>/=4.5 mg/dL), low albumin (<3.5 g/dL), and elevated parathyroid hormone (>/=150 pg/ml). On multiple linear regression analysis, the predictors of KDCS were unemployment (P < 0.001) and illiteracy (P = 0.03). Unemployment (P < 0.001) and age (P < 0.001) were predictors of PCS whereas literacy level (P < 0.001) was predictive of MCS.",Indian journal of nephrology,2017 Jan-Feb,India,2017,10

Individual interviews and two focus groups were conducted with men who participated in group programs in two agencies in Canada. Our qualitative analysis of interviews and focus groups suggested that both individual and program-related factors were determinants in the men's engagement. These findings drew our attention to the influence of certain factors outside of the group therapy, in particular organizational practices.

26591762,[Social determinants of chronic diseases related behaviors in primary school students in Beijing City].,"OBJECTIVE: To identify social determinants of chronic diseases related behaviors in primary school students in Beijing, China. METHODS: Cross-sectional study was designed and a two-stage (districts and schools) stratified (school type) cluster (classes) sampling method was adopted. Haidian and Fengtai districts were chosen firstly. One state and one private school with more migrant children were chosen in each district, paired with two state primary schools with more permanent resident children. Two classes from grades 4, 5 and 6 from each primary school were selected, all students in which and their parents were included as study subjects. A self-designed questionnaire was adopted to collect demographic information, chronic diseases related behaviors and knowledge from students and their parents. Overall, a total of 1604 paired samples of students and parents were obtained from eight primary schools. Eleven self-reported behaviors were grouped into three, which were trying smoking, dietary intake frequency (vegetables, fruit, milk, and breakfast intake, salty foods, fatty diets), sedentary life style (reading, watching TV and playing PC continuously more than one hour, and having physical activities both in school and at home). According to the number of risk behaviors, three groups were classified as low (0 - 1), medium (2 - 3), and high (4 + ). ANOVA, Chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression analysis were adopted to find the influence of demographic characteristics, school types, social economic status (SES) , students' health knowledge, and parents' health knowledge and behaviors on students' number of risk behaviors. RESULTS: Ordinal logistic regression analysis showed boys (OR = 1. 26, 95% CI 1. 03 - 1. 53) and older (OR = 1. 25, 95% CI 1. 14 - 1. 37) were risk factors for more risk behaviors. Higher SES scores (OR = 0. 84,95% CI 0. 73 - 0. 95) and higher students' health knowledge scores (OR = 0. 87, 95% CI 0. 83 - 0. 91), and better parents' health behaviors scores (OR = 0. 87, 95% CI 0. 83 - 0. 91) were protective factors for the number of risk behaviors. Household registration status and school types had no significant impact yet. Boys (OR = 1. 39, 95% CI 1. 08 -1.79) and lower SES scores (OR =0. 85, 95% CI 0. 73 -1. 00) were significant risk factors for more risk behaviors among migrant students, compared with those in residents students, while other factors had similar impact between two groups. CONCLUSION: Family social and economic status, students' health knowledge and parents' behaviors would have great impact on students' health behaviors cultivation.",Wei sheng yan jiu = Journal of hygiene research,2015 Sep,China,2015,10
21159224,"Workers' health risk behaviors by state, demographic characteristics, and health insurance status.","INTRODUCTION: Employers often lack data about their workers' health risk behaviors. We analyzed state-level prevalence data among workers for 4 common health risk behaviors: obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, and missed influenza vaccination (among workers older than 50 years). METHODS: We analyzed 2007 and 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, restricting the sample to employed respondents aged 18 to 64 years. We stratified health risk behavior prevalence by annual household income, educational attainment, health insurance status, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: For all 4 health risk behaviors, we found significant differences across states and significant disparities related to social determinants of health - income, education, and race/ethnicity. Among uninsured workers, prevalence of smoking was high and influenza vaccinations were lacking. CONCLUSION: In this national survey study, we found that workers' health risk behaviors vary substantially by state and by workers' socioeconomic status, insurance status, and race/ethnicity. Employers and workplace health promotion practitioners can use the prevalence tables presented in this article to inform their workplace health promotion programs.",Preventing chronic disease,2011 Jan,United States,2011,10
23865895,Social systems and life-history characteristics of mongooses.,"The diversity of extant carnivores provides valuable opportunities for comparative research to illuminate general patterns of mammalian social evolution. Recent field studies on mongooses (Herpestidae), in particular, have generated detailed behavioural and demographic data allowing tests of assumptions and predictions of theories of social evolution. The first studies of the social systems of their closest relatives, the Malagasy Eupleridae, also have been initiated. The literature on mongooses was last reviewed over 25 years ago. In this review, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the social organisation, mating systems and social structure (especially competition and cooperation) of the two mongoose families. Our second aim is to evaluate the contributions of these studies to a better understanding of mammalian social evolution in general. Based on published reports or anecdotal information, we can classify 16 of the 34 species of Herpestidae as solitary and nine as group-living; there are insufficient data available for the remainder. There is a strong phylogenetic signal of sociality with permanent complex groups being limited to the genera Crossarchus, Helogale, Liberiictis, Mungos, and Suricata. Our review also indicates that studies of solitary and social mongooses have been conducted within different theoretical frameworks: whereas solitary species and transitions to gregariousness have been mainly investigated in relation to ecological determinants, the study of social patterns of highly social mongooses has instead been based on reproductive skew theory. In some group-living species, group size and composition were found to determine reproductive competition and cooperative breeding through group augmentation. Infanticide risk and inbreeding avoidance connect social organisation and social structure with reproductive tactics and life histories, but their specific impact on mongoose sociality is still difficult to evaluate. However, the level of reproductive skew in social mongooses is not only determined by the costs and benefits of suppressing each other's breeding attempts, but also influenced by resource abundance. Thus, dispersal, as a consequence of eviction, is also linked to the costs of co-breeding in the context of food competition. By linking these facts, we show that the socio-ecological model and reproductive skew theory share some determinants of social patterns. We also conclude that due to their long bio-geographical isolation and divergent selection pressures, future studies of the social systems of the Eupleridae will be of great value for the elucidation of general patterns in carnivore social evolution.",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,2014 Feb,England,2014,10
28359580,Racialized legal status as a social determinant of health.,"This article advances the concept of racialized legal status (RLS) as an overlooked dimension of social stratification with implications for racial/ethnic health disparities. We define RLS as a social position based on an ostensibly race-neutral legal classification that disproportionately impacts racial/ethnic minorities. To illustrate the implications of RLS for health and health disparities in the United States, we spotlight existing research on two cases: criminal status and immigration status. We offer a conceptual framework that outlines how RLS shapes disparities through (1) primary effects on those who hold a legal status and (2) spillover effects on racial/ethnic in-group members, regardless of these individuals' own legal status. Primary effects of RLS operate by marking an individual for material and symbolic exclusion. Spillover effects result from the vicarious experiences of those with social proximity to marked individuals, as well as the discredited meanings that RLS constructs around racial/ethnic group members. We conclude by suggesting multiple avenues for future research that considers RLS as a mechanism of social inequality with fundamental effects on health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2018 Feb,England,2018,10
20978017,Quality of life in adults with congenital heart disease: biopsychosocial determinants and sex-related differences.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of life (QoL) in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) and to explore the sex-related differences and biopsychosocial determinants in an Asian cohort. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional clinical study. SETTING: One tertiary medical centre in Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The QoL of ACHD (>/=20 years) was investigated using the Taiwanese version of the QoL questionnaire designed by the WHO, which assesses four domains of QoL (physical, psychological, social and environmental). Personality, psychological distress and family support were assessed using the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Brief Symptom Rating Scale, and the Family APGAR score, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients (age 33.2 +/- 10.6 years; 36% men) were studied. ACHD women had significantly lower QoL scores in the physical and psychological domains compared to the age-matched general population, whereas no differences were observed between ACHD men and the general population. Multivariate analysis showed that female gender was associated with poorer physical QoL; the sex difference in the psychological QoL was mediated by psychological distress. Interaction analysis showed that the effect of family support on the psychological domain of QoL may be different by sex. The determinants of QoL varied between different domains. Extroversion personality trait, psychological distress and family support were common determinants of most domains of QoL. CONCLUSIONS: In ACHD, female gender was associated with poor physical and psychological QoL. The common denominators for QoL were primarily personality trait, psychological distress and family support, but not disease severity.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2011 Jan,England,2011,10
25305476,How important are community characteristics in influencing childrens nutritional status? Evidence from Malawi population-based household and community surveys.,"Using the 2004 data from the Malawi Integrated Household Survey and the Malawi Community Survey, this study investigates the influence of community characteristics on stunting among children under five years of age in a rural context. Multilevel logistic regression modelling on 4284 children with stunting as the dependent variable shows that availability of daily markets and lineage defined in terms of patrilineal or matrilineal communities were significant community determinants of childhood stunting in Malawi. There were significant differences in socio-economic status between household heads from matrilineal and patrilineal communities. Implementation of strategies that empower communities and households economically such as supporting the establishment of community daily markets and promoting household income generating opportunities can effectively reduce the burden of childhood stunting in Malawi.",Health & place,2014 Nov,England,2014,10
23849228,Socio-cultural determinants of timely and delayed treatment of Buruli ulcer: Implications for disease control.,"INTRODUCTION: Public health programmes recommend timely medical treatment for Buruli ulcer (BU) infection to prevent pre-ulcer conditions from progressing to ulcers, to minimise surgery, disabilities and the socio-economic impact of BU. Clarifying the role of socio-cultural determinants of timely medical treatment may assist in guiding public health programmes to improve treatment outcomes. This study clarified the role of socio-cultural determinants and health system factors affecting timely medical treatment for BU in an endemic area in Ghana. METHODS: A semi-structured explanatory model interview based on the explanatory model interview catalogue (EMIC) was administered to 178 BU-affected persons. Based on research evidence, respondents were classified as timely treatment (use of medical treatment 3 months from awareness of disease) and delayed treatment (medical treatment 3 months after onset of disease and failure to use medical treatment). The outcome variable, timely treatment was analysed with cultural epidemiological variables for categories of distress, perceived causes of BU, outside-help and reasons for medical treatment in logistic regression models. The median time for the onset of symptoms to treatment was computed in days. Qualitative phenomenological analysis of respondents' narratives clarified the meaning, context and dynamic features of the relationship of explanatory variables with timely medical treatment. RESULTS: The median time for initiating treatment was 25 days for pre-ulcers, and 204 days for ulcers. Income loss and use of herbalists showed significantly negative associations with timely treatment. Respondents' use of herbalists was often motivated by the desire for quick recovery in order to continue with work and because herbalists were relatives and easily accessible. However, drinking unclean water was significantly associated with timely treatment and access to health services encouraged timely treatment (OR 8.5, p = 0.012). Findings show that health system factors of access are responsible for non-compliance to treatment regimes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the importance of an integrated approach to BU control and management considering the social and economic features that influence delayed treatment and factors that encourage timely medical treatment. This approach should consider periodic screening for early case-detection, collaboration with private practitioners and traditional healers, use of mobile services to improve access, adherence and treatment outcomes.",Infectious diseases of poverty,2012 Oct 25,England,2012,10
26081477,"Dietary fat, fat subtypes and hepatocellular carcinoma in a large European cohort.","The role of amount and type of dietary fat consumption in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood, despite suggestive biological plausibility. The associations of total fat, fat subtypes and fat sources with HCC incidence were investigated in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, which includes 191 incident HCC cases diagnosed between 1992 and 2010. Diet was assessed by country-specific, validated dietary questionnaires. A single 24-hr diet recall from a cohort subsample was used for measurement error calibration. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models. Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV/HCV) status and biomarkers of liver function were assessed separately in a nested case-control subset with available blood samples (HCC = 122). In multivariable calibrated models, there was a statistically significant inverse association between total fat intake and risk of HCC (per 10 g/day, HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.99), which was mainly driven by monounsaturated fats (per 5 g/day, HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.92) rather than polyunsaturated fats (per 5 g/day, HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.68-1.25). There was no association between saturated fats (HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.88-1.34) and HCC risk. The ratio of polyunsaturated/monounsaturated fats to saturated fats was not significantly associated with HCC risk (per 0.2 point, HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.73-1.01). Restriction of analyses to HBV/HCV free participants or adjustment for liver function did not substantially alter the findings. In this large prospective European cohort, higher consumption of monounsaturated fats is associated with lower HCC risk.",International journal of cancer,2015 Dec 1,United States,2015,10
20950880,Determinants of variability in waiting times for radiotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer.,"PURPOSE: To examine psycho-social and geographic determinants of delay in starting radiotherapy in early invasive breast cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Waiting time was defined as the time elapsed until the beginning of radiotherapy, starting from the date of surgery (in absence of chemotherapy) or from the end of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Eight hundred and ninety six women aged 24-89 took part in the study. Mean waiting times were 52 days (sd=19) between surgery and radiotherapy and 31 days (sd=14) between chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Differences between radiotherapy centres (p<0.0001) accounted for 30% and 12%, respectively, of total variance in waiting times. Using a multivariate mixed analysis that took into account intra-centre correlation, the time between surgery and radiotherapy was shorter for young patients (p=0.020), those who had sought information about their illness (p=0.024) and those who had undergone surgery and radiotherapy in the same centre (p=0.021). On the other hand, no patient characteristic was associated with the time between chemotherapy and radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Centre is the major factor that explained longer waiting times in radiotherapy, emphasising the structural hypothesis. It is important to pursue initiatives to improve the organization within radiotherapy centres and then to verify that these initiatives have succeeded in shortening waiting times.",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,2010 Dec,Ireland,2010,10
29485788,Psychosocial Determinants of Satisfaction with Hospital Care in Adult Patients Suffering from Advanced Cancer.,"In this observational study, direct and indirect (moderator and mediator) relationships between sociodemographic (age, gender, life partner, education level, income and length of treatment) and psychological (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS) variables and satisfaction with hospital care (EORTC INPATSAT32) in adult (advanced cancer) patients were investigated. Study sample consisted of 75 hospitalized advanced cancer patients recruited at the Zagreb University Hospital Centre and Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Centre in 2015. Statistically significant negative correlations were found between HADS and elementary school education level, as well as with all satisfaction variables (satisfaction with physicians, nurses and organization). Moderate to high and statistically significant positive correlations were found between elementary school level and all satisfaction variables. Gender and level of education appeared as significant moderator variables in the relationship between HADS and satisfaction with nurse care. There were no significant mediator effects of sociodemographic variables on the correlation between HADS and satisfaction with care. Male participants who were more disturbed emotionally were more satisfied with nurses. Participants with elementary and high school levels of education and lower scores on HADS were more satisfied with nurses, while participants with university level of education had higher HADS scores and lower level of satisfaction with nurses.",Acta clinica Croatica,2017 Jun,Croatia,2017,10
31992995,Associations of Suicide Rates With Socioeconomic Status and Social Isolation: Findings From Longitudinal Register and Census Data.,"Suicide represents a major challenge to public mental health. In order to provide empirical evidence for prevention strategies, we hypothesized current levels of low socioeconomic status (SES) and high social isolation (SI) to be linked to increased suicide rates in N = 390 administrative districts since SES and SI are associated with mental illness. Effects of SES on suicide rates were further expected to be especially pronounced in districts with individuals showing high SI levels as SI reduces the reception of social support and moderates the impact of low SES on poor mental health. We linked German Microcensus data to register data on all 149,033 German suicides between 1997 and 2010 and estimated Prentice and Sheppard's model for aggregate data to test the hypotheses, accounting for spatial effect correlations. The findings reveal increases in district suicide rates by 1.20% (p < 0.035) for 1% increases of district unemployment, suicide rate decreases of -0.39% (p < 0.028) for 1% increases in incomes, increases of 1.65% (p < 0.033) in suicides for 1% increases in one-person-households and increases in suicide rates of 0.54% (p < 0.036) for 1% decreases in single persons' incomes as well as suicide rate increases of 3.52% (p < 0.000) for 1% increases in CASMIN scores of individuals who moved throughout the year preceding suicide. The results represent appropriate starting points for the development of suicide prevention strategies. For the definition of more precise measures, future work should focus on the causal mechanisms resulting in suicidality incorporating individual level data.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2019,Switzerland,2019,10
26150065,Syndemics of psychosocial problems and HIV risk: A systematic review of empirical tests of the disease interaction concept.,"In the theory of syndemics, diseases co-occur in particular temporal or geographical contexts due to harmful social conditions (disease concentration) and interact at the level of populations and individuals, with mutually enhancing deleterious consequences for health (disease interaction). This theory has widespread adherents in the field, but the extent to which there is empirical support for the concept of disease interaction remains unclear. In January 2015 we systematically searched 7 bibliographic databases and tracked citations to highly cited publications associated with the theory of syndemics. Of the 783 records, we ultimately included 34 published journal articles, 5 dissertations, and 1 conference abstract. Most studies were based on a cross-sectional design (32 [80%]), were conducted in the U.S. (32 [80%]), and focused on men who have sex with men (21 [53%]). The most frequently studied psychosocial problems were related to mental health (33 [83%]), substance abuse (36 [90%]), and violence (27 [68%]); while the most frequently studied outcome variables were HIV transmission risk behaviors (29 [73%]) or HIV infection (9 [23%]). To test the disease interaction concept, 11 (28%) studies used some variation of a product term, with less than half of these (5/11 [45%]) providing sufficient information to interpret interaction both on an additive and on a multiplicative scale. The most frequently used specification (31 [78%]) to test the disease interaction concept was the sum score corresponding to the total count of psychosocial problems. Although the count variable approach does not test hypotheses about interactions between psychosocial problems, these studies were much more likely than others (14/31 [45%] vs. 0/9 [0%]; chi2 = 6.25, P = 0.01) to incorporate language about ""synergy"" or ""interaction"" that was inconsistent with the statistical models used. Therefore, more evidence is needed to assess the extent to which diseases interact, either at the level of populations or individuals, to amplify HIV risk.",Social science & medicine (1982),2015 Aug,England,2015,10
25960393,Looking Beyond Income and Education: Socioeconomic Status Gradients Among Future High-Cost Users of Health Care.,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare spending occurs disproportionately among a very small portion of the population. Research on these high-cost users (HCUs) of health care has been overwhelmingly cross-sectional in nature and limited to the few sociodemographic and clinical characteristics available in health administrative databases. This study is the first to bridge this knowledge gap by applying a population health lens to HCUs. We investigate associations between a broad range of SES characteristics and future HCUs. METHODS: A cohort of adults from two cycles of large, nationally representative health surveys conducted in 2003 and 2005 was linked to population-based health administrative databases from a universal healthcare plan for Ontario, Canada. Comprehensive person-centered estimates of annual healthcare spending were calculated for the subsequent 5 years following interview. Baseline HCUs (top 5%) were excluded and healthcare spending for non-HCUs was analyzed. Adjusted for predisposition and need factors, the odds of future HCU status (over 5 years) were estimated according to various individual, household, and neighborhood SES factors. Analyses were conducted in 2014. RESULTS: Low income (personal and household); less than post-secondary education; and living in high-dependency neighborhoods greatly increased the odds of future HCUs. After adjustment, future HCU status was most strongly associated with food insecurity, personal income, and non-homeownership. Living in highly deprived or low ethnic concentration neighborhoods also increased the odds of becoming an HCU. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that addressing social determinants of health, such as food and housing security, may be important components of interventions aiming to improve health outcomes and reduce costs.",American journal of preventive medicine,2015 Aug,Netherlands,2015,10
25409216,[Birth rate and fertility: knowledge and expectations analysis of 3585 university students].,"INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, Portuguese birth rate is insufficient to ensure renewal of generations. Women high education levels and labor market integration and increased economic difficulties are some of multiple factors leading to a delay in average parenting age and an increase of infertility; also subject to others such as obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Transversal epidemiological study, analytical, uncontrolled, from self-filled online questionnaires, promoted by students' university unions. A sample of 3585 university students was considered and a global and by gender statistic analysis was done through SPSS, Excel was used to build graphics and tables and ArcMap to represent maps. RESULTS: Mainly students from the Health Sciences (40.6%), Universidade de Lisboa (59.4%), female (76.9%), median age of 22; intention to marry/ union 71.0%, parenthood 85.7%. A total of 18.4% smoke, 22.3% consume alcohol and obesity 15.4%; employment (47.4%) and the partner's will (39.9%) were important determinants for parenthood decision as well as having financial stability to provide a good education (33.6%) and healthcare (38.6%); A total of 53.6% have considered the hypothesis of infertility and highlight above 35 year old maternal age (18.7%), obesity (18%) and female smoking (19.0) as factors. Higher and more significant values for smoking (p = 0.001) and alcohol consumption (p = 0.000) in males were found. DISCUSSION: The sample seems representative, well distributed among different areas of study, with more female respondents than the university portuguese ratio. There are more students with parenting projects than marriage/cohabitation, in accordance with Portuguese data. Nevertheless, the same students identify the family as a priority in comparison with employment and career. Parenting decisions are tied by social-economic situation but an important factor is the low fertility due to the maternal age delay of the first pregnancy. CONCLUSION: University student unions are an excellent instrument to access them; a high number of respondents consider having children but delay the decision; there is a lack of information about the consequences of delaying parenting age and about infertility factors. The negative trend of fertility must be seen as a necessity to develop specific policies.",Acta medica portuguesa,2014 Sep-Oct,Portugal,2014,10
26858944,Measuring the Mental Health-Care System Responsiveness: Results of an Outpatient Survey in Tehran.,"As explained by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000, the concept of health system responsiveness is one of the core goals of health systems. Since 2000, further efforts have been made to measure health system responsiveness and the factors affecting responsiveness, yet few studies have applied responsiveness concepts to the evaluation of mental health systems. The present study aims to measure responsiveness and its related domains in the mental health-care system of Tehran. Utilizing the same method used by the WHO for its responsiveness survey, responsiveness for outpatient mental health care was evaluated using a validated Farsi questionnaire. A sample of 500 public mental health service users in Tehran participated and subsequently completed the questionnaire. On average, 47% of participants reported experiencing poor responsiveness. Among responsiveness domains, confidentiality and dignity were the best performing factors while autonomy, access to care, and quality of basic amenities were the worst performing. Respondents who reported their social status as low were more likely to experience poor responsiveness overall. Attention and access to care were responsiveness dimensions that performed poorly but were considered to be highly important by study participants. In summary, the study suggests that measuring responsiveness could provide guidance for further development of mental health-care systems to become more patient orientated and provide patients with more respect.",Frontiers in public health,2015,Switzerland,2015,10
27213340,"Heart Disease in Women: Unappreciated Challenges, GPER as a New Target.","Heart disease in women remains underappreciated, underdiagnosed and undertreated. Further, although we are starting to understand some of the social and behavioral determinants for this, the biological basis for the increased rate of rise in atherosclerosis risk in women after menopause remains very poorly understand. In this review we will outline the scope of the clinical issues related to heart disease in women, the emerging findings regarding the biological basis underlying the increased prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors in postmenopausal women (vs. men) and the role of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and its genetic regulation as a determinant of these sex-specific risks. GPER is a recently appreciated GPCR that mediates the rapid effects of estrogen and aldosterone. Recent studies have identified that GPER activation regulates both blood pressure. We have shown that regulation of GPER function via expression of a hypofunctional GPER genetic variant is an important determinant of blood pressure and risk of hypertension in women. Further, our most recent studies have identified that GPER activation is an important regulator of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor metabolism and that expression of the hypofunctional GPER genetic variant is an important contributor to the development of hypercholesterolemia in women. GPER appears to be an important determinant of the two major risk factors for coronary artery disease-blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. Further, the importance of this mechanism appears to be greater in women. Thus, the appreciation of the role of GPER function as a determinant of the progression of atherosclerotic disease may be important both in our understanding of cardiometabolic function but also in opening the way to greater appreciation of the sex-specific regulation of atherosclerotic risk factors.",International journal of molecular sciences,2016 May 18,Switzerland,2016,10
24042269,Health-promoting behaviors and social support in Iranian women of reproductive age: a sequential explanatory mixed methods study.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine health-promoting behaviors and their determinants including social support and sociodemographic characteristics as well as to explore women's experience of health-promoting behaviors. METHODS: This sequential explanatory mixed methods study was conducted in two phases. The first phase was a cross-sectional study conducted on 1,359 women. Questionnaires, including items on sociodemographic characteristics, the HPLP-II and the PRQ85-Part2, were completed by interview. In the second phase, 15 women who were identified as extreme cases participated in individual in-depth interviews. RESULTS: The results of the quantitative phase showed that women obtained the highest scores on interpersonal relations and the lowest scores on physical activity. Scores on the HPLP-II and all its subscales correlated significantly with the level of social support. In the qualitative phase, factors affecting health-promoting behaviors were explored and grouped into four main categories that included personal and socio-environmental barriers as well as personal and socio-environmental facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study confirm the importance of social support and modifiable variables (sociodemographic) that play a role in the health-promoting behaviours of women. These results will be useful in designing suitable interventions and strategies for the promotion of women's health.",International journal of public health,2014 Jun,Switzerland,2014,10
27818436,"HIV Diagnosis, Linkage to Care, and Retention among Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Women in Guatemala City.","Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women are disproportionately affected by HIV in Guatemala, yet little is known about their experiences with diagnosis, linkage to care, and retention. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with 26 MSM and transgender women living with HIV in Guatemala City. HIV diagnosis experiences changed over time with increasing asymptomatic testing at non-governmental organizations. Fear of the physical and social impacts of HIV delayed testing, acceptance of diagnosis, and linkage to HIV care. These fears were driven by layered stigma and discrimination due to non-normative gender expressions and / or sexual orientation. Retention-specific determinants included HIV clinic dynamics and limited employment opportunities. There is an urgent need to improve support systems for early testing and linkage to care and to expand employment opportunities. Stigma and discrimination must be addressed at the family, clinic and contextual levels to reduce fear of diagnosis and improve access to care.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,2016,United States,2016,10
31163050,"Trends, patterns and determinants of long-acting reversible methods of contraception among women in sub-Saharan Africa.","BACKGROUND: Method-specific contraceptive prevalence varies widely globally, as huge variations exist in the use of different types of contraception, with short-term methods being the most common methods in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Evidence is scanty on the trends, patterns and determinants of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods in SSA. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap. METHODS: Using a pseudo longitudinal research design and descriptive and inferential statistics, we analysed Demographic and Health Survey data of eight countries selected on the basis of contraceptive prevalence rates across SSA. Multinomial logistic regression modelling was used to tease out the predictors of the uptake of LARC methods in the selected countries. RESULTS: Findings exhibit a steady but slow upward trend in LARC methods across selected countries, as a marginal increase was recorded in LARC uptake over a 10-year period in many of the selected countries. Results established significant predictors of LARC methods uptake, including fertility-related characteristics, age, level of education, work status, wealth index and exposure to mass media. This study underscored the need to address various barriers to the uptake of LARC methods in SSA. It is recommended that governments at different levels undertake to cover the costs of LARC methods in order to increase access and uptake.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
25839337,Positive symptoms are associated with clinicians' global impression in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.,"Previous investigations on the relationship between global rating measures and symptoms have not considered the additional role of functioning. In this naturalistic study, we examined the relationship between symptom domains and functioning on Clinical Global Impression scales for severity (CGI-S) and improvement (CGI-I) in a sample of patients with schizophrenia assessed to be treatment resistant. Participants were patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who failed 2 prior antipsychotic trials and were considered candidates for clozapine. They were assessed on the 18-item Brief Psychiatric rating Scale (BPRS), Social Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), and CGI-S at baseline. A subset of patients was followed up at 6 weeks after initiation of clozapine and assessed on the CGI-I. The independent effects of symptom domains and functioning on the CGI scales were examined via multivariate regression models. Brief Psychiatric rating Scale positive factor (P < 0.001) and SOFAS (P < 0.001) scores were significant determinants of CGI-S at baseline. Multivariate models suggested that relative change measures had a better fit for the CGI-I compared to absolute change measures (R = 0.72 vs R = 0.61, respectively). Improvements in BPRS positive (P < 0.001) and affect (P = 0.002) factors and SOFAS (P = 0.030) scores were significant determinants of CGI-I. Ratings of 1 and 2 on the CGI-I corresponded to a mean relative change in the BPRS total of 65% and 41%, respectively. Positive symptoms were a key determinant of clinicians' impression of severity and improvement in this study. Although psychosocial functioning played a large part in determining severity, it was not as significant in the assessment of improvement.",Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,2015 Jun,United States,2015,10
23640065,Enduring links from childhood mathematics and reading achievement to adult socioeconomic status.,"Understanding the determinants of socioeconomic status (SES) is an important economic and social goal. Several major influences on SES are known, yet much of the variance in SES remains unexplained. In a large, population-representative sample from the United Kingdom, we tested the effects of mathematics and reading achievement at age 7 on attained SES by age 42. Mathematics and reading ability both had substantial positive associations with adult SES, above and beyond the effects of SES at birth, and with other important factors, such as intelligence. Achievement in mathematics and reading was also significantly associated with intelligence scores, academic motivation, and duration of education. These findings suggest effects of improved early mathematics and reading on SES attainment across the life span.",Psychological science,2013 Jul 1,United States,2013,10
26955821,Social and Structural Determinants of Cervical Health among Women Engaged in HIV Care.,"Cervical cancer prevention/control efforts among women living with HIV/AIDS (WLH) are socially and structurally challenging. Healthcare access and perceived HIV stigma and discrimination are factors that may challenge risk reduction efforts. This study examined socio-structural determinants of cervical cancer screening among women engaged in HIV care. One hundred forty-five WLH seeking health/social services from AIDS Service Organizations in the southeastern US completed a questionnaire assessing factors related to cervical cancer prevention/control. Ninety percent were African American, mean age 46.15 +/- 10.65 years. Eighty-one percent had a Pap test <1 year ago. Low healthcare access was positively associated with having a Pap test <1 year ago, (Odds ratio [OR] 3.80; 95 % Confidence interval [CI] 1.34-10.78). About 36 % reported >/=2 Pap tests during the first year after HIV diagnosis. Lower educational attainment was positively associated with having >/=2 Pap tests, OR 3.22; CI 1.08-9.62. Thirty-five percent reported more frequent Pap tests after diagnosis. Lower income was moderately associated with more frequent Pap tests post-diagnosis, OR 2.47; CI .98-6.23. Findings highlight the successes of HIV initiatives targeting socio-economically disadvantaged women and provide evidence that health policy aimed at providing and expanding healthcare access for vulnerable WLH has beneficial health implications.",AIDS and behavior,2016 Sep,United States,2016,10

We find that discretion in enforcement differs in state and federally conducted inspections. State agencies are more sensitive to local economic conditions, finding fewer standard violations and fewer serious violations as unemployment increases. Larger companies receive greater lenience in multiple dimensions. Inspector issued fines and final fines, after negotiated reductions, are both smaller during Republican presidencies.

22044489,Concordance of sibling's recall of measures of childhood socioeconomic position.,"BACKGROUND: Studies of socioeconomic determinants of health often rely on recalled information on childhood socioeconomic position, despite limited evidence of the validity of this information. This study examined concordance between siblings of recalled measures of childhood socioeconomic position. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined reports by 1280 adult sibling pairs in the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States of seven measures of childhood socioeconomic position: father's occupation (in 9 categories), father having a professional occupation, father being a supervisor at work, father's education level, mother's education level, receipt of welfare payments, and subjective appraisal of being better or worse off financially than others. RESULTS: Concordance was high for father's professional occupation (0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96, 0.98), father's occupation in 9 categories (0.76; 95% CI 0.73, 0.80), and receipt of welfare payments (0.95; 95% CI 0.93, 0.97). Concordance was lower for father's and mother's education level, and lowest for subjective appraisal of socioeconomic position (0.60; 95% CI 0.57, 0.64). Concordance of parental education was lower for sibling pairs with high school educations or less. CONCLUSION: Concordance of recalled measures of childhood socioeconomic position by siblings is generally but not uniformly high.",BMC medical research methodology,2011 Nov 1,England,2011,10
20623165,A typology of sick-listed claimants to improve communication skills for social insurance physicians during medical disability assessment interviews.,"INTRODUCTION: Role play with standardised simulated patients is often included in communication training. However, regarding physician-patient encounters in medical disability assessment interviews it is unclear what should be included in the scenarios for actors. The first objective of this study was to determine which types of medical disability claimants can be distinguished based on behavioural determinants. The second objective was to determine if these types of claimants differed in their perception of communication behaviour and their satisfaction with the communication with physicians. METHODS: Questionnaire data were collected from 56 Dutch claimants for 13 behavioural determinants before their assessment interview, and for 12 behavioural and satisfaction variables afterwards. For the first objective cluster analyses were performed and for the second objective linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The results showed that three types of claimants could be distinguished: insecure support-seeking claimants, confident claimants, and socially isolated claimants. Overall, claimants were positive about the communication with the physician: insecure support-seeking claimants were satisfied and confident claimants were highly satisfied, but socially isolated claimants were unsatisfied. CONCLUSION: Scenarios for standardised simulated patients should include different types of claimants. In training, special attention should be given to communication with socially isolated claimants.",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,2011 Mar,Netherlands,2011,10

AIM: The aim of this paper was the assessment of importance of psychological determinants of quality of life in women with depressive disorders. METHODS: The tests were carried out on the basis of the analysis of medical documentation, including the psychiatric records. The following criteria were measured: depression level (Beck Hopelessness Scale), quality of life (The Life Satisfaction Questionnaire FLZ according to Fahrenberg), personality model (NEO Five-Factor Inventory), optimism (The Life Orientation Test-Revised LOT-R by M. Scheier, ChS. Carver and M. Bridges adapted by R. Poprawa and Z. Juczynski), purpose in life (The Purpose-in-Life Test developed by Crumbaugh and Maholick according to the authorised translation by Z. Pluzek), social support (The Social Support Questionnaire by Sommer G, Fydrich T, 1989 adapted by Z. Juczynski), health satisfaction (General Health Questionnaire GHQ 28 by David Goldberg). Women diagnosed with depressive disorders were qualified for testing. The tested group of women included 80 patients in the age bracket of 40 to 60 years from the Outpatient Department of Mental Health, Regional Specialised Hospital in Zgierz. The reference group consisted of 30 women showing no symptoms of depressive disorders. RESULTS: The statistical analysis of variables taken into account in the tests showed essential statistical differences between the compared groups with regard to almost all parameters. Significant differences were found in respect of life satisfaction, personality variables, social support, health satisfaction and purpose in life. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results showed significant differences regarding the assessment of quality of life between the group of women with depressive disorders and the group of women without any symptoms of such disorders in respect of the tested psychological determinants. The only exception was the ""parent-child relationship satisfaction"" where no differences were found.",Psychiatria polska,2010 Jul-Aug,Poland,2010,10
26610117,Keeping up with the caravan of life: Successful aging strategies for Iranian women.,"BACKGROUND: Because of improving life expectancy in the world in recent times, the focus has shifted to the issue of the quality and nature of life and how to assist successful aging (SA) rather than increasing physical survival and lifespan. SA is a multidimensional, relative, and context-dependent concept with different paths and outcomes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore older women's strategies for SA in a specific context. METHODS: Following a grounded theory design approach, we conducted semi-structured individual interviews with 21 women between the ages of 28 and 96 years. We analyzed the data from interviews, written narratives, and field notes using the grounded theory approach. RESULTS: We identified four categories: prevention of threats, internal self-control against threats, coping with threats, and optimizing the passage of time according to opportunity. These described the strategies for SA when encountering with age-related changes. Utilizing these strategies, the women accompanied the caravan of life in the context of threats and opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that SA is a continuous process in confronting changes related to age. The identified strategies can help to promote SA by familiarizing older women with the threats and opportunities of life and training them in how to use these strategies.",International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,2015,United States,2015,10
23656514,"The connection between serious life events, anti-retroviral adherence, and mental health among HIV-positive individuals in the Western Cape, South Africa.","South Africa currently has one of the world's largest rates of HIV infection. A majority of the existing research focuses on individual risk behaviors that lead to increased risk of HIV contraction while also acknowledging the importance of the social and contextual determinants of HIV transmission and disease progression. Therefore, the present study aims to understand the ways in which experience of serious life events increases risk of both adherence lapse and mental illness in HIV-positive populations. Strikingly, our findings suggest that HIV-positive individuals are approximately 24 times as likely to have an anti-retroviral adherence lapse and are nearly four times likely to report mental health issues if they have experienced a recent serious life event. Implications of our results include the incorporation of socially relevant assessment tools and the development of interventions that address social and contextual issues for effecting adherence behaviors.",AIDS care,2013,England,2013,10
29935128,Developing a Framework for a Program Theory-Based Approach to Evaluating Policy Processes and Outcomes: Health in All Policies in South Australia.,"BACKGROUND: The importance of evaluating policy processes to achieve health equity is well recognised but such evaluation encounters methodological, theoretical and political challenges. This paper describes how a program theorybased evaluation framework can be developed and tested, using the example of an evaluation of the South Australian Health in All Policies (HiAP) initiative. METHODS: A framework of the theorised components and relationships of the HiAP initiative was produced to guide evaluation. The framework was the product of a collaborative, iterative process underpinned by a policy-research partnership and drew on social and political science theory and relevant policy literature. RESULTS: The process engaged key stakeholders to capture both HiAP specific and broader bureaucratic knowledge and was informed by a number of social and political science theories. The framework provides a basis for exploring the interactions between framework components and how they shape policy-making and public policy. It also enables an assessment of HiAP's success in integrating health and equity considerations in policies, thereby laying a foundation for predicting the impacts of resulting policies. CONCLUSION: The use of a program theory-based evaluation framework developed through a consultative process and informed by social and political science theory has accommodated the complexity of public policy-making. The framework allows for examination of HiAP processes and impacts, and for the tracking of contribution towards distal outcomes through the explicit articulation of the underpinning program theory.",International journal of health policy and management,2018 Jun 1,Iran,2018,10
31023749,Identifying the lifetime cognitive and socioeconomic antecedents of cognitive state: seven decades of follow-up in a British birth cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES: The life course determinants of midlife and later life cognitive function have been studied using longitudinal population-based cohort data, but far less is known about whether the pattern of these pathways is similar or distinct for clinically relevant cognitive state. We investigated this for Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination third edition (ACE-III), used in clinical settings to screen for cognitive impairment and dementia. DESIGN: Longitudinal birth cohort study. SETTING: Residential addresses in England, Wales and Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 1762 community-dwelling men and women of European heritage, enrolled since birth in the Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (the British 1946 birth cohort). PRIMARY OUTCOME: ACE-III. RESULTS: Path modelling estimated direct and indirect associations between apolipoprotein E (APOE) status, father's social class, childhood cognition, education, midlife occupational complexity, midlife verbal ability (National Adult Reading Test; NART), and the total ACE-III score. Controlling for sex, there was a direct negative association between APOE epsilon4 and the ACE-III score (beta=-0.04 [-0.08 to -0.002], p=0.04), but not between APOE epsilon4 and childhood cognition (beta=0.03 [-0.006 to 0.069], p=0.10) or the NART (beta=0.0005 [-0.03 to 0.03], p=0.97). The strongest influences on the ACE-III were from childhood cognition (beta=0.20 [0.14 to 0.26], p<0.001) and the NART (beta=0.35 [0.29 to 0.41], p<0.001); educational attainment and occupational complexity were modestly and independently associated with the ACE-III (beta=0.08 [0.03 to 0.14], p=0.002 and beta=0.05 [0.01 to 0.10], p=0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The ACE-III in the general population shows a pattern of life course antecedents that is similar to neuropsychological measures of cognitive function, and may be used to represent normal cognitive ageing as well as a screen for cognitive impairment and dementia.",BMJ open,2019 Apr 24,England,2019,10

24885941,Multi-country willingness to pay study on road-traffic environmental health effects: are people willing and able to provide a number?,"BACKGROUND: The health impacts from traffic-related pollutants bring costs to society, which are often not reflected in market prices for transportation. We set out to simultaneously assess the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for traffic-related air pollution and noise effect on health, using a single measurement instrument and approach. We investigated the proportion and determinants of ""protest vote/PV responses (people who were against valuing their health in terms of money)"" and ""don't know""/DK answers, and explored the effect of DK on the WTP distributions. METHODS: Within the framework of the EU-funded project INTARESE, we asked over 5,200 respondents in five European countries to state their WTP to avoid health effects from road traffic-related air pollution and noise in an open-ended web-based questionnaire. Determinants of PV and DK were studied by logistic regression using variables concerning socio-demographics, income, health and environmental concern, and risk perception. RESULTS: About 10% of the respondents indicated a PV response and between 47-56% of respondents gave DK responses. About one-third of PV respondents thought that costs should be included in transportation prices, i.e. the polluter should pay. Logistic regression analyses showed associations of PV and DK with several factors. In addition to social-demographic, economic and health factors known to affect WTP, environmental concern, awareness of health effects, respondent's ability to relax in polluted places, and their view on the government's role to reduce pollution and on policy to improve wellbeing, also affected the PV and DK response. An exploratory weighting and imputation exercise did not show substantial effects of DK on the WTP distribution. CONCLUSIONS: With a proportion of about 50%, DK answers may be a more relevant issue affecting WTP than PV's. The likelihood to give PV and DK response were influenced by socio-demographic, economic and health factors, as well as environmental concerns and appreciation of environmental conditions and policies. In contested policy issues where actual policy may be based on WTP studies, PV and DK answers may indeed affect the outcome of the WTP study. PV and DK answers and their determinants therefore deserve further study in CV studies on environmental health effects.",Environmental health : a global access science source,2014 May 9,England,2014,10
29239783,Early adulthood determinants of mid-life leisure-time physical inactivity stability and change: Findings from a prospective birth cohort.,"OBJECTIVES: Physical inactivity is highly prevalent. Knowledge is needed of influences on inactive lifestyles. We aimed to establish whether early adult factors predict subsequent inactivity patterns in mid-adulthood. DESIGN: Leisure-time inactivity (activity frequency<1/week) was assessed at 33y and 50y in the 1958 British Birth cohort (N=12,271). METHODS: We assessed associations of early adult (23-33y) physical status, mental function, social, family and neighbourhood circumstances with four 33-50y patterns (never inactive, persistently inactive, deteriorating or improving) using multinomial logistic regression with and without adjustment for childhood factors (e.g. social class). RESULTS: Inactivity prevalence was similar at 33y and 50y ( approximately 31%), but 17% deteriorated and 18% improved with age. Factors associated with persistent vs never inactive were: limiting illness (relative risk ratio (RRR):1.21(1.04,1.42) per number of ages exposed (0,1 or 2 times across ages 23y and 33y), obesity (1.33(1.16,1.54) per number of ages exposed), height (0.93(0.89,0.98) per 5cm), depression (1.32(1.19,1.47) per number of ages exposed); education (1.28(1.20,1.38) per decrease on 5-point scale) and neighbourhood (1.59(1.37,1.86) in 'industrial/local authority housing areas' and 1.33(1.12,1.58) in 'growth/metropolitan inner areas' vs 'suburbs, service, rural or seaside areas'). Associations were broadly similar for inactivity deterioration. Industrial/local authority housing areas (0.75(0.61,0.91)) and longer obesity exposure (0.78(0.64,0.95)) were associated with lower RRRs for improvement. Number of children was associated with improvement, although associations varied by age. Associations remained after adjustment for childhood factors. CONCLUSIONS: Several early adult factors are associated with inactivity persistence and deterioration; fewer with improvement. Obesity duration and neighbourhood lived in during young adulthood had long-lasting associations with inactivity patterns in mid-life.",Journal of science and medicine in sport,2018 Jul,Australia,2018,10
26996944,Determinants of sport-specific postural control strategy and balance performance of amateur rugby players.,"OBJECTIVES: Postural control strategy and balance performance of rugby players are important yet under-examined issues. This study aimed to examine the differences in balance strategy and balance performance between amateur rugby players and non-players, and to explore training- and injury-related factors that may affect rugby players' balance outcomes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and exploratory study. METHODS: Forty-five amateur rugby players and 41 healthy active individuals participated in the study. Balance performance and balance strategies were assessed using the sensory organization test (SOT) of the Smart Equitest computerized dynamic posturography machine. Rugby training history and injury history were solicited from the participants. RESULTS: The SOT strategy scores were 1.99-54.90% lower in the rugby group than in the control group (p<0.05), and the equilibrium scores were 1.06-14.29% lower in the rugby group than in the control group (p<0.05). After accounting for age, sex and body mass index, only length of rugby training (in years) was independently associated with the SOT condition 6 strategy score, explaining 15.7% of its variance (p=0.006). There was no association between SOT condition 6 strategy/equilibrium scores and injury history among the rugby players (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Amateur rugby players demonstrated inferior balance strategy and balance performance compared to their non-training counterparts. Their suboptimal balance strategy was associated with insufficient training experience but not with history of injury.",Journal of science and medicine in sport,2016 Nov,Australia,2016,10
31829158,Prevalence of unwanted pregnancy among Iranian women: an updated meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Unwanted pregnancy is a global issue with adverse outcomes for the mother, child, family, and society. Previous studies in Iran have reported different prevalence rates for unwanted pregnancy. This meta-analysis was aimed at estimating the overall prevalence of unwanted pregnancy among Iranian women. METHODS: A total of 20 articles in English or Persian, published between 2012 and December 2018, were collected. The search was conducted in national and international databases, including Scientific Information Database (SID), MagIran, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, using the following keywords: 'Unplanned pregnancy', 'Unintended pregnancy', 'Unwanted pregnancy', and 'Mistimed pregnancy'. The data were analyzed using the meta-analysis method and the random effects model. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I(2) statistic. All analyses were performed using Stata, version 12. RESULTS: Analysis of 20 studies with a total sample size of 16,298 showed that the prevalence of unwanted pregnancy among Iranian women was 26% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 23-28). This prevalence was higher in the regions 5 and 2 of Iran (27%) than the other regions, and had no significant decrease between 2012 and 2018 (p = 0. 937). CONCLUSION: More than one-fourth of pregnancies among Iranian women are unwanted. Providing training programs for couples who do not plan to have children along with the support policies aimed at stimulating population growth, can be an important step in overcoming the issue of unwanted pregnancy and reducing the illegal abortions related to it.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2019 Dec 11,England,2019,10
26036702,Body mass index relates weight to height differently in women and older adults: serial cross-sectional surveys in England (1992-2011).,"BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) tends to be higher among shorter adults, especially women. The dependence of BMI-height correlation on age and calendar time may inform us about temporal determinants of BMI. METHODS: Series of cross-sectional surveys: Health Survey for England, 1992-2011. We study the Benn Index, which is the coefficient in a regression of log(weight) on log(height). This is adjusted for age, gender and calendar time, allowing for non-linear terms and interactions. RESULTS: By height quartile, mean BMI decreased with increasing height, more so in women than in men (P < 0.001). The decrease in mean BMI in the tallest compared with the shortest height quartile was 0.77 in men (95% CI 0.69, 0.86) and 1.98 in women (95% CI 1.89, 2.08). Regression analysis of log(weight) on log(height) revealed that the inverse association between BMI and height was more pronounced in older adults and stronger in women than in men, with little change over calendar time. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike early childhood, where taller children tend to have higher BMI, adults, especially women and older people, show an inverse BMI-height association. BMI is a heterogeneous measure of weight-for-height; height may be an important and complex determinant of BMI trajectory over the life course.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2016 Sep,England,2016,10
28324815,"Gender and race/ethnic differences in the persistence of alcohol, drug, and poly-substance use disorders.","AIMS: To examine gender and racial/ethnic differences in the effect of substance use disorder (SUD) type on SUD persistence. METHODS: Data were provided by 1025 women and 1835 men from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to examine whether gender and race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic) moderate the effects of DSM-IV defined past-12 month SUD type (alcohol, drug, poly-substance) on SUD persistence at 3-year follow-up, controlling for covariates. Using gender-stratified weighted binary logistic regression, we examined predictors of SUD persistence, tested an SUD type by race/ethnicity interaction term, and calculated and conducted Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons of predicted probabilities. RESULTS: SUD persistence rates at 3-year follow-up differed for SUD type by gender by race/ethnicity sub-group, and ranged from 31% to 81%. SUD persistence rates were consistently higher among poly-substance users; patterns were mixed in relation to gender and race/ethnicity. Among women, alcohol disordered Hispanics were less likely to persist than Whites. Among men, drug disordered Hispanics were less likely to persist than Whites. Also, Black men with an alcohol or drug use disorder were less likely to persist than Whites, but Black men with a poly-substance use disorder were more likely to persist than Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of SUD type on SUD persistence varies by race/ethnicity, and the nature of these relationships is different by gender. Such knowledge could inform tailoring of SUD screening and treatment programs, potentially increasing their impact.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2017 May 1,Ireland,2017,10
23919641,Narrative environments and the capacity of disability narratives to motivate leisure-time physical activity among individuals with spinal cord injury.,"PURPOSE: Few individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) engage in the recommended amount of leisure time physical activity (LTPA). Yet little is known about how, and why, active individuals engage in specific types of LTPA. This study explored how a unique narrative environment and disability narratives motivated individuals with SCI to engage in LTPA. METHOD: Fourteen individuals with SCI from a physical activity program participated in approximately hour-long interviews. Interviews were then subjected to a narrative analysis. RESULTS: Individuals who used a restitution narrative (n = 6) were motivated to engage in functional LTPA because of the desire to maintain the body and restore the past self. The individual who used the chaos narrative (n = 1) preferred solitary LTPA as exposure to others with SCI was a constant reminder of the lost, pre-injury self. Individuals who used a quest narrative (n = 7) explored LTPA options that fit with their interests; these individuals were open to new types of LTPA, such as sport and outdoor recreation. CONCLUSION: The plot of three disability narratives can all motivate the pursuit of LTPA; however, not all types of LTPA are seen as equal. LTPA interventions can be enhanced through the lessons learned from this unique type of environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Despite individuals' views about their disability, they can still be motivated to engage in routine LTPA. Different theoretical determinants, such as health or social benefits, hold different relevance for LTPA among individuals with differing disability narratives. The environment provided by practitioners can therefore elicit some stories of SCI while stifling others. Open narrative environment will attract individuals to listen and maintain involvement in LTPA.",Disability and rehabilitation,2013,England,2013,10
28824233,Inhibition of MicroRNA miR-222 with LNA Inhibitor Can Reduce Cell Proliferation in B Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory molecules that negatively regulate gene expression by base-pairing with their target mRNAs. miRNAs have contribute significantly to cancer biology and recent studies have demonstrated the oncogenic or tumor-suppressing role in cancer cells. In many tumors up-regulation miRNAs has been reported especially miR-222 has been shown to be up-regulated in B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In this study we assessed the effected inhibition of miR-222 in cell viability of B-CLL. We performed inhibition of mir-222 in B-CLL cell line (183-E95) using locked nucleic acid (LNA) antagomir. At different time points after LNA-anti-mir-222 transfection, miR-222 quantitation and cell viability were assessed by qRT-real time polymerase chain reaction and MTT assays. The data were analyzed by independent t test and one way ANOVA. Down-regulation of miR-222 in B-CLL cell line (183-E95) with LNA antagomir decreased cell viability in B-CLL. Cell viability gradually decreased over time as the viability of LNA-anti-mir transfected cells was <47 % of untreated cells at 72 h post-transfection. The difference in cell viability between LNA-anti-miR and control groups was statistically significant (p < 0.042). Based on our findings, the inhibition of miR-222 speculate represent a potential novel therapeutic approach for treatment of B-CLL.",Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,2017 Sep,India,2017,10
23102594,"An Emergency Department-initiated, web-based, multidisciplinary approach to decreasing emergency department visits by the top frequent visitors using patient care plans.","BACKGROUND: Many patients present to the Emergency Department (ED) for multiple visits. Whatever the cause, assuring the highest quality of care is difficult in the ED. OBJECTIVES: We sought to implement a web-based, ED-initiated, multidisciplinary program to improve patient care and reduce frequent visits to the ED. METHODS: The top 50 ED frequent visitors were identified and care plans were constructed. Care plans consist primarily of a summary of the patient's pertinent history and any psychosocial issues that can contribute to frequent use of the ED, and recommend treatment plans for these patients. RESULTS: During the study period, ED visits by the top 50 chronic frequent visitors ranged from 88 to 98 visits/month and 28 to 31 admissions/month. As of January 2007, the top 50 frequent visitors had 94 ED visits/month (1,129 visits/year) for 2.2% of the total census, and 31 admissions/month (372 admissions per year) for approximately 3.3% of the total admissions. Each frequent visitor has approximately 22.6 visits/year (range from 11 to 41) and 7.3 admissions/year (range from 0 to 20). By May 2008, the top 50 frequent visitors had a decrease to 88 visits/month (1,059 visits/year) and 28 admissions/month (340 admissions/year), with each frequent visitor having 21.2 visits/year and 6.8 admissions/year. Social determinants included psychiatric disease (36%), substance abuse (22%), malingering (20%), medication noncompliance (16%), and unstable housing (10%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend toward a decrease of monthly ED visits by the top 50 ED frequent visitors, but no effect on the rate of admissions. Based on these preliminary data and the relative ease of integration into the system, this project shows the potential to begin to address the problem of chronic ED use with patient care plans.",The Journal of emergency medicine,2013 Apr,United States,2013,10
30452279,Use of Nutritional Supplements in Youth with Medicated and Unmedicated Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: To find out whether use of nutritional supplements (NUS) differs between children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; medicated or unmedicated), compared with those without the disorder. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the population-based I.Family study conducted between 2013 and 2014 in eight European countries. Parents completed questionnaires and participated in interviews, for example, on health and medical history of their child. Data from 5067 children and adolescents aged 5-17 years were included. Exposures were medicated (with ADHD-approved medication) and unmedicated ADHD. The outcome was the use of NUS, measured by use of any or multiple different NUS. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographics and health determinants was used to find ADHD-depending differences. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 4490 children and adolescents without ADHD and 51 medicated and 76 unmedicated subjects with ADHD. Regarding the use of any NUS, no statistically significant differences were found between children and adolescents without ADHD (18%) and those with medicated (18%) or unmedicated ADHD (22%). However, discrepancies appear when considering multiple use of NUS, not reported for any medicated ADHD subject but remarkably often for unmedicated ADHD subjects (13%), resulting in an adjusted odds ratio of 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.6) when compared with those without ADHD (5%). CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents who were not using medication for treating ADHD potentially took NUS as oral remedies. Given the potential for a delay of indicated treatments and for use of those NUS which have no proven effectiveness, pediatricians should actively explore whether NUS have been used to treat ADHD core symptoms, and families should be informed that the average effect size has to be considered small.",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,2019 Feb,United States,2019,10
26215831,Improving Social Determinants of Health: Effectiveness of a Web-Based Intervention.,"INTRODUCTION: Although patients who experience health-related social problems such as food insecurity are at increased risk for negative health outcomes, there are few systems for screening and intervention. The study aimed to determine whether a web-based intervention can (1) connect youth to services to address these problems and (2) increase their resolution. DESIGN: Prospective intervention study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 401 youth, aged 15-25 years, from an urban adolescent/young adult clinic were recruited. INTERVENTION: A self-administered, web-based tool was developed to screen participants for problems in nine health-related social domains, identify and provide feedback about potential problems, and facilitate a patient-centered selection process of recommended local health and human service agencies to assist in addressing selected problems (conducted in 2008-2010). Follow-up phone calls 1-2 months later determined if patients had contacted recommended agencies and resolved their top-priority problem. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included prevalence of identified problems, selected problems, and priority problem selected by domain. We also examined frequencies of referral agencies contacted and resolution of priority problem at time of follow-up analysis conducted in 2011-2013. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent (313/401) of youth selected at least one problem to address. The most frequent domains selected as priority were income security (21%); nutrition/fitness (15%); and healthcare access (15%). Eighty-three percent (259/313) were reached at follow-up; overall, 40% contacted a selected agency and 47% reported ""completely"" or ""mostly"" resolving their priority problem. CONCLUSIONS: When provided with services to address health-related social problems, the majority of youth choose to receive help, with nearly half successfully addressing their priority concern. Further research to understand the barriers to contacting and utilizing services is needed. A technology-based patient-centered feedback and referral system for social determinants of health can facilitate screening and connect patients with resources to address these problems.",American journal of preventive medicine,2015 Dec,Netherlands,2015,10
31450908,Stage of Breast Cancer Screening Adoption; The Role of Cognitive Predictors.,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. The present study investigated the stage of breast cancer screening adoption and the role of some of the cognitive predictors in a sample of Iranian married women. There were a total of 334 married women clients of eight health centers in Kermanshah city, the west of Iran, were randomly selected to participate voluntarily. Women filled out a self-report questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 20 using One-way ANOVA, chi2-test, Fisher's exact test, and bivariate correlations statistical tests at 95% significant level. The mean age was 39.75 years [SD: 7.73]. Nearly 58.4%, 26.9%, 3%, 9.6%, and 2.1% of the respondents were reported pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance of breast cancer screening adoption, respectively. There was a significant association between age (P=0.005), and positive family history of breast cancer (P=0.037), perceived susceptibility (P=0.005), perceived severity (P=0.001) and knowledge of symptoms (P=0.018) with breast cancer stage of screening adoption. Our findings can provide better knowledge for the development and implementing of stage-targeted breast cancer screening adoption promotion programs. We conclude that it seems that the focus of health planner should be to rise to perceived severity; perceived susceptibility and knowledge of symptoms of breast cancer about the promotion of breast cancer screening adoption an Iranian woman.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 Aug 1,Thailand,2019,10
29299979,Communities being well for family well-being: Exploring the socio-ecological determinants of well-being in an Inuit community of Northern Quebec.,"Inuit communities of Canada experience many disparities in health and psychosocial context. Research in community psychology has shown associations between such socio-ecological factors and individual well-being. The objective of the study was to explore how community-level determinants of well-being influence family well-being in a northern community of Nunavik, Quebec. A total of 14 participants were interviewed. A thematic inductive analysis was conducted to extract community determinants of family well-being from the data. A system science approach was used to explore the associations between determinants and larger psychosocial dynamics. A community workshop was held to discuss the results and their meaning. A total of 25 determinants were coded, 16 of which were community-level. Community-level stressors were highly interrelated, whereas community supports were generally disconnected and superimposed on narratives of stressors. Participants spoke of desired supports. In their narratives, these supports were connected to a variety of determinants of well-being, suggesting the need to connect, redefine and support existing resources rather than simply add on new ones. We discuss intricate links between family and community well-being in small and geographically isolated communities.",Transcultural psychiatry,2018 Feb,England,2018,10
26179340,Determinants of malnutrition among urban slum children in Bangladesh.,"BACKGROUND: This paper analyzes the role of child, maternal and household variables on weight-for-age nutritional status of children in the largest urban slum of Bangladesh. METHODS: We use anthropometric weight-for-age nutrition status of children for an ordered logistic analysis. Our dataset gives us the advantage of segregating health knowledge into three indices: health-seeking practices index, child health precautions index and medical cost knowledge index, which are used as covariates to understand the role of health knowledge towards child health. Gender specific regressions are also run to understand male and female children nutritional function differences. RESULTS: Per capita income significantly improves child health but household assets do not, casting doubt on the robustness of permanent income. After controlling for health knowledge and health-seeking behavior, the remaining impact of maternal education on child health is no longer significant. Health knowledge indices significantly improve child health albeit differentially. While male children are more sensitive to ""child health precautions"" and ""medical cost knowledge"", female children are more sensitive to ""health-seeking practices"". CONCLUSION: Role of health knowledge on child health carries a significant portion of the education effect. Policy makers looking to improve the nutritional status of female children vis-a-vis male children in study area, should promote programs focusing on health-seeking practices.",Health economics review,2015 Dec,Germany,2015,10
30871510,Social determinants of health priorities of state Medicaid programs.,"BACKGROUND: Growing understanding of the influence of social determinants of health (SDH) on healthcare costs and outcomes for low income populations is leading State Medicaid agencies to consider incorporating SDH into their program design. This paper explores states' current approaches to SDH. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach combined a web-based survey sent through the Medicaid Medical Director Network (MMDN) listserv and semi-structured interviews conducted at the MMDN Annual Meeting in November 2017. RESULTS: Seventeen MMDs responded to the survey and 14 participated in an interview. More than half reported current collection of SDH data and all had intentions for future collection. Most commonly reported SDH screening topics were housing instability and food insecurity. In-depth interviews underscored barriers to optimal SDH approaches. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that Medicaid leaders recognize the importance of SDH in improving health, health equity, and healthcare costs for the Medicaid population but challenges for sustainable implementation remain.",BMC health services research,2019 Mar 14,England,2019,10
30148061,Quantifying the visual-sensory landscape qualities that contribute to cultural ecosystem services using social media and LiDAR.,"Landscapes are increasingly recognized for providing valuable cultural ecosystem services with numerous non-material benefits by serving as places of rest, relaxation, and inspiration that ultimately improve overall mental health and physical well-being. Maintaining and enhancing these valuable benefits through targeted management and conservation measures requires understanding the spatial and temporal determinants of perceived landscape values. Content contributed through mobile technologies and the web are emerging globally, providing a promising data source for localizing and assessing these landscape benefits. These georeferenced data offer rich in situ qualitative information through photos and comments that capture valued and special locations across large geographic areas. We present a novel method for mapping and modeling landscape values and perceptions that leverages viewshed analysis of georeferenced social media data. Using a high resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) derived digital surface model, we are able to evaluate landscape characteristics associated with the visual-sensory qualities of outdoor recreationalists. Our results show the importance of historical monuments and attractions in addition to specific environmental features which are appreciated by the public. Evaluation of photo-image content highlights the opportunity of including temporally and spatially variable visual-sensory qualities in cultural ecosystem services (CES) evaluation like the sights, sounds and smells of wildlife and weather phenomena.",Ecosystem services,2018,Netherlands,2018,10
23965183,Immigrant women's experiences of postpartum depression in Canada: a protocol for systematic review using a narrative synthesis.,"BACKGROUND: Literature documents that immigrant women in Canada have a higher prevalence of postpartum depression symptomatology than Canadian-born women. There exists a need to synthesize information on the contextual factors and social determinants of health that influence immigrant women's reception of and behavior in accessing existing mental health services. Our research question is: what are the ethnoculturally defined patterns of help-seeking behaviors and decision-making and other predictive factors for therapeutic mental health care access and outcomes with respect to postpartum depression for immigrant women in Canada? METHODS/DESIGN: Our synthesis incorporates a systematic review using narrative synthesis of reports (peer- and non-peer reviewed) of empirical research and aims to provide stakeholders with perspectives on postpartum mental health care services as experienced by immigrant women. To reach this goal we are using integrated knowledge translation, thus partnering with key stakeholders throughout the planning, implementation and dissemination stages to ensure topic relevancy and impact on future practice and policy. The search and selection strategies draw upon established systematic review methodologies as outlined by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and also incorporate guidelines for selection and appraisal of gray literature. Two search phases (a database and a gray literature phase) will identify literature for screening and final selection based on an inclusion/exclusion checklist. Quality appraisal will be performed using the tools produced by the Centre for Evidence Based Management. The narrative synthesis will be informed by Popay et al. (2006) framework using identified tools for each of its four elements. The integrated knowledge translation plan will ensure key messages are delivered in an audience-specific manner to optimize their impact on policy and practice change throughout health service, public health, immigration and community sectors. DISCUSSION: The narrative synthesis methodology will facilitate understandings and acknowledgement of the broader influences of theoretical and contextual variables, such as race, gender, socio-economic status, pre-migration history and geographical location. Our review aims to have a substantive and sustainable impact on health outcomes, practice, programs and/or policy in the context of postpartum mental health of immigrant women.

21113773,Physical activity motivation and cancer survivorship.,"Physical activity (PA) participation has been shown to be helpful in improving physical and mental well-being among cancer survivors. The purpose of this chapter is to review the literature on the determinants of physical activity motivation and behavior among cancer survivors. Using theories of behavior change, researchers have sought to identify the correlates of motivation that predict the participation in regular physical activity in observational studies, while intervention studies have focused on manipulating those factors to support the initiation of physical activity. The majority of this work has been conducted with breast cancer survivors, and there is an interest in expanding this work to survivors of others cancers (e.g., prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer). Results suggest that constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Transtheoretical Model (TTM), and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) are associated with greater motivation for physical activity, and some of these constructs have been used in interventions to promote physical activity adoption. There is scope for understanding the determinants of physical activity adoption in various cancer survivor populations. Much more needs to done to identify the determinants of maintenance of physical activity.",Recent results in cancer research. Fortschritte der Krebsforschung.

31720482,"Zinc supplementation is an effective and feasible strategy to prevent growth retardation in 6 to 24 month children: A pragmatic double blind, randomized trial.","Background: Zinc is an essential nutrient that is naturally available in most foods. Deficiency of this micronutrient in particular can cause a number of health complications. Zinc deficiency during infancy is more troublesome as rapid growth and nutrient relied development takes place in this period. Most severe outcomes of zinc deficiency during infancy are considered to be, impaired immunity, growth retardation and impaired neurodevelopment. The aim of this pragmatic study is to determine whether zinc supplementation strategy is feasible and effective for reducing growth retardation at national level. Methods: A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel group effectiveness trial that evaluated the effect of zinc supplementation in infant development. Children aged 6-24 months were recruited from healthcare centers of Damavand, Pishva and Varamin in the beginning of the study (n = 682). The Subjects were then randomly allocated in two groups of intervention (n = 272), and control (n = 308), where a daily dose of zinc sulfate (5ml) suspension containing 5mg elemental zinc and placebo were administered for the period of 6 month. Investigators, care givers and the parents of the children were blinded to the nature of the intervention. Anthropometric measures were evaluated at the beginning and after the six month intervention period. The primary outcome measured was linear growth and length difference, serum zinc and ferritin concentrations were the secondary outcomes. Findings: Following the intervention, compared with the placebo, zinc supplementation was associated with significant difference in the average length increment (primary outcome) (placebo 5.23 +/- 2.19 vs. intervention 5.79 +/- 2.18 cm, p = 0.02). No significant difference was observed in concentrations of serum zinc and ferritin. After the intervention the prevalence of zinc deficiency was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. No complications and adverse effects were reported and the compliance was very good (7 children out of 344 didn't comply with the intake of syrup). Interpretation: Zinc supplementation for six month among children (6-24 months) had beneficial outcomes on growth and average length increment, therefore we propose it is a feasible strategy for preventing growth retardation.",Heliyon,2019 Nov,England,2019,10
31870361,Investigating the causal effect of socioeconomic status on quality of care under a universal health insurance system - a marginal structural model approach.,"BACKGROUND: Social disparities in healthcare persist in the US despite the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. We investigated the causal impact of socioeconomic status on the quality of care in a setting with minimal confounding bias from race, insurance type, and access to care. METHODS: We designed a retrospective population-based study with a random 25% sample of adult Taiwan population enrolled in Taiwan's National Health Insurance system from 2000 to 2016. Patient's income levels were categorized into low-income group (<25th percentile) and high-income group (>/=25th percentile). We used marginal structural modeling analysis to calculate the odds of hospital admissions for 11 ambulatory care sensitive conditions identified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the odds of having an Elixhauser comorbidity index greater than zero for low-income patients. RESULTS: Among 2,844,334 patients, those in lower-income group had 1.28 greater odds (95% CI 1.24-1.33) of experiencing preventable hospitalizations, and 1.04 greater odds (95% CI 1.03-1.05) of having a comorbid condition in comparison to high-income group. CONCLUSIONS: Income was shown to be a causal factor in a patient's health and a determinant of the quality of care received even with equitable access to care under a universal health insurance system. Policies focusing on addressing income as an important upstream causal determinant of health to provide support to patients in lower socioeconomic status will be effective in improving health outcomes for this vulnerable social stratum.",BMC health services research,2019 Dec 23,England,2019,10
21181446,Determinants of fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin among low income Latinos with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.,"The objective of this study was to identify demographic, socio-economic, acculturation, lifestyle, sleeping pattern, and biomedical determinants of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), among Latinos with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Latino adults (N = 211) with T2D enrolled in the DIALBEST trial were interviewed in their homes. Fasting blood samples were also collected in the participants' homes. Because all participants had poor glucose control, above-median values for FPG (173 mg/dl) and HbA1c (9.2%) were considered to be indicative of poorer glycemic control. Multivariate analyses showed that receiving heating assistance (OR: 2.20; 95% CI: 0.96-4.96), and having a radio (3.11, 1.16-8.35), were risk factors for higher FPG levels, and lower income (10.4, 1.54-69.30) was a risk factor for higher HbA1c levels. Lower carbohydrate intake during the previous day (0.04; 0.005-0.37), as well as regular physical activity (0.30; 0.13-0.69), breakfast (2.78; 1.10-6.99) and dinner skipping (3.9; 1.03-14.9) during previous week were significantly associated with FPG concentrations. Being middle aged (2.24, 1.12-4.47), 30-60 min of sleep during the day time (0.07, 0.01-0.74) and having medical insurance (0.31, 0.10-0.96) were predictors of HbA1c. Results suggest that contemporaneous lifestyle behaviors were associated with FPG and contextual biomedical factors such as health care access with HbA1c. Lower socio-economic status indicators were associated with poorer FPG and HbA1c glycemic control.",Journal of immigrant and minority health,2011 Oct,United States,2011,10
30618021,Leveraging Public Health Research to Inform State Legislative Policy that Promotes Health for Children and Families.,"Purpose Engagement in policy is an essential public health service, with state legislatures serving as important arenas for activity on issues affecting children and families. However, a gap in communication often exists between policymakers and public health researchers who have the research knowledge to inform policy issues. We describe one tool for researchers to better leverage public health research to inform state legislative policymaking on issues of relevance to children and families. Description The Oregon Family Impact Seminar (OFIS), adapted from the Policy Institute for Family Impact Seminars, applies a systematic process to bring a synthesis of research findings on public health issues to state legislators using a six-step process: (1) identify candidate topics, (2) recruit legislative champions, (3) select the topic, (4) identify and prepare speakers, (5) host the presentations, and (6) develop and disseminate a research brief as a follow-up contact. Assessment Use of this model in Oregon has produced policy impact; for example, the 2015 presentation, ""Two-Generation Approaches to Reduce Poverty,"" prompted ongoing dialogue culminating in a new statute to increase Earned Income Tax Credit for parents with young children. This approach also has strengthened relationships among researchers and legislators, which serves to streamline the OFIS process. Conclusion This model is an effective vehicle for leveraging public health research findings to inform state-level policy. This model also serves to connect researchers with opportunities to engage with policymakers to address significant public health problems, particularly those addressing social, economic, and environmental determinants of health for children and families.",Maternal and child health journal,2019 Jun,United States,2019,10
26222321,The Evolution of an Elective in Health Disparities and Advocacy: Description of Instructional Strategies and Program Evaluation.,"PROBLEM: Health disparities remain pervasive in the United States. Training future physicians to address health disparities requires attention to both systemic and provider causes of disparities, but comprehensive curricula are lacking. APPROACH: Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York, offers a 13-session health disparities elective to first-year medical students. The curriculum covers three main content areas: background, provider contributions to health disparities, and systemic contributions to health disparities (i.e., social determinants of health). Teaching methods included didactic and multimedia presentations, reflective discussions, and skill-building seminars (e.g., addressing subconscious assumptions and advocacy training).The authors evaluated the course in 2010-2013 by comparing students' summary scores for knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported confidence on pre- and postintervention tests. They investigated associations between students' sociodemographic characteristics and changes in summary scores. OUTCOMES: Scores increased significantly in each domain: Mean knowledge scores increased from 63.6 (+/- 10.0), out of 100, to 76.4 (+/- 12.8); mean attitudes scores increased from 16.7 (+/- 1.9), out of 20, to 18.2 (+/- 1.1); mean confidence scores increased from 10.7 (+/- 1.5), out of 16, to 14.4 (+/- 1.7). Younger students (< 24) had greater changes in confidence than older students. Other sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with changes in any domain. NEXT STEPS: Exposure to health disparities instruction is important for medical students. The authors' experience provides insights for incorporating such material into the compulsory curriculum. Future evaluation of outcomes from similar curricula should include measures of clinical behaviors (e.g., through clinical examinations).",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2015 Dec,United States,2015,10
22080765,Participation-based therapy for children with physical disabilities.,"PURPOSE: Optimizing home and community participation of children with physical disabilities is an important outcome of rehabilitation. METHOD: A review of literature identified research and theory on participation of children with physical disabilities. The authors' incorporated current knowledge to conceptualize the experience of optimal participation, formulate principles of participation-based physical and occupational therapy, and develop a five-step process for intervention. A case report was completed to illustrate application to practice. RESULTS: Optimal participation involves the dynamic interaction of determinants (attributes of the child, family, and environment) and dimensions (physical, social, and self engagement) of participation. Real-life experiences enable children to learn new activities and develop skills that optimize their participation and self-determination. Interventions are: goal-oriented, family-centered, collaborative, strengths-based, ecological, and self-determined. A distinguishing feature of intervention is that the therapist's primary role is to support the child and family to identify challenges to participation and solutions to challenges. The therapist is a consultant, collaborating with the child, family, and community providers to share information, educate, and instruct in ways that build child, family, and community capacity. CONCLUSION: The model may have utility for collaboration with families and community providers, determining goals for participation, and providing evidence-informed interventions.",Disability and rehabilitation,2012,England,2012,10
24825820,Economic rationalisation of health behaviours: the dangers of attempting policy discussions in a vacuum.,"When analysing the health behaviours of any group of people, understanding the constraints and possibilities for individual agency as shaped by the broader societal context is critical. In recent decades, our understanding of the ways in which physical and social environments influence health and health behaviours has expanded greatly. The authors of a recent analysis of Australian Aboriginal health data using an economic 'rational choice model,' published in this journal, claim to make a useful contribution to policy discussions relating to Aboriginal health, but neglect context. By doing so, they neglect the very factors that determine the success or failure of policy change. Notwithstanding the technical sophistication of the analyses, by ignoring most relevant determinants of health, the conclusions misrepresent the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and therefore risk perpetuating harm, rather than improving health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2014 Aug,England,2014,10
26246382,"Determinants of HIV, viral hepatitis and STI prevention needs among African migrants in Germany; a cross-sectional survey on knowledge, attitudes, behaviors and practices.","BACKGROUND: Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa (MisSA) are a relevant sub-group for HIV-transmission in Germany. A total of 10-15 % of all newly diagnosed cases are MisSA, and approximately one third acquired HIV in Germany. There is limited information on knowledge, attitudes, behaviors and practices (KABP) regarding sexual health in African communities residing in Germany. METHODS: From October-December 2013 we conducted a cross-sectional survey on KABP regarding HIV, viral hepatitis (HEP), and sexually transmitted infections (STI) among MisSA in Hamburg as a community-based participatory research project to identify knowledge gaps, sexual risk behavior regarding HIV/HEP/STI, HIV/STI-testing history and attitudes toward people living with HIV (PLWH). Trained peer researchers recruited participants through outreach. Questionnaires in German, English or French were either administered face-to-face or self-completed. Questions on knowledge about HIV/HEP/STI presented true statements; participants were asked if they knew the information before. To detect differences in sub-groups, unadjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated, and a multivariate analysis for knowledge on HIV/HEP/STI was performed. RESULTS: The final sample included 569 participants of whom 57 % were men. Most participants originated from Western and Central sub-Saharan Africa. Median time living in Germany was 6 years. Overall, 28 % had a university degree and 54 % reported a good level of German language. Over 80 % knew the risks for HIV transmission. A total of 44 % of respondents wrongly assumed that an HIV-diagnosis might lead to deportation and 64 % were not aware of the free and anonymous local HIV/STI-testing service. The proportion of participants with knowledge of presented facts on HEP varied from 40-58 %. The respective proportion on STI was 28-68 % and better among women compared to men (44 % vs. 54 %; OR = 1.45; 95 % CI 1.22-1.74). Men reported more often casual sex partners than women (43 % vs. 23 %; OR = 2.6; 95 % CI 1.7-4.0), and more frequently a previous STI (58 % vs. 39 %; OR = 2.1; 95 % CI 1.1-4.1). Overall, 16 % of women reported a history of sexual violence. The majority of respondents (75 %) reported that they would treat PLWH like any other person. CONCLUSION: Study participants demonstrated good knowledge on HIV-transmission but knowledge gaps regarding HIV/STI-testing services, HEP and STI. This calls for targeted interventions providing more information about these topics in African communities in Hamburg and possibly also elsewhere.",BMC public health,2015 Aug 6,England,2015,10
25949779,Geographic distribution of cancer cases in isfahan province/2006-2010.,"BACKGROUND: To facilitate analysis, interpreting and sharing cancer data and investigation spatial and geographical aspect of cancers in Isfahan province, cancer cases distribution was displayed using geographic information systems (GIS). METHODS: About 118,000 cancer data, which were confirmed in national cancer registration unit were extracted. Age-specific incidence rate and age standardized rate (ASR) of cancer cases from 2006 to 2010 was calculated for Isfahan province and its different districts. Distribution of ASR was determined according to sex and age groups. Spatial maps were drawn with the help of Arc GIS version 10 (ESRI, Redland, CA, USA) software in choropleth based maps. The data are classified in GIS environment by means of quantile method. Data were described with the help of maps spatially. RESULTS: Age standardized rate of cancers was higher in men than in women (134.58 vs. 115.4). The highest ASR was reported in the Isfahan (ASR: 133) and lowest in the Chadegan counties (ASR: 28). Different geographical distribution patterns of cancers were seen in district level. Cancer incidence was higher in the Isfahan, Lenjan, Fereidon Shahr and Falavarjan districts (134.3, 117.2, 113.5 and 111.1 respectively) among men and in Isfahan, Shahin Shahr, Lenjan and Najafabad districts (122.8, 102.3, 94 and 93 respectively) among women. The incidence rates of most cancers were lowest in the North East region of the province compared to the rest of the region. CONCLUSIONS: Using GIS for visual displaying of cancers facilitated communication with the policymakers and community. This study provided hypotheses about differences in the incidence of cancer in Isfahan districts. Higher age-specific incidence rate in the Isfahan city is probably a reflection of problems in addressing the patients in cancer registration. Complementary studies are needed to evaluate lower ASR in the North East regions of the province.",International journal of preventive medicine,2015,Iran,2015,10

DESIGN: An exploratory, qualitative analysis based on grounded theory. SAMPLE: A convenience sample of eight mothers from four of the most prevalent non-English-speaking cultures (Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Tamil) in an urban Canadian-teaching hospital. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: Non-Anglophone mothers' experience and support in the NICU. RESULTS: Study mothers experienced intense role disequilibrium during the unanticipated crisis of preterm birth of a VLBW infant; situational crises owing to the high-tech NI CU environment and their infant's condition; and developmental crises with feelings of loss, guilt, helplessness, and anxiety. Language barriers compounded the difficulties. Parent-buddies helped non-English-speaking mothers mobilize their strengths. Culture and language are important determinants of service satisfaction for non-English-speaking mothers.

28621806,Inequalities in uptake of prenatal screening according to ethnicity and socio-economic status in the four largest cities of the Netherlands (2011-2013).,"OBJECTIVES: In the Netherlands, all women are claimed to have equal access to prenatal screening (PS). Prior research demonstrated substantial inequalities in PS uptake associated with socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnic background. The suggested pathway was a lack of intention to participate in PS among these subgroups. We studied the background of inequalities in PS participation, challenging intention heterogeneity as the single explanation. METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression analyses of the national PS registry, focusing on the four largest cities in the Netherlands (n = 4578, years 2011-2013), stratified by SES. OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) any uptake of PS (yes/no) and (2) uptake (one/two tests) for women who intended to participate in two tests. Determinants included intention, ethnicity, practice, and age. RESULTS: Of non-Western women, 85.7% were screened versus 89.7% of Western women. Intention was an important explanatory factor in all models. However, after correction for intention, ethnicity remained a significant determinant for differences in uptake. Ethnicity and SES also interacted, indicating that non-Western women in low SES areas had the lowest uptake (corrected for intention). CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Socioeconomic status and ethnicity related inequalities in PS uptake are only partially explained by intention heterogeneity; other pathways, in particular provider-related determinants, may play a role.

29760227,Socioeconomic Status and Cardiovascular Outcomes: Challenges and Interventions.,"Socioeconomic status (SES) has a measurable and significant effect on cardiovascular health. Biological, behavioral, and psychosocial risk factors prevalent in disadvantaged individuals accentuate the link between SES and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Four measures have been consistently associated with CVD in high-income countries: income level, educational attainment, employment status, and neighborhood socioeconomic factors. In addition, disparities based on sex have been shown in several studies. Interventions targeting patients with low SES have predominantly focused on modification of traditional CVD risk factors. Promising approaches are emerging that can be implemented on an individual, community, or population basis to reduce disparities in outcomes. Structured physical activity has demonstrated effectiveness in low-SES populations, and geomapping may be used to identify targets for large-scale programs. Task shifting, the redistribution of healthcare management from physician to nonphysician providers in an effort to improve access to health care, may have a role in select areas. Integration of SES into the traditional CVD risk prediction models may allow improved management of individuals with high risk, but cultural and regional differences in SES make generalized implementation challenging. Future research is required to better understand the underlying mechanisms of CVD risk that affect individuals of low SES and to determine effective interventions for patients with high risk. We review the current state of knowledge on the impact of SES on the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of CVD in high-income societies and suggest future research directions aimed at the elimination of these adverse factors, and the integration of measures of SES into the customization of cardiovascular treatment.",Circulation,2018 May 15,United States,2018,10
26474735,How do patient perceived determinants influence the decision-making process to accept or decline preimplantation genetic screening?,"OBJECTIVE: Identify the determinants that influence the patient's decision-making process when deciding to accept or decline preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) in a given IVF cycle. DESIGN: Pilot, retrospective, cross-sectional study that used a questionnaire containing a combination of quantitative and qualitative items. SETTING: Private practice IVF clinic. PATIENT(S): Patients and partners initiating an IVF treatment cycle, both autologous and donor, between October 2012 and January 2015. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Identification of patient perceived determinants and the importance of each on the decision to accept or decline PGS. RESULT(S): Responses from the questionnaire (N = 117) were returned, and of these, 60% accepted PGS. The female response rate was 75% (N = 88) and the male response rate was 25% (N = 29). Ninety-eight percent were Christian (N = 112) and 88% college educated (N = 102) with 39% (N = 40) having some postgraduate education. Sixty-eight percent (N = 79) had no knowledge of PGS before the IVF cycle; however, after provider education, 92% (N = 108) correctly identified that PGS was elective and 93% (N = 109) reported sufficient knowledge to make an informed decision to accept or decline PGS. The additional cost of screening, the provider information and influence, and social support or acceptance from partner, family, and/or friends, were the three statistically significant variables affecting the decision. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first study, to the authors' knowledge, to identify and assess the determinants of the patient decision-making process when presented with the choice of PGS. Several factors contribute to the patient-perceived determinants when choosing to accept or decline PGS, including cost, religious and ethical beliefs and values, social and family support, provider influences, and the past reproductive experience of the patient.",Fertility and sterility,2016 Jan,United States,2016,10

The goal of QNTS is to document individual differences in the cognitive, behavioral, and social-emotional aspects of developmental health across childhood, their early bio-social determinants, as well as their putative role in later social-emotional adjustment, school and health outcomes. A total of 662 families of twins were initially assessed when the twins were aged 6 months. These twins and their family were then followed regularly. QNTS has 14 waves of data collected or planned, including 5 in preschool. Over the past 15 years, a broad range of physiological, cognitive, behavioral, school, and health phenotypes were documented longitudinally through multi-informant and multi-method measurements. QNTS also entails extended and detailed multi-level assessments of proximal (e.g., parenting behaviors, peer relationships) and distal (e.g., family income) features of the child's environment. This detailed longitudinal information makes QNTS uniquely suited for the study of the role of the early years and gene-environment transactions in development.",Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies,2013 Feb,England,2013,10

Through the lenses of the Social Ecological Model, the purpose of this study was to further understand the current lived experiences of persons in post-sexual identity disclosure. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 15 lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults. Sample size was determined by thematic saturation. A semiotic phenomenological procedure was used for analyzing the data. Results Based on the reported experiences after sexual identity disclosure among participants, 7 themes were identified. Themes entailed stereotypical perceptions of sexual identity, improvement in mental health, relationship estrangement, development of new relationships, social support, non-acceptance of sexual orientation, and minority stress. Conclusions Through various theories and models, this study provide recommendations for stakeholders invested in the health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.",American journal of health behavior,2018 Jul 1,United States,2018,10

We compared the prevalence and severity of FoF in older adults with and without DM and identified which FoF determinants contribute to FoF severity in older adults with DM. We used Canadian baseline data from the International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS) which identified 141 older adults with DM (DM-group;age:68.88+/-2.80years) and 620 without DM (noDM-group;age:68.81+/-2.68years). FoF was quantified with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I). FoF determinants were evaluated in demographic/health-related, physical, psychological, and social domains. High concern of FoF was more prevalent and of higher severity in 10/16 FES-I activities in the DM-group compared to the noDM-group. Higher FoF severity in the DM-group was associated with poor physical performance, being female, fall history, and clinical depressive symptoms. Protocols developed for screening and interventions may reduce FoF severity in this population.",Canadian journal on aging = La revue canadienne du vieillissement,2018 Sep,Canada,2018,10

As momentum for addressing social factors in primary care settings grows, provider ability to identify, treat and assess these factors remains unknown. Community health centers care for over 20-million of America's highest risk populations. This study at three centers evaluates provider ability to identify, treat and code for the SDH. METHODS: Investigators utilized a pre-study survey and a card study design to obtain evidence from the point of care. The survey assessed providers' perceptions of the SDH and their ability to address them. Then providers filled out one anonymous card per patient on four assigned days over a 4-week period, documenting social factors observed during encounters. The cards allowed providers to indicate if they were able to: provide counseling or other interventions, enter a diagnosis code and enter a billing code for identified factors. RESULTS: The results of the survey indicate providers were familiar with the SDH and were comfortable identifying social factors at the point of care. A total of 747 cards were completed. 1584 factors were identified and 31 % were reported as having a service provided. However, only 1.2 % of factors were associated with a billing code and 6.8 % received a diagnosis code. CONCLUSIONS: An obvious discrepancy exists between the number of identifiable social factors, provider ability to address them and documentation with billing and diagnosis codes. This disparity could be related to provider inability to code for social factors and bill for related time and services. Health care organizations should seek to implement procedures to document and monitor social factors and actions taken to address them. Results of this study suggest simple methods of identification may be sufficient. The addition of searchable codes and reimbursements may improve the way social factors are addressed for individuals and populations.",BMC family practice,2016 Aug 27,England,2016,10

26725070,Elevated levels of S100A12 in the seminal plasma of infertile men with varicocele.,"PURPOSE: Varicocele is among the leading causes of male infertility. Despite decades of research, its pathogenesis is still unclear. S100A12 is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins with principal extracellular activities. It is secreted by activated neutrophils and interacts with the multiligand receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Many studies have delineated the patterns of S100A12 expression in a variety of pathologic conditions. These data show that S100A12 could be a potentially useful inflammatory marker. To explore the relationship between S100A12 and infertility, we examined the amount of S100A12 in semen of infertile men who suffered from varicocele. METHODS: S100A12 levels in seminal plasma of 68 infertile men with varicocele (age range 30-45 years) and 68 healthy fertile controls were measured using ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed using both parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Results of this study showed that the seminal levels of S100A12 were significantly increased in infertile men with varicocele when compared to fertile controls (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the important role(s) of these molecules in inflammatory response of cell systems, it could be possible that the spermatozoa motility is reduced following increasing neutrophils, S100A12, and reactive oxygen species in semen of infertile patients with varicocele. S100 proteins seem to be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for male infertility.",International urology and nephrology,2016 Mar,Netherlands,2016,10
27856085,The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change.,"The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change is an international, multidisciplinary research collaboration between academic institutions and practitioners across the world. It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission, which concluded that the response to climate change could be ""the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century"". The Lancet Countdown aims to track the health impacts of climate hazards; health resilience and adaptation; health co-benefits of climate change mitigation; economics and finance; and political and broader engagement. These focus areas form the five thematic working groups of the Lancet Countdown and represent different aspects of the complex association between health and climate change. These thematic groups will provide indicators for a global overview of health and climate change; national case studies highlighting countries leading the way or going against the trend; and engagement with a range of stakeholders. The Lancet Countdown ultimately aims to report annually on a series of indicators across these five working groups. This paper outlines the potential indicators and indicator domains to be tracked by the collaboration, with suggestions on the methodologies and datasets available to achieve this end. The proposed indicator domains require further refinement, and mark the beginning of an ongoing consultation process-from November, 2016 to early 2017-to develop these domains, identify key areas not currently covered, and change indicators where necessary. This collaboration will actively seek to engage with existing monitoring processes, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO's climate and health country profiles. The indicators will also evolve over time through ongoing collaboration with experts and a range of stakeholders, and be dependent on the emergence of new evidence and knowledge. During the course of its work, the Lancet Countdown will adopt a collaborative and iterative process, which aims to complement existing initiatives, welcome engagement with new partners, and be open to developing new research projects on health and climate change.","Lancet (London, England)",2017 Mar 18,England,2017,10

24568143,"Gaps in Indigenous disadvantage not closing: a census cohort study of social determinants of health in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand from 1981-2006.","BACKGROUND: Australia, Canada, and New Zealand are all developed nations that are home to Indigenous populations which have historically faced poorer outcomes than their non-Indigenous counterparts on a range of health, social, and economic measures. The past several decades have seen major efforts made to close gaps in health and social determinants of health for Indigenous persons. We ask whether relative progress toward these goals has been achieved. METHODS: We used census data for each country to compare outcomes for the cohort aged 25-29 years at each census year 1981-2006 in the domains of education, employment, and income. RESULTS: The percentage-point gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous persons holding a bachelor degree or higher qualification ranged from 6.6% (New Zealand) to 10.9% (Canada) in 1981, and grew wider over the period to range from 19.5% (New Zealand) to 25.2% (Australia) in 2006. The unemployment rate gap ranged from 5.4% (Canada) to 16.9% (Australia) in 1981, and fluctuated over the period to range from 6.6% (Canada) to 11.0% (Australia) in 2006. Median Indigenous income as a proportion of non-Indigenous median income (whereby parity = 100%) ranged from 77.2% (New Zealand) to 45.2% (Australia) in 1981, and improved slightly over the period to range from 80.9% (Canada) to 54.4% (Australia) in 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Australia, Canada, and New Zealand represent nations with some of the highest levels of human development in the world. Relative to their non-Indigenous populations, their Indigenous populations were almost as disadvantaged in 2006 as they were in 1981 in the employment and income domains, and more disadvantaged in the education domain. New approaches for closing gaps in social determinants of health are required if progress on achieving equity is to improve.",BMC public health,2014 Feb 25,England,2014,10
31846517,The uptake of evidence-informed guidelines for reporting suicide into media codes of practice and policies in Australia.,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Despite different models and frameworks for effective suicide prevention, a universal intervention that is consistently highlighted is the need for responsible and safe media reporting of suicide. This is based on evidence of an association between media reporting of suicide and subsequent suicidal behaviour. This study examines the extent to which media-led policies and codes of practice in Australia have integrated and aligned with evidence-informed recommendations about reporting suicide. METHODS: An online search of Australian media agency websites was used to identify codes of practice or similar guidance for news reporting. Content analysis was conducted on all identified documents, assessing alignment with 16 key recommendations from the Mindframe media guidelines for reporting on suicide. RESULTS: A total of 17 documents across 12 media agencies were identified. Ten of the 12 agencies provided specific advice about the reporting of suicide, with all agencies that issue codes of practice or editorial policies including between two and 10 recommendations aligned with the Mindframe guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: While the results of this study are positive, significant variation between media agencies shows that there are opportunities to enhance adoption and implementation of evidence-informed guidance for media professionals in Australia. SO WHAT?: With over 3000 people dying by suicide and over 60 000 people attempting suicide each year in Australia, the prevention of suicide remains a key public health priority requiring a multi-sector and health-in-all-policies approach. This study reveals that there is a strong platform for ongoing collaboration with the Australian media to ensure safe and sensitive coverage of suicide.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2019 Dec 17,Australia,2019,10
26571028,"Epidemiology and Heritability of Major Depressive Disorder, Stratified by Age of Onset, Sex, and Illness Course in Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS).","The heritability of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been estimated at 37% based largely on twin studies that rely on contested assumptions. More recently, the heritability of MDD has been estimated on large populations from registries such as the Swedish, Finnish, and Chinese cohorts. Family-based designs utilise a number of different relationships and provide an alternative means of estimating heritability. Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) is a large (n = 20,198), family-based population study designed to identify the genetic determinants of common diseases, including Major Depressive Disorder. Two thousand seven hundred and six individuals were SCID diagnosed with MDD, 13.5% of the cohort, from which we inferred a population prevalence of 12.2% (95% credible interval: 11.4% to 13.1%). Increased risk of MDD was associated with being female, unemployed due to a disability, current smokers, former drinkers, and living in areas of greater social deprivation. The heritability of MDD in GS:SFHS was between 28% and 44%, estimated from a pedigree model. The genetic correlation of MDD between sexes, age of onset, and illness course were examined and showed strong genetic correlations. The genetic correlation between males and females with MDD was 0.75 (0.43 to 0.99); between earlier (</= age 40) and later (> age 40) onset was 0.85 (0.66 to 0.98); and between single and recurrent episodic illness course was 0.87 (0.72 to 0.98). We found that the heritability of recurrent MDD illness course was significantly greater than the heritability of single MDD illness course. The study confirms a moderate genetic contribution to depression, with a small contribution of the common family environment (variance proportion = 0.07, CI: 0.01 to 0.15), and supports the relationship of MDD with previously identified risk factors. This study did not find robust support for genetic differences in MDD due to sex, age of onset, or illness course. However, we found an intriguing difference in heritability between recurrent and single MDD illness course. These findings establish GS:SFHS as a valuable cohort for the genetic investigation of MDD.",PloS one,2015,United States,2015,10
29424102,Complex care and contradictions of choice in the safety net.,"This article explores the complicated and often-contradictory notions of choice at play in complex care management (CCM) programmes in the US healthcare safety net. Drawing from longitudinal data collected over two years of ethnographic fieldwork at urban safety-net clinics, our study examines the CCM goal of transforming frequent emergency department (ED) utilisers into 'active' patients who will reduce their service utilisation and thereby contribute to a more rational, cost-effective healthcare system. By considering our data alongside philosopher Annemarie Mol's (2008) conceptualisation of the competing logics of choice and care, we argue that these premises often undermine CCM teams' efforts to support patients and provide the care they need - not only to prevent medical crises, but to overcome socio-economic barriers as well. We assert that while safety-net CCM programmes are held accountable for the degree to which their patients successfully transform into self-managing, cost-effective actors, much of the care CCM staff provide in fact involves attempts to intervene on structural obstacles that impinge on patient choice. CCM programmes thus struggle between an economic imperative to get patients to make better health choices and a moral imperative to provide care in the face of systemic societal neglect.

Data from seven well-established cohort studies from Denmark were pooled. Combining these cohorts provided a unique opportunity to generate a large study population with long follow-up and sufficient statistical power to develop and apply new methods for quantification of the two basic mechanisms underlying social inequalities in cancer-mediation and interaction. The SIC cohort included 83 006 participants aged 20-98 years at baseline. A wide range of behavioural and biological risk factors such as smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol intake, hormone replacement therapy, body mass index, blood pressure and serum cholesterol were assessed by self-administered questionnaires, physical examinations and blood samples. All participants were followed up in nationwide demographic and healthcare registries.

24971295,Interaction of alcohol use and specific types of smoking on the development of oral cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is one of the most common life threatening diseases all over the world, in particular in Asian countries, and tobacco and alcohol are considered to be the most potent risk factors for oral cancer. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the combined effect of smoking types and alcohol consumption on the development of oral cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case-control study of 350 cases and 350 controls over a period of 19 months in the time period between February 2005 and September 2006 was carried out in Pune, India. The self-reported information about their consumption of alcohol and smoking behaviors was collected by structured questionnaires. The data was analyzed by SPSS software package. Risk analysis was performed using conditional logistic regression, which provides results in the form of crude odd ratios. RESULTS: The smoking as well as alcohol drinking rates in the subjects of the case group were signi fi cantly higher than the controls. Of smoking types, bidi (a hand rolled cigarette) (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.4-6.9), and among alcohol types, hard liquor (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1. 4-6.4), country liquor (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.3-3.6) and beer (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-5.0), showed a strong association with oral cancer. A significant interaction effect was found between alcohol consumption and bidi smoking (OR = 19.6, 95% CI = 4.6-83.5) followed by alcohol and non-filtered cigarette (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.8-12.0) as well as filtered-cigarette (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.1-5.0).

This paper provides analysis of why this group should be considered a priority health group using a social determinants of health framework, which has, to date, largely been ignored within primary health care policy reform in Australia. Several key areas of the primary health care reform package are considered in relation to LGBTI health and well-being. Practical suggestions are provided as to how the primary health care sector could contribute to reducing the health inequities affecting LGBTI people. It is argued that care needs to be taken to ensure the reform process does not further marginalise this group.",Australian journal of primary health,2011,Australia,2011,10

Depending on which studies are correct, low education white women have lost between 3 and 5 years of lifespan; men, between 6 months and 3 years. Although absolute declines in life expectancy are relatively rare, some commentators see the public alarm as reflecting a racist concern for white lives over black ones. How ought we ethically to evaluate this lifespan contraction in low education whites? Should we care, or is it racist to care? Does it constitute an injustice or reflect justice being done? I argue that the lifespan contraction in low education whites violates key normative criteria used to make determinations of health justice, and that these judgments do not vitiate concerns about racism. I conclude with reflections on US population health policy and building an inclusive health equity movement.",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,2018 Oct,United States,2018,10
31235363,"Differential associations between everyday versus institution-specific racial discrimination, self-reported health, and allostatic load among black women: implications for clinical assessment and epidemiologic studies.","PURPOSE: Black women have the highest estimated allostatic load (AL). AL and self-perceived health are strong health predictors and have been linked to racial discrimination. Research suggests that everyday and institution-specific racial discrimination may predict different AL and self-reported health (SRH) outcomes. Furthermore, discrepancies between AL and self-perceived health could widen disparities. We estimated associations between everyday versus institution-specific racial discrimination with AL and SRH. METHODS: Data are from a San Francisco Bay Area community sample of 208 black women aged 30-50 years. Participation involved a questionnaire, self-interview, blood draw, and anthropometric measurements. Adjusted generalized linear regression models estimated associations of racial discrimination with AL and SRH. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic position, and medication use, institution-specific discrimination was negatively associated with AL (i.e., better health), whereas everyday experiences showed no association. Those reporting very-high (vs. moderate) institution-specific discrimination had lower AL (beta = -1.31 [95% CI: -2.41, -0.20]; AL range: 0-15). No racial discrimination-SRH association was found. CONCLUSIONS: For black women, (1) institution-specific racial discrimination may be differentially embodied compared with everyday experiences and (2) institutional racism may contribute to physiologic stress-regulation regardless of self-perceived health status. Potential factors that may contribute to an inverse racial discrimination-AL association, and future research, are discussed.",Annals of epidemiology,2019 Jul,United States,2019,10

Self-efficacy deficiency in problem-solving runs through many families. This qualitative study was conducted to investigate and describe how couples solve problems in their families. Method: This study was conducted to detect couples' self-efficacy deficiency in problem-solving using purposive sampling method. Several deep semi-structured interviews based on McMaster model and observations were conducted by nine family therapists and psychiatrists on four couples (eight persons) living in Yazd (Iran).The interviews were performed, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The analysis was interpreted through directed content analysis methods. Results: Families in Yazd (Iran) made some attempts to solve their problems, but their efforts were not enough, and thus they suffered from self-efficacy deficiency, which included 8 categories. The main theme distilled from the data of 17 participants was self-efficacy deficiency, which included the following categories: avoidance, insolvency, interference from others, ineffective self-treatment, behavioral problems, stubbornness, superficiality, and denial. Conclusion: It is of paramount importance to identify self-efficacy deficiency in families and promote problem- solving programs to increase family stability.

This review aims to: (1) summarize the current knowledge on HRQoL and socioprofessional outcomes and (2) provide strategies for incorporation of HRQoL assessment into clinical practice. Studies report that pediatric patients with ESRD have significantly lower HRQoL scores compared with children with other chronic diseases. Patients treated by dialysis are at particularly high risk for impaired HRQoL. Furthermore, patients more often have impaired neurocognitive functioning and lower academic achievement. Important determinants of impaired HRQoL include medical factors (i.e., receiving dialysis, disabling comorbidities, cosmetic side effects, stunted growth), sociodemographic factors (i.e., female gender, non-Western background) and psychosocial factors (i.e., noneffective coping strategies). Contrary to the situation in childhood, adult survivors of pediatric ESRD report a normal mental HRQoL. Despite this subjective feeling of well-being, these patients have on average experienced significantly more difficulties in completing their education, developing intimate relationships, and securing employment. Several medical and psychosocial strategies may potentially improve HRQoL in children with ESRD. Regular assessment of HRQoL and neurocognitive functioning in order to identify areas in which therapies and interventions may be required should be part of standard clinical care.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2016 Oct,Germany,2016,10
31435578,The effect of sexual health counseling on women's sexual satisfaction in postpartum period: A randomized clinical trial.,"Background: Many couples experience decreasing sexual satisfaction in postpartum period. Various sexual health counseling approaches have been designed for postpartum women to address their common sexual concerns and problems. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Women's Postpartum Sexual Health Program (WPSHP) on women's sexual satisfaction in postpartum period. Materials and Methods: The study was a single blind randomized clinical trial on 75 postpartum women aged 18-35 yr with low sexual satisfaction who attended urban health-care centres in Mashhad, Iran in 2016. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, and the Larson Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire. The intervention group received counselling based on the WPSHP, a four-session, group- and couples-based program. The control group just received postpartum routine care. Results: Both the intervention and control groups were homogeneous for demographic variables. According to the Mann-Whitney test, sexual satisfaction score in the intervention group was significantly higher than the control group 8 weeks after the intervention (p < 0.001). According to the Wilcoxon test, there was a significant difference in the mean score of sexual satisfaction before and after intervention in the intervention group (p < 0.001). Conclusion: WPSHP caused higher levels of sexual satisfaction. It is therefore recommended to use this program in women during the postpartum period to promote their sexual satisfaction.","International journal of reproductive biomedicine (Yazd, Iran)",2019 Jan,Iran,2019,10
27936071,Foot Conditions among Homeless Persons: A Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Foot problems are common among homeless persons, but are often overlooked. The objectives of this systematic review are to summarize what is known about foot conditions and associated interventions among homeless persons. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on MEDLINE (1966-2016), EMBASE (1947-2016), and CINAHL (1982-2016) and complemented by manual searches of reference lists. Articles that described foot conditions in homeless persons or associated interventions were included. Data were independently extracted on: general study characteristics; participants; foot assessment methods; foot conditions and associated interventions; study findings; quality score assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. RESULTS: Of 333 articles screened, 17 articles met criteria and were included in the study. Prevalence of any foot problem ranged from 9% to 65% across study populations. Common foot-related concerns were corns and calluses, nail pathologies, and infections. Foot pathologies related to chronic diseases such as diabetes were identified. Compared to housed individuals across studies, homeless individuals were more likely to have foot problems including tinea pedis, foot pain, functional limitations with walking, and improperly-fitting shoes. DISCUSSION: Foot conditions were highly prevalent among homeless individuals with up to two thirds reporting a foot health concern, approximately one quarter of individuals visiting a health professional, and one fifth of individuals requiring further follow-up due to the severity of their condition. Homeless individuals often had inadequate foot hygiene practices and improperly-fitting shoes. These findings have service provision and public health implications, highlighting the need for evidence-based interventions to improve foot health in this population. An effective interventional approach could include optimization of foot hygiene and footwear, provision of comprehensive medical treatment, and addressing social factors that lead to increased risk of foot problems. Targeted efforts to screen for and treat foot problems could result in improved health and social outcomes for homeless individuals.",PloS one,2016,United States,2016,10
22305807,Social determinants of health--a question of social or economic capital? Interaction effects of socioeconomic factors on health outcomes.,"Social structures and socioeconomic patterns are the major determinants of population health. However, very few previous studies have simultaneously analysed the ""social"" and the ""economic"" indicators when addressing social determinants of health. We focus on the relevance of economic and social capital as health determinants by analysing various indicators. The aim of this paper was to analyse independent associations, and interactions, of lack of economic capital (economic hardships) and social capital (social participation, interpersonal and political/institutional trust) on various health outcomes. Data was derived from the 2009 Swedish National Survey of Public Health, based on a randomly selected representative sample of 23,153 men and 28,261 women aged 16-84 year, with a participation rate of 53.8%. Economic hardships were measured by a combined economic hardships measure including low household income, inability to meet expenses and lacking cash reserves. Social capital was measured by social participation, interpersonal (horizontal) trust and political (vertical/institutional trust) trust in parliament. Health outcomes included; (i) self-rated health, (i) psychological distress (GHQ-12) and (iii) musculoskeletal disorders. Results from multivariate logistic regression show that both measures of economic capital and low social capital were significantly associated with poor health status, with only a few exceptions. Significant interactive effects measured as synergy index were observed between economic hardships and all various types of social capital. The synergy indices ranged from 1.4 to 2.3. The present study adds to the evidence that both economic hardships and social capital contribute to a range of different health outcomes. Furthermore, when combined they potentiate the risk of poor health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2012 Mar,England,2012,10
23849228,Socio-cultural determinants of timely and delayed treatment of Buruli ulcer: Implications for disease control.,"INTRODUCTION: Public health programmes recommend timely medical treatment for Buruli ulcer (BU) infection to prevent pre-ulcer conditions from progressing to ulcers, to minimise surgery, disabilities and the socio-economic impact of BU. Clarifying the role of socio-cultural determinants of timely medical treatment may assist in guiding public health programmes to improve treatment outcomes. This study clarified the role of socio-cultural determinants and health system factors affecting timely medical treatment for BU in an endemic area in Ghana. METHODS: A semi-structured explanatory model interview based on the explanatory model interview catalogue (EMIC) was administered to 178 BU-affected persons. Based on research evidence, respondents were classified as timely treatment (use of medical treatment 3 months from awareness of disease) and delayed treatment (medical treatment 3 months after onset of disease and failure to use medical treatment). The outcome variable, timely treatment was analysed with cultural epidemiological variables for categories of distress, perceived causes of BU, outside-help and reasons for medical treatment in logistic regression models. The median time for the onset of symptoms to treatment was computed in days. Qualitative phenomenological analysis of respondents' narratives clarified the meaning, context and dynamic features of the relationship of explanatory variables with timely medical treatment. RESULTS: The median time for initiating treatment was 25 days for pre-ulcers, and 204 days for ulcers. Income loss and use of herbalists showed significantly negative associations with timely treatment. Respondents' use of herbalists was often motivated by the desire for quick recovery in order to continue with work and because herbalists were relatives and easily accessible. However, drinking unclean water was significantly associated with timely treatment and access to health services encouraged timely treatment (OR 8.5, p = 0.012). Findings show that health system factors of access are responsible for non-compliance to treatment regimes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the importance of an integrated approach to BU control and management considering the social and economic features that influence delayed treatment and factors that encourage timely medical treatment. This approach should consider periodic screening for early case-detection, collaboration with private practitioners and traditional healers, use of mobile services to improve access, adherence and treatment outcomes.",Infectious diseases of poverty,2012 Oct 25,England,2012,10
28086970,"Trends, determinants and inequities of 4(+) ANC utilisation in Bangladesh.","BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study are to document the trend on utilisation of four or more (4(+)) antenatal care (ANC) over the last 22 years period and to explore the determinants and inequity of 4(+) ANC utilisation as reported by the last two Bangladesh Demographic and Health surveys (BDHS) (2011 and 2014). METHODS: The data related to ANC have been extracted from the BDHS data set which is available online as an open source. STATA 13 software was used for organising and analysing the data. The outcome variable considered for this study was utilisation of 4(+) ANC. Trends of 4(+) ANC were measured in percentage and predictors for 4(+) ANC were measured through bivariate and multivariable analysis. The concentration index was estimated for assessing inequity in 4(+) ANC utilisation. RESULTS: Utilisation of 4(+) ANC has increased by about 26% between the year 1994 and 2014. Higher level of education, residing in urban region and richest wealth quintile were found to be significant predictors. The utilisation of 4(+) ANC has decreased with increasing parity and maternal age. The inequity indices showed consistent inequities in 4(+) ANC utilisation, and such inequities were increased between 2011 and 2014. CONCLUSIONS: In Bangladesh, the utilisation of any ANC rose steadily between 1994 and 2014, but progress in terms of 4(+) ANC utilisation was much slower as the expectation was to achieve the national set target (50%: 4(+) ANC utilisation) by 2016. Socio-economic inequities were observed in groups that failed to attend a 4(+) ANC visit. Policymakers should pay special attention to increase the 4(+) ANC coverage where this study can facilitate to identify the target groups whom need to be intervened on priority basis.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",2017 Jan 13,Bangladesh,2017,10

RESULTS: Among the 219 patients analyzed, 53.4% achieved successful outcomes (cure, completed treatment) while 46.6% of patients had unsuccessful outcomes (default, treatment failure, died). After adjusting for other factors, unsuccessful outcome was associated with intravenous drug use (OR 2.72; 95% CI 1.44-5.16), not receiving antiretroviral therapy (OR 5.10; 95% CI 2.69-9.69), lymphadenopathy (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.09-3.72) and low serum albumin (OR 4.61; 95% CI 1.73-12.27). CONCLUSION: Anti-retroviral treatment must be provided to all HIV-infected tuberculosis patients. Good immune and nutritional status needs to be assured in all HIV-infected tuberculosis patients. More studies are required in intravenous drug users to understand why tuberculosis treatment outcomes are poor in this group.",Preventive medicine,2013,United States,2013,10
28210469,"Comparison of four techniques on facility of two-hand Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation: E-C, Thenar Eminence, Thenar Eminence (Dominant hand)-E-C (non-dominant hand) and Thenar Eminence (non-dominant hand) - E-C (dominant hand).","Introduction: Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation is the first and important part of the airway management. The aim of present study was to evaluate the quality of four different BVM ventilation techniques - E-C, Thenar Eminence, Thenar Eminence (Dominant hand)-E-C (Non dominant hand), and Thenar Eminence (Non dominant hand)-E-C (Dominant hand) - among two novice and experienced groups. Methods: In a case-control and mannequin based study that was conducted in Tabriz University of medical sciences, 120 volunteers were recruited and divided into two groups. 60 participants in experienced and other 60 as novice group who observed BVM ventilation but hadn't practical experience about BVM ventilation. Every participant in both groups performed 4 BVM ventilation techniques under the supervision of an experienced assessor. Quality of mannequin chest expansion was recorded by two other experienced assessors who were blind to ventilation process. The data were analyzed with SPSS 17.0. Results: In novice group, when evaluating each technique performance, they did Thenar Eminence (non-dominant hand) - E-C (dominant hand) technique much better than the others (P<0.0001). But in the experienced group, there was no meaningful difference between the all four techniques (P= 0.102). Conclusion: Novice participants did Thenar Eminence (non-dominant hand) - E-C (dominant hand) technique better than the others. Therefore, it is recommended that training of this technique was placed in educational program of medical students.",Journal of cardiovascular and thoracic research,2016,Iran,2016,10
23856316,Dutch midwives' behavioural intentions of antenatal management of maternal distress and factors influencing these intentions: an exploratory survey.,"OBJECTIVE: to explore midwives' behavioural intentions and the determinants of these intentions with regard to the management of antenatal care of women with maternal distress. DESIGN: an exploratory survey using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics calculated expanded TPB constructs, demographic information, personal characteristics and work related details. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine which factors influence midwives' intention to provide antenatal care of maternal distress. SETTING: midwives working in Dutch primary care. PARTICIPANTS: 112 midwives completed the survey. RESULTS: midwives did not report a clear intention to screen for maternal distress (3.46 +/- 1.8). On average, midwives expressed a positive intention to support women with maternal distress (4.63 +/- 1.57) and to collaborate with other health-care professionals (4.63 +/- 1.57). Finding maternal distress an interesting topic was a positive predictor for the intention to screen (B=0.383; p=0.005), to support (B=0.637; p=<0.000) and to collaborate (B=0.455; p=0.002). Other positive predictors for the intention to screen for maternal distress were years of work experience (B=0.035; p=0.028), attitude about the value of screening (B=0.326; p=0.002), and self-efficacy (B=0.248; p=0.004). A positive attitude toward support for women with maternal distress (B=0.523; p=0.017) predicted the intention to support these women. Number of years of work experience (B=0.042; p=0.017) was a positive predictor for the intention to collaborate with other health-care professionals. KEY CONCLUSIONS: the intention to screen for maternal distress was less evident than the intention to support women with maternal distress and the intention to collaborate with other health-care professionals. Important factors predicting the midwife's intention to screen, support and collaborate were finding maternal distress an interesting topic, years of work experience, attitude about the value of screening and support and self-efficacy about screening. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: to provide care involving all three components of antenatal management of maternal distress implies efforts to influence the factors that predict the intention to screen, to support women with maternal distress and the intention to collaborate with other health-care professionals.",Midwifery,2014 Feb,Scotland,2014,10
24066987,Community-based physical activity intervention using principles of social marketing: a demonstration project in Southern India.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the development and implementation of promotion of physical activity in a rural community by applying the principles of social marketing and to determine participation behaviour in a physical activity programme in a community setting. METHODS: The intervention targeted 485 people, 20-49 years of age, residents of Periakattupalayam and Rangareddipalayam villages, Tamil Nadu. This community-based participatory research was based on the principles of 'social marketing'. Health education by one-to-one counselling, written materials and community events were used to popularize moderate intensity physical activity (brisk walking for 30 minutes on 4 days/week). We formed 30 walking groups under four coordinators, in a home-based setting with professional supervision and guidance. A log of physical activity sessions for the 10-week intervention period was maintained in the form of group attendance record. Village leaders, self-help groups and youth clubs were involved in promoting physical activity. RESULTS: Of the 485 subjects, 265 people (54.6%) engaged in brisk walking >4 days a week, while 156 subjects (32.2%) performed walking on 1-4 days per week during the intervention. The drop-out rate was 13.2% (64 subjects). Age, occupation and educational status were important determinants of participation and adherence to the physical activity programme. CONCLUSION: Application of social marketing techniques in an intervention to promote physical activity was successful in a rural Indian community. Studying the determinants of adoption of a physical activity programme and addressing the barriers to behaviour change are essential for designing relevant policies and effective programmes.",The National medical journal of India,2013 Jan-Feb,India,2013,10
24349720,Determinants of inequity in health care services utilization in markazi province of iran.,"BACKGROUND: National and international statistics from Iran have indicated that progresses and achievements have been made for most health indicators, but there are differences in some indicators in special groups and at the provincial level. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the main predictors of inequity in seeking Health Care Utilities (HCU) locally. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data gathered from the HCU survey, which was conducted in the Markazi province of Iran during 2008, was used in the present study. A systematic sampling method, based on the Iranian household framework, was applied in order to choose 758 households as well as 2711 individuals. The household wealth index constructed by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and robust login link function in Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) model were used in order to determine the predictors of inequity. RESULTS: 66.4% of those in need sought outpatient health care from which 97.7% received appropriate services. After adjustment for the clustering effect of household as well as confounding effect of the covariates, GEE model showed that there were inequities in HCU for females (OR = 2.44, CI; 1.24- 4.81) and subjects with inpatient need (OR = 2.14, CI: 1.23-3.72). Being in the lowest quintile of household wealth index was associated with the lower use of outpatient health services (OR = 0.45, CI; 0.23- 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In spite of improvements in the national health indicator, different groups of people use health care services differently, but these inequities in HCU are related to social and individual factors. Also, it is clear that health sector facilities and the accessibility to health services are not the only predictors.",Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,2013 May,Iran,2013,10
31271301,"Stunting and Its Determinants among Adolescent Girls: Findings from the Nutrition Surveillance Project, Northwest Ethiopia.","Under nutrition among adolescents is a major public health problem in Ethiopia and its causes are under investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of stunting and its determinants among adolescent girls in Dabat district. A total of 1556 adolescent girls were included in the study. The WHO's Anthro-plus software was used to generate the height for age z-scores. Variables having a p-value<0.2 in the simple logistic regression were entered into multiple logistic regression and a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. About 47.4%(95%CI; 45.0, 49.6%) of adolescent girls were stunted. Being in the early (AOR = 0.027, 95%CI: 0.08, 0.09) and middle age (AOR = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.06, 0.71) were less likely to be stunted compared with the late adolescent. The odds of stunting were found to be higher among adolescent of rural area (AOR = 1.45; 95%CI: 1.01, 2.10) and from household food in-secured (AOR = 1.33; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.73)families. Higher numbers of adolescent girls are stunted in Dabat district, suggesting severe public health importance of the problem. Age, residence and food security were associated with adolescent stunting. Thus, improving food security strategies targeting rural and food insecure households is recommended.

25789712,Patterns of post-acute health care utilization after a severe traumatic brain injury: Results from the PariS-TBI cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess brain injury services utilization and their determinants using Andersen's model. METHODS: Prospective follow-up of the PariS-TBI inception cohort. Out of 504 adults with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), 245 survived and 147 received a 4-year outcome assessment (mean age 33 years, 80% men). Provision rates of medical, rehabilitation, social and re-entry services and their relations to patients' characteristics were assessed. RESULTS: Following acute care discharge, 78% of patients received physiotherapy, 61% speech/cognitive therapy, 50% occupational therapy, 41% psychological assistance, 63% specialized medical follow-up, 21% community re-entry assistance. Health-related need factors, in terms of TBI severity, were the main predictors of services. Provision of each therapy was significantly associated with corresponding speech, motor and psychological impairments. However, care provision did not depend on cognitive impairments and cognitive therapy was related to pre-disposing and geographical factors. Community re-entry assistance was provided to younger and more independent patients. CONCLUSIONS: These quantitative findings illustrate strengths and weaknesses of late brain injury care provision in urban France and highlight the need to improve treatment of cognitive impairments.",Brain injury,2015,England,2015,10
29308613,"Effect of Transplantation of Bone Marrow Stromal Cell- Conditioned Medium on Ovarian Function, Morphology and Cell Death in Cyclophosphamide-Treated Rats.","OBJECTIVES: Although stem cell transplantation has beneficial effects on tissue regeneration, but there are still problems such as high cost and safety issues. Since stem cell therapy is largely dependent on paracrine activity, in this study, utilization of transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)-secretome instead of the cells, into damaged ovaries was evaluated to overcome the limitations of stem cell transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, BMSCs were cultured and 25-fold concentrated conditioned medium (CM) from BMSCs was prepared. Female rats were injected intraperitoneally with cyclophosphamide (CTX) for 14 days. Then, BMSCs and CM were individually transplanted into bilateral ovaries, and the ovaries were excised after four weeks of treatment. The follicle count was performed using hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining and the apoptotic cells were counted using TUNEL assay. Ovarian function was evaluated by monitoring the ability of ovulation and the levels of serum estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). RESULTS: Evaluation of the ovarian function and structure showed that results of secretome transplantation were almost similar to those of BMSCs transplantation and there was no significant differences between them. CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs-secretome is likely responsible for the therapeutic paracrine effect of BMSCs. Stem cellsecretome is expected to overcome the limitations of stem cell transplantation and become the basis of a novel therapy for ovarian damage.",Cell journal,2018 Apr,Iran,2018,10
23614899,Independent review of social and population variation in mental health could improve diagnosis in DSM revisions.,"At stake in the May 2013 publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), are billions of dollars in insurance payments and government resources, as well as the diagnoses and treatment of millions of patients. We argue that the most recent revision process has missed social determinants of mental health disorders and their diagnosis: environmental factors triggering biological responses that manifest themselves in behavior; differing cultural perceptions about what is normal and what is abnormal behavior; and institutional pressures related to such matters as insurance reimbursements, disability benefits, and pharmaceutical marketing. In addition, the experts charged with revising the DSM lack a systematic way to take population-level variations in diagnoses into account. To address these problems, we propose the creation of an independent research review body that would monitor variations in diagnostic patterns, inform future DSM revisions, identify needed changes in mental health policy and practice, and recommend new avenues of research. Drawing on the best available knowledge, the review body would make possible more precise and equitable psychiatric diagnoses and interventions.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2013 May,United States,2013,10
31476012,Disseminated Bacille Calmette-Guerin infection at a glance: a mini review of the literature.,"INTRODUCTION: Immunodeficient children are at a high risk of disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG] infection. We assessed the literature on clinical manifestations of BCGosis in children with specific primary immunodeficiencies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of clinical practice articles by searching Medline, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar from their inception to date. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles were included regarding BCG vaccination and its dissemination in children with primary immunodeficiencies. Articles on dissemination after intravesicular BCG were excluded from the study. CONCLUSIONS: Since disseminated BCG vaccination may be the first manifestation of a primary immunodeficiency disease, a comprehensive search for immunological defects in children developing these problems after BCG vaccination seems rational.",Advances in respiratory medicine,2019,Poland,2019,10
27669394,A participatory evaluation framework in the establishment and implementation of transdisciplinary collaborative centers for health disparities research.,"OBJECTIVE: We describe the formulation and implementation of a participatory evaluation plan for three Transdisciplinary Collaborative Centers for Health Disparities Research funded by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities. METHODS: Although different in scope of work, all three centers share a common goal of establishing sustainable centers in health disparities science in three priority areas - social determinants of health, men's health research, and health policy research. RESULTS: The logic model guides the process, impact, and outcome evaluation. Emphasis is placed on process evaluation in order to establish a ""blue print"" that can guide other efforts as well as assure that activities are being implemented as planned. CONCLUSION: We have learned three major lessons in this process: (1) Significant engagement, participation, and commitment of all involved is critical for the evaluation process; (2) Having a ""roadmap"" (logic model) and ""directions"" (evaluation worksheets) are instrumental in getting members from different backgrounds to follow the same path; and (3) Participation of the evaluator in the leadership and core meetings facilitates continuous feedback.",Evaluation and program planning,2017 Feb,England,2017,10
28458122,Impact of social prescribing on general practice workload and polypharmacy.,"OBJECTIVES: Social prescribing has emerged as a useful tool for helping patients overcome some of the social and behavioural determinants of poor health. There has been little research on the impact of social prescribing on use of primary healthcare resources. This study sought to determine whether social prescribing activities influenced patient-general practitioner (GP) contacts and polypharmacy. STUDY DESIGN: Quality-improvement design with social prescribing activity interventions from an urban general practice in Northern Ireland. METHODS: Patients over 65 years of age with a chronic condition who attended their GP frequently or had multiple medications were offered a social prescribing activity. Participants' contacts with GP and the new repeat prescriptions before and during the social prescribing activity were measured. The total number of repeat prescriptions per patient was compared at the time of referral and 6-12 months later. Indications for referral, primary diagnoses and reasons for declining participation in a social prescribing activity after referral were prospectively recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients agreed to participate but only 28 (41%) engaged in a prescribed social activity. There was no statistically significant difference in GP contacts (visits to GP, home visits or telephone calls) or number of new repeat prescriptions between referral and completion of 12 weeks of social prescribing activity. Similarly there was no statistically significant difference in the total number of repeat prescriptions between referral and 6-12 months after social prescribing activity in either intention to treat or per protocol analyses. Social prescribing participants had similar demographic factors. Mental health issues (anxiety and/or depression) were more common among participants than those who were referred but declined participation in a social prescribing activity (P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: While social prescribing may help patients' self-esteem and well-being, it may not decrease GP workload. Further research is required to optimise social prescribing benefits.",Public health,2017 Jul,Netherlands,2017,10
27481274,Driver licensing: descriptive epidemiology of a social determinant of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health.,"OBJECTIVE: Education, employment and equitable access to services are commonly accepted as important underlying social determinants of health. For most Australians, access to health, education and other services is facilitated by private transport and a driver licence. This study aimed to examine licensing rates and predictors of licensing in a sample of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as these have previously been poorly described. METHODS: Interviewer-administered surveys were conducted with 625 people 16 years or older in four Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services in New South Wales and South Australia over a two-week period in 2012-2013. RESULTS: Licensing rates varied from 51% to 77% by site. Compared to not having a licence, having a driver licence was significantly associated with higher odds of full-time employment (adjusted OR 4.0, 95%CI 2.5-6.3) and educational attainment (adjusted OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.2-2.8 for trade or certificate; adjusted OR 4.0, 95%CI 1.6-9.5 for degree qualification). CONCLUSIONS: Variation in driver licensing rates suggests different yet pervasive barriers to access. There is a strong association between driver licensing, education and employment. IMPLICATIONS: Licensing inequality has far-reaching impacts on the broader health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, reinforcing the need for appropriate and accessible pathways to achieving and maintaining driver licensing.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2016 Aug,Australia,2016,10
30283850,Is a Patient's Current Address of Record a Reasonable Measure of Neighborhood Deprivation Exposure? A Case for the Use of Point in Time Measures of Residence in Clinical Care.,Purpose: Interest is increasing in the use of geocoded patient address data to understand the effects that social determinants of health have on healthcare outcomes. Use of a patient's current address of record is often problematic given population mobility. Intragenerational economic mobility research suggests that patients will reside within neighborhoods with similar relative deprivation over time despite geographic mobility. The purpose of this study was to measure evidence of patient neighborhood deprivation persistence given a change in address of record. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients receiving active care in an integrated delivery system in a high-mobility United States region. Neighborhood deprivation was measured using a block-group level area deprivation index. Neighborhood deprivation persistence was measured as the probability that an individual with an address of record change remained within a neighborhood with a similar deprivation score. Logistic regression was used to conduct multivariate analysis. Results: Geographic mobility was highest among patients living in the most deprived neighborhoods versus least-deprived (odds ratio 1.75; 95% confidence interval: 1.71-1.79). Seventy-eight percent of all patients with a change of address did so to a neighborhood with a similar deprivation quintile. The probability that a random patient selected from the study had a change of address outside the same or neighboring quintile within a 1-year period ranged from 2% to 13%. Conclusions: Neighborhood deprivation persistence was high among this population of patients from a high mobility region. A current address of record is a reasonable indicator of patient exposure to neighborhood deprivation within a 1-3-year timeframe that is useful in evaluating healthcare disparities.,Health equity,2018,United States,2018,10
31621423,A theory-based intervention delivered by an online social media platform to promote oral health among Iranian adolescents: a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Objective: Based on the Health Action Process Approach, we tested the efficacy of a theory-based program using an online social media platform (Telegram) to promote good oral hygiene behaviour among Iranian adolescents. Design: A three-arm randomized-controlled trial design was used, consisting of an adolescent only intervention group (A group; n = 253), an adolescent and mother intervention group (A + M group; n = 260), and a control group (n = 278). Main outcome measures: Psychosocial variables, toothbrushing behaviour, Visual Plaque Index, and Community Periodontal Index. Results: Increases in adolescent toothbrushing at the one- and six-month follow-ups in both intervention groups compared to the control group were observed. Adolescents in the A + M group showed significant greater improvements in their toothbrushing behaviour, Visual Plaque Index, and Community Periodontal Index scores than adolescents in the A group. Improvements to toothbrushing social cognitions were also observed. Conclusions: Current results support the use of the theory-based program delivered by Telegram in improving good oral hygiene behaviour and oral health outcomes among Iranian adolescents. Involving mothers in an intervention can confer additional benefits for adolescent oral health.",Psychology & health,2019 Oct 17,England,2019,10
26357958,Socio-cultural and behavioural factors constraining latrine adoption in rural coastal Odisha: an exploratory qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Open defecation is widely practiced in India. To improve sanitation and promote better health, the Government of India (GOI) has instituted large scale sanitation programmes supporting construction of public and institutional toilets and extending financial subsidies for poor families in rural areas for building individual household latrines. Nevertheless, many household latrines in rural India, built with government subsidies and the facilitation and support of non-government organizations (NGO), remain unused. Literature on social, cultural and behavioural aspects that constrain latrine adoption and use in rural India is limited. This paper examines defecation patterns of different groups of people in rural areas of Odisha state in India to identify causes and determinants of latrine non-use, with a special focus on government-subsidized latrine owners, and shortcomings in household sanitation infrastructure built with government subsidies. METHODS: An exploratory study using qualitative methods was conducted in rural communities in Odisha state. Methods used were focus group discussions (FGDs), and observations of latrines and interviews with their owners. FGDs were held with frontline NGO sanitation program staff, and with community members, separately by caste, gender, latrine type, and age group. Data were analysed using a thematic framework and approach. RESULTS: Government subsidized latrines were mostly found unfinished. Many counted as complete per government standards for disbursement of financial subsidies to contracted NGOs were not accepted by their owners and termed as 'incomplete'. These latrines lacked a roof, door, adequate walls and any provision for water supply in or near the cabin, whereas rural people had elaborate processes of cleansing with water post defecation, making presence of a nearby water source important. Habits, socialising, sanitation rituals and daily routines varying with caste, gender, marital status, age and lifestyle, also hindered the adoption of latrines. Interest in constructing latrines was observed among male heads for their female members especially a newlywed daughter-in-law, reflecting concerns for their privacy, security, and convenience. This paper elaborates on these different factors. CONCLUSIONS: Findings show that providing infrastructure does not ensure use when there are significant and culturally engrained behavioural barriers to using latrines. Future sanitation programmes in rural India need to focus on understanding and addressing these behavioural barriers.",BMC public health,2015 Sep 10,England,2015,10
30202193,Community Partnering for Behavioral Health Equity: Public Agency and Community Leaders' Views of its Promise and Challenge.,"Objective: To understand potential for multi-sector partnerships among community-based organizations and publicly funded health systems to implement health improvement strategies that advance health equity. Design: Key stakeholder interviewing during HNI planning and early implementation to elicit perceptions of multi-sector partnerships and innovations required for partnerships to achieve system transformation and health equity. Setting: In 2014, the Los Angeles County (LAC) Board of Supervisors approved the Health Neighborhood Initiative (HNI) that aims to: 1) improve coordination of health services for behavioral health clients across safety-net providers within neighborhoods; and 2) address social determinants of health through community-driven, public agency sponsored partnerships with community-based organizations. Participants: Twenty-five semi-structured interviews with 49 leaders from LAC health systems, community-based organizations; and payers. Results: Leaders perceived partnerships within and beyond health systems as transformative in their potential to: improve access, value, and efficiency; align priorities of safety-net systems and communities; and harness the power of communities to impact health. Leaders identified trust as critical to success in partnerships but named lack of time for relationship-building, limitations in service capacity, and questions about sustainability as barriers to trust-building. Leaders described the need for procedural innovations within health systems that would support equitable partnerships including innovations that would increase transparency and normalize information exchange, share agenda-setting and decision-making power with partners, and institutionalize partnering through training and accountability. Conclusions: Leaders described improving procedural justice in public agencies' relationships with communities as key to effective partnering for health equity.",Ethnicity & disease,2018,United States,2018,10
31967099,The prevalence and predictive factors of somatization and its relationship with anxiety and depression in Iranian population.,"Introduction: Today mental disorders are important concerns of health care system in all countries. Among different mental disorders; depression, anxiety, and somatization are more frequent. This manuscript was conducted to evaluate the frequency of somatization symptoms, its related factors and the correlation between somatization symptoms and anxiety and depression disorders in Iranian population. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran, 2017. Participants were selected from patients who referred to the Clinics of Educational Hospitals using convenience sampling method. The PHQ-15 and HADS questionnaire were used to assess the somatization and depression and anxiety, respectively. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the predictive factors of somatization symptoms. The correlations between each PHQ-15 item score and anxiety and depression score were expressed. Results: The frequency of mild, moderate and severe levels of somatization was 66.3%, 20.5% and 13.1%, respectively. Considering multivariate logistic regression analysis; age was associated with somatic symptoms, significantly. The risk of somatic symptoms was 3.4 times more in Divorced/Widowed participants than single ones (p-value: 0.035). There were significant positive correlations between anxiety and depression scores. Each additional score of anxiety and depression were associated with 1.14 times more likely (p-value: < 0.001) and 1.11 times less likely (p-value: 0.003) of having somatic symptoms, respectively. Conclusion: The burden of somatization, depression and anxiety is high in Iranian population. Psychologists and policy-makers should consider these predictive factors for primary prevention of somatization at the personal and community level, respectively.",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2019 Dec,Italy,2019,10
28146173,Potential effectiveness of strategies to promote oral health in primary health care: comparative study among Brazilian capitals and regions.,"Objective:: To evaluate the potential effectiveness of strategies of Oral Health Promotion (OHP), which are carried out by teams in primary health care (PHC) in Brazilian capitals and regions. Methods:: A sample of 1,848 dentists were interviewed (1,819 valid responses) working in the PHC of 26 capitals and the Federal District. The Effectiveness of the Assessment Tool for the Promotion of Oral Health Strategies was used. It is composed of 23 indicators grouped into three dimensions: oral health, health public policies, and human and social development. The answers were arranged in a Likert scale (1-5), and the final score obtained for each sample unit can range from 23 to 115. Higher score values indicate greater potential for the strategy to promote oral health. Results:: Statistically significant differences were identified among the analyzed geopopulation units considering the study object. The Southeast and South regions had better performance for the OHP strategies in comparison to the other regions of Brazil (p </= 0.01). Conclusions:: The OHP strategies identified in the study were heterogeneous, with better results favoring the Southeast regions, with disadvantages for people living in capitals from the Central-North-Northeast of Brazil. Efforts should be undertaken aiming to qualify the PHC teams, especially for those in disadvantageous regions. Therefore, an alignment of PSB strategies to the principles and values of health promotion is required, addressed to the social health determinants (SHDs) and in order to fight the inequalities in oral health.",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,2016 Oct-Dec,Brazil,2016,10
24642726,"The biological functions, structure and sources of CXCL10 and its outstanding part in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis.","The etiology of several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), has still not been completely clarified. MS is defined as an autoimmune disease with clinical features of a chronic, inflammatory and demyelinating autoimmune disorder which affects the central nervous system. The course of the disease includes phases of remission and relapses which can be exacerbated in both severity and duration. Chemokines, which are a subfamily of the cytokines, act as chemoattractants for a wide variety of cells, including immune cells. CXCL10 is a small protein that is defined as an 'inflammatory' chemokine and binds to CXCR3 to mediate immune responses through the activation and recruitment of leukocytes such as T cells, eosinophils, monocytes and NK cells.

19863752,Birth outcomes and risk factors in adolescent pregnancies: results of a Taiwanese national survey.,"BACKGROUND: This study explores birth outcomes and determinants in adolescent pregnancies, using subjects drawn from the Taiwan Birth Cohort Study (TBCS) from 2005. METHODS: Through completed interviews and surveys with mothers or other family members, differences in birth outcomes and personal, pregnancy and social profiles of mothers were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 533 adolescent mothers (<20 years old) and 9347 adult mothers (20-34 years old) were included in our study. There was a significantly higher incidence of low birthweight (LBW) (<2500 g, 10.2% vs 5.6%) and premature birth (<37 weeks, 14.8% vs 8.6%) in the adolescent group. When adjusted for covariates in the multiple-variable model, youth remained a risk factor for LBW (OR = 1.50, 95%CI 1.09, 2.07) and premature delivery (OR = 1.42, 95%CI 1.07, 1.89). Age, prenatal care and weight gain during pregnancy are important predictors of LBW and premature birth. CONCLUSION: Adolescent pregnancy carries a high-risk of LBW and premature birth. Inadequate prenatal care and weight gain during pregnancy are contributing factors that could be improved through strategies of health education, family support and case management.",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2010 Jun,Australia,2010,10

Community engaged strategies aimed at creating racial equity have generated effective ways to dismantle structural racism-the racialized policies and practices that have shaped economic and social institutions in the United States throughout its history. In crafting the Food & Fitness Initiative, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation made advancing racial equity a top priority. By doing so, it encouraged the community partnerships funded under the initiative to apply theories of expanding equity to real-world situations in order to reduce racial disparities in their neighborhoods. This article reviews the methods that were employed over the course of the initiative to support the partnerships with their efforts. It highlights three key components: (1) being intentional about maintaining a focus on racial equity, (2) concentrating on changing policies and systems, and (3) consistently incorporating meaningful and authentic community engagement into the work. The importance of making the concept of equity concrete and measurable is explored. Furthermore, the article discusses strategies that strengthened the capacity of the partnerships to navigate the policy-making process and to build leadership and shift power to community residents. The article concludes by detailing measures that could guide future efforts to make racial equity a priority and emphasizes that doing so is crucial given the rapid demographic shifts underway across the country.",Health promotion practice,2018 Sep,United States,2018,10
31090675,Determinants of Managerial Preventive Actions in Relation to Common Mental Disorders at Work: A Cross-Sectional Study Among Swedish Managers.,"OBJECTIVE: Manager characteristics (personal, work-, and competence-related) were investigated as determinants of managerial preventive actions (MPAs) in relation to common mental disorders (CMDs) among employees. METHODS: A web survey (n = 2921) among Swedish managers measured diverse managerial characteristics and two types of MPAs: reviewing assignments and work situation (MPA-review); talking about CMDs at the work place (MPA-talk). RESULTS: MPA-review was reported by 50% and MPA-talk by 57% of managers. Characteristics that related to more MPAs were female gender, workplace offering lectures on CMDs, workplace offering stress counseling, being responsible for the work environment, management training on CMDs, and more than 10 years of managerial experience (MPA-talk only). CONCLUSION: Managers who are female, have had training on CMDs, and work for organizations paying attention to CMD prevention initiate MPAs more often.",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,2019 Oct,United States,2019,10
20930254,International obligations through collective rights: Moving from foreign health assistance to global health governance.,"This article analyzes the growing chasm between international power and state responsibility in health rights, proposing an international legal framework for collective rights - rights that can reform international institutions and empower developing states to realize the determinants of health structured by global forces. With longstanding recognition that many developing state governments cannot realize the health of their peoples without international cooperation, scholars have increasingly sought to codify international obligations under the purview of an evolving human right to health, applying this rights-based approach as a foundational framework for reducing global health inequalities through foreign assistance. Yet the inherent limitations of the individual human rights framework stymie the right to health in impacting the global institutions that are most crucial for realizing underlying determinants of health through the strengthening of primary health care systems. Whereas the right to health has been advanced as an individual right to be realized by a state duty-bearer, the authors find that this limited, atomized right has proven insufficient to create accountability for international obligations in global health policy, enabling the deterioration of primary health care systems that lack the ability to address an expanding set of public health claims. For rights scholars to advance disease protection and health promotion through national primary health care systems - creating the international legal obligations necessary to spur development supportive of the public's health - the authors conclude that scholars must look beyond the individual right to health to create collective international legal obligations commensurate with a public health-centered approach to primary health care. Through the development and implementation of these collective health rights, states can address interconnected determinants of health within and across countries, obligating the international community to scale-up primary health care systems in the developing world and thereby reduce public health inequities through global health governance.",Health and human rights,2010 Jun 15,United States,2010,10
19795458,Determinants of delays in treatment initiation in children and adolescents diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma in Canada.,"Minimizing delays that may occur along the cancer care pathway requires an understanding of their determinants. Few studies on childhood cancers have been published on the factors that influence the time it takes for patients to get a first medical consultation (patient delay) and treatment (health care system [HCS] delay) once cancer symptoms have been recognized. Our objective was to assess factors related to disease, patient and HCS on patient and HCS delay for children and adolescents with leukemias and lymphomas in Canada. A prospective cohort study was conducted on subjects enrolled in the Treatment and Outcomes Surveillance program of the Canadian Childhood Cancer Surveillance and Control Program, a national surveillance program. We studied 963 leukemia and 397 lymphoma patients who were less than 19-years old at diagnosis in 1995-2000. Logistic regression models were used to measure the associations between candidate predictive factors and delays. Age was positively associated with patient delay for both leukemia and lymphoma patients, but not with HCS delay. Patients first seen in a hospital emergency room had a lower risk of HCS delay than patients first seen by a general practitioner. Cancer subtype was associated with patient delay for leukemia patients, and HCS delay for lymphoma patients. Longer patient delay was associated with a lower risk of long HCS delay for both cancers. Factors related to the patients, their disease and the HCS may exert different influences on varying segments of the care pathway of leukemia and lymphoma patients.",International journal of cancer,2010 Apr 15,United States,2010,10
29507598,Undetected psychiatric morbidity among HIV/AIDS patients attending Comprehensive Care Clinic (CCC) in Nairobi Kenya: towards an integrated mental health care.,"Background: Psychiatric morbidity is commonly associated with HIV disease and may have adverse effects. This aspect may be overlooked at comprehensive HIV care centers in Low and Middle-Income Countries. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of undetected psychiatric morbidity among HIV/AIDS adult patients attending Comprehensive Care Centre in a semi-urban clinic, in Nairobi, Kenya. Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study of adult HIV patients not receiving any psychiatric treatment was conducted. Participants/methods: The participants consisted of consecutive sample of adults (n = 245) attending HIV Comprehensive Care Clinic at Kangemi Health Centre, Nairobi. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was administered to screen for undetected psychiatric morbidity. Socio-demographic characteristics were recorded in a questionnaire. Sample descriptive analysis was performed and prevalence of undetected psychiatric morbidity calculated. Chi-square test for independence was used to examine the associations between patient characteristics and undetected morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of undetected psychiatric morbidity. Results: The mean age of our participants was 37.3 years (SD 9.2) Three-quarters (75.9%) of participants were females and median duration of HIV illness was 5 years. The prevalence of (previously undetected) psychiatric morbidity was 71.4% (95% CI 65.3-77). The leading psychiatric disorders were MDD (32.2%), PTSD (18.4%), Dysthymia (17.6%), and OCD (17.6%). Overall psychiatric morbidity was associated with low income (<USD 30), p = 0.035. MDD was associated with older age and female gender. There were no statistically significant associations between overall psychiatric morbidity and social determinants such as gender, marital status, level of education, religious affiliation, and occupation or employment status. Conclusion: The burden of psychiatric morbidity in Kenyan HIV patients remains high and is most significantly associated with lower socioeconomic status. There is need to provide holistic care including screening for mental well-being all through the treatment of HIV patients in low-income settings.",Annals of general psychiatry,2018,England,2018,10
27018728,"A preliminary experimental examination of worldview verification, perceived racism, and stress reactivity in African Americans.","OBJECTIVE: According to worldview verification theory, inconsistencies between lived experiences and worldviews are psychologically threatening. These inconsistencies may be key determinants of stress processes that influence cardiovascular health disparities. This preliminary examination considers how experiencing injustice can affect perceived racism and biological stress reactivity among African Americans. Guided by worldview verification theory, it was hypothesized that responses to receiving an unfair outcome would be moderated by fairness of the accompanying decision process, and that this effect would further depend on the consistency of the decision process with preexisting justice beliefs. METHOD: A sample of 118 healthy African American adults completed baseline measures of justice beliefs, followed by a laboratory-based social-evaluative stressor task. Two randomized fairness manipulations were implemented during the task: participants were given either high or low levels of distributive (outcome) and procedural (decision process) justice. Glucocorticoid (cortisol) and inflammatory (C-reactive protein) biological responses were measured in oral fluids, and attributions of racism were also measured. RESULTS: The hypothesized 3-way interaction was generally obtained. Among African Americans with a strong belief in justice, perceived racism, cortisol, and C-reactive protein responses to low distributive justice were higher when procedural justice was low. Among African Americans with a weak belief in justice however, these responses were higher when a low level of distributive justice was coupled with high procedural justice. CONCLUSIONS: Biological and psychological processes that contribute to cardiovascular health disparities are affected by consistency between individual-level and contextual justice factors.

26544091,Parental and Child Characteristics Related to Early-Onset Disordered Eating: A Systematic Review.,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to: Evaluate the evidence regarding parental and child characteristics related to early-onset disordered eating. ABSTRACT: Eating disorders are rare in children, but disordered eating is common. Understanding the phenomenology of disordered eating in childhood can aid prevention of full-blown eating disorders. The purpose of this review is to systematically extract and synthesize the evidence on parental and child characteristics related to early-onset disordered eating. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMED/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo using the following search terms: eating disorder, disordered eating, problem eating, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating, child, preadolescent, and early onset. Studies published from 1990 to 2013 addressing parental and child characteristics of disordered eating in children aged 6 to 12 years were eligible for inclusion. The search was restricted to studies with cross-sectional, case-control, or longitudinal designs, studies in English, and with abstracts available. Forty-four studies fit these criteria. Most studies were based on community samples with a cross-sectional design. The included studies varied considerably in size, instruments used to assess early-onset disordered eating, and parental and child characteristics investigated. Important determinants included the following: higher body weight, previously reported disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, depression, parental disordered eating, and parental comments/concerns about child's weight and eating. The findings were inconsistent for sex, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, self-esteem/worth, and parental body weight. In conclusion, characteristics related to early-onset disordered eating have mainly been explored with a cross-sectional design. Full understanding of causal pathways will require good-quality longitudinal studies designed to address the influence of parental eating behaviors, mental and physical health, family interactions, and child growth patterns.",Harvard review of psychiatry,2015 Nov-Dec,United States,2015,10
31291916,Testing the psychometric properties of the illness perceptions questionnaire for OCD (IPQ-O).,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that our perceptions about illness are important determinants of how we respond and adjust to health threats. To examine whether illness perceptions affect illness responses in OCD (e.g. help-seeking), this study aimed to develop and test the psychometric properties of a new OCD-specific tool to assess illness perceptions, the illness perceptions questionnaire for OCD (IPQ-O). METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based design was used. Following adaptation of the IPQ-R based on qualitative interviews with people with OCD, adults (age >/= 16) with OCD completed the IPQ-O (online or postal), alongside measures of depression, anxiety, OCD severity, attitudes to seeking mental health services and behaviours (e.g. treatment seeking intentions). A sub-sample re-completed the IPQ-O after two-weeks to obtain test-retest reliability. Factor analysis was used to derive the IPQ-O factor structure; internal consistency of subscales was calculated. Convergent validity was explored. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-eight people with OCD completed the IPQ-O. After factor analysis, seven main sub-scales and four cause sub-scales were identified, explaining 45.5 and 41.6% of the variance after extraction and rotation respectively. Three sub-scales from the original IPQ-R were validated; other dimensions differed from original IPQ-R sub-scales. The new 'spectrum' sub-scale measures the strength of the view that OCD is a trait that presents to varying extents within the general population. The IPQ-O demonstrated internal consistency, test re-test reliability (Kendall's tau = .51-.75) and convergent validity. Illness perceptions were associated with important aspects of adjustment (depression, anxiety) and condition management (receipt of treatment, plans to seek help). In particular, emerging data showed that those who had not received medication for OCD endorsed stronger spectrum beliefs. Though longitudinal study is needed to verify the direction of this association, this raises the question of whether spectrum beliefs deter people with OCD from using pharmacological treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The IPQ-O provides a valuable tool for subsequent testing of whether illness perceptions drive outcomes as proposed by the CSM. If perceptions are found to drive adjustment and behaviour, therapists could elicit and subsequently challenge perceptions that have negative effects on adjustment and coping, as part of psychological therapy.",BMC psychiatry,2019 Jul 10,England,2019,10
27143540,Social inequalities and access to health: challenges for society and the nursing field.,"OBJECTIVE: to present a critical reflection upon the current and different interpretative models of the Social Determinants of Health and inequalities hindering access and the right to health. METHOD: theoretical study using critical hermeneutics to acquire reconstructive understanding based on a dialectical relationship between the explanation and understanding of interpretative models of the social determinants of health and inequalities. RESULTS: interpretative models concerning the topic under study are classified. Three generations of interpretative models of the social determinants of health were identified and historically contextualized. The third and current generation presents a historical synthesis of the previous generations, including: neo-materialist theory, psychosocial theory, the theory of social capital, cultural-behavioral theory and the life course theory. CONCLUSION: From dialectical reflection and social criticism emerge a discussion concerning the complementarity of the models of the social determinants of health and the need for a more comprehensive conception of the determinants to guide inter-sector actions to eradicate inequalities that hinder access to health.",Revista latino-americana de enfermagem,2016,Brazil,2016,10
28372583,Exposure to bacterial products lipopolysaccharide and flagellin and hepatocellular carcinoma: a nested case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: Leakage of bacterial products across the gut barrier may play a role in liver diseases which often precede the development of liver cancer. However, human studies, particularly from prospective settings, are lacking. METHODS: We used a case-control study design nested within a large prospective cohort to assess the association between circulating levels of anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and anti-flagellin immunoglobulin A (IgA) and G (IgG) (reflecting long-term exposures to LPS and flagellin, respectively) and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of 139 men and women diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma between 1992 and 2010 were matched to 139 control subjects. Multivariable rate ratios (RRs), including adjustment for potential confounders, hepatitis B/C positivity, and degree of liver dysfunction, were calculated with conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Antibody response to LPS and flagellin was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (highest vs. lowest quartile: RR = 11.76, 95% confidence interval = 1.70-81.40; P trend = 0.021). This finding did not vary substantially by time from enrollment to diagnosis, and did not change after adjustment for chronic infection with hepatitis B and C viruses. CONCLUSIONS: These novel findings, based on exposures up to several years prior to diagnosis, support a role for gut-derived bacterial products in hepatocellular carcinoma development. Further study into the role of gut barrier failure and exposure to bacterial products in liver diseases is warranted.",BMC medicine,2017 Apr 4,England,2017,10
30836713,Perception of the Effectiveness of Health-related Campaigns among the Adult Population: An Analysis of Determinants.,"BACKGROUND: Social campaigns focusing on health are commonly used within an attempt to change behavior. To date, there has not been a targeted analysis of societies' general perception about social campaigns. The aim of this study is to assess citizens' opinions on the effectiveness of health-related social campaigns. METHODS: The data set used in the analysis was obtained from Poland's nationwide ""Social Diagnosis"" study. The determinants of public opinion were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression. The independent variables included socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, social participation, and the use of digital media. RESULTS: The logistic regression model was developed using 23,593 cases. Opinions about the effectiveness of campaigns depended on all the predictors included in the socio-demographic cluster, smoking, self-declared excessive alcohol consumption, physical activity, the use of mobile phones, and watching TV. A significant impact was found in all but one variable related to social participation. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis revealed that opinions about social campaigns present in the media ""landscape"" are influenced by many factors. Interestingly, persons exhibiting unhealthy behaviors are more resistant to health-related campaigns and surprisingly the need to make use of healthcare resources is not accompanied by an acceptance of the interventions.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 Mar 4,Switzerland,2019,10
24559606,Correlates of drug use cessation among participants in the Canadian HIV-HCV Co-infection Cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Ongoing drug use remains a barrier to HIV and HCV treatment. We examined the occurrence and correlates of drug use cessation among HIV-HCV co-infected drug users participating in HIV care. METHODS: Participants from the Canadian Co-infection Cohort reporting drug use (injecting drugs and/or smoking crack) with at least two follow-up visits were included (n=521 (43%), 1832 visits). Socio-demographics, behavioural, and health information were collected at each six-month visit. Associations with cessation (no drug use since last visit) were examined using non-linear mixed effects logistic regression models with random intercepts. RESULTS: During follow-up, 361 (69%) participants ceased using drugs. Having a fixed address (aOR [adjusted odds ratio] 1.73, CI [95% confidence interval] 1.02-2.96) and smoking crack without injecting drugs (aOR 3.10, CI 2.05-4.71) were positively associated. Living alone (aOR 0.47, CI 0.35-0.63), current tobacco use (aOR 0.41, CI 0.26-0.64), hazardous alcohol drinking (aOR 0.67, CI 0.49-0.91), snorting drugs (aOR 0.52, CI 0.37-0.74), having a greater exposure to addiction programmes (aOR 0.88, CI 0.81-0.94), having been recruited in Quebec or Nova Scotia (aOR 0.41, CI 0.25-0.66), and British Columbia or Alberta (aOR 0.51, CI 0.32-0.82) were negatively associated. Various socio-demographic (age, education) and health-related (HIV duration, care adherence) factors were not associated. CONCLUSION: Drug use cessation among HIV-HCV co-infected persons is relatively common in this cohort. Stable housing and supportive living situations seem to be important facilitators for drug use cessation in this population. Greater efforts should be made to retain patients in addiction treatment programmes.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2014 Apr 1,Ireland,2014,10
31322434,Determinants of exercise behaviour in persons with Parkinson's disease.,"Background: Exercise shows promise for improving physical and cognitive functioning, quality of life, and mood in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Structured interviews have suggested potential factors influencing participation in exercise in this population, but no studies have examined if they predict exercise behaviour. Methods: Thirty persons with PD completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. Time spent exercising was calculated by summing responses for recreation, sport, and leisure-time physical activity. Predictors of exercise were assessed via interview. In addition, participants were asked about what types of exercise they engaged in and what types of exercise they would be interested in trying. Regression analyses were used to identify the factors that predicted time spent exercising, as well as determining factors in low vs. high exercisers (>/=150 min per week). Results: Positive predictors of exercise were being male (beta= -0.52, p = 0.01; chi(2) = 4.84, p = 0.03), married (beta = 0.32, p = 0.03; chi(2) = 5.60, p = 0.02), and enjoyment of exercise (beta = 0.36, p = 0.02). Fear of falling (beta = -0.41, p = 0.01; chi(2 )= 4.29, p = 0.04), negative perception of health (beta = -0.41, p = 0.02), perception of PD symptoms (chi(2) = 12.45, p < 0.001), bad weather (chi(2) = 5.06, p = 0.02), and lack of an exercise partner (chi(2) = 13.39, p < 0.001) were negative predictors of exercise. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that exercise programmes should work to make activities enjoyable, safe, and adaptable to the abilities of the individual. Programmes should also include social engagement. Implications for rehabilitation Parkinson's exercise programmes should be enjoyable. Parkinson's exercise programmes should include both social engagement and social support. Parkinson's exercise programmes should be safe and adaptable to the abilities of the participants. Parkinson's exercise programmes should aim to improve balance and reduce fear of falling. Individual exercise programmes can also be successful, many people with PD exercise alone with the most common form being walking.",Disability and rehabilitation,2019 Jul 19,England,2019,10
27326415,Vaginal progesterone on the prevention of preterm birth and neonatal complications in high risk women: A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study.,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prophylactic vaginal progesterone on decreasing preterm birth rate and neonatal complications in a high-risk population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed on 100 high-risk singleton pregnancies. Vaginal suppository progesterone (400 mg) or placebo was administered daily between 16-22 wks to 36 wks of gestation. Progesterone (n=50) and placebo (n=50) groups were compared for incidence of preterm delivery and neonatal complications. RESULTS: The preterm birth rate was 52%. Preterm birth rate before the 37 wks of gestation (68% vs. 36%: RR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.25-2.86) and also before the 34 wks of gestation (42% vs. 18%: RR=2.33, 95% CI: 1.19-4.58) in placebo group was significantly higher than progesterone group. Our study also showed that the administration of vaginal progesterone was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of birth weight </=2500 gr, the rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in the progesterone group when compared with the placebo group. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of neonatal death, days of admission in NICU, intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic vaginal progesterone reduced the rate of preterm delivery, the risk of a birth weight </=2500 gr, the rates of RDS and admission to NICU in women who were at risk of preterm delivery.","International journal of reproductive biomedicine (Yazd, Iran)",2016 May,Iran,2016,10

This study aimed to determine correlation of Gerkin, Queen's College, George, and Jackson methods in estimating maximal oxygen consumption, and demographic factors affecting maximal oxygen consumption. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in a census of medical emergency students (n=57) in Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in 2016. The subjects firstly completed the General Health Questionnaire (PAR-Q) and demographic characteristics. Then eligible subjects were assessed using exercise tests of Gerkin treadmill, Queen's College steps and non-exercise George, and Jackson. Data analysis was carried out using independent t-test, one way analysis of variance and Pearson correlation in the SPSS software. Results: The mean age of participants was 21.69+/-4.99 years. The mean of maximal oxygen consumption using Gerkin, Queen's College, George, and Jackson tests was 4.17, 3.36, 3.64, 3.63 liters per minute, respectively. Pearson statistical test showed a significant correlation among fours tests. George and Jackson tests had the greatest correlation (r=0.85, p>0.001). Results of tests of one-way analysis of variance and t-test showed a significant relationship between independent variable of weight and height in four tests, and dependent variable of maximal oxygen consumption. Also, there was a significant relationship between variable of body mass index in two tests of Gerkin and Queen's College and variable of exercise hours per week with the George and Jackson tests (p>0.001). Conclusion: Given the obtained correlation, these tests have the potential to replace each other as necessary, so that the non-exercise Jackson test can be used instead of the Gerkin test.",Electronic physician,2017 Oct,Iran,2017,10
24599006,Examining parents' assessments of objective and subjective social status in families of children with cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Understanding the social determinants of child health is a prominent area of research. This paper examines the measurement of socioeconomic position in a sample of families of children with cancer. Socioeconomic position is difficult to measure in pediatric health research due to sensitivity of asking about finances when research is conducted in health care delivery settings, financial volatility associated with periods of pediatric illness, and difficulty recruiting fathers to research. METHODS: Caregivers of children with cancer (n=76) completed a questionnaire that included the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (SSS). SSS was measured using two 10-rung ladders with differing referent groups: the US and respondents' communities. Respondents placed themselves on each ladder by placing an X on the rung that represented their social position in relation to the two referent groups. Individuals' SSS ratings and discrepancies in SSS ratings within couples were examined, and associations with objective social status measures were evaluated using Pearson correlations or t-tests. RESULTS: Parents' placement on the US and community ladders was positively associated with their income, education, wealth, household savings, and household savings minus debt. On average, respondents placed themselves higher on the US ladder compared to the community ladder. There was an average intra-couple discrepancy of 1.25 rungs in partner's placements on the US ladder and a 1.56 rung difference for the community ladder. This intra-couple discrepancy was not associated with gender. DISCUSSION: Results offer insight into the use of subjective social status measures to capture a more holistic assessment of socioeconomic position and the measurement of socioeconomic position in two-parent families.",PloS one,2014,United States,2014,10
28440783,Social vulnerability and hypoglycemia among patients with diabetes.,"Lower-income populations are hit harder by the diabetes epidemic as regards both prevalence and the risk of complications. Food Insecurity is one of the mechanisms through which poverty may predispose people with low socio-economic status to poorer control and higher complication rates. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization defined food security as ""the right to have access to sufficient nutritional and culturally acceptable food choices."" Adults suffering from diabetes with limited income have a 40% greater chance of having food insecurity and an inadequate blood glucose control. Such patients have a two-fold greater risk of developing severe hypoglycemia. In addition, several studies have shown that social vulnerability resulting from food insecurity, low socioeconomic status, low educational levels, and poor health education is an independent risk factor for hypoglycemia, even after conventional predictors are controlled. This review analyzes the literature available on social vulnerability as a non-conventional risk factor for development of hypoglycemia in diabetic subjects.","Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2017 Feb,Spain,2017,10

Tooth loss may lead to mastication disability, which in turn has important impact on individual's quality of life. Social and psychological factors have been shown to be associated with tooth loss. This study aimed to investigate the social determinants and prevalence of tooth loss, and presence of functional dentition among female heads of household under support of Welfare Organization in Mashhad, Iran. Materials and methods. In current study 556 participants aged 16-76 years were recruited. Sociodemographic characteristics (age, level of education, family size, and monthly income) were collected using interviewer-led questionnaire. Data about number of teeth and functional dentition were obtained by oral examination. The data were analyzed using Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, T-test and binary logistic regression analysis. Results. Four percent of participants were edentulous. Tooth loss was significantly associated with level of education, age and family size (P < 0.001). There was no significant association between level of income and tooth loss (P = 0.88). Only 37.5% of dentate subjects had functional dentition (anterior and premolar teeth). Women older than 40 years were 0.63 times less likely to have functional dentition than those younger than 40 years. Females with at least a high-school diploma were six times more likely to have functional dentition than their illiterate counterparts. Conclusion. Social determinants of functional dentition should be taken into account when planning oral health promoting programs for female heads of household.

This total population study examines fatal drowning among children under five in portable pools in Australia. METHODS: All child drowning deaths in portable pools for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2018 were identified. A portable pool was defined as any structure used for swimming and wading which, when emptied, can be moved. RESULTS: Twenty-three children (aged 0-17 years) drowned in portable pools. The drowning rate for children less than 5 years of age was 0.09 per 100 000 population. The peak age of death was 12-23 months (RR = 2.99; CI: 1.09-8.23), with the majority (n = 20 deaths) aged 16-31 months. Ninety per cent followed a fall into water. None were supervised. Children commonly resided in areas classified as socially and economically disadvantaged (85%; n = 17). Drowning rates in very remote areas were 15 times greater (RR = 15.41; CI: 0.03-7579.65) than city children. Eleven (55%) drowning deaths occurred in pools with a depth >300 mm, of which 10 (91%) were known to be unfenced. CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants impact child drowning in portables pools, which can occur quickly and in just 150 mm of water. Active supervision and a regulation-compliant barrier are effective prevention stratagems, factors which were absent from the deaths in this study. SO WHAT?: Portable pool drowning disproportionately impacts those aged 16-31 months who reside in very remote areas and areas classified as having high socio-economic disadvantage. Education for these groups on fencing and supervision of children must be provided.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2019 Aug 1,Australia,2019,10
27101890,Screening for Social Determinants of Health Among Children and Families Living in Poverty: A Guide for Clinicians.,"Approximately 20% of all children in the United States live in poverty, which exists in rural, urban, and suburban areas. Thus, all child health clinicians need to be familiar with the effects of poverty on health and to understand associated, preventable, and modifiable social factors that impact health. Social determinants of health are identifiable root causes of medical problems. For children living in poverty, social determinants of health for which clinicians may play a role include the following: child maltreatment, child care and education, family financial support, physical environment, family social support, intimate partner violence, maternal depression and family mental illness, household substance abuse, firearm exposure, and parental health literacy. Children, particularly those living in poverty, exposed to adverse childhood experiences are susceptible to toxic stress and a variety of child and adult health problems, including developmental delay, asthma and heart disease. Despite the detrimental effects of social determinants on health, few child health clinicians routinely address the unmet social and psychosocial factors impacting children and their families during routine primary care visits. Clinicians need tools to screen for social determinants of health and to be familiar with available local and national resources to address these issues. These guidelines provide an overview of social determinants of health impacting children living in poverty and provide clinicians with practical screening tools and resources.",Current problems in pediatric and adolescent health care,2016 May,United States,2016,10
27466983,"Visual Function, Social Position, and Health and Life Chances: The UK Biobank Study.","IMPORTANCE: The adverse impact of visual impairment and blindness and correlations with socioeconomic position are known. Understanding of the effect of the substantially more common near-normal vision (mild impairment) and associations with social position as well as health and life chances is limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of visual health (across the full acuity spectrum) with social determinants of general health and the association between visual health and health and social outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional epidemiologic study was conducted using UK Biobank data from 6 regional centers in England and Wales. A total of 112314 volunteers (aged 40-73 years) were assessed in June 2009 and July 2010. Data analysis was performed from May 20, 2013, to November 19, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Habitual (correction if prescribed) distance visual acuity was used to assign participants to 1 of 8 categories from bilateral normal visual acuity (logMAR, 0.2 or better; Snellen equivalent, 6/9.5 or better) to visual impairment or blindness (logMAR, 0.5 or worse; Snellen equivalent, 6/19 or worse) using World Health Organization and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision taxonomy. Relationships between vision, key social determinants and health and social outcomes (including the main factors that define an individual's life-the social, economic, educational, and employment opportunities and outcomes experienced by individuals during their life course) were examined using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Of the of 112314 participants, 61169 were female (54.5%); mean (SD) age was 56.8 (8.1) years. A total of 759 (0.7%) of the participants had visual impairment or blindness, and an additional 25678 (22.9%) had reduced vision in 1 or both eyes. Key markers of social position were independently associated with vision in a gradient across acuity categories; in a gradient of increasing severity, all-cause impaired visual function was associated with adverse social outcomes and impaired general and mental health. These factors, including having no educational qualifications (risk ratio [RR], 1.86 [95% CI, 1.69-2.04]), having a higher deprivation score (RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.07-1.09]), and being in a minority ethnic group (eg, Asian) (RR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.83-2.30]), were independently associated with being in the midrange vision category (at legal threshold for driving). This level of vision was associated with an increased risk of being unemployed (RR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.31-1.84]), having a lower-status job (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.09-1.41]), living alone (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10-1.39]), and having mental health problems (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04-1.20]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Impaired vision in adults is common, and even near-normal vision, potentially unrecognized without assessment, has a tangible influence on quality of life. Because inequalities in visual health by social position mirror other health domains, inclusion of vision in generic initiatives addressing health inequalities could address the existing significant burden of underrecognized and/or latent visual disability. Longitudinal investigations are needed to elucidate pathophysiologic pathways and target modifiable mechanisms.",JAMA ophthalmology,2016 Sep 1,United States,2016,10
30518344,Determinants of the willingness to participate in biobanking among Malaysian stakeholders in the Klang Valley.,"BACKGROUND: The demand in biobanking for the collection and maintenance of biological specimens and personal data from civilians to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases has increased notably. Despite the advancement, certain issues, specifically those related to privacy and data protection, have been critically discussed. The purposes of this study are to assess the willingness of stakeholders to participate in biobanking and to determine its predictors. METHODS: A survey of 469 respondents from various stakeholder groups in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia was carried out. Based on previous research, a multi-dimensional instrument measuring willingness to participate in biobanking, and its predictors, was constructed and validated. A single step Structural Equation Modelling was performed to analyse the measurements and structural model using the International Business Machines Corporation Software Package for Social Sciences, Analysis of Moment Structures (IBM SPSS Amos) version 20 with a maximum likelihood function. RESULTS: Malaysian stakeholders in the Klang Valley were found to be cautious of biobanks. Although they perceived the biobanks as moderately beneficial (mean score of 4.65) and were moderately willing to participate in biobanking (mean score of 4.10), they professed moderate concern about data and specimen protection issues (mean score of 4.33). Willingness to participate in biobanking was predominantly determined by four direct predictors: specific application-linked perceptions of their benefits (beta = 0.35, p < 0.001), issues of data and specimen protection (beta = - 0.31, p < 0.001) and religious acceptance (beta = 0.15, p < 0.05) and trust in key players (beta = 0.20, p < 0.001). The stakeholders' willingness to participate in biobanking also involves the intricate relationships between the above-mentioned factors and other predictors, such as attitudes regarding technology, religiosity and engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study reaffirmed that stakeholders' willingness to participate in biobanking is a complex phenomenon that should be viewed from a multidimensional perspective. Stakeholder willingness to participate in biobanking is warranted when direct predictors (benefits, issues of data and specimen protection, religious acceptance, and trust in key players) as well as indirect factors are well accounted for.",BMC medical research methodology,2018 Dec 5,England,2018,10
25303845,"Social protection and tuberculosis control in 21 European countries, 1995-2012: a cross-national statistical modelling analysis.","BACKGROUND: WHO stresses the need to act on the social determinants of tuberculosis. We tested whether alternative social protection programmes have affected tuberculosis case notifications, prevalence, and mortality, and case detection and treatment success rates in 21 European countries from 1995 to 2012. METHODS: We obtained tuberculosis case notification data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's 2014 European Surveillance System database. We also obtained data for case detection, treatment success, prevalence, and mortality rates from WHO's 2014 tuberculosis database. We extracted data for 21 countries between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2012. Social protection data were from EuroStat, 2014 edition. We used multivariate cross-national statistical models to quantify the association of differing types of social protection programmes with tuberculosis outcomes. All analyses were prespecified. FINDINGS: After we controlled for economic output, public health spending, and country fixed effects, each US$100 increase in social protection spending was associated with a decrease per 100,000 population in the number of tuberculosis case notifications of -1.53% (95% CI -0.28 to -2.79; p=0.0191), estimated incidence rates of -1.70% (-0.30 to -3.11; p=0.0201), non-HIV-related tuberculosis mortality rate of -2.74% (-0.66 to -4.82; p=0.0125), and all-cause tuberculosis mortality rate of -3.08% (-0.73 to -5.43; p=0.0127). We noted no relation between increased social spending and tuberculosis prevalence (-1.50% [-3.10 to 0.10] per increase of $100; p=0.0639) or smear-positive treatment success rates (-0.079% [-0.18 to 0.34] per increase of $100; p=0.5235) or case detection (-0.59% [-1.31 to 0.14] per increase of $100; p=0.1066). Old age pension expenditure seemed to have the strongest association with reductions in tuberculosis case notification rates for those aged 65 years or older (-3.87% [-0.95 to -6.78]; p=0.0137). INTERPRETATION: Investment in social protection programmes are likely to provide an effective complement to tuberculosis prevention and treatment programmes, especially for vulnerable groups.

23981078,Effect of social networks and well-being on acute care needs.,"The effect of social surroundings has been noted as an important component of the well-being of elderly people. A strong social network and strong and steady relationships are necessary for coping when illness or functional limitations occur in later life. Vulnerability can affect well-being and functioning particularly when sudden life changes occur. The objective of this study was to analyse how the determinants of social well-being affect individual acute care needs when sudden life changes occur. Empirical evidence was collected using a cross-sectional mail survey in Finland in January 2011 among individuals aged 55-79 years. The age-stratified random sample covered 3000 individuals, and the eventual response rate was 56% (1680). Complete responses were received from 1282 respondents (42.7%). The study focuses on the compactness of social networks, social disability, the stability of social relationships and the fear of loneliness as well as how these factors influence acute care needs. The measurement was based on a latent factor structure, and the key concepts were measured using two ordinal items. The results of the structural model suggest that the need for care is directly affected by social disability and the fear of loneliness. In addition, social disability is a determinant of the fear of loneliness and therefore plays an important role if sudden life changes occur. The compactness of social networks decreases social disability and partly diminishes the fear of loneliness and therefore has an indirect effect on the need for care. The stability of social relationships was influenced by the social networks and disability, but was an insignificant predictor of care needs. To conclude, social networks and well-being can decrease care needs, and supportive actions should be targeted to avoid loneliness and social isolation so that the informal network could be applied as an aspect of care-giving when acute life changes occur.",Health & social care in the community,2014 Jan,England,2014,10
24189794,Strategies for public health research in European Union countries.,"INTRODUCTION: 'Health' is an identifiable theme within the European Union multi-annual research programmes. Public Health Innovation and Research in Europe (PHIRE), led by the European Public Health Association, sought to identify public health research strategies in EU member states. METHODS: Within PHIRE, national public health associations reviewed structures for health research, held stakeholder workshops and produced reports. This information, supplemented by further web searches, including using assisted translation, was analysed for national research strategies and health research strategies. RESULTS: All countries described general research strategies, outlining organizational and capacity objectives. Thematic fields, including health, are mentioned in some strategies. A health research strategy was identified for 15 EU countries and not for 12. Ministries of health led research strategies for nine countries. Public health research was identified in only three strategies. National research strategies did not refer to the European Union's health research programme. CONCLUSIONS: Public health research strategies of European countries need to be developed by ministries of health, working with the research community to achieve the European Research Area.",European journal of public health,2013 Nov,England,2013,10
29973669,Cold weather increases respiratory symptoms and functional disability especially among patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.,"Cold weather affects the respiratory epithelium and induces bronchial hyperresponsiveness. We hypothesized that individuals with allergic rhinitis or/and asthma experience cold weather-related functional disability (FD) and exacerbation of health problems (EH) more commonly than individuals without these. This was a population-based study of 7330 adults aged 25-74 years. The determinants of interest, including doctor-diagnosed asthma and allergic rhinitis, and the outcomes, including cold weather-related FD and EH, were measured using a self-administered questionnaire. The prevalences of cold-related FD and EH were 20.3% and 10.3%, respectively. In Poisson regression, the risk of FD increased in relation to both allergic rhinitis (adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.37 among men; 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.46 among women), asthma (1.29, 0.93-1.80; 1.36, 0.92-2.02, respectively) and their combination (1.16, 0.90-1.50; 1.40, 1.12-1.76, respectively). Also the risk of cold weather-related EH was related to both allergic rhinitis (1.53, 1.15,-2.04 among men; 1.78, 1.43-2.21 among women), asthma (4.28, 2.88-6.36; 3.77, 2.67-5.34, respectively) and their combination (4.02, 2.89-5.59; 4.60, 3.69-5.73, respectively). We provide new evidence that subjects with allergic rhinitis or/and asthma are more susceptible to cold weather-related FD and EH than those without pre-existing respiratory diseases.",Scientific reports,2018 Jul 4,England,2018,10

The aim here was to measure health-related QoL and its determinants among patients with beta-TM, using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional study at the Hematology Research Center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, in southern Iran. METHODS One hundred and one patients with beta-TM were randomly selected. After the participants' demographics and disease characteristics had been recorded, they were asked to fill out the SF-36 questionnaire. The correlations of clinical and demographic factors with the QoL score were evaluated. RESULTS There were 44 men and 57 women of mean age 19.52 +/- 4.3 years (range 12-38). On two scales, pain (P = 0.041) and emotional role (P = 0.009), the women showed significantly lower scores than the men. Lower income, poor compliance with iron-chelating therapy and presence of comorbidities were significantly correlated with lower SF-36 scores. These factors were also found to be determinants of worse SF-36 scores in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS We showed that the presence of disease complications, poor compliance with iron-chelating therapy and poor economic status were predictors of worse QoL among patients with beta-TM. Prevention and proper management of disease-related complications, increased knowledge among patients regarding the importance of managing comorbidities and greater compliance with iron-chelating therapy, along with psychosocial and financial support, could help these patients to cope better with this chronic disease state.",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,2013,Brazil,2013,10
28682221,"Factors related to unwanted pregnancies and abortion in the northern district of the city of Tehran, Iran.","The aim of this study was to investigate the levels and determinants of unwanted pregnancies and therapeutic and elective induced abortions in an Iranian sample of women. This study was conducted from the beginning of 2013 to the end of July 2013, using data from 950 women aged 15-45 years. To evaluate the relationship of independent variables to the number of unwanted pregnancies, a negative binomial regression model was used. A multinomial logistic model was used to investigate the relationship of the history of at least one unwanted pregnancy to therapeutic and elective induced abortion. The prevalence of unwanted pregnancy among participants was 19.2 percent (n = 182). Among those with a history of unwanted pregnancy, eighteen had had at least one induced abortion (14.5 percent of the total abortions reported). Having enough knowledge about the intrauterine device during unprotected intercourse on average was associated with a 57 percent reduction in unwanted pregnancies (mean odds ratio = 0.43, 95 percent Confidence Interval (CI): 0.11-0.93). Given the high rates of complications following unwanted pregnancies and associated maternal health threats, timely identification and training of women at risk, as well as the development of appropriate attitudes regarding reproductive health, may help avoid such pregnancies and their complications.",Women & health,2018 Jul,United States,2018,10

28211559,Behavioral genetics in Polish print news media between 2000 and 2014.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to describe how Polish print news media frame relations between genetics and human behaviors and what images of behavioral genetics dominate in press discourse. METHODS: A content and frame analysis of 72 print news articles about behavioral genetics published between 2000 and 2014 in four major Polish weekly magazines: ""Polityka"", ""Wprost"", ""Newsweek"" and ""Przekroj"" was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty one different behaviors were mentioned in the sample and six major analytic frames were identified: essentialist, materialistic, deterministic, probabilistic, optimistic and pessimistic. The most common was the tendency to describe human behaviors in terms of genetic essentialism, reductionism and determinism, as almost one half of the articles was focused solely on genetic determinants of human behaviors and lacked any reference to polygenetic and/or environmental conditioning. Although most of the articles were balanced in tone, benefits were stressed more often than potential risks. Stories that confirmed existence of genetic determinants of human behavior were favored over those that did not. One third of the articles stressed the social or ethical consequences of the development of behavioral genetics. CONCLUSIONS: The complex and abstract character of genetic knowledge results in a simplistic portrayal of behavioral genetics in the press, which may lead to a misunderstood interpretation of the complicated interplay between behavior, genetics and environment by the public. Consequently, print news media contribute to geneticization of behaviors. It is important to improve the quality of science reporting on behavioral genetics and to educate researchers how to communicate with the media more effectively.",Psychiatria polska,2016 Dec 23,Poland,2016,10
26762646,Validation and comparison study of three urbanicity scales in a Thailand context.,"BACKGROUND: Validity and reliability of an urbanicity scale is of utmost importance in developing effective strategies to minimize adverse social and health consequences of increased urbanization. A number of urbanicity scales for the quantitative assessment of the ""static"" feature of an urban environment has been invented and validated by the original developers. However, their comparability and robustness when utilized in another study context were not verified. This study aimed to examine the comparability, validity, and reliability of three urbanicity scales proposed by Dahly and Adair, Jones-Smith and Popkin, and Novak et al. in a Thailand context. METHODS: Urban characteristics data for 537 communities throughout Thailand were obtained from authoritative sources, and urbinicity scores were calculated according to the original developers' algorithms with some modifications to accommodate local available data. Comparability, dimensionality, internal consistency, and criterion-related and construct validities of the scores were then determined. RESULTS: All three scales were highly correlated, but Dahly and Adair's and Jones-Smith and Popkin's were more comparable. Only Dahly and Adair's scale achieved the unidimensionality assumption. Internal consistency ranged from very poor to high, based on their Chonbach's alpha and the corrected item-scale correlation coefficients. All three scales had good criterion-related validity (when compared against the official urban-rural dichotomy and four-category urbanicity classification) and construct validity (in terms of their relation to the mean per capita monthly income and body mass index). CONCLUSIONS: This study's results ensure the utility of these three urbanicity scales as valid instruments for examining the social and health impacts of urbanicity/urbanization, but caution must be applied with comparisons of urbanicity levels across different studies when different urbanicity scales are applied.",BMC public health,2016 Jan 14,England,2016,10
30079743,Collective Well-Being to Improve Population Health Outcomes: An Actionable Conceptual Model and Review of the Literature.,"OBJECTIVES: To propose collective well-being as a holistic measure of the overall ""health"" of a community. To define collective well-being as a group-level construct measured across 5 domains (vitality, opportunity, connectedness, contribution, and inspiration) and introduce an actionable model that demonstrates how community characteristics affect collective well-being. To review the literature describing each domain's association with health outcomes and community characteristics' associations with collective well-being. METHODS: We came to consensus on topics describing each component of our conceptual model. Because ""well-being"" is not indexed in MEDLINE, we performed topic-specific database searches and examined bibliographies of papers retrieved. We excluded articles that were limited to narrow subtopics or studies within small subpopulations. Preference was given to quasi-experimental or randomized studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses. Consensus was reached on inclusion or exclusion of all articles. RESULTS: Reviewed literature supported each of the proposed domains as important aspects of collective well-being and as determinants of individual or community health. Evidence suggests a broad range of community characteristics support collective well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The health and quality of life of a community may be improved by focusing efforts on community characteristics that support key aspects of well-being. Future work should develop a unified measure of collective well-being to evaluate the relative impact of specific efforts on the collective well-being of communities.",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,2018 Nov,United States,2018,10

24351390,Factors associated with the preference for delivery at the government hospitals in rural areas of Lucknow district in Uttar Pradesh.,"For assuring safe maternal and newborn health, institutional delivery was given paramount importance. In India, in spite of several efforts, lesser than 40% deliveries are conducted at health facilities, mostly at private sector. The present cross-sectional study aimed to find out the determinants of preference for delivery at government hospitals in rural areas of Lucknow, a district in Uttar Pradesh. Multistage random sampling was used for selecting villages. From them, 352 recently delivered women were selected, following systematic random sampling. Overall, 84.9% of deliveries were conducted at health institutions. Out of them, 79.3% were at government hospitals. Applying multivariate logistic regression, Hindu women (odd's ratio [OR] = 3.205), women belonging to lower socio-economic class (OR = 4.630) and late registered women (OR = 2.320) were found to be more likely to deliver at government hospitals.

24615312,Prognosis of mild cognitive impairment in general practice: results of the German AgeCoDe study.,"PURPOSE: The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has recently been introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as mild neurocognitive disorder, making it a formal diagnosis. We investigated the prognostic value of such a diagnosis and analyzed the determinants of the future course of MCI in the AgeCoDe study (German Study on Ageing, Cognition, and Dementia in Primary Care Patients). METHODS: We recruited 357 patients with MCI aged 75 years or older from primary care practices and conducted follow-up with interviews for 3 years. Depending on the course of impairment over time, the patients were retrospectively split into 4 groups representing remittent, fluctuating, stable, and progressive courses of MCI. We performed ordinal logistic regression analysis and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 41.5% of the patients had remission of symptoms with normal cognitive function 1.5 and 3 years later, 21.3% showed a fluctuating course, 14.8% had stable symptoms, and 22.4% had progression to dementia. Patients were at higher risk for advancing from one course to the next along this spectrum if they had symptoms of depression, impairment in more than 1 cognitive domain, or more severe cognitive impairment, or were older. The result on a test of the ability to learn and reproduce new material 10 minutes later was the best indicator at baseline for differentiating between remittent and progressive MCI. Symptoms of depression modified the prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In primary care, about one-quarter of patients with MCI have progression to dementia within the next 3 years. Assessments of memory function and depressive symptoms are helpful in predicting a progressive vs a remittent course. When transferring the concept of MCI into clinical diagnostic algorithms (eg, DSM-5), however, we should not forget that three-quarters of patients with MCI stayed cognitively stable or even improved within 3 years. They should not be alarmed unnecessarily by receiving such a diagnosis.",Annals of family medicine,2014 Mar-Apr,United States,2014,10
27381478,Health-related quality of life in children with myelomeningocele: a systematic review of the literature.,"Myelomeningocele (MMC) is the most complex congenital birth defect compatible with life. To provide the best health care for children with MMC, clinicians and researchers have to understand health and functional status of their patients as well as factors influencing their quality of life (QOL). The objective is to review studies that assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and determinants of HRQOL in children with MMC. The data sources include MEDLINE, along with reference lists of relevant reviews and included articles. Study eligibility criteria are quantitative studies that assess HRQOL using validated HRQOL instrument. Participants include children aged 0-18 years with diagnosis of MMC or spina bifida. Risk of bias was assessed using the Hayden system for non-randomized studies. Narrative synthesis and tables of results of HRQOL studies were conducted. Children with MMC have decreased HRQOL compared with normative population. Physical HRQOL is the most exposed aspect of QOL, while discrepancies in psychosocial domains vary by study. Many determinants of QOL have been found, and it is still not clear which determinant can be described as the strongest predictor. Psychosocial factors are the most consistent determinants of HRQOL.Heterogeneous study sample size, study designs, determinant and outcomes measures limited synthesis of findings. The HRQOL in children with MMC is complex and mediated by a number of associated medical problems, together with a variety of psychosocial and environmental factors. Future research is needed (a) on the relation between complex medical problems, functional independence, parent's and clinician's expectation and HRQOL in children and (b) to assess the differences in HRQOL by social environment and healthcare system.","Child: care, health and development",2016 Sep,England,2016,10
25888526,"Interrelationships between education, occupational class and income as determinants of sickness absence among young employees in 2002-2007 and 2008-2013.","BACKGROUND: A low socioeconomic position (SEP) is consistently associated with ill health, sickness absence (SA) and permanent disability, but studies among young employees are lacking. We examined the interrelationships between education, occupational class and income as determinants of SA among 25-34-year-old employees. We also examined, whether the association between SEP and SA varied over time in 2002-2007 and 2008-2013. METHODS: The analyses covered young, 25-34-year-old women and men employed by the City of Helsinki over the time periods 2002-2007 and 2008-2013. Four-level education and occupational class classifications were used, as well as income quartiles. The outcome measure was the number of annual SA days. RESULTS: Education had the strongest and most consistent independent association with SA among women and men in both periods under study. Occupational class had weaker independent and less consistent association with SA. Income had an independent association with SA, which strengthened over time among the men. The interrelationships between the SEP indicators and SA were partly explained by prior or mediated through subsequent SEP indicators.

30005185,WHO/ILO work-related burden of disease and injury: Protocol for systematic reviews of exposure to long working hours and of the effect of exposure to long working hours on stroke.,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing a joint methodology for estimating the national and global work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO joint methodology), with contributions from a large network of experts. In this paper, we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from stroke attributable to exposure to long working hours, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint methodology. OBJECTIVES: We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to long working hours (called Systematic Review 1 in the protocol) and systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of long working hours on stroke (called Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework, conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized way. DATA SOURCES: Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsychINFO. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA: We will include working-age (>/=15years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but exclude children (<15years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of occupational exposure to long working hours (i.e. 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and >/=55h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 2005-2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of a relevant level of long working hours on the incidence of or mortality due to stroke, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. 35-40h/week). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2.

This downplays that we as humans are not only biological organisms but simultaneously also social beings which live in socially organized societies. Disease and premature mortality are thus embodied expressions of the conditions under which we live and work. The paper outlines that a large part of prevailing diseases are strongly influenced by social, economic and political determinants and analyses how social inequalities get under the skin and cause adverse health. Considering social as well as biological processes can generate new evidence, how we biologically incorporate our lived experience and thus create social patterns of health and illness not only in societies but also between societies.","Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",2013 Jan,Germany,2013,10
29103548,Understanding cultural influences on back pain and back pain research.,"Low back pain is highly prevalent and places a considerable burden on individuals, their families and communities. This back pain burden is unequally distributed around the world and within populations. Clinicians and researchers addressing back pain should be aware of the cultural, social and political context of back pain patients and how this context can influence pain perception, disability and health care use. Culture, which influences the beliefs and behaviour of individuals within a social group, could be considered an important contributor to the unequal distribution of back pain. However, there is paucity of high-quality research exploring the influence of culture on the experience and management of back pain. Further development and testing of specific tools, assessment methods and communication strategies are needed to improve our understanding of how cultural practices, values and identifications affect those dealing with back pain.",Best practice & research.

We used data from the 2015 standard households living survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistic. RESULTS: About 6315 (13.3%) of the participants had experienced OOP health expenditure. There was significant differences in the self-reported OOP between these three areas (p < 0.001). The overall mean of OOP expenditure among all participants was 16,034.33 XOF (29 USD). People in Abidjan spent an average of 1.6 and 1.5 times more than those in the rural and urban areas respectively (p < 0.001). Hospitalization is the highest expenditure item in terms of money spent, while drugs are the most common item of expenditure in terms of frequency, regardless of the place of residence. Female gender, high social economic status and large household size increase OOP health expenditure significantly in all areas of residence when insurance reduce it. To reduce the impact of the direct payments there is a need to take into account social demographic factors in addition to economic factor in health policy development.",BMC research notes,2019 Jan 15,England,2019,10

The aim of this research was to explore effective strategies to reduce cesarean delivery rates in Iran. METHODS: A mixed methodological study was designed and implemented. First, using a qualitative approach, concepts and influencing factors of increased cesarean delivery were explored. Based on the findings of this phase of the study, a questionnaire including the proposed strategies to reduce cesarean delivery was developed. Then in a quantitative phase, the questionnaire was assessed by key informants from across the country and evaluated to obtain more effective strategies to reduce cesarean delivery. Ten participants in the qualitative study included policy makers from the Ministry of Health, obstetricians, midwives and anthropologists. In the next step, 141 participants from private and public hospitals, insurance experts, Academic Associations of Midwifery, and policy makers in Maternity Health Affairs of Ministry of Health were invited to assess and provide feedback on the strategies that work to reduce cesarean deliveries. RESULTS: Qualitative data analysis showed four concept related to increased cesarean delivery rates including; ""standardization"", ""education"", ""amending regulations"", and ""performance supervision"". Effective strategies extracted from qualitative data were rated by participants then, using ACCEPT derived from A as attainability, C as costing, C as complication, E as effectiveness, P as popularity, and T as timing table 19 strategies were detected as priorities. CONCLUSIONS: Although developing effective strategies to reduce cesarean delivery rates is complex process because of the multi-factorial nature of increased cesarean deliveries, in this study we have achieved strategies that in the context of Iran could work.",International journal of preventive medicine,2014 Dec,Iran,2014,10
30398971,"Prevalence and associated factors for social phobia among school-going adolescents in a rural area of Puducherry, South India.","Background The World Health Organisation has reported that mental disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Social phobia is one such mental disorder that can have significant impact on the livelihood of adults if not detected at an early stage. There have been very few studies done on social phobia among adolescents in South India. Hence, this study was done to determine the prevalence of social phobia and factors associated with it among the school-going adolescents in rural Puducherry. Methodology A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 1018 school going adolescents from December 2017 to January 2018 in rural Puducherry. Information on socio-demographic characteristics was collected by a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire and social phobia was assessed using the validated Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) questionnaire. Results Among 1018 participants, 738 (72.5%) belonged to early adolescence (10-13 years); 520 (51.1%) were boys; 557 (54.7%) were studying in a middle class; 931 (91.5%) were Hindus; 978 (96.1%) had siblings. The prevalence of social phobia among adolescents was found to be 22.9% (95% CI: 20.4-25.5%). The prevalence of mild social phobia was 18% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.7-20.4%], moderate social phobia was 4% (95% CI: 2.9-5.4%), severe social phobia was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3-1.3%) and very severe social phobia was 0.2% (95% CI: 0.03-0.64%). Higher age, female gender, lack of counselling services and specialist visits at school were found to be determinants of social phobia. Conclusion The current study showed that one in every five adolescents was at risk of developing social phobia. Health education for students, teachers and family members needs to be given to make them aware of the importance of social phobia.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2018 Nov 6,Germany,2018,10
31355958,The impact of social determinants of health on laryngotracheal stenosis development and outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: The social determinants of health affect a wide range of health outcomes and risks. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the impact of social determinants of health on laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS). We sought to describe the social determinants in a cohort of LTS patients and explore their association with treatment outcome. METHODS: Subjects diagnosed with LTS undergoing surgical procedures between 2013 and 2018 were identified. Matched controls were identified from intensive care unit (ICU) patients who underwent intubation for greater than 24 hours. Medical comorbidities, stenosis characteristics, and patient demographics were abstracted from the clinical record. Tracheostomy at last follow-up was recorded from the medical record and phone calls. Socioeconomic data was obtained from the American Community Survey. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two cases met inclusion criteria. Cases had significantly lower education compared to Tennessee (P = .009) but similar education rates as ICU controls. Cases had significantly higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04, P = .035), duration of intubation (OR: 1.21, P < .001), and tobacco use (OR: 1.21, P = .006) in adjusted analysis when compared to controls. Tracheostomy dependence within the case cohort was significantly associated with public insurance (OR: 1.33, P = .016) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.34, P = .018) in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSION: Intubation practices, medical comorbidities and social determinants of health may influence the development of LTS and tracheostomy dependence after treatment. Identification of at-risk populations in ICUs may allow for prevention of tracheostomy dependence through the use of early tracheostomy and specialized follow-up.

Method A case study type social research of qualitative nature, in which nurses of a primary health care service unit in Sao Paulo were interviewed. Results The home visit was identified as a nursing practice possible to be expanded in order to identify social determinants of health, triggering emancipatory practices in the service. This expansion occurred because the design of health care labour intended by the service team changed its focus from the traditional object of health services, the disease. Conclusion First, it is advocated that social policies lead projects with the purpose of improving health needs. On the other hand, the daily labour needs to provide opportunities for reflection and discussion of healthcare projects, leading workers to propose labour-processes targeted to both the social determinants of health and people's illness.",Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da U S P,2014 Aug,Brazil,2014,10
24853825,Exploring health promotion practitioners' experiences of moral distress in Canada and Australia.,"This article introduces moral distress - the experience of painful feelings due to institutional constraints on personal moral action - as a significant issue for the international health promotion workforce. Our exploratory study of practitioners' experiences of health promotion in Australia and Canada during 2009-2010 indicated that practitioners who work in upstream policy- and systems-level health promotion are affected by experiences of moral distress. Health promotion practitioners at all levels of the health promotion continuum also described themselves as being engaged in a minority practice within a larger dominant system that does not always value health promotion. We argue that health promotion practitioners are vulnerable to moral distress due to the values-driven and political nature of the practice, the emphasis on systems change and the inherent complexity and diversity of the practice. This vulnerability to moral distress poses significant challenges to both workers and organisations and the communities they seek to benefit. We propose that further research should be undertaken to fully identify the causes and symptoms of moral distress in health promotion. Extensive existing research on moral distress in nursing provides ample resources to conduct such research.",Global health promotion,2015 Mar,England,2015,10
27923966,Thinking Style as a Predictor of Men's Participation in Cancer Screening.,"Men's participation in cancer screening may be influenced by their thinking style. Men's need for cognition (NFC) and faith in intuition were measured to explore whether they varied by demographic variables or predicted screening behavior. Australian males ( n = 585, aged 50-74 years) completed surveys about past screening and were subsequently offered mailed fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs). Demographic predictors included age, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and language spoken at home. The screening behaviors were self-reported prostate cancer screening (prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal examinations [DREs]), and colorectal cancer screening (self-reported FOBT participation and recorded uptake of the FOBT offer). Analysis comprised principal component analysis and structural equation modelling. NFC was positively related to demographic variables education, socioeconomic status, and speaking English at home. Faith in intuition was negatively related to educational attainment. NFC predicted variance in self-reported DRE participation ( r = .11, p = .016). No other relationships with thinking style were statistically significant. The relationship of NFC to DRE participation may reflect the way certain attributes of this screening method are processed, or alternatively, it may reflect willingness to report participation. The relationship of thinking style to a range of healthy behaviors should be further explored.",American journal of men's health,2017 Mar,United States,2017,10
31637098,Sociogenomic Approach to Wound Care: A New Patient-Centered Paradigm.,"Psychoneuroendocrinology studies provided first insight into social determinants of wound healing. Social stressors impede wound healing. In 2005, we first reported that the transcriptome of wound-site neutrophil is highly responsive to psychological stress in young men. Bioinformatics processing of transcriptome-wide data from neutrophils provided first insight into social transduction pathways relevant to wound healing. In 2010, Idaghdour et al. presented striking evidence demonstrating that genetic factors are responsible for only 5% of the variation in genomic expression. In contrast, the living environment of the individual, urban or rural, was responsible for as much as 50% of such variation. Genetic and environmental factors acted in a largely additive manner. This observation may be credited as the foundation stone of human social genomics. The environment of a patient, including social factors, influences gene expression relevant to wound healing. The nonhealing wound itself and its worsening outcome, including pain, are likely to cause stress. Conversely, positive social interactions may circumvent barriers to wound healing. Thus, interventions directed at the social environment of a wound care patient are likely to help manage wound chronicity. The genomic and related Big Data technology platforms have vastly improved during the past 5 years during which these technologies have also become widely accessible and affordable. Thus, this is the right time to revisit the choice of technologies for the study of social genomics of wound healing. Against the backdrop of our current understanding of the mechanisms of wound healing, such precision approach is likely to transform wound care and its outcomes making it patient-centered and, therefore, more effective.",Advances in wound care,2019 Nov 1,United States,2019,10
29447257,Access to health insurance coverage among sub-Saharan African migrants living in France: Results of the ANRS-PARCOURS study.,"BACKGROUND: Migrants' access to care depends on their health insurance coverage in the host country. We aimed to evaluate in France the dynamic and the determinants of health insurance coverage acquisition among sub-Saharan migrants. METHODS: In the PARCOURS life-event retrospective survey conducted in 2012-2013 in health-care facilities in the Paris region, data on health insurance coverage (HIC) each year since arrival in France has been collected among three groups of sub-Saharan migrants recruited in primary care centres (N = 763), centres for HIV care (N = 923) and for chronic hepatitis B care (N = 778). Year to year, the determinants of the acquisition and lapse of HIC were analysed with mixed-effects logistic regression models. RESULTS: In the year of arrival, 63.4% of women and 55.3% of men obtained HIC. But three years after arrival, still 14% of women and 19% of men had not obtained HIC. HIC acquisition was accelerated in case of HIV or hepatitis B infection, for migrants arrived after 2000, and for women in case of pregnancy and when they were studying. Conversely, it was slowed down in case of lack of a residency permit and lack of financial resources for men. In addition, women and men without residency permits were more likely to have lost HIC when they had one. CONCLUSION: In France, the health insurance system aiming at protecting all, including undocumented migrants, leads to a prompt access to HIC for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, this access may be impaired by administrative and social insecurities.",PloS one,2018,United States,2018,10
25631857,Socioeconomic inequalities in cause-specific mortality in 15 European cities.,"BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic inequalities are increasingly recognised as an important public health issue, although their role in the leading causes of mortality in urban areas in Europe has not been fully evaluated. In this study, we used data from the INEQ-CITIES study to analyse inequalities in cause-specific mortality in 15 European cities at the beginning of the 21st century. METHODS: A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out to analyse 9 of the leading specific causes of death in small areas from 15 European cities. Using a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model, we estimated smoothed Standardized Mortality Ratios, relative risks and 95% credible intervals for cause-specific mortality in relation to a socioeconomic deprivation index, separately for men and women. RESULTS: We detected spatial socioeconomic inequalities for most causes of mortality studied, although these inequalities differed markedly between cities, being more pronounced in Northern and Central-Eastern Europe. In the majority of cities, most of these causes of death were positively associated with deprivation among men, with the exception of prostatic cancer. Among women, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, chronic liver diseases and respiratory diseases were also positively associated with deprivation in most cities. Lung cancer mortality was positively associated with deprivation in Northern European cities and in Kosice, but this association was non-existent or even negative in Southern European cities. Finally, breast cancer risk was inversely associated with deprivation in three Southern European cities. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in many of the main causes of mortality, and reveal variations in their magnitude between different European cities.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2015 May,England,2015,10
25120115,[Policies and mental health action plans in OECD: lessons for Quebec?].,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this research are: 1) to provide a conceptual framework for analyzing mental health policies; 2) to compare mental health policies across a sample of OECD jurisdictions; 3) to describe configurations of mental health policies; 4) to identify practical implications for the Province of Quebec. METHODS: DESIGN: This research is a comparative synthetic study of mental health policies. SAMPLING: The web sites of the Ministries of health of the thirty-four OECD countries and ten Canadian Provinces were searched for mental health policies proposed within the last fifteen years. Twenty one such policies (with an English or French version) were retrieved, covering thirteen OECD countries, six Canadian Provinces and the WHO. ANALYSIS: Content analysis was performed based on the categories (differentiation, integration, governance) and sub-categories of the aforementioned conceptual framework. Eight policies that together cover the variations encountered between all policies were used to identify typical configurations. RESULTS: A conceptual framework derived from Parsons' Theory of Social Action posits that social action systems must exhibit a level of internal differentiation that corresponds to the heterogeneity of their external environment and also a level of integration that allows them to remain coherent despite the complexity of their environment. Governance mechanisms help them maintain an equilibrium between differentiation and integration.In terms of differentiation, mental health policies exhibit much variation between the needs and the groups that are prioritized (age, gender, ethnicity, culture, etc.), the types of interventions that are proposed (promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, etc.), the systemic levels at which interventions take place (society, government as a whole, health care system, organizations, programs, individuals), and the level of specification and scientific basis of proposed interventions. In terms of integration, policies promote various mechanisms belonging to four general categories of increasing effectiveness from hierarchical separation of mandates, to exchange of information, to collaborative planning, and to complete structural integration and co-localisation of certain components (ex. dependence and mental health services). In terms of governance, policies present program theories of varying explicitness and scientific bases, and with different emphases on structures, processes or outcomes. Management models also vary in terms of precision, accountability, financing mechanisms, information systems, and the importance of clinical governance and quality improvement.Five configurations of mental health policies are identified (the public health, the professional, the structural technocratic, the functional technocratic, and the political), each comprising typical combinations of the preceding ingredients. CONCLUSION: The current Quebec mental health policy belongs to the structural technocratic configuration. It specifies fragmented mental health structures with mild integration mechanisms. In the future, it should consider improving its public health aspects (inter-sector work on the determinants of mental health), professional aspects (emphasis on scientific evidence, clinical governance and quality), and functional aspects (integrated specialized community mental health and addiction services). But political factors may prevent it from doing so.",Sante mentale au Quebec,2014 Spring,Canada,2014,10
30171272,Historical trends in suicide risk for the residents of mainland China: APC modeling of the archived national suicide mortality rates during 1987-2012.,"PURPOSE: Distinctive and dramatic changes in the history of China with a rapid suicide decline in recent years present an opportunity to investigate the risk of suicide. In this study, we investigated suicide risk with a historical perspective with archived data to inform suicide research and prevention policies and strategies. METHOD: Documented age-specific suicide mortality rates in 1987-2012 were decomposed into age, period, and cohort effect using APC-modeling method and intrinsic estimator (IE) technique. The estimated effects were further analyzed by numerical differentiation. RESULTS: The data satisfactorily fit the constructed APC models. Cohort effect indicated that suicide risk in China fluctuated at very high levels during 1903-1967, followed by a sharp decline during 1968-1977, and reached the lowest level in 1983-1987 before increased again. Period effect confirmed the declining trend since 1987. Three sunny cohorts with reduced suicide risk and four cloudy cohorts with increased risk were, respectively, associated with significant cultural, social, political, and economic events in China since the 1900s. CONCLUSIONS: The mega trends in the suicide risk at the population level are closely related to significant historical events in China. Suicide is anticipated to increase because of the growing risk for the young cohorts (particularly young females) as the country further develops. Study findings suggest the significance of national strategies for suicide prevention and control, including maintenance of social harmony and stability, provision of more opportunities for development, enhancement of social integration, and restriction of suicide facilitating factors.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2019 Jan,Germany,2019,10

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done on 287 primipara women. The data collection tools used included a demographic characteristics questionnaire, Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Social Support Scale. Pearson's correlation test and general linear model were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The mean maternal-fetal attachment score was 90.0 (SD: 10.3). The highest score was obtained in the ""role taking"" domain and the lowest in the ""interaction with the fetus"" domain. The mean depression score was 8.5 (SD: 4.0). The score of perceived social support was 135.5 (SD: 15.6). Pearson's correlation test showed a significant positive correlation between social support and maternal-fetal attachment (r = 0.36, p < .001) and a significant negative correlation between social support and depression (r= -0.14, p = .018). CONCLUSION: The present study found a significant relationship between maternal-fetal attachment, depression and social support. It is recommended to devise plans for increasing the support given to women and to improve the society's and families' awareness about these issues in the attempt to have healthy mothers and thereby healthy families and communities.","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2018 Sep,England,2018,10

METHODS: Our study population were the 17 276 respondents in the Canadian National Population Longitudinal Health Survey data, from 1994/1995 to 2006/2007. RESULTS: Respondents who were overweight and obese increased over time, with arthritis increasing from 20% to 30% over the study period. Women reported a 10% higher prevalence of arthritis than men. Men aged 70-79 and women aged 60-69 were most likely to report arthritis. PAR% calculations indicated that 3.8% of arthritis in 1994 and 7.5% in 2006 in the overall population could be attributed to overweight, while the proportion of arthritis attributable to obesity increased from 7.0% in 1994 to 10.2% in 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing overweight/obesity of the population was positively associated with arthritis in Canada for both sexes. In addition to the many other beneficial health effects, reducing levels of excess weight may result in either less arthritis or fewer manifestations of symptoms of arthritis or both.",International journal of rheumatic diseases,2014 Jul,England,2014,10

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of Yersinia enterocolitica in chicken meat by using culture method on selective medium and confirmation by PCR assay. Also, biochemical methods were used for biotyping. A total of 100 chicken thigh meat samples were collected randomly from retail outlets in Mashhad, Iran. Samples were enriched in Peptone-Sorbitol-Bile (PSB) broth and then cultured on Cefsulodin-Irgasan-Novobiocin (CIN) agar containing antibiotics supplement. The DNA was extracted from suspected colonies of Yersinia spp. and then PCR test using specific primers for 16S rRNA gene of Yersinia enterocolitica was performed. In this study, 30% of chicken meat was contaminated with Yersinia spp. by culture method and 25% of chicken meat was contaminated with Yersinia enterocolitica. Biotyping of isolated colonies showed that all of the isolates belonged to biotype 1A. Culture and detection of Yersinia spp. from food samples traditionally take 4 days. Due to high accuracy and speed of PCR assay, it is a good alternative method for microbiological techniques. In conclusion, poultry meat can act as a source of Y. enterocolitica and could be considered as a public health hazard.",Journal of pathogens,2018,Egypt,2018,10

These types of experiences were explored among Latino men in North Carolina through quantitative assessment data ( n = 247). Qualitative in-depth interviews were also conducted with a subsample of Latino men who completed the assessment ( n = 20) to contextualize quantitative findings. Participants reported high rates of unfair treatment, discrimination or violence, and questioning about their immigration status. Having been questioned about one's immigration status was significantly associated with increased drug use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.07, 4.38]) and increased depressive symptoms (AOR = 2.87; 95% CI [1.07, 7.67]). Qualitative themes included: reports of frequent discrimination based on immigration status, race/ethnicity, and language; workplaces and police interactions as settings where reported discrimination is most common and challenging; frequent violent victimization; psychological consequences of experiences of discrimination and violence and concerns related to immigration enforcement for Latino men and their families; inter- and intra-community tensions; health-care services as safe spaces; use of coping strategies; and system-level approaches for reducing discrimination and violent victimization of Latinos. Findings point to the need to address underlying causes of discrimination and violence toward Latinos, particularly those related to immigration enforcement, to support health and well-being.",American journal of men's health,2018 Nov,United States,2018,10
20156339,A tailored lifestyle intervention to reduce the cardiovascular disease risk of individuals with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH): design of the PRO-FIT randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Because of a high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), early prevention of cardiovascular disease is important for health gain and cost reduction. This project focuses on the development and evaluation of an innovative intervention aiming to reduce CVD risk by promoting a healthy lifestyle among people with FH. METHODS: This project is designed as a randomised controlled trial in which individuals with FH will be assigned randomly to a control or intervention group. In the intervention group (n = 200), participants will receive a personalized intervention which is a combination of web-based tailored lifestyle advice and personal counselling by a lifestyle coach. The control group (n = 200) will receive care as usual. Primary outcomes are biological indicators of CVD risk: systolic blood pressure, glucose, BMI, waist circumference and lipids (triglycerides, total, LDL and HDL cholesterol). Secondary outcomes are: healthy lifestyle behaviour (with regard to smoking, physical activity, dietary pattern and compliance to statin therapy) and psychological correlates and determinants of healthy lifestyle behaviour (knowledge, attitude, risk perception, social influence, self-efficacy, cues to action, intention and autonomy). Measurement will take place at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months after randomisation. Additionally, a throughout process-evaluation will be conducted to assess and monitor intervention implementation during the trial. DISCUSSION: Results of the PRO-FIT project will provide information about the effects and implementation of a healthy lifestyle intervention for individuals with FH. Our experiences with this intervention will be indicative about the suitability, feasibility and benefits of this approach for future interventions in other high-risk groups, such as Familial Combined Hypercholesterolemia (FCH) and diabetes.

During this investigation, An. stephensi biological forms were morphologically identified and sequenced for odorant-binding protein 1 (Obp1) gene. Also, intron I sequences were used to construct phylogenetic trees. Despite nucleotide sequence variation in exon of AsteObp1, nearly 100% identity was observed at the amino acid level among the three biological forms. In order to overcome difficulties in using egg morphology characters, intron I sequences of An. stephensi Obp1 opens new molecular way to the identification of the main Asian malaria vector biological forms. However, multidisciplinary studies are needed to establish the taxonomic status of An. stephensi.",Acta tropica,2015 Jun,Netherlands,2015,10
31331811,Socioeconomic determinants of leprosy new case detection in the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort: a population-based linkage study.,"BACKGROUND: Although leprosy is recognised as a disease of poverty, there is little evidence on the specific socioeconomic factors associated with disease risk. To inform targeted strategies for disease elimination, we investigated socioeconomic markers of leprosy risk in Brazil. METHODS: Socioeconomic data from the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort were linked to the Brazilian national disease registry (Sistema de Informacao de Agravos de Notificacao) for leprosy from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2014. Using Poisson regression, we assessed the association of socioeconomic factors with risk of incident leprosy in the full cohort and in children (aged 0-15 years), by leprosy subtype and region of residence. FINDINGS: In an analysis of 23 899 942 individuals including 18 518 patients with leprosy, increased levels of deprivation were associated with an increased risk of leprosy in Brazil. Directions of effect were consistent in children younger than 15 years and across disease subtypes. Individuals residing in regions with the highest poverty in the country (central-west, north, and northeast regions) had a risk of leprosy incidence five-to-eight times greater than did other individuals. Decreased levels of income and education and factors reflecting unfavourable living conditions were associated with an up to two-times increase in leprosy incidence (incidence rate ratio 1.46, 95% CI 1.32-1.62, for lowest vs highest quartile of income per capita; 2.09, 95% CI 1.62-2.72, for lowest vs highest level of education). INTERPRETATION: Within the poorest half of the Brazilian population, the most deprived individuals have the greatest risk of leprosy. Strategies focusing on early detection and treatment in the poorest populations could contribute substantially to global disease control.

29194914,Cell-cell recognition and social networking in bacteria.,"The ability to recognize self and to recognize partnering cells allows microorganisms to build social networks that perform functions beyond the capabilities of the individual. In bacteria, recognition typically involves genetic determinants that provide cell surface receptors or diffusible signalling chemicals to identify proximal cells at the molecular level that can participate in cooperative processes. Social networks also rely on discriminating mechanisms to exclude competing cells from joining and exploiting their groups. In addition to their appropriate genotypes, cell-cell recognition also requires compatible phenotypes, which vary according to environmental cues or exposures as well as stochastic processes that lead to heterogeneity and potential disharmony in the population. Understanding how bacteria identify their social partners and how they synchronize their behaviours to conduct multicellular functions is an expanding field of research. Here, we review recent progress in the field and contrast the various strategies used in recognition and behavioural networking.",Environmental microbiology,2018 Mar,England,2018,10
29653568,Prevalence and intensity of catastrophic health care expenditures in Iran from 2008 to 2015: a study on Iranian household income and expenditure survey.,"BACKGROUND: Households exposure to catastrophic health expenditure is a valuable measure to monitor financial protection in health sector payments. The present study had two aims: first, to estimate the prevalence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) in Iran. Second, to investigate main factors that influence the probability of CHE. METHODS: CHE is defined as an occasion in which a household's out-of-pocket (OOP) spending exceeds 40% of the total income that remains after subtraction of living expenses. This study used the data from eight national repeated cross-sectional surveys on households' income and expenditure. The proportion of households facing CHE, as a prevalence measure, was estimated for rural and urban areas. The intensity of CHE was also calculated using overshoot and mean positive overshoot (MPO) measures. The factors affecting the CHE were also analyzed using logistic random effects regression model. We also used ArcMap 10.1 to display visually disparities across the country. RESULTS: An increasing number of Iranians has been subject to catastrophic health care costs over the study period in both rural and urban areas (CHE = 2.57% in 2008 and 3.25% in 2015). In the same period, the overshoot of CHE and the mean positive overshoot ranged from 0.26% to 0.65% and from 12.26% to 20.86%, respectively. The average absolute monetary value of OOP spending per month has been low in rural areas over the years, but the prevalence of CHE has been higher than urban areas. Generally put, rural settlement, higher income, receiving inpatient and outpatient services, and existence of elderly people in the household led to increase in CHE prevalence (p < 0.05). Interestingly, provinces with more limited geographical and cultural accessibility had the lowest CHE. CONCLUSIONS: According to the findings, Iran's healthcare system has failed to realize the aim of five-year national development plan regarding CHE prevalence (1% CHE prevalence according to the plan). Therefore, revision of financial health care protection policies focusing on pre-payments seems mandatory. For instance, these policies should extend the interventions that target low-income populations particularly in rural areas, provide more coverage for catastrophic medical services in basic benefit packages, and develop supplementary health insurance.",International journal for equity in health,2018 Apr 13,England,2018,10
26179340,Determinants of malnutrition among urban slum children in Bangladesh.,"BACKGROUND: This paper analyzes the role of child, maternal and household variables on weight-for-age nutritional status of children in the largest urban slum of Bangladesh. METHODS: We use anthropometric weight-for-age nutrition status of children for an ordered logistic analysis. Our dataset gives us the advantage of segregating health knowledge into three indices: health-seeking practices index, child health precautions index and medical cost knowledge index, which are used as covariates to understand the role of health knowledge towards child health. Gender specific regressions are also run to understand male and female children nutritional function differences. RESULTS: Per capita income significantly improves child health but household assets do not, casting doubt on the robustness of permanent income. After controlling for health knowledge and health-seeking behavior, the remaining impact of maternal education on child health is no longer significant. Health knowledge indices significantly improve child health albeit differentially. While male children are more sensitive to ""child health precautions"" and ""medical cost knowledge"", female children are more sensitive to ""health-seeking practices"". CONCLUSION: Role of health knowledge on child health carries a significant portion of the education effect. Policy makers looking to improve the nutritional status of female children vis-a-vis male children in study area, should promote programs focusing on health-seeking practices.",Health economics review,2015 Dec,Germany,2015,10
28362022,"Growth status of Korean orphans raised in the affluent West: anthropometric trend, multivariate determinants, and descriptive comparison with their North and South Korean peers.","ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the trend in height among adult Korean orphans who were adopted in early life into affluent Western nations. Final heights of 148 females were analyzed based on a Korean government survey conducted in 2008. Height of the orphans was descriptively compared against final heights of South and North Koreans. Furthermore, statistical determinants of orphan height were investigated in multivariate regressions. Mean height of Korean orphans was 160.44 cm (SD 5.89), which was higher than that of South Koreans at 158.83 cm (SD 5.01). Both Korean orphans and South Koreans were taller than North Koreans at 155.30 cm (SD 4.94). However, height of Korean orphans stagnated at around 160-161 cm while those of North and South Koreans improved over time. In the regression analysis, the socioeconomic status of the adoptive family was statistically significant in all models, while dummies for the adoptive nations and age at adoption were insignificant. This study shows that the mean final height of women experiencing extreme environmental improvements in early-life is capped at 160-161 cm, tentatively suggesting that social stress factors in the host nation or early-life factors in the birth nation might have offset some of the environmental enrichment effects achieved through intercountry adoption.",Anthropologischer Anzeiger; Bericht uber die biologisch-anthropologische Literatur,2017 Apr 1,Germany,2017,10
24992827,"Avoidable hospitalizations in Switzerland: a small area analysis on regional variation, density of physicians, hospital supply and rurality.","BACKGROUND: Avoidable hospitalizations (AH) are hospital admissions for diseases and conditions that could have been prevented by appropriate ambulatory care. We examine regional variation of AH in Switzerland and the factors that determine AH. METHODS: We used hospital service areas, and data from 2008-2010 hospital discharges in Switzerland to examine regional variation in AH. Age and sex standardized AH were the outcome variable, and year of admission, primary care physician density, medical specialist density, rurality, hospital bed density and type of hospital reimbursement system were explanatory variables in our multilevel poisson regression. RESULTS: Regional differences in AH were as high as 12-fold. Poisson regression showed significant increase of all AH over time. There was a significantly lower rate of all AH in areas with more primary care physicians. Rates increased in areas with more specialists. Rates of all AH also increased where the proportion of residences in rural communities increased. Regional hospital capacity and type of hospital reimbursement did not have significant associations. Inconsistent patterns of significant determinants were found for disease specific analyses. CONCLUSION: The identification of regions with high and low AH rates is a starting point for future studies on unwarranted medical procedures, and may help to reduce their incidence. AH have complex multifactorial origins and this study demonstrates that rurality and physician density are relevant determinants. The results are helpful to improve the performance of the outpatient sector with emphasis on local context. Rural and urban differences in health care delivery remain a cause of concern in Switzerland.",BMC health services research,2014 Jul 3,England,2014,10
31416213,Coverage and Determinants of Full Immunization: Vaccination Coverage among Senegalese Children.,"Background and Objectives: In line with the global success of immunization, Senegal achieved impressive progress in childhood immunization program. However, immunization coverage is often below the national and international targets and even not equally distributed across the country. The objective of this study is to estimate the full immunization coverage across the geographic regions and identify the potential factors of full immunization coverage among the Senegalese children. Materials and Methods: Nationally representative dataset extracted from the latest Continuous Senegal Demographic and Health Survey 2017 was used for this analysis. Descriptive statistics such as the frequency with percentage and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed and results were presented in terms of adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Overall, 70.96% of Senegalese children aged between 12 to 36 months were fully immunized and the coverage was higher in urban areas (76.51%), west ecological zone (80.0%), and among serer ethnic groups (77.24%). Full immunization coverage rate was almost the same between male and female children, and slightly higher among the children who were born at any health care facility (74.01%). Children who lived in the western zone of Senegal were 1.66 times (CI: 1.25-2.21; p = 0.001) and the children of Serer ethnic groups were 1.43 times (CI: 1.09-1.88; p = 0.011) more likely to be fully immunized than the children living in the southern zone and from the Poular ethnic group. In addition, children who were born at health facilities were more likely to be fully immunized than those who were born at home (AOR = 1.47; CI: 1.20-1.80; p < 0.001), and mothers with recommended antenatal care (ANC) (4 and more) visits during pregnancy were more likely to have their children fully immunized than those mother with no ANC visits (AOR: 2.06 CI: 1.19-3.57; p = 0.010). Conclusions: Immunization coverage was found suboptimal by type of vaccines and across ethnic groups and regions of Senegal. Immunization program should be designed targeting low performing areas and emphasize on promoting equal access to education, decision-making, encouraging institutional deliveries, and scaling up the use of antenatal and postnatal care which may significantly improve the rate full immunization coverage in Senegal.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 Aug 14,Switzerland,2019,10
27435719,Police must join the fast track to end AIDS by 2030.,"World leaders have committed to ending AIDS by 2030, but stigma and discrimination remain significant obstacles. In particular, police are critical, front-line determinants of risk for many people living with HIV (PLHIV) and members of other key affected populations (KAPs). The negative impact of adverse police behaviours and practices on HIV risk is well documented, and these risks undermine global efforts to end AIDS. Far less well documented, and less common, are attempts to ameliorate this impact by working to change police behaviours. This Special Issue seeks to help redress this imbalance by presenting a selection of original, provocative and important interventions from academics, police officers and other stakeholders concerned with documenting the potential for constructive, progressive and evidence-based approaches to the reduction of HIV risk. We recommend urgent boosting of efforts and funding to engage police in the HIV response. Among other strategies, this needs sustainable funding of programmes and their evaluation, and increased and continuing advocacy and education at all levels to match policy and law reform.",Journal of the International AIDS Society,2016,Switzerland,2016,10
26631986,Substance use prevention program for adolescents with intellectual disabilities on special education schools: a cluster randomised control trial.,"BACKGROUND: Students without intellectual disability (ID) start experimenting with tobacco and alcohol between 12 and 15 years of age. However, data for 12- to 15-year old students with ID are unavailable. Prevention programs, like 'PREPARED ON TIME' (based on the attitude-social influence-efficacy model), are successful, but their efficacy has not been studied in students with ID. The objectives of this study were (1) to undertake a cluster randomised control trial to test the efficacy of the e-learning program among 12- to 15-year old students with mild and borderline ID in secondary special-needs schools and (2) to examine the tobacco and alcohol use for this population. METHODS: Five schools, randomly selected to be part of either the experimental group or the control group, participated in this study. Passive informed consent was used in which parents and their children can refuse to participate in the study, resulting in 111 students in the experimental group and 143 students in the control group. A total of 210 students completed both baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Primary outcome variables are the knowledge and attitude towards alcohol and tobacco use. This study is registered in the ISRCTN registry with number ISRCTN95279686. RESULTS: Baseline findings showed that a large proportion of all respondents had initiated smoking (49%) and drinking (75%), well above the expected numbers based on national figures. 'PREPARED ON TIME' did not affect the behavioural determinants (i.e. attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy), except modelling on smoking. Additionally, alcohol-related knowledge of students in the experimental group increased after the completion of the program. CONCLUSIONS: To obtain effective results on behavioural outcomes from 'PREPARED ON TIME', a greater degree of flexibility (i.e. repetition, extension of the program, role playing, etc.) is required. Furthermore, prevention needs to be implemented at a younger age, as 6% of the students tried their first cigarette and 15% of the students drank alcohol at the age of 10 years or younger.",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,2016 Mar,England,2016,10
31477096,Prevalence of medical errors in Iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Medical errors are considered as a major threat to patient safety. To clarify medical errors' status in Iran, a review was conducted to estimate the accurate prevalence of medical errors. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in international databases (MEDLINE, Scopus and the Web of Science), national databases (SID, Magiran, and Barakat) and Google Scholar search engine. The search was performed without time limitation up to January 2017 using the MeSH terms of Medical ""error(s)"" and ""Iran"" in Endnote X5. Article in English and Persian which estimated the prevalence of medical errors in Iran were eligible to be included in this review. The JBI appraisal instrument was used to assess the quality of included studies, by two independent reviewers. The prevalence of medical errors was calculating using random effect model. Stata software was used for data analysis. RESULTS: In 40 included studies, the most frequent occupational group observed were nursing staff and nursing students (21 studies; 52% of studies). The most reported type of error was medication error (25 studies; 62% of studies, with prevalence ranged from 10 to 80%). University or teaching hospitals (30 studies; 75% of studies) as well as, internal/intensive care wards (10 studies; 25% of studies) were the most frequent hospitals and wards detected. Based on the result of the random effect model, the overall estimated prevalence of medical errors was 50% (95% confidence interval: 0.426, 0.574). CONCLUSION: Result of the comprehensive literature review of the current studies, found a wide variation in the prevalence of medical errors based on the occupational group, type of error, and health care setting. In this regards, providing enough education to nurses, improvement of patient safety culture and quality of services and attention to special wards, especially in teaching hospitals are suggested.",BMC health services research,2019 Sep 2,England,2019,10
30758679,"Burden, access, and disparities in kidney disease.","Kidney disease is a global public health problem, affecting over 750 million persons worldwide. The burden of kidney disease varies substantially across the world, as does its detection and treatment. In many settings, rates of kidney disease and the provision of its care are defined by socio-economic, cultural, and political factors leading to significant disparities. World Kidney Day 2019 offers an opportunity to raise awareness of kidney disease and highlight disparities in its burden and current state of global capacity for prevention and management. Here, we highlight that many countries still lack access to basic diagnostics, a trained nephrology workforce, universal access to primary health care, and renal replacement therapies. We point to the need for strengthening basic infrastructure for kidney care services for early detection and management of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease across all countries and advocate for more pragmatic approaches to providing renal replacement therapies. Achieving universal health coverage worldwide by 2030 is one of the World Health Organization's Sustainable Development Goals. While universal health coverage may not include all elements of kidney care in all countries, understanding what is feasible and important for a country or region with a focus on reducing the burden and consequences of kidney disease would be an important step toward achieving kidney health equity.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2019 Apr,Germany,2019,10
23565376,"Childhood obesity: Determinants, evaluation, and prevention.","Childhood obesity is a grave issue, which needs to be addressed urgently because it leads to several medical and psychosocial problems in children. High prevalence is being increasingly reported in children from developing countries as well. The combination of our genetic propensity to store fat, the ready availability of calorie dense foods, and sedentary lifestyle promotes overweight. The child's food environment at home and parental obesity are strong determinants. Urban poor in developed countries and urban rich in developing countries are both at risk. In developing countries, a number of beliefs passed down over generations are other important determinants. Evaluation includes assessing the child's lifestyle, excluding weight-promoting medication history; poor linear growth needs endocrine evaluation; genetic syndromes should be considered if there are clinical pointers. Overweight children should be evaluated for hypertension, dyslipidemia, T2DM, and NAFLD. Therapeutic lifestyle changes targeting food habits and physical activity through parental participation and social support are the cornerstones of preventing childhood obesity. Active travel and play by making the built environment more accessible, ban on 'junk' food advertising, and effective health education through active participation of clinicians, school systems, and the media will go a long way in reversing anticipated trends in childhood obesity.",Indian journal of endocrinology and metabolism,2012 Dec,India,2012,10
31595444,"""A Temple of God"": A Qualitative Analysis of the connection Between Spiritual/Religious Beliefs and Health Among Mormons.","In the last decades, studies have increasingly shown an association between religious/spiritual beliefs (R/S) and several health outcomes. In this context, Mormons provide an intriguing case for such investigation because Mormonism stands out for its commitment to the ""Word of Wisdom"" with several restrictions and recommendations. Despite the consolidated wide array of evidence, showing that the relationship between ""Word of Wisdom"" and health may usually have a protective effect in North-American studies, little is know about this community in other countries and, to our knowledge, no health studies have ever been carried out in European and Spanish Mormons. The present qualitative study aims to fill this gap, exploring the discourses, opinions, and attitudes of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the recommendations of the Health Law and the ""Word of Wisdom"" on their health. In the analysis, six themes appeared during the coding process and were converted in the following categories: Theme 1 Body as a Temple, Theme 2 Promises of blessing, Theme 3 Healthy lifestyle, Theme 4 Stigma, Theme 5 Damage to the family, and Theme 6 Spiritual Performance. We found that fulfilling the ""Law of Wisdom"" may lead Mormons to take care of their health, and to have a network of support from church leaders, who may act as health promoters. Religiosity tends to insert values and behaviours that seem to benefit individual's health and protect their families, such as the non-use of substances and the preservation of a ""healthy body"" (i.e. ""body as a temple""). However, some stigma and isolation may appear in contact with other groups due to these restrictions and limitations.",Journal of religion and health,2019 Oct 8,United States,2019,10
31543562,Knowledge and Parity: Perspectives of Usage of Emergency Contraceptive Pills among Women of a Rural Area of Delhi.,"Context: Correct use of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) may prevent up to 95% of unwanted pregnancies which may significantly decrease unsafe abortions and maternal mortality. Aims: Assessment of knowledge and use of ECPs among women and to explore factors associated with them. Materials and Methods: This was a facility-based cross-sectional study. Data were collected using a prestructured, pretested questionnaire from 381 reproductive age women (15-49 years) selected by systematic random sampling. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 and Epi info (version 7.0.) were used for all statistical analyses. Descriptive analysis was performed, and results were expressed in terms of frequencies and percentages. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used as tests of significance in univariate analysis. Determinants of use of ECPs were identified using logistic regression. Results: Of 381 women interviewed, awareness level of ECPs (ever heard about ECPs) was found to be 34% (n = 128). Ever use of emergency contraception was reported by 38 (9.7%). Age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.88-4.87]), education (OR = 0.086, 95% CI [0.047-0.158]), husband's education (OR = 0.11, 95% CI [0.067-0.187]), socioeconomic status (OR = 6.14, 95% CI [3.28-11.51]), and family status (OR = 2.6, 95% CI [1.59-4.24]) were found to be significantly associated with the use of emergency contraceptives. Conclusions: The study identified that most respondents lack adequate knowledge about ECPs, and ever use of ECPs was very low. Factors that were associated with the use of ECPs were age, literacy, socioeconomic status, and knowledge about the method. Creating a sustainable awareness on ECPs and their use may serve them with power to control their parity.",Nigerian medical journal : journal of the Nigeria Medical Association,2019 May-Jun,Nigeria,2019,10
25428143,Relationship between risk factors and in-hospital mortality due to myocardial infarction by educational level: a national prospective study in Iran.,"INTRODUCTION: Since no hospital-based, nationwide study has been yet conducted on the association between risk factors and in-hospital mortality due to myocardial infarction (MI) by educational level in Iran, the present study was conducted to investigate relationship between risk factors and in-hospital mortality due to MI by educational level. METHODS: In this nationwide hospital-based, prospective analysis, follow-up duration was from definite diagnosis of MI to death. The cohort of the patients was defined in view of the date at diagnosis, hospitalization and the date at discharge (recovery or in-hospital death due to MI). 20750 patients hospitalized for newly diagnosed MI between April, 2012 and March, 2013 comprised sample size. Totally, 2511 deaths due to MI were obtained. The data on education level (four-level) were collected based on years of schooling. To determine in-hospital mortality rate and the associated factors with mortality, seven statistical models were developed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of the studied patients, 9611 (6.1%) had no education. in-hospital mortality rate was 8.36 (95% CI: 7.81-8.9) in women and 6.12 (95% CI: 5.83-6.43) in men per 100 person-years. This rate was 5.56 in under 65-year-old patients and 8.37 in over 65-year-old patients. This rate in the patients with no, primary, high school, and academic education was respectively 8.11, 6.11, 4.85 and 5.81 per 100 person-years. Being woman, chest pain prior to arriving in hospital, lack of thrombolytic therapy, right bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia, smoking and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were significantly associated with increased hazard ratio (HR) of death. The adjusted HR of mortality was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.06-1.52), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.77-1.13), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.57-0.91) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.66-1.01) in the patients with respectively illiterate, primary, secondary and high school education compared to academic education. CONCLUSION: A disparity was noted in post-MI mortality incidence in different educational levels in Iran. HR of death was higher in illiterate patients than in the patients with academic education. Identifying disparities per educational level could contribute to detecting the individuals at high risk, health promotion and care improvement by relevant planning and interventions in clinics and communities.",International journal for equity in health,2014 Nov 27,England,2014,10
23283809,"""Normative content"" and health inequity enculturation: a logic model of men's health advocacy.","Epidemiologic studies and related literature consistently report that males have fewer years of life expectancy than females. Moreover, males experience fewer quality years of life in that they tend to live with greater rates of morbidity such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes among other conditions. Causal evidence traditionally highlights the role of biology in determining the life course for males. However, emerging literature suggests that social determinants of health play a more central role in male morbidity and mortality, and thus contribute to health inequities between the sexes. The purpose of this article is to explore core concepts of social determinants of health as they pertain to male health inequities and provide a systematic conceptualization of how society has become encultured to view these inequities as ""normative."" Strategies to improve male health are discussed using a logic model to illustrate male health advocacy in the face of the social climes of encultured health inequities.",American journal of men's health,2013 May,United States,2013,10
21228438,Factors that shape the development of interprofessional improvement initiatives in health organisations.,"BACKGROUND: Quality and safety improvement programmes advance the standard of care delivered by health organisations but have been shown to be less effective than anticipated. Implementing improvement programmes require a greater understanding of the impact of the social context and strategies that engage staff. OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors that shaped the development of interprofessional improvement initiatives in a health organisation. METHODS: Data are drawn from a large-scale longitudinal action research study examining interprofessional learning and practice. The setting is an autonomous bounded health jurisdiction in Australia. Within the study, health professionals have conceptualised more than 111 interprofessional improvement projects, of which 76 have evolved into ongoing activities. Textual data were analysed using emergent coding and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Initiatives were shaped by six determinants: site receptivity; team issues; leadership; impact on healthcare relations; impact on quality and safety issues; and extent to which the projects became institutionally embedded. Initiatives that engaged participants and progressed were characterised by and displayed flexible leadership, and ongoing refinement and maturity over time. The local organisational context and initiatives coevolved. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement initiatives are necessary for improved quality of care and patient safety but are difficult to implement and sustain. The factors identified to develop them are constantly under challenge in health services. Improving healthcare quality will, in part, depend upon the ability to provide more flexible and supportive social contexts.",BMJ quality & safety,2011 Apr,England,2011,10

Asking how and why the governance of these networks emerges and evolves over time, it responds to calls for more innovative thinking in this field. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Data result from a rare longitudinal qualitative case study conducted with the Healthcare Centre Lower Engadin, the lead organisation of pioneering health and social care network in a rural Swiss region. FINDINGS: Actors governed the network through repetitive sequences of collaborative inquiry, a practice through which they defined and addressed recurrent problems of network governance and joint network action in creative and experimental ways. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Explaining how and why the governance of integrated care networks emerges and evolves, this study adds a dynamic theory to previous research, which has studied the determinants of effective network governance without considering their temporal evolution. It also contributes to the wider network literature, drawing attention to the pivotal role of meaning making, creativity and experimentation for understanding network governance dynamics. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study invites practitioners to reflect on how they want to design collaborative inquiry in their own contexts. Important design levers include the creation of communication forums, trust and information transparency.

Individuals with objectively verified HF ( n = 388, 234 males, mean age = 68.9 +/- 3.4) completed the (i) eHEALS, (ii) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, (iii) Short Form 12, (iv) 9-item European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale, and (v) 5-item Medication Adherence Report Scale. Two types of analyses were carried out to evaluate the factorial structure of the eHEALS: (i) confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in classical test theory and (ii) Rasch analysis in modern test theory. A regression model was constructed to examine the associations between eHEALS and other instruments. CFA supported the one-factor structure of the eHEALS with significant factor loadings for all items. Rasch analysis also supported the unidimensionality of the eHEALS with item fit statistics ranging between 0.5 and 1.5. The eHEALS was significantly associated with all the external criteria.

Sleep hygiene practices are one of the important variables that affect sleep quality. The objective of this study was to assess association between sleep hygiene practices and sleep quality of medical students in Qazvin University of Medical Sciences. METHODS: In this descriptive-correlational study, a total of 285 medical students completed a self-administered questionnaire. Demographic data, sleep-wake schedule in weekday and weekend, and sleep duration were collected. Students' sleep quality was assessed by Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were analyzed by SPSS Ver 13. RESULTS: Overall, 164 (57.5) of students had poor sleep quality. Mean global PSQI score and average score of four subscales were significantly higher in male than female. Regression analysis showed that male students (beta=-0.85, P<0.05), students at senior level (beta=-0.81, P<0.05), married students (beta=-0.45, P<0.05), and those with improper sleep hygiene practices slept worse. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that the prevalence of poor sleep quality in medical students is high. Improper sleep hygiene behaviors might be a reason for poor quality of sleep in medical students.",Journal of caring sciences,2016,Iran,2016,10
29216229,Factors associated with pre-diabetes in Tehranian men and women: A structural equations modeling.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of sex-specific related factors with pre-diabetes in Tehranian non-diabetic adults. METHODS: This study has been conducted within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) between 2008-2010. A total of 5568 (55.4% female) non-diabetic adults, aged >/=20 years, selected from among participants of the TLGS, were recruited for the study. Data on socio-behavioral factors, family history of diabetes and cardio-metabolic risk factors were included in the hypothesized model to test their direct and indirect associations with pre-diabetes in men and women separately, using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Pre-diabetes was diagnosed in 23.6% of participants, with significantly higher prevalence in men compared to women (27.4% and 20.5%, respectively; p<0.001). Body mass index (BMI) and triglycerides (TG) in both sexes and hypertension and high density lipoprotein only in women, were directly associated with pre-diabetes (p<0.05). Poor diet in women was the only behavioral factor directly associated with pre-diabetes (p<0.05). Age in both sexes and education, only in women, were directly associated with pre-diabetes. In both genders, age, marital status, education, employment, poor diet and leisure time physical activity were indirectly associated with pre-diabetes through cardio-metabolic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The main modifiable factors directly associated with pre-diabetes were TG in women and BMI in men, which need to be prioritized in health policies for diabetes prevention programs in Tehranian adults. Future research should focus on the gender-specific determinants and underlying mechanisms for TG levels and BMI status among this population.",PloS one,2017,United States,2017,10
25027158,Quality of life in mothers of children with cerebral palsy: The role of children's gross motor function.,"Four hundred and twenty-four Iranian mothers of children with cerebral palsy (CP) were recruited using the convenience sampling approach in a cross-sectional study. The researchers assessed the quality of life (QOL) in mothers according to the gross motor function levels and types of CP. The evaluation was done using a well-validated Persian version of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. In 2012, demographic data and clinical relevant information were also collected in rehabilitation clinics affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The results indicated that the mean score for the study sample on physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) was 39.21 and 41.23, respectively. This suggests that participants considered themselves to have a low QOL (p < .05). The mean PCS scores for SF-36 were significantly different between mothers having CP children of different age, levels of motor function, and CP types (p < .05 and p < .01, respectively). The results indicate that mothers of children with CP suffer from poor physical and mental health. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to the QOL in mothers of children with CP, and rehabilitation professionals should offer supportive strategies to promote aspects of their QOL.",Journal of child health care : for professionals working with children in the hospital and community,2016 Mar,England,2016,10
22890348,Mobilizing Older Adults: Harnessing the Potential of Smart Home Technologies. Contribution of the IMIA Working Group on Smart Homes and Ambient Assisted Living.,"OBJECTIVES: This paper highlights the potential of smart home applications to not only assess mobility determinants for older adults in the home environment but also provide the opportunity for tailored interventions. METHODS: We present a theoretical framework for assessing mobility parameters and utilizing this information to enable behavior change based on the Health Belief Model. We discuss examples that showcase the potential of smart home systems to not only measure but also improve mobility for community dwelling older adults. RESULTS: Mobility is a complex construct that cannot be addressed with a single monitoring approach or a single intervention. Instead, tailored interventions that address specific needs and behaviors of individuals and take into consideration preferences of older adults and potentially their social network are needed to effectively enforce positive behavior change. Smart home systems have the ability to capture details of one's daily living that could otherwise not be easily obtained; however, such data repositories alone are not sufficient to improve clinical outcomes if appropriate mechanisms for data mining and analysis, as well as tailored response systems are not in place. CONCLUSIONS: Unleashing the potential of smart home applications to measure and improve mobility has the potential of transforming elder care and providing potentially cost-effective tools to support independence for older adults. A technologically driven smart home application can maximize its clinical relevance by pursuing interactive features that can lead to behavior change.",Yearbook of medical informatics,2012,Germany,2012,10
31162863,"""You only have time for so much in 12 hours"" unmet social needs of hospitalised patients: A qualitative study of acute care nurses.","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of nurses caring for socially at-risk patients and gain an understanding of the challenges nurses face when providing care. BACKGROUND: Nurses play a pivotal role in caring for hospitalised patients with social risk factors and preparing them for discharge. Few studies have explored whether acute care nurses are adequately supported in their practice environments to address the unique needs of socially at-risk patients as they transition back into community settings. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study of nurses working in a large urban academic medical centre. METHODS: We conducted six semi-structured focus groups of nurses (n = 21). Thematic content analysis was performed to analyse the transcripts from the focus groups. We adhered to COREQ guidelines for reporting this qualitative study. RESULTS: Six key themes emerged: (a) nurses' assessments of social risk factors, (b) experiences providing care, (c) barriers to care, (d) fear of ""labelling"" socially at-risk patients, (e) unmet social care needs and (f) recommendations to improve care. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that nurses are able to identify social risk factors. However, prioritisation of medical needs during acute care hospitalisation and lack of organisational supports may deter nurses from fully addressing social concerns. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Acute care nurses should be involved in the development of future efforts to address the needs of socially at-risk patients and be provided with additional supports in their practice environments. This could include continuing education to build nursing competencies in community-based care and social vulnerability.",Journal of clinical nursing,2019 Oct,England,2019,10
28349171,"Intersections of poverty, race/ethnicity, and sex: alcohol consumption and adverse outcomes in the United States.","We examine whether intersectionality theory-which formalizes the notion that adverse health outcomes owing to having a marginalized social status, identity, or characteristic, may be magnified for individuals with an additional marginalized social status, identity, or characteristic-can be applied using quantitative methods to describe the differential effects of poverty on alcohol consumption across sex and race/ethnicity. Using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, we analyze longitudinal data from Black, Hispanic, and White drinkers (n = 21,140) to assess multiplicative interactions between poverty, as defined by the US Census Bureau, sex, and race/ethnicity, on adverse alcohol outcomes. Findings indicated that the effect of poverty on the past-year incidence of heavy episodic drinking was stronger among Black men and Black women in comparison to men and women of other racial/ethnic groups. Poverty reduction programs that are culturally informed may help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in the adverse outcomes of alcohol consumption.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2017 May,Germany,2017,10
23384288,Communication skills training for physicians performing work disability assessments increases knowledge and self-efficacy: results of a randomised controlled trial.,"PURPOSE: It was assessed whether a post-graduate communication skills training course would increase physicians' competence and knowledge with regard to communication during work disability assessment interviews, and would change the determinants of their communication behaviour. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was performed. At baseline and at follow-up, 42 physicians completed questionnaires. The primary outcome measures were competence and knowledge about communication. The secondary outcome measures were 21 self-reported determinants of communication behaviour. One-way analyses of variance and covariance were performed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in overall competence, but there was for the introduction phase (intervention: mean = 7.0, SD 2.7; control: mean = 4.8, SD 2.7; p = 0.014). Knowledge about communication was significantly higher (p = 0.001) in the intervention group (mean = 79.6, SD 9.2) than in the control group (mean = 70.9, SD 6.7), especially concerning the information-gathering phase of the interview (intervention: mean = 80.0, SD 10.2; control: mean = 69.4, SD 8.9; p = 0.001). The intervention group scored significantly better on 7 of the 21 self-reported determinants (secondary outcomes), including self-efficacy, intentions, skills and knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The communication skills training course may improve some aspects of physician communication, but not all. Because physicians were unanimously positive about the course, further development is warranted. Implications for Rehabilitation Even though optimal communication is essential in face-to-face assessment interviews for determining entitlement to work disability benefits, and there is a lot at stake for the claimants, this issue has scarcely been addressed in scientific research. A tailor-made two-day communication skills training course, based on scientific research, increases physicians' knowledge about communication (both objectively measured and self-reported), their self-efficacy and their intention to pay explicit attention to their communication during assessment interviews. The participants evaluated the communication skills training course as very positive, which indicates a successful application of scientific research in practice. It is essential to offer physicians assessing entitlement to work disability benefits the opportunity to attend post-graduate communication skills training courses, which are tailored to their needs and are continuously evaluated and improved.",Disability and rehabilitation,2015 Jul 21,England,2015,10
29356165,Period prevalence and reporting rate of medication errors among nurses in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIMS: To estimate the 1-year period prevalence of medication errors and the reporting rate to nurse managers among nurses working in hospitals in Iran. BACKGROUND: Medication errors are one of the main factors affecting the quality of hospital services and reducing patient safety in health care systems. METHOD: A literature search from Iranian and international scientific databases was developed to find relevant studies. Meta-regression was used to identify which characteristics may have a confounding effect on the pooled prevalence estimates. RESULTS: Based on the final 22 studies with 3556 samples, the overall estimated 1-year period prevalence of medication errors and its reporting rate to nurse managers among nurses were 53% (95% confidence interval, 41%-60%) and 36% (95% confidence interval, 23%-50%), respectively. The meta-regression analyses indicated that the sex (female/male) ratio was a statistically significant predictor of the prevalence of medication errors (p < .05), but not of the prevalence of reporting medication errors to nurse managers. CONCLUSION: The period prevalence of medication errors among nurses working in hospitals was high in Iran, whereas its reporting rate to nurse managers was low. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Continuous training programmes are required to reduce and prevent medication errors among nursing staff and to improve the reporting rate to nurse managers in in Iran.",Journal of nursing management,2018 Jul,England,2018,10
31805900,Identification of food insecurity factors in French-speaking Belgium: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Diet is an essential determinant of health. Among the health determinants, we find access problems that are summarized as food insecurity. While such food insecurity has been studied in other countries and correlated to several health problems, it has been scarcely assessed in Belgium. The purpose of this work was to determine the factors of food insecurity existing within the Belgian population. METHOD: From November 2016 to February 2017, a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 19 adults present attending the waiting rooms of six Public Social Action Centers in French-speaking Belgium, analyzed by grounded theory. RESULTS: In Belgium, for given food preferences and needs, food insecurity could be summarized as inadequacy between necessary and available resources within two dimensions: at the access level, for financial, temporal, informational, and freedom of action, and at the food use level, for temporal factors, material, knowledge, and skills. In these situations of inadequacy, participants reported finding either strategies to restore balance, or being forced to alter the quality or quantity of their diet. CONCLUSION: While several factors of food insecurity may exist in Belgium, it appears essential that the first line of care these factors into consideration, since they could interfere with care and health, and because the first line of care is ideally placed to inform and refer the patients in question. Several courses of action are proposed in this work, which must still be confirmed by other studies.",BMC public health,2019 Dec 5,England,2019,10
26256863,Social participation experiences of mothers of children with cerebral palsy in an Iranian context.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Social participation is increasingly of interest in research that investigates the impact of caring for a child with a disability. Little has been investigated about the social participation experiences of mothers of children with cerebral palsy (CP). This study explored social participation among Iranian mothers of children with CP. METHODS: The conventional qualitative content analysis method was utilised. Data were collected via in-depth semi-structured interviews with 14 mothers (aged 26-45 years) of children with CP with the gross motor function classification system expanded & revised levels III-V. Constant comparative analysis was deployed for data analysis. RESULTS: The results were identified and classified into three main themes: (i) polarisation of positive and negative feelings; (ii) challenges to mothers' social activity; and (iii) striving to engage in society. CONCLUSION: In the Iranian context, mothers of children with CP are facing many challenges to social participation and seem to have been neglected by the health-care system. One of the priorities of Iranian health policy makers may be developing, establishing and implementing social support to enable the mothers to participate in social activities. Furthermore, occupational therapists can contribute and guide mothers' social participation by creating programs to develop and utilise skills for them.",Australian occupational therapy journal,2015 Dec,Australia,2015,10
30035139,The Effect of Education on the Attitude and Child Abuse Behaviors of Mothers with 3-6 Year Old Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial Study.,"Background: Child abuse is a kind of domestic violence of children under the age of 18 which potentially or actually damages all aspects of their health. This study was conducted to determine the effect of education based on growth and development with home-visiting follow up on the mothers' attitude and child abuse with 3-6-year-old children. Methods: This controlled trial study was carried out in two rural community health centers in Khorasan Razavi province in Iran, during April 2016 to Jun 2017 on 64 abusive mothers of 3-6-year-old children. The data collection tools included the 32-item adult adolescent parenting inventory (AAPI) and the questionnaire of child abuse. By using multi-stage random sampling, the mothers referring to two health centers were assigned to the experimental (N=32) and control groups (N=32). The intervention group received parenting educational interventions based on child growth and development and after being followed up for eight weeks through home-visits. The data were analyzed in SPSS-16, using descriptive statistics, analytical tests including the Chi-square, independent t-test, and Mc Nemars test. Results: After the intervention, the overall score of parenting attitudes was found to be significantly increased (P<0.001), and the prevalence of most abusive behaviors towards children was significantly reduced (P<0.05) in the intervention group compared to the control group. Conclusion: According to the results, this educational program was found to be significantly more effective in improving parenting attitudes and preventing child abuse compared to routine childcare programs in health centers.

30402523,Assessment of Care and its Associated Factors in Traumatic Patients in North of Iran.,"Objective: To determine the status of pre-hospital emergency care and its associated factors in traumatic patients. Methods: In across-sectional study, 577 traumatic patients who were transferred to Poursina hospital by EMS (Emergency Medical Services) personnel were selected by simple random sampling method. Pre-hospital emergency services were observed. Then the mean of taken measures scores for each domain was determined in percent and evaluated in terms of associated factors (age, working experience of staff and number of missions per day) and compared using Spearman's test. Results: Out of 577 patients, 454 were men (78.7%) and 123 women (21.3%). Their mean age was 35.1 years old. Accident (82.7%) was the most common mechanism of injury. Most vehicles involved in the accident were light -weight cars (48.5%) and motorcycles (32.2%). A significant relationship was found between age, general domain (p=0.039) and hemodynamic (p=0.019) as well as between work experience and general domain (p=0.018). Conclusion: Given that pre-hospital emergency services provided in most of the domains are relatively far from world standard, results of this research can provide information for managers to improve strategic planning on care and medical services, appropriation of budget, knowledge of personnel and necessary equipment.",Bulletin of emergency and trauma,2018 Oct,Iran,2018,10
28183400,"Toward a better understanding of social anxiety and depression in psoriasis patients: The role of determinants, mediators, and moderators.","OBJECTIVE: To determine how and under which conditions psoriasis is related to the psychological impairments, in particular, to social anxiety and depression, the current study tested the interplay of selected factors such as gender, age of onset of psoriasis, cognitive and affective elements of body image, experiences of stigmatization, and patients' subjective perceptions of severity of the disease. METHODS: Adult psoriasis patients (N=193) completed the Appearance Schemas Inventory-Revised, the Stigmatization Scale, the Body Emotions Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Social Anxiety Questionnaire. The disease severity was defined based on the Body Surface Area (BSA) index. RESULTS: The effect of psoriasis on social anxiety was moderated by age of onset: higher severity of the disease was associated with higher levels of social anxiety, but only for patients with pre-adult onset psoriasis. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that in patients with adult-onset (>/=18years of age) the importance of appearance to one's sense of self-worth was the main contributor to social anxiety, while in patients with pre-adult onset, social anxiety was most strongly related to experiences of stigmatization. Moreover, the results indicated that negative body-related emotions mediated the relationship between severity of the disease and depression. Additionally, the relationship between severity of psoriasis and body image emotions was moderated by gender. CONCLUSIONS: Findings significantly extend previous studies by confirming and highlighting the role of age of onset of psoriasis in psychological impairments, and provide more insight into factors that contribute to social anxiety in this group of patients.",Journal of psychosomatic research,2017 Mar,England,2017,10
26960436,Polish school nurses' knowledge of the first-aid in tooth avulsion of permanent teeth.,"BACKGROUND: The frequency of dental trauma in schools is secondary only to accidents at home. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge of first aid in the avulsion of permanent teeth presented by Polish school nurses from different areas. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with the use of a structured self-administrative questionnaire was conducted in 2014 on school nurses working in randomly selected Polish provinces. The instrument consisted of demographic questions, questions referring to nurses' experience and training in dental trauma and questions checking knowledge of first-aid in the avulsion of permanent teeth. The maximum number of points to be scored was eight. Data were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis, the Mann-Whitney U and Chi(2) tests with the level of statistical significance at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 164 nurses of which 70.1 % had experience with dental injuries and 45.7 % witnessed a tooth avulsion in pupils. 10.4 % nurses participated in training courses concerning tooth avulsion and 67.1 % of them independently broadened their knowledge. The knowledge of the first-aid management of an avulsed tooth was moderate (4.72 +/- 1.95 points). 78.1 % of nurses chose a correct definition of the term of 'tooth avulsion'. Only 7.3 % of them were aware that the replantation could be conducted by any witness of an accident. Saline was most often chosen as a proper transport medium for an avulsed tooth (57.9 %), whereas 16.1 % of nurses indicated milk. 13.4 % of evaluated nurses showed readiness to conduct an immediate replantation. Most respondents preferred calling child's parents and advising them to bring the child to a dentist (63.4 %). The main factor influencing nurses' level of knowledge was self-education (p < 0.001). Being a witness to dental trauma (p = 0.0032) and working in schools with sports classes (p = 0.0423) were positive determinants of improved knowledge. Nurses from large agglomerations had significantly lower knowledge (p = 0.005). The main source of information for self-education was the Internet. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated nurses were in need of education with regard to the management of dental trauma cases. The Internet should be used to deliver evidence-based knowledge to medical staff working at schools.",BMC oral health,2016 Mar 9,England,2016,10

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Based on an inductive approach, judgmental sampling was used to target relevant health care organizations. Informants were assessed according to their knowledge of their organizations' sustainability initiatives. FINDINGS: Report the main determinants of orientation and organization revealed in relation to the hospitals' past and present sustainability initiatives, providing a foundation for describing their sustainable development. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Reveals a selection of descriptive determinants of sustainable development in private hospitals, all of which offers a basis for assessing whether the evolution of organizational sustainability initiatives is major, minor or non-existent. MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: The sustainability orientation has changed from value-based initiatives to business-based ones. It has also resulted in the orientation changing from environmental initiatives to social ones, as well as a change from reactive initiatives to proactive ones. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Contributes to framing sustainable development through descriptive determinants in private healthcare organizations. It also divides these determinants into two categories, namely the orientation and organization of sustainability initiatives.",Evaluation and program planning,2019 Aug,England,2019,10
31028895,Predictors of hospital readmission in US children and adults with atopic dermatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Decreasing readmissions is a health care priority in the United States. However, little is kanown about the determinants of hospital readmissions for atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVE: To determine readmission rates among inpatients hospitalized for AD in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed the 2012-2014 Nationwide Readmission Database, including a representative, cross-sectional sample of hospital readmissions in the United States. RESULTS: Overall, 17.0% of inpatients with AD were readmitted within 1 year for all causes, including 12.5% with only a single readmission and 4.6% for AD. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, hospital readmission for AD was associated with below-median household income, being uninsured, having a prolonged initial hospitalization, but inversely associated with older age and a diagnosis of infection. Inpatients admitted for AD on a weekend, in the summer, or in autumn were more likely to be readmitted for AD. Hospital characteristics associated with readmission for AD included nonmetropolitan hospital location and hospital teaching status. CONCLUSION: One in 5 inpatients with AD are readmitted within 1 year for all causes. There are socioeconomic and health care disparities in readmission rates for AD.","Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2019 Jul,United States,2019,10
27558902,Methods for a longitudinal cohort of refugee children in a regional community in Australia.,"PURPOSE: Few studies explore the long-term health and well-being of refugee children. A longitudinal cohort of refugee children was created to determine health and well-being outcomes over time. This article describes the methodology used to conduct this study, including sample characteristics and effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies. PARTICIPANTS: Newly arrived refugee children settling in a regional part of Australia aged 6 months to 15 years were recruited between 2009 and 2013 and 85% were followed for an average of 31 months. METHOD AND DESIGN: General practitioners conducted health and pathology examinations shortly after arrival. Additional follow-up assessments were conducted by the research team at an average of 13 months after arrival for the first (year 2) and 31 months for the second (year 3) assessment. Children under 5 years had developmental and children aged 4-17 years had social-emotional screening. Families were assessed for risk and protective factors using a structured interview and the Social Readjustment Ratings Scale. Parent experience of the research was explored. FINDINGS TO DATE: Eligibility criteria were met by 158 of 228 (69%) newly arrived children, 61 of whom (39%) were enrolled. Retention was 100% (n=61) at year 2 and 85% at year 3. The study sample was younger than and had an over-representation of African refugees as compared to the eligible population. Parents reported that the research was respectful. FUTURE PLANS: This study demonstrates that a longitudinal cohort study in refugee children is feasible and acceptable, and retention rates can be high. The establishment of this cohort provides the opportunity to analyse valuable data about the early settlement experience, risk and protective factors and long-term health and well-being outcomes in refugee children. These are necessary to identify refugee children in need of additional support and to guide future service delivery.",BMJ open,2016 Aug 24,England,2016,10
29166484,Assessing the role of appropriate primary health care on the use of dental services by Brazilian low-income preschool children.,"This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the association between the quality of primary health care (PHC) and the use of dental services by preschoolers served by the Family Health Strategy (FHS), controlling for socio-demographic determinants and perceived need. The sample encompassed 438 children aged 3-5 years, enrolled in 19 FHS facilities in Ponta Grossa, Parana State, Brazil. Individual level variables were collected by interviewing parents or caregivers at home. They answered a questionnaire on socioeconomic conditions, oral hygiene habits and use of dental services. Parental perception of child's oral health related quality of life, as perceived need, was assessed by the Brazilian version of Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS). Normative need was assessed by oral examinations, according to guidelines standardized by the World Health Organization. The contextual level factor was defined as the extent of implementation of PHC in the facilities. Managers responded to PCATool-Brazil, a validated questionnaire which measures the extent of PHC. Dentists answered to a version of PCATool, which was adapted and pretested for dental services. Multilevel analysis, based on Andersen's behavioral model, fitted the adjustment of ""having ever consulted a dentist"" to contextual and individual covariates. We observed high prevalence of dental caries. Almost half of the sample had had dental appointments in life. Social gradients were observed for the use of dental services. Although it was not able to eliminate the impact of adverse social conditions, higher levels of PHC attributes in dental services favored the effective use of such services by low-income children.",Cadernos de saude publica,2017 Nov 21,Brazil,2017,10
31605361,Incorporating social dimensions in hydrological and water quality modeling to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural beneficial management practices in a Prairie River Basin.,"There is growing interest to develop processes for creating user-informed watershed scale models of hydrology and water quality and to assist in decision-making for balanced policies for managing watersheds. Watershed models can be enhanced with the incorporation of social dimensions of watershed management as brought forward by participants such as the perspectives, values, and norms of people that depend on the land, water, and ecosystems for sustenance, economies, and overall wellbeing. In this work, we explore the value of combining both qualitative and quantitative methods and social science data to enhance salience and legitimacy of watershed models so that end-users are more engaged. We discuss pilot testing and engagement workshops for building and testing a systems dynamics model of the Qu'Appelle Valley to gather insights from local farmers and understand their perceptions of Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs). Mixed-method workshops with agricultural producers in the Qu'Appelle Watershed gathered feedback on the developing model and the incorporation of social determinants affecting decision-making. Analysis of focus groups and factor analysis of Q-sorts were used to identify the desired components of the model, and whether it supported farmers' understanding of the potential effects of BMPs on water quality. We explored farmers' engagement with models testing BMPs and the potential of incorporating their decision processes within the model itself. Finally, we discuss the reception of the process and the practicality of the approach in providing legitimate and credible decision support tools for a community of farmers.",Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 Oct 12,Germany,2019,10
30074142,Investigation and Comparison of In Vitro Genotoxic Potency of PM10 Collected in Rural and Urban Sites at Tehran in Different Metrological Conditions and Different Seasons.,"The particulate matter has become a serious health problem in some large cities in the world. These particles are a complex mixture of chemical compounds which change based on location and time and, consequently, can cause different health-related effects. The exact mechanism of the effect of these particles is not yet known for certain. However, it seems that numerous mechanisms through the production of ROS and, eventually, DNA destruction, which are related to a wide range of diseases, are among the causes of particles' health-related effects. The present study is aimed to evaluate and compare the genotoxicity potential of particles collected in Tehran, Iran, in urban and rural regions during spring and autumn as well as dusty and inversion conditions. These effects were examined using the comet assay on human pulmonary epithelial cells (A549). Results showed that all the particles had the potential for genotoxicity at the concentration used in this study (75,150 and 300 mug/ml). Moreover, DNA destruction changed with season, site, and even dusty and inversion atmospheric conditions. These changes mostly belonged to urban particles. In general, urban particles in autumn and, specifically, on days with inversion had higher genotoxicity (p < 0.01). Difference was observed between dusty and regular days so that regular days were more potent (p < 0.05). A strong correlation was observed between the effects of most PAH compounds and other metals such as Cr, Co, Cd, Mn, As, and also SO4, which were mostly the result of combustion in vehicle engines in urban regions. No difference was observed for rural particles at different conditions and seasons.",Biological trace element research,2019 May,United States,2019,10
28218395,"Coffee, tea and melanoma risk: findings from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.","In vitro and animal studies suggest that bioactive constituents of coffee and tea may have anticarcinogenic effects against cutaneous melanoma; however, epidemiological evidence is limited to date. We examined the relationships between coffee (total, caffeinated or decaffeinated) and tea consumption and risk of melanoma in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). EPIC is a multicentre prospective study that enrolled over 500,000 participants aged 25-70 years from ten European countries in 1992-2000. Information on coffee and tea drinking was collected at baseline using validated country-specific dietary questionnaires. We used adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the associations between coffee and tea consumption and melanoma risk. Overall, 2,712 melanoma cases were identified during a median follow-up of 14.9 years among 476,160 study participants. Consumption of caffeinated coffee was inversely associated with melanoma risk among men (HR for highest quartile of consumption vs. non-consumers 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.69) but not among women (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.62-1.47). There were no statistically significant associations between consumption of decaffeinated coffee or tea and the risk of melanoma among both men and women. The consumption of caffeinated coffee was inversely associated with melanoma risk among men in this large cohort study. Further investigations are warranted to confirm our findings and clarify the possible role of caffeine and other coffee compounds in reducing the risk of melanoma.",International journal of cancer,2017 May 15,United States,2017,10
22300841,Accessibility of sexual health services in teenage sexual health service users: local area geospatial analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Teenage pregnancy rates in the UK are the highest in Western Europe. Causes of teenage pregnancies are multifaceted with complex interplay of social, lifestyle and wider determinants influencing risk. Improving access to sexual health services through community services is an important factor in attempting to tackle this issue, but few studies have examined factors that influence this. METHODS: Geospatial analysis was conducted on community sexual health service users and teenage conceptions from local sexual health services were recorded. Univariate and multinomial regression was performed to test associations between service type and socio-economic status. RESULTS: No significant differences in accessibility of services between teenage girls who have conceived and those seeking sexual health services were found. Females aged 17 and under were more likely to use a young people's sexual health service than mainstream services (P < 0.001). However, a young person living in the most deprived quintiles was more likely to use a mainstream service if it was closer to their home address (adjusted odds ratios: 2.154, 95% confidence intervals: 1.533-3.027). CONCLUSIONS: Service type and socio-economic status impact upon the choices young people make when accessing community sexual health services. The study supports policy for locating young person services within the most deprived areas of a community.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2012 Aug,England,2012,10
29569529,Applying the Innov8 approach for reviewing national health programmes to leave no one behind: lessons learnt from Indonesia.,"The World Health Organization's Innov8 Approach for Reviewing National Health Programmes to Leave No One Behind is an eight-step process that supports the operationalization of the Sustainable Development Goals' commitment to 'leave no one behind'. In 2014-2015, Innov8 was adapted and applied in Indonesia to review how the national neonatal and maternal health action plans could become more equity-oriented, rights-based and gender-responsive, and better address critical social determinants of health. The process was led by the Indonesian Ministry of Health, with the support of WHO. It involved a wide range of actors and aligned with/fed into the drafting of the maternal newborn health action plan and the implementation planning of the newborn action plan. Key activities included a sensitization meeting, diagnostic checklist, review workshop and in-country work by the review teams. This 'methods forum' article describes this adaptation and application process, the outcomes and lessons learnt. In conjunction with other sources, Innov8 findings and recommendations informed national and sub-national maternal and neonatal action plans and programming to strengthen a 'leave no one behind' approach. As follow-up during 2015-2017, components of the Innov8 methodology were integrated into district-level planning processes for maternal and newborn health, and Innov8 helped generate demand for health inequality monitoring and its use in planning. In Indonesia, Innov8 enhanced national capacity for equity-oriented, rights-based and gender-responsive approaches and addressing critical social determinants of health. Adaptation for the national planning context (e.g. decentralized structure) and linking with health inequality monitoring capacity building were important lessons learnt. The pilot of Innov8 in Indonesia suggests that this approach can help operationalize the SDGs' commitment to leave no one behind, in particular in relation to influencing programming and monitoring and evaluation.",Global health action,2018 Jan - Dec,United States,2018,10
29653255,Promoting Father Involvement for Child and Family Health.,"Paternal involvement in children's lives is associated with a variety of child outcomes, including improved cognition, improved mental health, reduced obesity rates, and asthma exacerbation. Given this evidence, the American Academy of Pediatrics has promoted actions by pediatricians to engage fathers in pediatric care. Despite these recommendations, the mother-child dyad, rather than the mother-father-child triad, remains a frequent focus of care. Furthermore, pediatric care is often leveraged to improve maternal health, such as screening for maternal depression, but paternal health is infrequently addressed even as men tend to exhibit riskier behaviors, poorer primary care utilization, and lower life expectancy. Therefore, increasing efforts by pediatric clinicians to engage fathers may affect the health of both father and child. These efforts to engage fathers are informed by currently used definitions and measures of father involvement, which are discussed here. Factors described in the literature that affect father involvement are also summarized, including culture and context; interpersonal factors; logistics; knowledge and self-efficacy; and attitudes, beliefs, and incentives. Innovative ways to reach fathers both in the clinic and in other settings are currently under investigation, including use of behavior change models, motivational interviewing, mobile technologies, peer support groups, and policy advocacy efforts. These modalities show promise in effectively engaging fathers and improving family health.",Academic pediatrics,2018 Sep - Oct,United States,2018,10
20854325,Rheumatic fever in indigenous Australian children.,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) caused by acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a disease of poverty, poor hygiene and poor living standards. RHD remains one of the major causes of childhood cardiac disease in developing nations. Within developed nations, there has been a dramatic drop in the prevalence of RHD because of the improvement of living standards, access to health care and the widespread availability of penicillin-based drugs. Despite a dramatic reduction of RHD in Australia overall, it continues to be a major contributor to childhood and adult cardiac disease in Indigenous communities throughout northern and central Australia. Currently, Australia has among the highest recorded rates of ARF and RHD in the world. The most accurate epidemiological data in Australia come from the Northern Territory's RHD control programme. In the Northern Territory, 92% of people with RHD are Indigenous, of whom 85% live in remote communities and towns. The incidence of ARF is highest in 5-14-year-olds, ranging from 150 to 380 per 100,000. Prevalence rates of RHD since 2000 have steadily increased to almost 2% of the Indigenous population in the Northern Territory, 3.2% in those aged 35-44 years. Living in remote communities is a contributing factor to ARF/RHD as well as a major barrier for adequate follow-up and care. Impediments to ARF/RHD control include the paucity of specialist services, rapid turnover of health staff, lack of knowledge of ARF/RHD by health staff, patients and communities, and the high mobility of the Indigenous population. Fortunately, the recently announced National Rheumatic Fever Strategy, comprising recurrent funding to the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia for control programmes, as well as the creation of a National Coordination Unit suggest that RHD control in Australia is now a tangible prospect. For the disease to be eradicated, Australia will have to address the underpinning determinants of poverty, social and living conditions.",Journal of paediatrics and child health,2010 Sep,Australia,2010,10

We aimed to look at the discourse in the HIV and AIDS prevention discourse by the elite. This research was conducted in 2019 in Palu City, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia in Palu City, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Methods: We used qualitative research aiming to obtain a full picture of a matter according to the human perspective studied. Results: There was a pressure from various groups so that all people who have the potential to increase the HIV and AIDS trends must be dealt with explicitly, even religious leaders urged to immediately close down the main source of the disease, namely prostitution, LGBT activities that are considered very contrary to culture and any religion. Conclusion: The discourse in the HIV and AIDS prevention discourse in Palu city has not yet occurred in the discourse synergy developed by the elite, even the program policies are domination and hegemony.",Iranian journal of public health,2019 Dec,Iran,2019,10
30913951,Intimate Partner Violence During Pregnancy in Turkey: Determinants From Nationwide Surveys.,"Domestic violence has severe consequences for women, both psychologically and physiologically. Violence during pregnancy is even riskier, endangering women's lives and the lives of their fetuses. A nationwide survey in Turkey in 2014 revealed that 7% of women who have experienced a pregnancy were exposed to physical violence perpetrated by an intimate partner during pregnancy. In this study, the risk and protective factors for this particular type of violence and how it can be addressed in Turkey are discussed using nationally representative data for the first time. Data are obtained from surveys conducted in 2008 and 2014 on domestic violence against women. The analysis is based on multinomial regression models in which the dependent variable consists of three groups of women: those who have not been exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV), those whose have been exposed to physical IPV but not during pregnancy, and those who have been exposed to physical IPV during pregnancy. In this way, the factors that have a significant effect on this severe form of violence can be identified. Our findings show that earlier age of first intercourse; the nature of first intercourse; men's affairs; men's controlling behaviors over women; men's use of alcohol, drugs, or gambling; and experience with violence in the family are all significant factors for IPV during pregnancy. Women's empowerment and the restructuring of the unequal power relations between women and men should be targeted to eradicate the problem in the long run. It is concluded that, for the time being, it is crucial to ensure that legal procedures for domestic violence function well and that health institutions are key components in identifying pregnant women exposed to violence and in guiding them toward institutional and social support mechanisms.",Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 Mar 27,United States,2019,10
24661534,"[Prevalence and determinants of obesity in children and young people in Catalonia, Spain, 2006-2012].","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight in children aged 2 to 14 years in Catalonia, its trends between 2006 and 2010-2012, and to evaluate social determinants and lifestyle associated with obesity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study, using the data from 4,389 surveys from Catalonia Health Surveys of the years 2006 and 2010-2012, was conducted. Obesity and overweight were determined by World Health Organization criteria. Socioeconomic position, parent's education, usual diet and activity, and hours of sleep were assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity and overweight were: 15.4 and 20.2% in 2010-2012. The prevalence of obesity was higher in boys (15.5%) compared to girls (12.8%) (P<.05), and higher in children ranging from 2 to 9 years old (17.5%) than children aged 10 to 14 years (7.7%) (P<.05). In 2006, the prevalence of obesity and overweight were similar to the prevalence in 2010-2012. Obesity was more frequent in children with parents with a low socioeconomic position and/or a primary or elementary parent's education. CONCLUSIONS: During the last 5 years (2006-2012), child obesity and overweight have remained stable in Catalonia, yet they are relatively high in Europe. Public health programmes against obesity must consider conducting an intersectional action taking social determinants and family life styles into account.",Medicina clinica,2014 Dec 9,Spain,2014,10
25587572,"The meaning of collaboration, from the perspective of Iranian nurses: a qualitative study.","BACKGROUND: Interdisciplinary collaboration among nurses is a complex and multifaceted process, an essential element in nursing, which is crucial to maintain an efficient, safe, and viable medical setting.

27105309,Explaining Disparities in Use of Skilled Birth Attendants in Developing Countries: A Conceptual Framework.,"Despite World Health Organization recommendations that all women deliver with a skilled birth attendant (SBA), research continues to demonstrate large disparities in use of SBAs by socioeconomic status (SES). Yet few quantitative studies empirically examine the factors underlying these disparities, due in part to the fact that current models do not provide clear pathways-with measurable mediators-for how distal factors like SES may affect maternal health-seeking behaviors like delivering with SBAs. We propose the Disparities in Skilled Birth Attendance (DiSBA) framework for examining the determinants of use of SBAs. We posit that three proximal factors directly affect use of SBAs: perceived need, perceived accessibility of maternal health services, and perceived quality of care. Distal factors like SES affect use of SBAs indirectly through these proximal factors, and the effects can be measured. We test the assumptions of the DiSBA framework using data from the Ghana Maternal Health Survey. The analytic techniques we use include logistic regression with mediation analysis to examine the intervening effects. We find that our proxies for perceived access, perceived need, and perceived quality of care account for approximately 23% of the difference between women with no education and those with primary school education, and about 55% of the difference between women in the lowest wealth quintile and those in the middle wealth quintiles. This study suggests that proximal factors are worthy of increased attention in terms of measurement, data collection, analysis, programmatic efforts, and policy interventions, as these factors are potentially more amenable to change than the distal factors. The effects of proximal factors are also likely context specific, thus sufficient understanding in different contexts is essential to developing appropriate interventions.",PloS one,2016,United States,2016,10
23617991,The federal and Ontario budgets of 2012: what's in it for health equity?,"Health equity has started to receive significant attention among Canadian policy-makers, with acknowledgement at both the federal and provincial levels of the importance of reducing health inequities. However, a challenging budget environment has led to a number of budget cutbacks in areas that are likely to negatively influence social determinants of health, such as housing, education, and social assistance. This article analyzes both the federal and Ontario budgets of 2012 and their potential impacts on and implications for health equity. Even though health care services have largely remained untouched in both budgets, the article argues that existing health inequities will be further amplified through the implementation of cutbacks in sectors other than health, given the importance of social determinants of health (SDH) for health equity outcomes.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2012 Jul 18,Switzerland,2012,10
28424776,Socially Responsible Surgery: Building Recognition and Coalition.,"IMPORTANCE: Socially responsible surgery (SRS) integrates surgery and public health, providing a framework for research, advocacy, education, and clinical practice to address the social barriers of health that decrease surgical access and worsen surgical outcomes in underserved patient populations. These patients face disparities in both health and in health care, which can be effectively addressed by surgeons in collaboration with allied health professionals. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the current state of surgical access and outcomes of underserved populations in American rural communities, American urban communities, and in low- and middle-income countries. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched PubMed using standardized search terms and reviewed the reference lists of highly relevant articles. We reviewed the reports of two recent global surgery commissions. CONCLUSION: There is an opportunity for scholarship in rural surgery, urban surgery, and global surgery to be unified under the concept of SRS. The burden of surgical disease and the challenges to management demonstrate that achieving optimal health outcomes requires more than excellent perioperative care. Surgeons can and should regularly address the social determinants of health experienced by their patients. Formalized research and training opportunities are needed to meet the growing enthusiasm among surgeons and trainees to develop their practice as socially responsible surgeons.",Frontiers in surgery,2017,Switzerland,2017,10
31323739,"Linkage Between the Environment and Individual Resilience to Urban Flooding: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China.","Resilience is widely accepted as the capacities implemented to manage climate change. Exploring how individual resilience can be enhanced to better prepare residents for natural disasters, such as urban flooding, is therefore necessary. Environmental cognitions that provide psychological and physiological benefits to people by adding motivation to interact with the place are factors influencing people's resilience-oriented behaviors but have largely been ignored in existing research. As such, this study establishes a framework for the concept of individual resilience to urban flooding. Gongming, a sub-district of Shenzhen, China, is considered the case area wherein individual resilience and its environmental determinants are evaluated. Through hierarchical linear modeling, the environmental determinants of individual resilience at the individual and community levels are identified. At the individual level, the main factors are a few green spaces, low quality of the built environment, mutual distrust and lack of well-being perceived by residents. At the community level, the results suggest that the social environment, particularly its gatedness, is pivotal to individual resilience. This study offers an approach for analyzing factors that limit individual resilience from the environmental perspective, thereby providing a basis for formulating corresponding policy recommendations to effectively improve resilience through urban planning.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 Jul 18,Switzerland,2019,10
30586753,Ambulance Density and Outcomes After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.,"BACKGROUND: In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), geographic disparities in outcomes may reflect baseline variations in patients' characteristics but may also result from differences in the number of ambulances providing basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS). We aimed at assessing the association between allocated ambulance resources and outcomes in OHCA patients in a large urban community. METHODS: From May 2011 to January 2016, we analyzed a prospectively collected Utstein database for all OHCA adults. Cases were geocoded according to 19 neighborhoods and the number of BLS (firefighters performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and applying automated external defibrillator) and ALS ambulances (medicalized team providing advanced care such as drugs and endotracheal intubation) was collected. We assessed the respective associations of Utstein parameters, socioeconomic characteristics, and ambulance resources of these neighborhoods using a mixed-effect model with successful return of spontaneous circulation as the primary end point and survival at hospital discharge as a secondary end point. RESULTS: During the study period, 8754 nontraumatic OHCA occurred in the Greater Paris area. Overall return of spontaneous circulation rate was 3675 of 8754 (41.9%) and survival rate at hospital discharge was 788 of 8754 (9%), ranging from 33% to 51.1% and from 4.4% to 14.5% respectively, according to neighborhoods ( P<0.001). Patient and socio-demographic characteristics significantly differed between neighborhoods ( P for trend <0.001). After adjustment, a higher density of ambulances was associated with successful return of spontaneous circulation (respectively adjusted odds-ratio [aOR], 1.31 [1.14-1.51]; P<0.001 for ALS ambulances >1.5 per neighborhood and aOR, 1.21 [1.04-1.41]; P=0.01 for BLS ambulances >4 per neighborhood). Regarding survival at discharge, only the number of ALS ambulances >1.5 per neighborhood was significant (aOR, 1.30 [1.06-1.59] P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this large urban population-based study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests patients, we observed that allocated resources of emergency medical service are associated with outcome, suggesting that improving healthcare organization may attenuate disparities in prognosis.",Circulation,2019 Mar 5,United States,2019,10

28007333,[Social determinants of contraceptive use in Tunisia].,"BACKGROUND: In Tunisia, the ""Revolution"" of January 2011 highlighted significant regional disparities and social inequalities in access to health care, including reproductive health services. The purpose of this study was to analyze the social determinants of the use of contraception in Tunisia. METHODS: A cross-sectional national study conducted in 2012; on a sample of 15 to 49-year married women (n=4374) drawn by a two levels random sampling. Prevalence of contraception and its association factors were assessed. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the variation of contraception prevalence with area of residence, age, level of education, number of children and household income. RESULTS: The prevalence of contraception was 66.4 %. Eighty-two percent of women used a modern contraceptive method. The use of contraceptive methods was significantly dependent on the age (P<0.001), area of residence (P=0.008), education (P<0.001). The prevalence of contraception was higher in North West (OR=1.1 [0.81-1.5]; P<0.001), among multiparous women (OR=4.49 [3.57-5.66]; P<0.001), among the youngest women (OR=1.4 [0.9-2,19]; P<0.001) and among those with higher levels of education (OR=1.62 [1.19-2.21]; P=0.008). CONCLUSION: Tunisia, precursor Arab country in family planning, is recording a slowdown in the use of contraception in comparison with other countries of North Africa.

27719687,The Identification of Hereditary and Environmental Determinants of Frailty in a Cohort of UK Twins.,"Our study examines the contribution of genetic and environmental factors (both shared and unique) to frailty, measured using the Rockwood Frailty Index (FI) in a sample of twins from the St Thomas' UK Adult Twin Registry. The FI was based on 39 items of potential health deficit. Study participants were 3,375 volunteer adult twins (840 monozygotic and 802 dizygotic twin-pairs) 40.0-84.5 years old. First, we used structural equation modeling to estimate the relative contribution of genetics and of the shared and unique environment to variance in FI adjusted for age. In a second analysis, multiple linear regression was used to examine variance in FI as a function of father's occupational class (a component of shared environment and a measure of childhood socioeconomic status [SES]), adjusting for age, birth weight, marital status, and health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity). Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS(R) Version 22 software and Mx open source software. Findings showed that 45% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 30-53%) of the inter-individual variation in FI was heritable and 52% (95% CIs 47-57%) was due to the individual's unique environment. Multiple linear regression also showed a small but statistically significant inverse association between father's occupational class and FI, mediated by one's own educational attainment and birth weight. Our results indicate that frailty is both genetically and environmentally determined. Thus, its prevention and management call for a multifaceted approach that includes addressing deleterious environmental factors, some of which, like childhood SES, may act across the life course.",Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies,2016 Dec,England,2016,10

30800729,The JeffSTARS Advocacy and Community Partnership Elective: A Closer Look at Child Health Advocacy in Action.,"Introduction: Advocacy and service-learning increasingly are being incorporated into medical education and residency training. The Jefferson Service Training in Advocacy for Residents and Students (JeffSTARS) curriculum is an educational program for Thomas Jefferson University and Nemours trainees. The JeffSTARS Advocacy and Community Partnership Elective is one of two core components of the larger curriculum. Methods: The elective is a monthlong rotation that provides trainees in their senior year of medical school or residency training the opportunity to learn about health advocacy in depth. Trainees develop a basic understanding of social determinants of health, learn about health policy, participate in legislative office visits, and work directly with community agencies on a mutually agreeable project. The elective provides advocacy training to self-selected trainees from area medical schools and residency programs to develop a cadre of physicians empowered to advocate for child health. Results: JeffSTARS has advanced the field of child health advocacy locally by forging new partnerships and building a network of experts, agencies, and academic institutions. After this experience, trainees realize that their health expertise is very valuable to health advocacy and policy development. JeffSTARS is recognized nationally as one of a growing number of advocacy training programs for students and residents, with trainees presenting selected projects at national meetings. Discussion: Teaching advocacy has raised awareness about social determinants of health, community resources, and the medical home. One of the many benefits of the elective has been to strengthen the skills and expertise of trainees and faculty members alike.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2016 Dec 31,United States,2016,10

Longitudinal data on the behaviour of HIV-negative MSM are scarce in Europe. The aim of this protocol, developed during the Euro HIV Early Diagnosis And Treatment (EDAT) project, is to implement a multicentre community-based cohort of HIV-negative MSM attending 15 CBVCT services in 5 European countries. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: (1) To describe the patterns of CBVCT use, (2) to estimate HIV incidence, and to identify determinants of (3) HIV seroconversion and (4) HIV and/or sexually transmitted infection (STI) test-seeking behaviour. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All MSM aged 18 years or over and who had a negative HIV test result are invited to participate in the COmmunity-BAsed Cohort (COBA-Cohort). Study enrolment started in February 2015, and is due to continue for at least 12 months at each study site. Follow-up frequency depends on the testing recommendations in each country (at least 1 test per year). Sociodemographic data are collected at baseline; baseline and follow-up questionnaires both gather data on attitudes and perceptions, discrimination, HIV/STI testing history, sexual behaviour, condom use, and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. Descriptive, exploratory and multivariate analyses will be performed to address the main research objectives of this study, using appropriate statistical tests and models. These analyses will be performed on the whole cohort data and stratified by study site or country. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Public Health authorities of each country where the study is being implemented. Findings from the COBA-Cohort study will be summarised in a report to the European Commission, and in leaflets to be distributed to study participants. Articles and conference abstracts will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and conferences.",BMJ open,2016 Jul 13,England,2016,10
27903556,Assessment of cardiovascular risk in Tunisia: applying the Framingham risk score to national survey data.,"OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to assess the socioeconomic determinants of a high 10 year cardiovascular risk in Tunisia. SETTING: We used a national population based cross sectional survey conducted in 2005 in Tunisia comprising 7780 subjects. We applied the non-laboratory version of the Framingham equation to estimate the 10 year cardiovascular risk. PARTICIPANTS: 8007 participants, aged 35-74 years, were included in the sample but effective exclusion of individuals with cardiovascular diseases and cancer resulted in 7780 subjects (3326 men and 4454 women) included in the analysis. RESULTS: Mean age was 48.7 years. Women accounted for 50.5% of participants. According to the Framingham equation, 18.1% (17.25-18.9%) of the study population had a high risk (>/=20% within 10 years). The gender difference was striking and statistically significant: 27.2% (25.7-28.7%) of men had a high risk, threefold higher than women (9.7%; 8.8-10.5%). A higher 10 year global cardiovascular risk was associated with social disadvantage in men and women; thus illiterate and divorced individuals, and adults without a professional activity had a significantly higher risk of developing a cardiovascular event in 10 years. Illiterate men were at higher risk than those with secondary and higher education (OR=7.01; 5.49 to 9.14). The risk in illiterate women was more elevated (OR=13.57; 7.58 to 24.31). Those living in an urban area had a higher risk (OR=1.45 (1.19 to 1.76) in men and OR=1.71 (1.35 to 2.18) in women). CONCLUSIONS: The 10 year global cardiovascular risk in the Tunisian population is already substantially high, affecting almost a third of men and 1 in 10 women, and concentrated in those more socially disadvantaged.",BMJ open,2016 Nov 30,England,2016,10

Based on an extended literature review, a structural equation model is derived and empirically tested for a sample of 343 students. The empirical estimates support the derived model with a good overall model fit and sufficient R(2) values for dependent variables. Hence, our results provide evidence for a general significant impact of behavioral intention and related personal and social determinants as well as for the relevance of environmental/situational determinants such as portion sizes and palatability of food for plate leftovers. Moreover, we find that environmental and personal determinants are interrelated and that the impact of different determinants is relative to perceived time constraints during a visit of the university canteen. Accordingly, we conclude that simple measures to decrease avoidable food waste may take effects via complex and interrelated behavioral structures and that future research should focus on these effects to understand and change food leftover behavior.",Appetite,2017 Sep 1,England,2017,10
30724740,Electronic Health Program to Empower Patients in Returning to Normal Activities After General Surgical and Gynecological Procedures: Intervention Mapping as a Useful Method for Further Development.,"BACKGROUND: Support for guiding and monitoring postoperative recovery and resumption of activities is usually not provided to patients after discharge from the hospital. Therefore, a perioperative electronic health (eHealth) intervention (""ikherstel"" intervention or ""I recover"" intervention) was developed to empower gynecological patients during the perioperative period. This eHealth intervention requires a need for further development for patients who will undergo various types of general surgical and gynecological procedures. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to further develop the ""ikherstel"" eHealth intervention using Intervention Mapping (IM) to fit a broader patient population. METHODS: The IM protocol was used to guide further development of the ""ikherstel"" intervention. First, patients' needs were identified using (1) the information of a process evaluation of the earlier performed ""ikherstel"" study, (2) a review of the literature, (3) a survey study, and (4) focus group discussions (FGDs) among stakeholders. Next, program outcomes and change objectives were defined. Third, behavior change theories and practical tools were selected for the intervention program. Finally, an implementation and evaluation plan was developed. RESULTS: The outcome for an eHealth intervention tool for patients recovering from abdominal general surgical and gynecological procedures was redefined as ""achieving earlier recovery including return to normal activities and work."" The Attitude-Social Influence-Self-Efficacy model was used as a theoretical framework to transform personal and external determinants into change objectives of personal behavior. The knowledge gathered by needs assessment and using the theoretical framework in the preparatory steps of the IM protocol resulted in additional tools. A mobile app, an activity tracker, and an electronic consultation (eConsult) will be incorporated in the further developed eHealth intervention. This intervention will be evaluated in a multicenter, single-blinded randomized controlled trial with 18 departments in 11 participating hospitals in the Netherlands. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention is extended to patients undergoing general surgical procedures and for malignant indications. New intervention tools such as a mobile app, an activity tracker, and an eConsult were developed.

27548816,Critical reflections on the currently leading definition of sustainable employability.,"Sustainable employability (SE) is an important topic as it deals with employees' abilities to function adequately at work and in the labor market throughout their working lives. However, until now there has been only one attempt to define SE in the international literature (1). This first definition is a valuable contribution to the field as it rightfully describes SE as a multidimensional concept, recognizes the importance of both employee and work characteristics, and acknowledges the inherently longitudinal nature of SE. Despite these merits, we argue that this definition of SE has some serious omissions that are important in capturing SE comprehensively. Specifically, we argue that the definition could be improved in various ways, namely, it should: (i) clarify which aspects of employment constitute someone's SE; (ii) not counterintuitively treat SE as a characteristic of both the job and the employee simultaneously; (iii) not be based on the insufficiently tested assumption that achieving value in work inherently leads to SE; (iv) be formulated in a way that SE can also apply to unemployed individuals; and (v) adequately specify how the inherently longitudinal dimension of SE should be addressed. We would like to contribute to the discussion by providing guidelines for a new adjusted definition of SE that could facilitate further research on this important concept and its determinants. Introduction SE is a topic of vital importance to individual employees, organizations and society alike. It generally refers to employees' capacities to function in work throughout their working life. As participation in work is important for individuals, organizations, and society as a whole, individuals' ability to function in work is essential. For individuals, work provides meaning, financial security as well as social contacts. Organizations need productive employees to survive. Also from a societal perspective, it is important that as many people as possible participate in the labor market to maintain economic welfare (1). Moreover, as a consequence of population aging (2-6), longevity, rapid changes in technology (7, 8) and changes in the nature of work (1), both the need to promote sustainable employability of individuals in society and the complexity to succeed in doing so increase even further. Only recently, van der Klink et al provided the first definition of the concept in the international scientific literature (1, p74): ""Sustainable employability means that throughout their working lives, workers can achieve tangible opportunities in the form of a set of capabilities. They also enjoy the necessary conditions that allow them to make a valuable contribution through their work, now and in the future, while safeguarding their health and welfare. This requires, on the one hand, a work context that facilitates this for them and, on the other, the attitude and motivation to exploit these opportunities."" This definition is accompanied by an equally recent operationalization of SE as a set of capabilities (9). Moreover, the definition itself also appeared in an earlier Dutch publication (10), which other international publications about SE most commonly refer to [ie, in comparison with other definitions in the non-international (eg, Dutch) literature] (11-13). As mentioned, the present paper provides a critical reflection on van der Klink et al's aforementioned definition of SE (1). Merits Van der Klink et al's definition of SE (1) has three important merits. First, SE is seen as a multidimensional construct. It is presented as consisting of a broad set of opportunities for employees to create value for themselves and for their employer that cover various aspects of working. Moreover, the individual's health and well-being as well as attitudinal and motivational aspects are included in the definition as well. This acknowledgement of the multidimensionality of SE is favorable, as it illustrates the complexity of the construct and of what constitutes functioning in work. This is in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (14), in which functioning is seen from three different perspectives (body, activities, and participation). The ICF underlines the multifaceted and complex nature of functioning in which disease, environmental factors, and personal factors play a role. Similarly, the multifaceted nature of functioning is also illustrated by the fact that different disciplines focus on different aspects to understand functioning at work (15, 16). Second, SE is (partially) defined as the degree to which (i) employees are able to work throughout their entire working lives, and (ii) their work context enables them to do so. This suggests that SE is a set of interacting characteristics of the employee and the work context that codetermine the opportunities and conditions affecting employees' capacity to participate in the labor market throughout their working lives. As such, the definition describes an equal responsibility for employee and employer to maintain the employee's ability to work. This could be considered as a great merit, as research shows how strongly an employee's ability to function is influenced by both the individual, work and work-contextual factors (17). Third, van der Klink et al's definition recognizes that SE is an inherently longitudinal construct as clearly embedded in the words ""throughout their working lives"". This is essential as ""sustainable"" necessarily implies a time dimension. Need for further development Despite the aforementioned merits, there are important needs for improvement of van der Klink et al's definition of SE. First, it is not immediately clear from the definition what particular element(s) of the work situation constitute(s) SE. The paper provides some clarity by equating SE with the capability set it propagates, as evidenced by these statements: ""... in an accompanying paper also published in this issue, we report on the development and validation of a questionnaire that allows for the assessment of sustainable employability based on the concept of capability"" (1, p72) and ""This [capability] set, in our view, represents the best possible operationalization of sustainable employability"" (1, p74). However, in the paper, SE is also referred to as being determined by a worker's capability: ""this model holds that an individual's sustainable employability is determined by how he or she succeeds in converting resources into capabilities, and subsequently into work functioning, in such a way that values such as security, recognition and meaning are met""(1, p72). As it is not feasible that SE is predicted by itself in the form of a capability set, perhaps the capability set does not actually refer to SE itself but rather to a favorable employment situation that may cause SE. More clarity on this issue is needed. Second, the definition seems to treat SE as a characteristic of both the job and the individual at the same time. This is counterintuitive and problematic as the job and work context may predict an individual's ability to be sustainably employed, but they can never be aspects that are part of SE. Instead, employability is a characteristic of the individual alone. Of course the individual's ability to be employed does depend on work and work-contextual factors, but these should be predictors and not be embedded in the construct itself. For an adequate definition of SE, it is essential to disentangle these relationships between causes (employment) and effects (employability). Moreover, future approaches should treat SE as an individual characteristic that is an outcome of the complex interaction between other individual, work, and work-contextual characteristics. Third, the definition and operationalization of SE assume that achieving value in work inherently predicts SE and that, therefore, SE can be conceptualized as achieving value in work. This is problematic, as before such claims can be made, such relationships need to be tested with SE as criterion. This is, however, impossible within the approach van der Klink et al provides. (1), as SE is equated with its predictor(s). Therefore, similar to the first conceptual issue, it seems unlikely that the capability set adequately reflects SE. Fourth, the definition by van der Klink et al (1) suggests that SE only applies to individuals who are employed. In the Abma et al publication (9), which accompanies van der Klink's definition paper as a validation paper, this is shown by the way in which capabilities are measured. Moreover, the definition also suggests this because individuals can only be considered to be sustainably employable if their work context enables them to achieve tangible opportunities. However, individuals who are not currently working can still be highly employable and even sustainably so, but just be between jobs. It is therefore not required for individuals to be enabled by their employer to be sustainably employable. Consequently, in line with our aforementioned points on improving the definition, being enabled by an employer to achieve value may be an important predictor of SE, but it is not necessarily part of SE itself. Moreover, future approaches to SE should define the concept in such a way that it is applicable to every individual regardless of employment status. Finally, the definition and operationalization of SE in the form of a capability set do not include any specification on how the longitudinal aspect of SE should be captured. The definition rightfully acknowledges the longitudinal dimension of SE, but its operationalization focuses solely on achieving value. Although achieving value at work may be an important predictor of SE, a complete operationalization and definition should include its longitudinal nature as well. Outlook In conclusion, while van der Klink et al's definition of SE (1) does have strong merits, it requires further improvement. The approach's main drawback is that capabilities seem more apt at describing a potentially important set of predictor(s) of SE than at capturing the construct itself. Either way, future developments in conceptualizing SE should build on the aforementioned merits, but also define SE in a way that (i) clearly labels which aspects of the employment situation constitute SE; (ii) explicitly separates causes and effects; (iii) treats SE as an individual characteristic that may be affected by other employment characteristics at the individual, work, and work-contextual levels; (iv) makes the concept applicable to any individual regardless of their employment status; and (v) clearly addresses the longitudinal nature of SE as embedded in the word ""sustainable"". These guidelines should not only enable the development of an appropriate definition of SE but also a conceptually sound way of measuring the construct.","Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",2016 Jun 1,Finland,2016,10
25379769,Addressing reproductive health disparities as a healthcare management priority: pursuing equity in the era of the Affordable Care Act.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the newest available evidence on maternal and reproductive health disparities, and to describe elements of the Affordable Care Act most likely to impact these disparities. RECENT FINDINGS: Significant racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and reproductive health outcomes have persisted in recent years, contributing to poor outcomes and increasing costs. Pregnancy-related mortality ratios are up to three times higher in Black women compared with non-Hispanic White women, with the risk of severe maternal morbidity also significantly higher in Black and Hispanic women. Unintended pregnancy is twice as likely in minority women. Insurance status, socioeconomic status, and broader social determinants of health are implicated in these disparities. Coverage changes associated with the Affordable Care Act may provide some opportunities to reach communities most at risk. Delivery innovation, payment reform, and further public financing of key services are examples of further management approaches that can be used to address reproductive health disparities. SUMMARY: The Affordable Care Act offers important opportunities to address persistent reproductive health disparities, but significant gaps remain. Efforts must be made to reduce the negative outcomes and high financial and human costs associated with disparities in reproductive health.",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,2014 Dec,England,2014,10
30303466,The Relationship Between Residential Mobility and Behavioral Health Service Use in a National Sample of Adults With Mental Health and/or Substance Abuse Problems.,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with mental health and/or substance abuse problems experience disparities in health care utilization. While previous studies have focused on individual and social determinants of health care use in these populations, few have investigated the role of residential stability, especially in relation to different types of service use (i.e., inpatient vs. outpatient treatment). The present study examined the relationship between residential mobility, defined as the number of residential relocations in the past year, and past-year use of four types of behavioral services (i.e., inpatient and outpatient mental health services, inpatient and outpatient substance abuse services) among a national sample of adults with mental health and/or substance abuse problems. METHODS: Data were drawn from the 2011-2014 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (unweighted N = 43,411). Based on prior literature and theory, we hypothesized that individuals who frequently relocate are more likely to use inpatient services and are less likely to use outpatient services. Logistic regression analyses were conducted and all models controlled for predisposing, need, and enabling factors. RESULTS: Compared to individuals who did not move in the past year, those who moved three or more times were more likely to report using inpatient mental health and substance abuse services. The relationship between residential mobility and outpatient mental health and substance use service use is not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of understanding housing stability as a predictor factor of service use and access. Future research is needed to shed light on the pathway through which residential mobility affects behavioral health service utilization.",Journal of dual diagnosis,2018 Oct-Dec,United States,2018,10
31850858,Health and Climate Change: science calls for global action.,"Climate changes affect social and environmental health determinants such as clean air, ecosystems health, safe drinking water and safe sufficient food. Globally, people at greatest risk of adverse health effects associated with climate change include children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups. Temperature-related death and illness, extreme events, polluted or stressed ecosystems represent relevant issues raising concern for both health and economic consequences. The aim of the Symposium ""Health and Climate Change"" (Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome 3-5 December 2018) was to promote an inter-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach to estimate and prevent climate change-related events as well as to call the authorities to put in place measures to reduce adverse health effects. At the end of the Symposium the Rome International Charter on Health and Climate Change was presented. It includes a series of actions and recommendations, discussed and shared by all the participants, intended to inform policy makers and all the stakeholders involved in the management of climate changes.",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,2019 Oct-Dec,Italy,2019,10
29991390,Defining a migrant-inclusive tuberculosis research agenda to end TB.,"BACKGROUND: Pillar 3 of the End TB Strategy calls for the promotion of research and innovation at the country level to facilitate improved implementation of existing and novel interventions to end tuberculosis (TB). In an era of increasing cross-border migration, there is a specific need to integrate migration-related issues into national TB research agendas. The objective of the present review is to provide a conceptual framework to guide countries in the development and operationalization of a migrant-inclusive TB research agenda. METHODS: We conducted a literature review, complemented by expert opinion and the previous articles in this State of the Art series, to identify important themes central to migration-related TB. We categorized these themes into a framework for a migration-inclusive global TB research agenda across a comprehensive spectrum of research. We developed this conceptual framework taking into account: 1) the biomedical, social and structural determinants of TB; 2) the epidemiologic impact of the migration pathway; and 3) the feasibility of various types of research based on a country's capacity. DISCUSSION: The conceptual framework presented here is based on the key principle that migrants are not inherently different from other populations in terms of susceptibility to known TB determinants, but that they often have exacerbated or additional risks related to their country of origin and the migration process, which must be accounted for in developing comprehensive TB prevention and care strategies. A migrant-inclusive research agenda should systematically consider this wider context to have the highest impact.",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,2018 Aug 1,France,2018,10
27526796,"""All is well"": professionals' documentation of social determinants of health in Swedish Child Health Services health records concerning maltreated children - a mixed method approach.","BACKGROUND: Knowledge about social determinants of health has influenced global health strategies, including early childhood interventions. Some psychosocial circumstances - such as poverty, parental mental health problems, abuse and partner violence - increase the risk of child maltreatment and neglect. Healthcare professionals' awareness of psychosocial issues is of special interest, since they both have the possibility and the obligation to identify vulnerable children. METHODS: Child Health Services health records of 100 children in Malmo, Sweden, who had been placed in, or were to be placed in family foster care, were compared with health records of a matched comparison group of 100 children who were not placed in care. A mixed-method approach integrating quantitative and qualitative analysis was applied. RESULTS: The documentation about the foster care group was more voluminous than for the comparison group. The content was problem-oriented and dominated by severe parental health and social problems, while the child's own experiences were neglected. The professionals documented interaction with healthcare and social functions, but very few reports to the Social Services were noted. For both groups, notes about social structures were almost absent. CONCLUSIONS: Child Health Service professionals facing vulnerable children document parental health issues and interaction with healthcare, but they fail to document living conditions thereby making social structures invisible in the health records. The child perspective is insufficiently integrated in the documentation and serious child protection needs remain unmet, if professionals avoid reporting to Social Services.",BMC pediatrics,2016 Aug 15,England,2016,10
20428279,Searching for systematic reviews of the effects of social and environmental interventions: a case study of children and obesity.,"SETTING: Although an important part of the evidence base in health, systematic reviews are not always easy to find. Difficulties are compounded when interventions under review are ""social and environmental"" (that is, targeting wider determinants of health). The authors explored searches from a descriptive map containing thirty-two systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of social and environmental interventions for childhood obesity. QUESTIONS: Which sources give the highest yield of relevant reviews per 100 records? What is the value of searching databases that index literature beyond the ""health"" arena when looking for data on the effectiveness of social and environmental interventions? METHODS: The authors analyzed search results from nineteen databases and calculated the precision and the relative and unique contribution of each source. RESULTS: Searches of specialist systematic review databases-Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Database of Promoting Health Effectiveness Reviews (DoPHER), and Health Technology Assessment (HTA)-had the highest precision, although MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO located many additional reviews. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews should be searched for health-related reviews. Searches of education, transportation, social policy, and social sciences databases did not identify additional reviews. Searching websites and bibliographies was important. CONCLUSIONS: Searches for review-level evidence could profitably start with the specialist review databases. Searches of the major health-related databases are essential, but database searching beyond them may not identify much additional evidence. Internet and hand-search remain important sources of reviews not found elsewhere. Comparison of the results with previous research suggests that appropriate sources for locating primary and secondary evidence may be different.",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,2010 Apr,United States,2010,10
28346280,Conjunctivochalasis and Related Factors in an Adult Population of Iran.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of conjunctivochalasis and its determinants in a middle-aged Iranian population. METHODS: This population-based study was conducted in the context of the second phase of Shahroud Eye Cohort Study in 2014. Of 4,737 participants aged 45 to 69 years who participated in the second phase, the data of 4,702 participants were available for this report. A diagnosis of conjunctivochalasis was made based on the physician's judgment on ophthalmic examinations. RESULTS: Diagnosis of conjunctivochalasis in at least one eye was confirmed in 295 (6.2%) participants. The prevalence of unilateral and bilateral conjunctivochalasis was 0.7% and 5.5%, respectively. Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-3.15), use of Losartan (an angiotensin II receptor antagonist) (OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.05-2.08), Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (OR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.78-3.03), Pinguecula (OR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.42-0.77), and blepharitis (OR=0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.77) had a significant association with conjunctivochalasis. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of conjunctivochalasis in our study was less than other reports from Asian population.

26597699,Heterosexual transmission of HIV in the Dominican Republic: gendered indicators are associated with disparities in condom use.,"BACKGROUND: Gendered dynamics in heterosexual relationships compromise women's self-efficacy and increase their vulnerability to acquiring HIV. This study examines the impact of socioeconomic determinants, media exposure, and sexual expectations on sexual behaviors of men and women in the Dominican Republic (DR). METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 51,018 adults in the Dominican Republic age 15 to 45 years collected by the Demographics and Health Survey (DHS) in 2007. Measures included demographic and socioeconomic indicators, social exposures, sexual expectations and sexual behaviors. Logistic regression models explored gender differences in condom use. RESULTS: Study findings indicated that women were less likely to use a condom at last intercourse than men (odds ratio [OR] = 0.29; 95 % CI = 0.27, 0.31). Among men, secondary (OR = 1.43; 95 % CI = 1.16, 1.76) and higher education (OR = 1.58; 95 % CI = 1.25, 2.00), being in the richest quintile (OR = 1.25; 95 % CI = 1.07, 1.47), and living in a female-headed household (OR = 1.13; 95 % CI 1.03, 1.23) increased the likelihood of condom use. Compared to never married men, currently and formerly married men were less likely to use condoms (OR = 0.03; 95 % CI = 0.03, 0.04 and OR = 0.67; 95 % CI = 0.60, 0.75, respectively). The odds of condom use increased for young women 15-19 years old in comparison with women age 30-34 years, but decreased as they grew older. For women, being in the richer quintile (OR = 1.28; 95 % CI = 1.06, 1.54), living in a female-headed household (OR = 1.26; 1.12, 1.41), and having good access to media (OR = 1.24; 95 % CI = 1.12, 1.42) increased the likelihood of condom use. Being currently married or formerly married and living in rural areas decreased such likelihood among women. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings provide evidence that, in the DHS, socioeconomic and cultural differences between men and women affects condom use. Efforts to reduce HIV transmission within heterosexual relationships in the DR call for tailored, gender-specific interventions that take into account gender differences of power and sexual behaviors.",BMC public health,2015 Nov 23,England,2015,10
29349264,Life course influences on later life health in China: Childhood health exposure and socioeconomic mediators during adulthood.,"China's unprecedented population aging and social and economic change raise important issues concerning life course determinants of advantage or disadvantage into later life. Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2013 were analysed to identify the influence of childhood health on later life health as indicated by self-rated health and how this influence could be mediated by social and economic positions (SEP) and resources later in the life span. CHARLS provides nationally representative data on 18, 000 individuals aged 45 years and above in approximately 150 districts and 450 villages. Both multivariate logit regression model and KHB method (Karlson/Holm/Breen method) were applied to examine and decompose the life span influences on later life health. The results show that the childhood health, accounts for approximately half of the effect directly and another half of the effect indirectly through social and economic variations during adulthood. Relative living standard, marital status and urban residence are the most significant and important social and economic mediators for men; For women, living standard and secondary schooling are most influential while marital status is not significant. Implications for social and economic policies to improve later life health are discussed.",SSM - population health,2017 Dec,England,2017,10
31339443,The Relationship Between Childhood Adversity and Other Aspects of Clinical Complexity in Psychiatric Outpatients.,"Childhood abuse, neglect, and loss are common in psychiatric patients, and the relationship between childhood adversity and adult mental illness is well known. However, beyond diagnoses that are specifically trauma-related, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, there has been little research on how childhood adversity contributes to complex presentations that require more intensive treatment. We examined the relationship between childhood adversity and other contributors to clinical complexity in adult outpatients seeking mental health assessment. In a cross-sectional study, patients completed standard measures of psychological distress and functional impairment. Psychiatrists completed an inventory of clinical complexity, which included childhood abuse, neglect, and loss. Of 4,903 patients seen over 15 months, 1,315 (27%) both consented to research and had the measure of complexity completed. Childhood abuse or neglect was identified in 474 (36.0%) and significant childhood loss in 236 (17.9%). Correcting for multiple comparisons and controlling for psychiatric diagnosis, age, and sex, patients with childhood abuse or neglect were significantly more likely to also have 11 of 31 other indices of clinical complexity, with odds ratios ranging from 1.7 to 5.0. Both childhood abuse or neglect and childhood loss were associated with greater overall complexity (i.e., more indices of complexity, chi(2) = 136 and 38 respectively, each p < .001). Childhood abuse and neglect (but not childhood loss) were significantly associated with psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K10] score, F = 6.2, p = .01) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 [WHODAS 2.0] score, F = 5.0, p = .03). Childhood abuse and neglect were associated with many characteristics that contribute to clinical complexity, and thus to suboptimal outcomes to standard, guideline-based care. Screening may alert psychiatrists to the need for intensive, patient-centered, and trauma-informed treatments. Identifying childhood adversity as a common antecedent of complexity may facilitate developing transdiagnostic programs that specifically target sources of complexity.",Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 Jul 24,United States,2019,10
26678804,Job satisfaction of urban community health workers after the 2009 healthcare reform in China: a systematic review.,"PURPOSE: In 2009 China introduced a new round of healthcare reform to strengthen primary care networks through the development of Community Health Services (CHS). This study aimed to measure the degree of overall job satisfaction and also satisfaction dimensions and then find common causes of dissatisfaction among Community Health Workers (CHWs) in urban China by conducting a systematic review of relevant studies on CHWs' job satisfaction. DATA SOURCES: Web of Science, PubMed, Google scholar, Wanfangdata and CNKI were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Publications about job satisfaction of CHWs were screened and assessed. Finally 18 Chinese articles and 4 English articles were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted for nine themes concerning job satisfaction. Narrative synthesis was employed to analyze the data. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: CHWs were generally neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with their work after 2009. Financial rewards and opportunities for professional development were the most important determinants of job dissatisfaction. Workers were generally satisfied with interpersonal relationships in the workplace. The expanded public health services package and human-resources related regulations, e.g. the professional rank promotion system, government-controlled staffing policy (i.e. staff-quota system) and government-controlled budgetary planning (i.e. the Separation of Revenue and Expenditure), were policies that had an effect on job satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Financial rewards and professional development were the two main predictors of job satisfaction. To improve CHS in China, policy-makers (especially the central government) need to consider the impact of current policies on job satisfaction in order to reduce job dissatisfaction.",International journal for quality in health care : journal of the International Society for Quality in Health Care,2016 Feb,England,2016,10
28503391,Prevalence and Predictors of Use of Home Sphygmomanometers Among Hypertensive Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Few studies have looked at the predictors of use of home sphygmomanometers among hypertensive patients in low-income countries such as Pakistan. Considering the importance of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of the usage of all kinds of HBPM devices. METHOD: This study was conducted in Karachi during the time period of January-February 2017. Adult patients previously diagnosed with hypertension visiting tertiary care hospitals were selected for the study. Interviews from the individuals were conducted after verbal consent using a pre-coded questionnaire. The data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v. 23.0 (SPSS, IBM Corporation, NY, USA). Chi-squared test was applied as the primary statistical test. RESULTS: More than half of the participants used a home sphygmomanometer (n=250, 61.7%). The age, level of education, family history of hypertension, compliance to drugs and blood pressure (BP) monitoring, few times a month at clinics were significant determinants of HBPM (P values < 0.001). It was found that more individuals owned a digital sphygmomanometer (n=128, 51.3%) as compared to a manual type (n=122, 48.8%). Moreover, avoiding BP measurement in a noisy environment was the most common precaution taken (n=117, 46.8%). CONCLUSION: The study showed that around 40% of the hypertensive individuals did not own a sphygmomanometer and less than 25% performed HBPM regularly. General awareness by healthcare professionals can be a possible factor which can increase HBPM.",Cureus,2017 Apr 11,United States,2017,10
22253320,Socio-economic status is associated with epigenetic differences in the pSoBid cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetic programming and epigenetic mechanisms driven by environmental factors are thought to play an important role in human health and ageing. Global DNA methylation has been postulated as an epigenetic marker for epidemiological studies as it is reflective of changes in gene expression linked to disease. How epigenetic mechanisms are affected by psychological, sociological and biological determinants of health still remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between socio-economic and lifestyle factors and epigenetic status, as measured by global DNA methylation content, in the pSoBid cohort, which is characterized by an extreme socio-economic and health gradient. METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Maxwell(R) 16 System and Maxwell(R) 16 Blood DNA Purification kit (Promega, UK). Global DNA methylation was assessed using Methylamp Global DNA Methylation Quantification Ultra kit (Epigentek, USA). Associations between global DNA methylation and socio-economic and lifestyle factors were investigated in linear regression models. RESULTS: Global DNA hypomethylation was observed in the most socio-economically deprived subjects. Job status demonstrated a similar relationship, with manual workers having 24% lower DNA methylation content than non-manual. Additionally, associations were found between global DNA methylation content and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and inflammation, including fibrinogen and interleukin-6 (IL-6), after adjustment for socio-economic factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study has indicated an association between epigenetic status and socio-economic status (SES). This relationship has direct implications for population health and is reflected in further associations between global DNA methylation content and emerging biomarkers of CVD.",International journal of epidemiology,2012 Feb,England,2012,10
28177447,Suicide mortality in Belgium at the beginning of the 21st century: differences according to migrant background.,"Background: Suicidal behaviour has long been recognized to vary widely between countries. Yet, rates of suicidal behaviour do not only vary between, but also within countries. Gender and socioeconomic differences in suicidal behaviour are well established, but the literature on suicidal behaviour and migrants is sparse, particularly in Belgium. The present study maps out the occurrence of suicide mortality across three of the largest migrant groups (Italians, Turks and Moroccans) versus the native population in Belgium, and verifies whether this association persists after accounting for socioeconomic variables. Methods: Census-linked mortality follow-up data covering the period 2001-2011 were used to probe into suicide mortality. To compare absolute differences by migrant background, indirect standardisation analyses were carried out. To assess relative differences, Cox proportional hazards models were performed. Analyses were restricted to 18- to 64-year-olds. Results: Belgian men and women have the highest suicide mortality risk, persons of Moroccan/Turkish origin the lowest, and Italians are somewhere in between. When migration generation is considered, the risk is higher for second-generation groups compared to that of the first-generation. Accounting for socioeconomic determinants, the difference between the native population and the various nationality groups intensifies. Conclusion: Although the risk is generally lower for minorities compared to the majority population, the results across migration generations underscore minorities' increased vulnerability to suicide over time. Future research should focus on understanding the risks and protective factors of suicidal behaviour across different nationality groups. This way, tailored policy recommendations can be developed in order to tackle the burden of suicide.",European journal of public health,2017 Feb 1,England,2017,10
27183187,Predictors of physical activity in persons with mental illness: Testing a social cognitive model.,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether the social cognitive theory (SCT) model can be used to explain the variance in physical exercise among persons with serious mental illnesses. METHOD: A cross-sectional, correlational design was employed. Participants from community mental health centers and supported housing programs (N = 120) completed 9 measures on exercise, social support, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, barriers, and goal-setting. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression tested the relationship between self-report physical activity and SCT determinants while controlling for personal characteristics. The model explained 25% of the variance in exercise. Personal characteristics explained 18% of the variance in physical activity, SCT variables of social support, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, barriers, and goals were entered simultaneously, and they added an r2 change value of .07. Gender (beta = -.316, p = .001) and Brief Symptom Inventory Depression subscale (beta = -2.08, p < .040) contributed significantly to the prediction of exercise. In a separate stepwise multiple regression, we entered only SCT variables as potential predictors of exercise. Goal-setting was the single significant predictor, F(1, 118) = 13.59, p < .01), r2 = .10. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: SCT shows promise as an explanatory model of exercise in persons with mental illnesses. Goal-setting practices, self-efficacy, outcome expectations and social support from friends for exercise should be encouraged by psychiatric rehabilitation practitioners. People with more depressive symptoms and women exercise less. More work is needed on theoretical exploration of predictors of exercise.

27160832,Weight self-stigma and its association with quality of life and psychological distress among overweight and obese women.,"BACKGROUND: There are limiting studies evaluating the weight self-stigma and its association with eating disorders and health concerns. However, no study is available evaluating weight self-stigma and its determinants among reproductive age women in Iran. The aim of this study was to evaluate weight self-stigma and its association with quality of life and psychological distress among overweight and obese Iranian women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current cross-sectional study was performed among 170 women aged 17-45 years referring to health centers of Tabriz-Iran. Anthropometric assessments were performed. Weight self-stigma was assessed by weight self-stigma questionnaire (WSSQ). Evaluation of quality of life and psychological distress was performed using SF-12 and general health questionnaires (GHQ-12), respectively. Analysis of data was performed by multivariate hierarchical regression analysis using SPSS 18 software. RESULTS: In this study, the multivariate hierarchical regression analysis revealed that being married and having low total weight self-stigma and fear of enacted stigma (FES) scores were associated with better physical component summary scores (p < 0.05). Whereas, younger ages and lower total weight self-stigma scores were associated with better mental component summary scores. In addition, lower weight self-stigma total scores and lower self-devaluation scores were predictors of lower psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated the negative impacts of weight self-stigma on quality of life and psychological distress among overweight and obese women. Since weight stigma might be a potent barrier of obese individuals to engage in health promoting behaviors, therefore, the results of the current study further warrants the need for developing interventional strategies to reduce the adverse impacts of weight stigma on quality of life via including the reduction of weight self-stigma as a key therapeutic goal in obesity treatment programs.",Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2017 Sep,Germany,2017,10
29190544,The contribution of occupational factors on frailty.,"INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a clinical condition characterized by enhanced vulnerability to stressors and increased risk of developing dependency and/or mortality. It has been described as the multidimensional and dynamic condition that cannot be easily disentangled from psychosocial determinants. To date, the possible role of occupational factors on frailty development and its progression at advanced age are not yet fully understood. The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of existing evidence exploring the relationship between multiple occupational issues (e.g., employment history, workplace risk factors, organizational job characteristics) and frailty. METHODS: A systematic search and revision of available literature addressing the contribution of occupational factors on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of frailty in the elderly was performed in the Pubmed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases. RESULTS: The major weaknesses of existing literature reside in the heterogeneous operationalization of frailty and the limited description of the workplace factors. Nevertheless, an association between life-course occupational conditions and frailty was documented. In particular, intrinsically harder, manual, or blue-collar occupations emerged as possible determinants of the frailty manifestation and severity at older age. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results do not allow extrapolating definite conclusions. Further studies are needed. However, it seems that a significant relationship exists between the life-course occupation and frailty at advanced age. From a public health and social geriatric perspective, this work may provide the basis to define future innovations for preventing frailty at elderly adopting a life-course approach.",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2018 Mar - Apr,Netherlands,2018,10
31369395,The effects of Vitex agnus-castus on menstrual bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Introduction Vitex agnus-castus, also called Vitex, is a plant with many medicinal properties. This systematic study examined the evidence of the effectiveness and safety of Vitex on menstrual bleeding (primary outcome) and its side effects (secondary outcomes). Materials and methods This systematic review study examined all papers that were a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental, and cross-over conducted on the effect of Vitex on menstrual bleeding, following the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) criteria without any time limits in December 2017. The participants were women of reproductive age with no gynecologic disorders. The intervention included the use of Vitex in form of tablets, capsule, or oral drops with different doses. The control group included the placebo or mefenamic acid group. The search strategy in this study was in accordance with MeSH terms. The keywords used separately or in combination with other words were Menstrual bleeding OR Menstruation OR Menorrhagia AND Vitexcastus OR Vitex OR Chasteberry AND randomized controlled trial OR randomized trial OR randomized clinical trial OR randomized controlled. All papers, including Persian or English, were searched for in the databases; Medline (through PubMed), Scopus, Embase (through Ovid), Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, SID, Magiran, Irandoc, and Iranmedex, without any time limits. Two authors independently reviewed the quality of the papers and assessed the risk of bias based on Cochrane handbook, and the disputes were resolved through discussion and consensus with a third person. The meta-analysis was done on continuous data (mean of menstrual bleeding). In meta-analysis, subgroup analysis was performed based on the type of comparison group. Results Out of the 8,905 searched papers in the databases, 8,905 titles, 720 abstracts, 85 full texts, and 20 references of the papers were reviewed, of which 5 papers entered this study. Based on the subgroup analysis, the consumption of Vitex did not have a significant effect on the amount of menstrual bleeding compared to the placebo group in the first (mean difference [MD]: 3.08; 95% CI: -3.11-9.26; p=0.33; I2=0%) and second menstrual cycles (MD: 0.00; 95% CI: -5.75-5.75; p=1.00; I2=0%). Also, the Higham mean score was statistically more in the Vitex group compared to the mefenamic acid group in the first menstrual cycle (MD: 7.17; 95% CI: 0.33-14.01; p=0.04; I2=0%) but there was no statistical significant difference between Vitex and mefenamic acid groups in the second menstrual cycle (MD: 12.18; 95% CI: -5.57-29.94; p=0.18; I2=75%). Only nausea and abdominal pain were reported as side effects of Vitex in the included studies. Conclusions The results of this study showed that the consumption of Vitex in the intervention group did not have a significant effect on menstrual bleeding in comparison with the placebo group. However, due to the relatively low quality of the papers, it is essential to perform clinical trials with an appropriate design to determine the effect of Vitex on menstrual bleeding.",Journal of complementary & integrative medicine,2019 Jul 31,Germany,2019,10
29694543,A framework to assess management performance in district health systems: a qualitative and quantitative case study in Iran.,"The aim was to design a district health management performance framework for Iran's healthcare system. The mixed-method study was conducted between September 2015 and May 2016 in Tabriz, Iran. In this study, the indicators of district health management performance were obtained by analyzing the 45 semi-structured surveys of experts in the public health system. Content validity of performance indicators which were generated in qualitative part were reviewed and confirmed based on content validity index (CVI). Also content validity ratio (CVR) was calculated using data acquired from a survey of 21 experts in quantitative part. The result of this study indicated that, initially, 81 indicators were considered in framework of district health management performance and, at the end, 53 indicators were validated and confirmed. These indicators were classified in 11 categories which include: human resources and organizational creativity, management and leadership, rules and ethics, planning and evaluation, district managing, health resources management and economics, community participation, quality improvement, research in health system, health information management, epidemiology and situation analysis. The designed framework model can be used to assess the district health management and facilitates performance improvement at the district level.",Cadernos de saude publica,2018,Brazil,2018,10
27764969,'Yarning up with Koori kids' - hearing the voices of Australian urban Indigenous children about their health and well-being.,"OBJECTIVE: Australian Indigenous children experience some of the most substantial health inequalities globally. In this context, research regarding their health and well-being has overemphasised physical illnesses with limited exploration of a diverse range of dimensions and determinants, particularly those based on Indigenous holistic understandings of health and well-being. This deficit-based approach has thus missed many strengths and assets of Indigenous children. This research aimed to gain insight into the perspectives of Indigenous children about their health and well-being in an urban setting in Australia. It joins a limited international literature examining views and experiences of non-majority children. DESIGN: Participatory and qualitative child-friendly research methods were utilised. The project was developed in partnership with Indigenous community organisations and members. Photo-elicitation activities and focus groups were conducted with 31 Indigenous children aged 8-12 years. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, combining focus group and interview data. RESULTS: It was evident an urban Indigenous child perspective of health and well-being includes rich understandings of the interconnectedness of physical, social-emotional and cultural dimensions of holism, as well as the integral importance of family and community relationships. The study also found that specific worries regarding loss of loved ones and racism were highly salient in Indigenous children's lives. CONCLUSION: The overwhelming conclusion to be drawn from this research is that Indigenous children in urban areas need ongoing recognition of both their agency and resilience in the face of adversity, within a wider context of historical and contemporary racialisation and racism.",Ethnicity & health,2017 Dec,England,2017,10
31881652,The Shamba Chef Educational Entertainment Program to Promote Modern Cookstoves in Kenya: Outcomes and Dose-Response Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Globally, an estimated 3.6 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking over open fires or in simple cookstoves. Universal access to clean cooking fuels and technology by 2030 is a United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal. METHODS: The Mediae Company created a home makeover television and radio show, Shamba Chef, designed to promote modern, cleaner, safer cooking methods and improved nutrition in Kenya, which reached 5 million homes in late 2017. This was accompanied by a mobile phone platform called iChef. Researchers evaluated the effects of Shamba Chef on cookstove purchase, use, and attitudes, beliefs, and intentions. RESULTS: The study revealed dose-response effects of Shamba Chef exposure on several key outcomes. Exposure to the program was associated with an awareness of improved biomass stoves (OR 4.4; 95% CI 2.8 to 6.9), and aspirations to own an improved biomass stove (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.9). Receiving information about modern stoves from two or more sources generated greater awareness of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.1). The qualitative study revealed that Shamba Chef explained how the stoves worked, communicated their benefits, and encouraged participants to trust and purchase those cookstoves. CONCLUSION: Shamba Chef was successful in influencing determinants of cookstove purchase and use, and there is evidence from the qualitative study that it influenced the purchase and use of improved biomass stoves.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 Dec 25,Switzerland,2019,10
30545425,Changes in income-related inequalities in cervical cancer screening during the Spanish economic crisis: a decomposition analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers, but it may be prevented by early detection. Social inequalities in the use of cytology testing have been identified in the literature. However, the degree of income-related inequality has not been quantified and determinants of inequality changes during the economic crisis remain unknown. METHODS: Using the Spanish National Health Surveys (2006-07 / 2011-12), we analyzed how income-related inequalities in the use of cervical cancer screening for women aged 25-64 changed across the economic crisis. We used corrected concentration indices (CCI) which were further decomposed in order to compute the contribution of the explanatory variables. An Oaxaca-type approach was employed to investigate the origin of changes over time. RESULTS: Our final sample consisted of 10,743 observations in 2006-07 and 6587 in 2011-12. Despite the higher prevalence of screening over time (from 73.9 to 77.9%), pro-rich inequality significantly increased (from CCI = 0.1726 to CCI = 0.1880, p < 0.001). Income was the main determinant of inequality in cervical screening, although its contribution decreased over time, as well as the contribution of the type of health insurance, mainly due to changes in elasticity. Other factors, such as nationality or the educational level, seem to have played an important role in the increase of pro-rich inequality of cytology testing. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing cervical screening inequalities would require actions focused on most vulnerable groups such as migrants, low income and low educated population. The implementation of population-based screening programs would also help to cope with income-related inequalities in cytology testing.",International journal for equity in health,2018 Dec 13,England,2018,10
30285599,Exploring the Social Determinants of Animal Health.,"An understanding of the One Health and EcoHealth concepts by students is dependent on medical pedagogy and veterinary medical pedagogy having similarities that allow a common discourse. Medical pedagogy includes a focus on the social, political, and economic forces that affect human health, while this discourse is largely absent from veterinary medical pedagogy. There is, however, a gradient in health that human and animal populations experience. This health gradient in human populations, which runs from low to high according to the World Health Organization, is largely explained by ""the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.""(1,2) Regarding the human health gradient, other authors have broadened the list of conditions to include access to health care systems used to prevent disease and treat illness, and the distribution of power, money, and resources, which are shaped by social, economic, and political forces.(1,2) In human medicine, these conditions are collectively termed the social determinants of health (SDH). Veterinarians who work with the public encounter people and their animals at both the low and the high end of the health gradient. This article explores the concept of the parallel social determinants of animal health (SDAH) using examples within urban, rural, and remote communities in North America as well as abroad. We believe that in order to understand the One Health paradigm it is imperative that veterinary pedagogy include information on, and competence in, SDH and SDAH to ultimately achieve improvements in human, animal, and environmental health and wellbeing.",Journal of veterinary medical education,2018 Oct 4,Canada,2018,10
30973825,Development and psychometric properties of the female adolescents' sexual reproductive self-care scale.,"Introduction The aim of this study was to design and evaluate the psychometric properties of an instrument for understanding female adolescents' reproductive and sexual self-care behaviors. Methods A methodological study was conducted. In the qualitative phase, individual in-depth interviews were performed to develop the initial questionnaire. In the quantitative part, the psychometric properties of the questionnaire were evaluated. Findings The initial questionnaire with 128 items was reviewed by the research team and taking into account the cut-off point 1.5 for the item impact and 0.62 for the content validity ratio (CVR), the number of questions fell to 82 items. S-CVR and S-content validity index (CVI) rations were 0.83 and 0.91, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis led to 74 items in seven dimensions. The alpha Cronbach's coefficient for the whole questionnaire was 0.895 and the intra-cluster correlation coefficient was 0.91. Conclusion The questionnaire developed in this study is reliable and valid for assessing female adolescents' sexual and reproductive self-care.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2019 Apr 11,Germany,2019,10
25031450,The unknown citizen: epidemiological challenges in child mental health.,"Growing concern about the global burden of child mental health disorders has generated an increased interest in population-level efforts to improve child mental health. This in turn has led to a shift in emphasis away from treatment of established disorders and towards prevention and promotion. Prevention efforts are able to draw on a substantial epidemiological literature describing the prevalence and determinants of child mental health disorders. However, there is a striking lack of clearly conceptualised and measurable positive outcomes for child mental health, which may result in missed opportunities to identify optimal policy and intervention strategies. In this paper, we propose an epidemiological approach to child mental health which is in keeping with public health principles and with the WHO definition of health, and which is grounded in current thinking about child development. Constructs such as competence offer the opportunity to develop rigorous outcome measures for epidemiological research, while broader ideas about 'the good life' and 'the good society' derived from philosophical thinking can enable us to shape policy initiatives based on normative ideas of optimal child mental health that extend beyond individuals and undoubtedly beyond the traditional boundaries of the health sector.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2014 Oct,England,2014,10
23088503,The impact of parental bonding on sexual distress in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,"INTRODUCTION: Psychosomatic and social issues have been found to be determinants of sexual distress in diabetic and non-diabetic populations. However, the role of parental bonding as a determinant for sexual distress has not been studied in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM-1). AIM: To study the role of parental care and overprotection, in the pathogenesis of sexual distress in women with DM-1. METHODS: Seventy-seven women with uncomplicated DM-1 and 77 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), the General Health Questionnaire-28, and the Parental Bonding Instrument were used to evaluate sexual distress, general health and bonding with parents, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess the role of parental bonding as risk factor for sexual distress, in women with DM-1. RESULTS: Women with DM-1 had significantly higher FSDS scores compared with controls. Furthermore, women with DM-1 had significantly higher maternal and paternal care, and lower maternal overprotection in comparison with the healthy ones. Paternal overprotection and general health were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Sexual distress was more frequent in women with DM-1 (31.43% vs. 8.57% of controls, P < 0.05). Diabetic women with sexual distress had lower maternal care, higher maternal overprotection and lower paternal overprotection compared to diabetics without sexual distress (P < 0.05). No difference was found in the paternal care between the two groups (P > 0.05). Moreover, sexually distressed DM-1 women had worse general health parameters in comparison with the non-sexually distressed diabetics (P < 0.05). In the DM-1 group, low maternal care and low paternal overprotection were significant risk factors for sexual distress (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Parental care and overprotection can lead to sexual distress and, therefore, to Female Sexual Dysfunction in DM-1 women. Evaluation of parental bonding is necessary in DM-1 women with distressing sexual problems.",The journal of sexual medicine,2013 Feb,Netherlands,2013,10
30388880,"Children's Independent Mobility: Current Knowledge, Future Directions, and Public Health Implications.","Environmental changes significantly impact health behavior. Active travel behavior is mostly affected by increasing motorization, urban sprawl, and traffic safety. Especially for children, active and independent travel can contribute to physical activity, social and motor development, and other health-related outcomes. A reduced number of children engaging in independent mobility over the last 20 years demanded researchers to further examine the construct of children's independent mobility. By examining relevant literature, this narrative review aims to provide the current state of knowledge on children's independent mobility, and identify future directions in research, as well as practical implications. From a public health perspective, considering children's independent mobility in intervention programs is recommended, since it is associated with numerous health and environmental benefits. To develop interventions, multilevel socio-ecological influences on children's independent mobility are widely examined; however, evidence is limited due to heterogeneous measurements and a lack of high-quality prospective studies. To oppose the decline in children's independent mobility, further analysis using comparable measures is needed to understand the determinants of children's independent mobility and to enable international comparison.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2018 Nov 1,Switzerland,2018,10
26929951,Predictors of Prosthodontic Treatment-Related Behavior Using the Theory of Planned Behavior Framework.,"The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to assess subjects' intentions and behavior to predict willingness to undergo prosthodontic care. A questionnaire was administered to 225 adults with history of teeth loss who currently were not under prosthodontic treatment. The questionnaire comprised TPB components (attitude toward behaviour [ATB], subjective norm [SN], and perceived behavioral control [PBC]) containing items with potential influence on the intentions and behavior of individuals toward prosthodontic care. Clinical and socioeconomic data were also assessed. A path regression model was constructed explaining two dependent variables simultaneously: one explained the influence of PBC on intention (R2=0.04) and another explained the influence of dental arch, position of lost teeth, socioeconomic status, and PBC on behavior (R2=0.31). It was concluded that PBC was a relevant TPB component that encompasses perception of costs, opportunity cost, perceived need, and access to dental care. Clinical and socioeconomic factors were also major determinants of behavior toward prosthodontic treatment.",The International journal of prosthodontics,2016 Mar-Apr,United States,2016,10
27132687,The double burden of neoliberalism? Noncommunicable disease policies and the global political economy of risk.,"The growing prevalence of NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is now recognized as one of the major global health policy issues of the early 21st century. Current official approaches reflect ambivalence about how health policy should approach the social determinants of health identified by the WHO Commission on the topic that released its report in 2008, and in particular the role of macro-scale economic and social processes. Authoritative framing of options for NCD prevention in advance of the September, 2011 UN high-level meeting on NCDs arguably relied on a selective reading of the scientific (including social scientific) evidence, and foregrounded a limited number of risk factors defined in terms of individual behavior: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, alcohol (ab)use and physical inactivity. The effect was to reproduce at a transnational level the individualization of responsibility for health that characterizes most health promotion initiatives in high-income countries, ignoring both the limited control that many people have over their exposure to these risk factors and the contribution of macro-scale processes like trade liberalization and the marketing activities of transnational corporations to the global burden of NCDs. An alternative perspective focuses on ""the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources"" described by the WHO Commission, and the ways in which policies that address those inequities can avoid unintentional incorporation of neoliberal constructions of risk and responsibility.",Health & place,2016 May,England,2016,10
30061513,'Buying Salad Is a Lot More Expensive than Going to McDonalds': Young Adults' Views about What Influences Their Food Choices.,"Young adults (18(-)30 years of age) are an 'at-risk' group for poor dietary behaviours and less healthy food choices. Previous research with young adults has looked at the barriers and enablers driving their food choices, focusing primarily on university and college students. However, there is less research using qualitative methods with young adults as a broader population group. This study aimed to explore the experiences of young adults in two different yet similar settings: Sydney, Australia and Glasgow, Scotland. Eight focus groups of young adult participants, ranging in size from 2(-)6 participants, were held in Sydney, Australia (n = 14) and Glasgow, Scotland (n = 16) to discuss, explore and compare the determinants and influences of their food choices. Focus group transcripts were coded thematically based on a process of narrative analysis. Three major narratives were identified across both locations: value of food; appeal of food; and emotional connections with food. These narratives were underpinned by a broader narrative of 'performing adulthood.' This narrative reflected a belief amongst participants that they should make rational, informed choices about food despite this conflicting with their broader food environment. Future research could examine which environment-level or policy-based interventions are most acceptable to young adults in terms of influencing their food choices and dietary behaviours.",Nutrients,2018 Jul 30,Switzerland,2018,10
31154293,The feasibility and potential use of case-tracked client journeys in primary healthcare: a pilot study.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of case-tracking methods in documenting client journeys at primary healthcare (PHC) services in order to investigate the comprehensiveness of service responses and the experiences of clients. DESIGN: Prospective pilot study. Quantitative and qualitative case management data were collected from staff via questionnaire or interview. SETTING: Five Australian multidisciplinary PHC services were involved including four South Australian state-managed and one Northern Territory Aboriginal community-controlled PHC service. PARTICIPANTS: Clients using services for depression (95) or diabetes (185) at the PHC services were case tracked over a 12-month period to allow construction of client journeys for these two conditions. Clients being tracked were invited to participate in two semi-structured interviews (21) and complete a health log. RESULTS: Though a number of challenges were encountered, the case-tracking methods were useful in documenting the complex nature of client journeys for those with depression or diabetes accessing PHC services and the need to respond to the social determinants of health. A flexible research design was crucial to respond to the needs of staff and changing organisational environments. CONCLUSIONS: The client journeys provided important information about the services' responses to depression and diabetes, and about aspects unique to comprehensive PHC such as advocacy and work that takes into account the social determinants of health.",BMJ open,2019 Jun 1,England,2019,10
28293480,"The role of genes, intelligence, personality, and social engagement in cognitive performance in Klinefelter syndrome.","INTRODUCTION: The determinants of cognitive deficits among individuals with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) are not well understood. This study was conducted to assess the impact of general intelligence, personality, and social engagement on cognitive performance among patients with KS and a group of controls matched for age and years of education. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with KS and 69 controls were assessed in terms of IQ, NEO personality inventory, the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scale, and measures of cognitive performance reflecting working memory and executive function. RESULTS: Patients with KS performed more poorly on memory and executive-function tasks. Patients with KS also exhibited greater neuroticism and less extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness than controls. Memory deficits among patients with KS were associated with lower intelligence, while diminished executive functioning was mediated by both lower intelligence and less social engagement. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that among patients with KS, memory deficits are principally a function of lower general intelligence, while executive-function deficits are associated with both lower intelligence and poorer social skills. This suggests a potential influence of social engagement on executive cognitive functioning (and/or vice-versa) among individuals with KS, and perhaps those with other genetic disorders. Future longitudinal research would be important to further clarify this and other issues discussed in this research.",Brain and behavior,2017 Mar,United States,2017,10
27364390,Sex-driven vulnerability in stress and drug abuse.,"A growing body of literature shows that a link exists between substance abuse and stress and that the crosstalk of sex hormones with the neuroendocrine system might differently prime vulnerability to drug addiction in male and female subjects. Thus, understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction and the identification of sex-driven determinants in vulnerability to drug abuse may help to better devise and/or implement strategic (pharmacological, behavioural, social) interventions to prevent or face the issue of addiction. Differences between sexes can be found at all stages of life (in both the animal model and human studies) and may account for genetic, epigenetic and environmental/hormonal factors that in turn affect the functionality of the whole organism leading also to a sex-driven differential vulnerability or resilience to non-communicable pathologies. These include the onset and precipitation of stress-related psychiatric disorders as well as ""substance-related and addictive disorders"" (as defined in the DSM-V). This paper reviews the scientific literature highlighting significant differences in male and female subjects in stress and neuroendocrine function and the implications for sex-dependent differential vulnerability to drug addiction.",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,2016 Apr-Jun,Italy,2016,10
30866874,"""If you can, change this system"" -Pregnant asylum seekers' perceptions on social determinants and material circumstances affecting their health whilst living in state-provided accommodation in Germany - a prospective, qualitative case study.","BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and new mothers seeking asylum are highly vulnerable and have special needs, yet there is dearth of research related to this group in Germany. This paper reports on material circumstances and behavioural factors as social determinants of asylum seekers' health during pregnancy and early motherhood. The study aim was to gain in-depth insights into these women's experiences and perceived needs with a focus on material circumstances whilst living in state-provided accommodation in one federal state in Southern Germany. METHODS: A qualitative, prospective approach was taken with individual semi-structured interviews of participants during pregnancy and up to the six-week postnatal assessment, aiming at interviewing each woman twice during pregnancy and once after giving birth. Two female interviewers performed interviews assisted by female professional interpreters on the telephone. Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. An inductive approach was taken to perform content analysis of interview material. RESULTS: 21 interviews were performed with nine women seeking asylum in pregnancy and early motherhood. Content analysis of women's perceived health-related needs revealed significant health challenges due to considerable constraints in two major themes each with associated categories: a) material circumstances and b) behavioural factors. Participants' experiences of living conditions included significant challenges in terms of housing and neighbourhood quality e.g. poor hygiene standards with fear of disease and restless sleep due to threats of violence. Consumption potential was severely limited because of a minimal living allowance. Food was a major preoccupation for all participants. Catering services in state-provided accommodation were perceived as unsatisfactory and neglecting religious practices. Institutional food provided adequate calorific intake but participants reported loss of appetite due to bland food, limited variety, little choice and unfamiliar tastes. Self-catering was prohibited further exacerbating this problem. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant asylum seekers and new mothers living in state-provided accommodation experienced major restrictions related to material circumstances in this study. Key results identified housing and neighbourhood quality, consumption potential and nutrition as social determinants of health which women perceived to adversely affect their health, especially during pregnancy and early motherhood.",BMC public health,2019 Mar 12,England,2019,10
22044489,Concordance of sibling's recall of measures of childhood socioeconomic position.,"BACKGROUND: Studies of socioeconomic determinants of health often rely on recalled information on childhood socioeconomic position, despite limited evidence of the validity of this information. This study examined concordance between siblings of recalled measures of childhood socioeconomic position. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined reports by 1280 adult sibling pairs in the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States of seven measures of childhood socioeconomic position: father's occupation (in 9 categories), father having a professional occupation, father being a supervisor at work, father's education level, mother's education level, receipt of welfare payments, and subjective appraisal of being better or worse off financially than others. RESULTS: Concordance was high for father's professional occupation (0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96, 0.98), father's occupation in 9 categories (0.76; 95% CI 0.73, 0.80), and receipt of welfare payments (0.95; 95% CI 0.93, 0.97). Concordance was lower for father's and mother's education level, and lowest for subjective appraisal of socioeconomic position (0.60; 95% CI 0.57, 0.64). Concordance of parental education was lower for sibling pairs with high school educations or less. CONCLUSION: Concordance of recalled measures of childhood socioeconomic position by siblings is generally but not uniformly high.",BMC medical research methodology,2011 Nov 1,England,2011,10

The aim of the study was to know the disease burden and disability of the elderly (75 and over) cared by the integrated continuing care teams. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study carried out in a sample of 230 participants, from 25 teams randomly selected in the region of Lisbon and Tagus Valley. Data were collected at the patient's home trough caregiver's interviewing. The variables studied were: socio-demographic; disability determinants; degree (Barthel's scale) and duration of disability; morbidity (diagnoses, number and Charlson index). RESULTS: The study population had: on average 84 years; low or no scholar degree level (88.7%); on average 9.5 problems per person and a Charlson index of 8.48; disability over 42 months (severe in 65.2%). The most frequent disability-determinants were: dementia, stroke and femur fracture. The most frequent diagnoses were: osteoarthritis, hypertension and dementia. DISCUSSION: The results revealed a high disease burden (Charlson of 8.48) and disability. Although the diagnoses were those expected and comparable with the literature, their coexistence was universal, averaging 9.5 per person, affecting different organs/systems. Multimorbidity, coupled with severe disability, leads to clinical and organizational-care challenges, as well as the need for other population base studies. CONCLUSION: The population cared by the integrated continuing care teams is at risk: elderly, with low scholar degree level, with a high disease-burden and disability.",Acta medica portuguesa,2017 Aug 31,Portugal,2017,10
27038907,[Social inequalities in health less pronounced in women than in men: A question of measurements?].,"Social inequalities in mortality are generally less pronounced for women than for men. Are women's health risks and behaviours more homogeneous, or does this pattern arise from a measurement issue inducing an under-estimation of these inequalities? This article reviews a number of studies covering different dimensions of health and different dimensions of social status. Their findings show that there are large social inequalities in health among women. The focus on the working careers, family histories and conciliation of multiple activities provides evidence of major social determinants of health to which women are widely exposed. This article highlights the need to broaden the notion of social inequality and to redefine the social categories, notably by considering the distinct trajectories of men and women and their different spheres of activity. It highlights that gender differences in health are themselves partly socially constructed, as suggested by the gender approaches in the social sciences.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,2016 Apr,France,2016,10
30369409,Review of Tools for Measuring Exposure to Adversity in Children and Adolescents.,"Exposure to childhood adversity can result in negative behavioral and physical health outcomes due to potential long-term embedding into regulatory biological processes. Screening for exposure to adversity is a critical first step in identifying children at risk for developing a toxic stress response. We searched PubMed, PsycArticles, and CINAHL for studies published between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016, as well as other sources, to identify potential tools for measuring cumulative adversity in children and adolescents. We identified 32 tools and examined them for adversity categories, target population, administration time, administration qualifications and method, and reliability and validity. We also created a list of recommended tools that would be feasible for use by pediatric practitioners in most types of practice. This review provides a starting point for mobilizing screening in pediatric settings, highlighting the challenges with existing tools, and potential issues in the development and evaluation of future tools.",Journal of pediatric health care : official publication of National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners,2018 Nov - Dec,United States,2018,10

OBJECTIVE: To examine the determinants of perceived health and the differences between 50-year-old men and women. METHODS: Men and women born in 1953 were examined between 2003 and 2004. Participation rate was 60% among the men and 67% among the women. Questionnaires were used, including one on perceived health that was ranked on a 7-point scale from 1 (excellent) to 7 (very poor). The participants' medical histories were obtained through a questionnaire, and risk factors were measured. RESULTS: Women generally perceived their health as poorer than men. Women experienced more symptoms than men, and most symptoms were more prevalent among women than men. Poor perceived health was strongly related to number of symptoms. In multivariable analyses 5 factors were related to perceived health in both men and women: working full or part time (women OR [odds ratio] = 0.3, men OR = 0.3) and physical activity (women OR = 0.6, men OR = 0.6) had a positive effect, whereas a low level of social activities (women OR = 1.9, men OR = 1.7), still feeling tired after normal hours of sleep (women OR = 4.5, men OR = 4.0), and feeling burned out during the past 12 months (women OR = 2.3, men OR = 3.0) had a negative effect on perceived health. CONCLUSIONS: Women perceive their health as ""worse"" in comparison with men. Perceived health is a multifaceted condition related to social circumstances, physical activity, various symptoms, and tiredness after normal hours of sleep both in women and men.",Gender medicine,2011 Apr,United States,2011,10
25583915,Family hardships and serum cotinine in children with asthma.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A better understanding of how poverty-related hardships affect child health could highlight remediable intervention targets. Tobacco smoke exposure may be 1 such consequence of family hardship. Our objective was to explore the relationship between family hardships and tobacco exposure, as measured by serum cotinine, a tobacco metabolite, among children hospitalized for asthma. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of 774 children, aged 1 to 16 years, admitted for asthma or bronchodilator-responsive wheezing. The primary outcome was detectable serum cotinine. We assessed family hardships, including 11 financial and social variables, through a survey of the child's caregiver. We used logistic regression to evaluate associations between family hardship and detectable cotinine. RESULTS: We had complete study data for 675 children; 57% were African American, and 74% were enrolled in Medicaid. In total, 56% of children had detectable cotinine. More than 80% of families reported >/= 1 hardship, and 41% reported >/= 4 hardships. Greater numbers of hardships were associated with greater odds of having detectable cotinine. Compared with children in families with no hardships, those in families with >/= 4 hardships had 3.7-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.0-7.0) greater odds of having detectable serum cotinine in adjusted analyses. Lower parental income and educational attainment were also independently associated with detectable serum cotinine. CONCLUSIONS: Family hardships are prevalent and associated with detectable serum cotinine level among children with asthma. Family hardships and tobacco smoke exposure may be possible targets for interventions to reduce health disparities.",Pediatrics,2015 Feb,United States,2015,10
29158661,"Policy, System and Environmental Correlates of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in a Low-Income African American Population in the Southeast.","Objective: The current study seeks to identify policy, system and environmental (PSE) correlates of fruit and vegetable consumption among a sample of low-income African Americans in two counties in Alabama (Jefferson and Mobile) and one county in Mississippi (Forrest). Design: A modified Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFFS) survey, which included multi-level ecological factors, was used to evaluate nutritional habits at the pre-intervention stage of a multi-state research study. We surveyed a total of 256 participants between May and August 2015. Local community coalitions established in each of the counties were instrumental in the planning and administration of the baseline survey. Results: Univariate analyses revealed that whether participants met the daily recommendation for fruit/vegetable consumption may be correlated with whether participants had children who attended schools/day care centers with health policies in place, received food assistance, and observed media campaigns related to nutrition. Further, results of multivariate analysis indicated that meeting fruit/vegetable recommendations was correlated with personally participating or having a family member who participated in a health policy meeting in the past two years. Conclusion: These findings suggest that policy-based interventions have the potential to improve health outcomes among priority populations, such as low-income African Americans, who are at high risk of developing chronic diseases.",Ethnicity & disease,2017,United States,2017,10
21388945,[Social psychological determinants of the formation of medical students' professional identity. Possibilities of development].,"Systematic observations regarding techniques of medical career-socialization has hardly ever appeared in Hungarian technical literature yet. Focusing on the need for practical medical training the author elaborated a career-socialization program consisting of a three-level, three-branch training technique. This consisted of a Junior Balint-group, an imaginative visualization technique, and an expressive, drama-pedagogical working method completed with a projective technique. This career-socialization program focuses on the physician's personality, capability-expansion in relationship management, and practicing a set of professional behavior-roles. During the empirical observations connected to the work the author examined medical students' patient-representation, their relation to the patients, and the development of the physician's professional character. Within the frames of this three-level, three-branch training technique program it enables us to observe which training technique is able to reveal all those psychological qualities that can contribute to the conformation of the representations, thus to the process of career-socialization in the most effective way. The content-analyses of the cases of Junior Balint-groups (n = 60) revealed that the most frequent problems are fear of intimacy, of bodily contact, communication with patients in a chronic or terminal state, and the fear of medical practice. The content-analyses of imaginary patient-images (n = 62) with Rorschach-signs confirmed that the psychological burdens mentioned above are the most serious problems for medical students. The process-, and content-analyses of drama-games, the integrative healing contact training groups (n = 74) showed that group work primarily intensifies the relationship responsiveness, the ability to adopt the other's (the patient's) viewpoints, and enables an involuntary and distressless identification with the patient and the physician, both agents in the healing relationship. It is the drama-game that gives significant support to experience the physician- patient relationship in a high quality level. In the next phase the author tested the short story used for the drama-game and its projective contents on a sample of medical and psychology students (n = 313). For the statistical analysis the SPSS and the LEM program-packets were applied. Statistical methods included variance analysis, chi-square test and log-linear analysis. The vast similarity of the projective contents appearing in the survey questionnaire and in the drama-group verified that the chosen short story as a projective surface is suitable for recalling the students' typical stereotypes and representations related to diseases, patients, healing experts and therapeutic situations. The drama-group focused on the realization of these stereotypical representations, and also on experiencing and forming the students' emotional relations to them.",Orvosi hetilap,2011 Mar 20,Hungary,2011,10
22714703,Urban planning for healthy cities. A review of the progress of the European Healthy Cities Programme.,"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the progress made by European cities in relation to Healthy Urban Planning (HUP) during Phase IV of the World Health Organization's Healthy Cities programme (2003-2008). The introduction sets out the general principle of HUP, identifying three levels or phases of health and planning integration. This leads on to a more specific analysis of the processes and substance of HUP, which provide criteria for assessment of progress. The assessment itself relies on two sources of data provided by the municipalities: the Annual Review Templates (ARTs) 2008 and the response to the Phase IV General Evaluation Questionnaire. The findings indicate that the evidence from different sources and questions in different sections are encouragingly consistent. The number of cities achieving a good level of understanding and activity in HUP has risen very substantially over the period. In particular, those achieving effective strategic integration of health and planning have increased. A key challenge for the future will be to develop planning frameworks which advance public health concerns in a spatial policy context driven often by market forces. A health in all policies approach could be valuable.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2013 Oct,United States,2013,10
28495112,Inequalities in non-communicable diseases between the major population groups in Israel: achievements and challenges.,"Israel is a high-income country with an advanced health system and universal health-care insurance. Overall, the health status has improved steadily over recent decades. We examined differences in morbidity, mortality, and risk factors for selected non-communicable diseases (NCDs) between subpopulation groups. Between 1975 and 2014, life expectancy in Israel steadily increased and is currently above the average life expectancy for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Nevertheless, life expectancy has remained lower among Israeli Arabs than Israeli Jews, and this gap has recently widened. Age-adjusted mortality as a result of heart disease, stroke, or diabetes remains higher in Arabs, whereas age-adjusted incidence and mortality of cancer were higher among Jews. The prevalence of obesity and low physical activity in Israel is considerably higher among Arabs than Jews. Smoking prevalence is highest for Arab men and lowest for Arab women. Health inequalities are also evident by the indicators of socioeconomic position and in subpopulations, such as immigrants from the former Soviet Union, ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Bedouin Arabs. Despite universal health coverage and substantial improvements in the overall health of the Israeli population, substantial inequalities in NCDs persist. These differences might be explained, at least in part, by gaps in social determinants of health. The Ministry of Health has developed comprehensive programmes to reduce these inequalities between the major population groups. Sustained coordinated multisectoral efforts are needed to achieve a greater impact and to address other social inequalities.","Lancet (London, England)",2017 Jun 24,England,2017,10
24082718,Antimicrobial resistance in India: A review.,"Antimicrobial resistance is an important concern for the public health authorities at global level. However, in developing countries like India, recent hospital and some community based data showed increase in burden of antimicrobial resistance. Research related to antimicrobial use, determinants and development of antimicrobial resistance, regional variation and interventional strategies according to the existing health care situation in each country is a big challenge. This paper discusses the situational analysis of antimicrobial resistance with respect to its problem, determinants and challenges ahead with strategies required in future to reduce the burden in India. Recent data from Google search, Medline and other sources were collected which was reviewed and analyzed by the authors. Hospital based studies showed higher and varied spectrum of resistance in different regions while there are limited number of community based studies at country level. There exists lacunae in the structure and functioning of public health care delivery system with regard to quantification of the problem and various determining factors related to antimicrobial resistance. There is an urgent need to develop and strengthen antimicrobial policy, standard treatment guidelines, national plan for containment of AMR and research related to public health aspects of AMR at community and hospital level in India.","Journal of natural science, biology, and medicine",2013 Jul,India,2013,10
31198712,Nursing efficiency in patient care: A comparative study in perception of staff nurse and hospital management in a trust hospital.,"Background and Objective: While efficient use of resources and cost control is the responsibility of hospital managers, it is the duty of the nurses to carry out patient care and provide high-quality services. The aim of present research was to study the perception of staff nurses and nurse managers about nursing efficiency in patient care in a trust hospital. Materials and Methods: This quantitative and explanatory research has been done on staff nurses as well as nurse managers in a 550-bedded trust hospital in rural Gujarat of India. Data collection tool was a researcher made questionnaire and the data collection method was interview schedules for staff nurse and nurse managers. The total number of staff nurse in this hospital was 450 including 50 nurse managers. Results: Staff nurses had shown dissatisfaction regarding managers' practice and stated some aspects of managers practice which needed to improve such as keeping competitive salary for staff nurse, providing counseling system to supporting nursing practice, better recognition and acknowledgement system, better job security, providing supportive managerial style, better unit size and Applying vacation system. Conclusions: There was a difference between staff nurses' perception and nurse managers' perception regarding professional characteristics for nursing profession and factors, which affect nursing efficiency in patient care (with 95% confidence interval and P < 0.05).",Journal of family medicine and primary care,2019 May,India,2019,10

SETTING: In-depth semistructured interviews were carried out with South Asian youth living in Peel Region (Mississauga, Brampton and Caledon), a suburb of Toronto, Canada, home to over 50% of Ontario's South Asian population. PARTICIPANTS: South Asian youth (n=10) engaged in thoughtful, candid dialogue about their mental health and service access barriers. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative interview themes related to mental health stressors and mental health service access barriers experienced by youth living in Peel Region were assessed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: South Asian youth face many mental health stressors, from intergenerational and cultural conflict, academic pressure, relationship stress, financial stress and family difficulties. These stressors can contribute to mental health challenges, such as depression and anxiety and drug use, with marijuana, alcohol and cigarettes cited as the most popular substances. South Asian youth were only able to identify about a third (36%) of the mental health resources presented to them and did not feel well informed about mental health resources available in their neighbourhood. CONCLUSIONS: They offered recommendations for improved youth support directed at parents, education system, South Asian community and mental health system.

22683253,Undergraduate nursing students integrating health literacy in clinical settings.,"BACKGROUND: Analyzing students' performance and self-criticism of their roles in promoting health literacy can inform nursing education in a social environment that expects new graduates to be health promoters. OBJECTIVES: The pilot study reported here aimed to a) analyze students' understanding of and sensitivity to issues of health literacy, (b) identify students' perceptions of structural, organizational, and political barriers to the promotion of health literacy in social and health care organizations, and (c) document students' suggestions for curriculum changes that would develop their skills and competencies as health-literacy promoters. DESIGN: A qualitative pilot study. SETTING: A collaborative undergraduate nursing degree program in the metropolitan area of Toronto, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen undergraduate, Year 4 nursing students. METHODS: Signed informed consent was obtained from the participants. Participation was unpaid and voluntary. Recruitment was through an email invitation sent by the School of Nursing Student Affairs Coordinator. Three, one-time individual interviews and three focus groups were conducted. All were audio-recorded. Recordings were transcribed, and the transcriptions were coded using the qualitative software ATLAS ti 6.0. The interview data were submitted to thematic analysis. Additional data were gathered from the two-page self-assessments in students' academic portfolios. RESULTS: Sensitivity to health literacy was documented. Students performed best as health promoters in supportive teaching hospitals. Their performance was hindered by clinical settings unsupportive of health education, absence of role models, and insufficient theoretical preparation for health teaching. Students' sensitivity to their clients' diversity reportedly reinforced the interconnection, in multicultural healthcare settings, between health literacy and other social determinants of health and a growing demand for educating future nurses in expanding their role also as health promoters. CONCLUSIONS: Students recommended more socially inclusive and experiential learning initiatives related to health teaching to address education gaps in classrooms and practice.",Nurse education today,2013 Sep,Scotland,2013,10
31703734,Socioeconomic inequalities in maternal health service utilisation: a case of antenatal care in Nigeria using a decomposition approach.,"BACKGROUND: Antenatal care (ANC) services are critical for maternal health but Nigeria performs poorly in ANC utilisation compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to assess socioeconomic inequalities in ANC utilisation and the determinants of these inequalities in Nigeria. METHODS: The 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data with 18,559 women was used for analysis. The paper used concentration curves and indices for different measures of ANC utilisation (no ANC visit, 1-3 ANC visits, at least four ANC visits, and the number of ANC visits). A positive (or negative) concentration index means that the measure of ANC utilisation was concentrated on the richer (poorer) population compared to their poorer (richer) counterparts. The concentration indices were also decomposed using standard methodologies to examine the significant determinants of the socioeconomic inequalities in no ANC visit, at least four ANC visits, and the number of ANC visits. RESULTS: No ANC visit was disproportionately concentrated among the poor (concentration index (CI) = - 0.573), whereas at least four ANC visits (CI = 0.582) and a higher number of ANC visits (CI = 0.357) were disproportionately concentrated among the rich. While these results were consistent across all the geopolitical zones and rural and urban areas, the inequalities were more prevalent in the northern zones (which also have the highest incidence of poverty in the country) and the rural areas. The significant contributors to inequalities in ANC utilisation were the zone of residence, wealth, women's education (especially secondary) and employment, urban-rural residence, ethnicity, spousal education, and problems with obtaining permission to seek health care and distance to the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing wealth inequalities, enhancing literacy, employment and mitigating spatial impediments to health care use will reduce socioeconomic inequalities in ANC utilisation in Nigeria. These factors are the social determinants of health inequalities. Thus, a social determinants of health approach is needed to address socioeconomic inequalities in ANC coverage in Nigeria.",BMC public health,2019 Nov 8,England,2019,10
26379716,The Social Determinants of Health in Military Forces of Iran: A Qualitative Study.,"Providing effective health interventions and achieving equity in health need to apply the community-based approaches such as social determinants of health. In the military organizations, these determinants have received less attention from the military health researchers and policymakers. Therefore, this study aimed to identify and explain the social determinants affecting the health of military forces in Iran. This was a qualitative study which was conducted in 2014. The required data were collected through semistructured interviews and analyzed through Conventional Content Analysis. The studied sample consisted of 22 military health experts, policymakers, and senior managers selected using purposeful sampling method with maximum variation sampling. MAXQDA.2007 was used to analyze the collected data. After analyzing the collected data, two main contents, that is, ""general social determinants of health"" and ""military social determinants of health,"" with 22 themes and 90 subthemes were identified as the social determinants of military forces' health. Main themes were religious rule, spirituality promotion policies, international military factors, military command, and so forth.

23251832,Social Determinants of Stroke as Related to Stress at Work among Working Women: A Literature Review.,"In adult life, many of the social determinants of health are connected to working life. Yet, our knowledge of the role of work-related factors for the risk of stroke is fairly limited. In contemporary occupational health research, the Demand-Control Model (DCM) is frequently used to measure work stress. Previous literature reviews of the association of work stress and cardiovascular disease (CVD) do not include stroke as a specific outcome. Results regarding work stress and the risk of CVD are less evident in working women. With the focus on working women, the purpose of the present paper was to review the current research into the DCM in relation to stroke and to scrutinize potential gender differences. A literature search was performed and eight studies from three countries were identified. Based on the reviewed studies, there is some evidence that high psychological demands, low job control, and job strain are associated with increased stroke risk in women as well as in men. Any major reduction in deaths and disability from stroke is likely to come from decreasing social inequalities in health, and reducing work stress has a potential to contribute to a reduced risk of stroke in working populations.",Stroke research and treatment,2012,United States,2012,10
31313420,Longitudinal sleep efficiency in the elderly and its association with health.,"The relationships between older age and sleep efficiency have traditionally been assessed using cross-sectional studies that ignore changes within individuals as they age. This research examines the determinants of sleep efficiency, the heterogeneity in an individual's sleep efficiency trajectory across a period of up to 27 years in later life and its associations with health. The University of Manchester Longitudinal Study of Cognition in Normal Healthy Old Age cohort (n = 6,375; age 42-94 years) was used in this study. Depression and health data were collected using self-report validated instruments (Cornell Medical Index, Beck Depression Inventory and Geriatric Depression Scale). Longitudinal sleep and sociodemographic data were collected using a study-specific self-report questionnaire. A mixed-effect model was performed for sleep efficiency with adjustments for time-invariant and time-variant predictors. Latent class analysis was used to demonstrate subgroups of sleep efficiency trajectories and associations between sleep efficiency clusters and health history of the participants were investigated. Older adults have decreased sleep efficiency over time, with 18.6% decline between 40 and 100 years of age. Three sleep efficiency trajectory clusters were identified: high (32%), medium (50%) and low sleep efficiency (18%). Belonging to the high sleep efficiency cluster was associated with having lower prevalence of hypertension, circulatory problems, general arthritis, breathing problems and recurrent episodes of depression compared to the low efficiency cluster. Overall, ageing decreases sleep efficiency. However, there are detectable subgroups of sleep efficiency that are related to prevalence of different diseases.",Journal of sleep research,2019 Jul 16,England,2019,10
26382241,"Changes in health in England, with analysis by English regions and areas of deprivation, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.","BACKGROUND: In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), knowledge about health and its determinants has been integrated into a comparable framework to inform health policy. Outputs of this analysis are relevant to current policy questions in England and elsewhere, particularly on health inequalities. We use GBD 2013 data on mortality and causes of death, and disease and injury incidence and prevalence to analyse the burden of disease and injury in England as a whole, in English regions, and within each English region by deprivation quintile. We also assess disease and injury burden in England attributable to potentially preventable risk factors. England and the English regions are compared with the remaining constituent countries of the UK and with comparable countries in the European Union (EU) and beyond. METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2013 to compare mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with a disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in England, the UK, and 18 other countries (the first 15 EU members [apart from the UK] and Australia, Canada, Norway, and the USA [EU15+]). We extended elements of the analysis to English regions, and subregional areas defined by deprivation quintile (deprivation areas). We used data split by the nine English regions (corresponding to the European boundaries of the Nomenclature for Territorial Statistics level 1 [NUTS 1] regions), and by quintile groups within each English region according to deprivation, thereby making 45 regional deprivation areas. Deprivation quintiles were defined by area of residence ranked at national level by Index of Multiple Deprivation score, 2010. Burden due to various risk factors is described for England using new GBD methodology to estimate independent and overlapping attributable risk for five tiers of behavioural, metabolic, and environmental risk factors. We present results for 306 causes and 2337 sequelae, and 79 risks or risk clusters. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2013, life expectancy from birth in England increased by 5.4 years (95% uncertainty interval 5.0-5.8) from 75.9 years (75.9-76.0) to 81.3 years (80.9-81.7); gains were greater for men than for women. Rates of age-standardised YLLs reduced by 41.1% (38.3-43.6), whereas DALYs were reduced by 23.8% (20.9-27.1), and YLDs by 1.4% (0.1-2.8). For these measures, England ranked better than the UK and the EU15+ means. Between 1990 and 2013, the range in life expectancy among 45 regional deprivation areas remained 8.2 years for men and decreased from 7.2 years in 1990 to 6.9 years in 2013 for women. In 2013, the leading cause of YLLs was ischaemic heart disease, and the leading cause of DALYs was low back and neck pain. Known risk factors accounted for 39.6% (37.7-41.7) of DALYs; leading behavioural risk factors were suboptimal diet (10.8% [9.1-12.7]) and tobacco (10.7% [9.4-12.0]). INTERPRETATION: Health in England is improving although substantial opportunities exist for further reductions in the burden of preventable disease. The gap in mortality rates between men and women has reduced, but marked health inequalities between the least deprived and most deprived areas remain. Declines in mortality have not been matched by similar declines in morbidity, resulting in people living longer with diseases. Health policies must therefore address the causes of ill health as well as those of premature mortality. Systematic action locally and nationally is needed to reduce risk exposures, support healthy behaviours, alleviate the severity of chronic disabling disorders, and mitigate the effects of socioeconomic deprivation.

METHODS: A six-month randomized controlled trial based on the SCT was implemented in female schools in Hamadan City, west of Iran in 2018 on 128 female students with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (CES-D =10-45). They were randomly assigned to either intervention or control group (n= 64 in each group). Depression improvement program was implemented through the website via short videos, animations and Power-Point slides. Depression was evaluated using Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale. A researcher-made questionnaire based on the sheerer and Perceived-Social-Support-Scale-Revised (PSSS-R) questionnaires were used to evaluate the SCT constructs. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The intervention program resulted in the improvement of depression in 12 wk based on Intent-to-treat analyses. Nevertheless, these achievements seem to have decreased by 24 wk in intervention group. The intervention increased the mean scores of the constructs of social support and self-regulation from baseline to 12 wk in the intervention group (P<0.05). The intervention had no effect on outcome expectations and self-efficacy. There were no statistically significant associated between theory constructs changes and changes in depression (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The web-based intervention improved depression in female students. Future training using strategies for the sustainable improvement of depression in female students are needed.",Journal of research in health sciences,2019 Aug 19,Iran,2019,10
29808620,Evidence for the presence of Ctenocephalides orientis in livestock dwellings in northwest Iran.,"Fleas are important vectors of diseases such as murine typhus, tularaemia, hymenolepiasis and plague. The presence of active foci and history of human- and flea-transmitted plague in northwest Iran prompted the present group to collect and identify fleas from human and livestock dwellings across West Azerbaijan Province. Adult fleas were collected and identified using routine taxonomic keys. Species designation was confirmed by sequencing the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI). Of the collected specimens (n = 989), 104 were collected off-host (30 from human dwellings and 74 in light traps) and the rest were found on hosts (107 on animals and 778 by human bait). Of these fleas, 394 (40%) were male and 595 (60%) were female. The collected specimens belonged to the species Ctenocephalides canis, Ctenocephalides felis, Ctenocephalides orientis and Pulex irritans (all: Siphonaptera: Pulicidae). The amplified COI fragment, in addition to confirming the morphological identification of species, showed good efficacy in separating the different species in the phylogenetic analysis. In addition to the identification of fleas from human and livestock dwellings using morphological and molecular characteristics, the current paper represents the first report of the presence of C. orientis in northwest Iran. This finding suggests that changing climate conditions may have expanded the distribution of this species.",Medical and veterinary entomology,2018 Sep,England,2018,10
30194518,Psychosocial Determinants of Teens' Online Engagement in Drug Prevention Social Media Campaigns: Implications for Public Health Organizations.,"Social networking sites (SNSs) now serve as a primary form of communication among adolescents. Consequently, drug prevention campaigns delivered through SNSs have the potential to reach a wide network of adolescents if teens are willing to engage in the message diffusion process by commenting on, ""liking,"" following, creating, or sharing prevention messages with their networked peers. However, little is known about the psychosocial factors that influence adolescents' willingness to participate in drug prevention social media campaigns. We use qualitative methods to explore reasons why adolescents may or may not want to engage in the message diffusion process. We conducted four semi-structured focus groups with a total of 33 high school students from various school- and community-based youth programs in Rhode Island. Focus groups were followed by a brief self-administered questionnaire collecting information about participants' social media use to augment qualitative findings. Overall, findings reveal that engaging teens in the message diffusion process can be advantageous but difficult to accomplish due to multiple factors. Most notably, asking adolescents to participate in drug prevention campaigns delivered through SNSs means also asking youth to violate online norms that promote drug use, which could in turn subject them to peer reprisal. We conclude that future studies should begin to investigate strategies addressing the various challenges we identified. Meanwhile, prevention specialists should consider alternative or supplemental evidence-based approaches to drug prevention rather than invest resources into activities that may offer little return on investment.",The journal of primary prevention,2018 Oct,Netherlands,2018,10
25147780,The Serum Lead level in Patients With Retained Lead Pellets.,"BACKGROUND: Patients, who survived from shotgun injuries, often have some retained lead pellets in their bodies. Several cases of lead toxicity have been reported regarding these patients. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to compare the serum lead level in patients who have retained lead pellets in their bodies with the control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, we gathered the serum lead levels of 25 patients with some retained lead pellets in their bodies due to shotgun and 25 volunteers without similar lead exposure and compared them in view of the age, gender, and living place. RESULTS: While the mean serum lead level in both groups was lower than the standard level (i.e. 40 microg/dL) , the mean +/- SD of serum lead level were 29 +/- 12.8 microg/dL and 25.3 +/- 6.4 microg/dL in the case and control groups, respectively without any significant difference (P = 0. 30) . However, a positive relationship was seen between serum lead level, and the number of retained lead pellets (r = 0.447, P = 0. 025) . CONCLUSIONS: Although extensive surgery to remove the lead pellets is not recommended in patients injured with shotguns, those with many retained lead pellets in their bodies should be considered at risk for lead poisoning and monitored carefully.",Archives of trauma research,2014 Jun,Netherlands,2014,10
21735613,"Yearning, learning, and conceding: reasons men and women change their childbearing intentions.","People's childbearing intentions change over the course of their reproductive lives. These changes have been conceptualized as occurring in response to the realization that an individual is unlikely to achieve his or her intended fertility, because of constraints such as the ""biological clock"" or lack of a partner. In this article, we find that changes to child-bearing plans are influenced by a much wider range of factors than this. People change their plans in response to the wishes of their partners, in response to social norms, as the result of repartnering, and as the result of learning about the costs and benefits of parenthood; there are also differences between the factors that influence men's and women's decision-making. In a departure from existing studies in this area, we use a flexible analytical framework that enables us to analyze increases in planned fertility separately from decreases. This allows us to uncover several complexities of the decision-making process that would otherwise be hidden, and leads us to conclude that the determinants of increases in planned fertility are not simply equal and opposite to the determinants of decreases.",Population and development review,2011,United States,2011,10
29773663,Factors associated with condom use and HIV testing among young men who have sex with men: a cross-sectional survey in a random online sample in Sweden.,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to analyse social determinants of sexual health behaviour (condom use and HIV testing) among young, internet-active, cis men who have sex with men (MSM) in a high-income country. The aspects of sexual health behaviour analysed here are condomless anal intercourse with one or more new or casual partner(s), condomless anal intercourse during the most recent sex with a man and HIV testing. METHODS: A randomised sample of men active on Sweden's main online community for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans people responded to an online survey (response rate 19%). A subsample of young people, aged 15-29, was analysed (effective sample 597-669) using multivariable logistic regression with respect to factors associated with condomless anal intercourse with one or more new or casual partner(s), condomless anal intercourse at most recent sex and not having had a test for HIV. RESULTS: Low education, being single and living in a metropolitan area were found to be independently associated with condomless anal intercourse with new or casual partner(s). Sex with a steady partner was associated with condomless anal intercourse during the most recent sex. Knowledge of where to get tested, high education, being born outside Sweden and condomless anal intercourse with new or casual sex partner(s) were independently associated with having been tested for HIV. CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with sexual health behaviour among young MSM are complex, and preventive messages need to be tailored accordingly.",Sexually transmitted infections,2018 Sep,England,2018,10
27492314,[Impairment - disability - participation for all : New federal reporting in light of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities].,"The new Federal Government's Report on Participation explores the contexts in which impairments become disabilities for those individuals who experience them. In parallel, it outlines the factors that foster inclusion and opportunities to act for everyone in society - despite existing impairments.From a sociopolitical and health policy perspective, disability refers to unequal opportunities based on impairment. Hence, the focus here is on the equalisation of these participation opportunities to match those of the entire population - but always from differentiated perspectives on the various social arenas. The human rights approach stresses protection against discrimination as well as dignity and self-determination for all. From a human resources angle, the emphasis is on the performance of individuals in favourable conditions and the attainment of personal goals within their actual everyday circumstances.The new reporting concept is indebted to these perspectives and thus focuses on individual life circumstances, while referring to the WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) - an approach now validated on a global scale. Therefore, it does not only report on measures provided by services for persons with disabilities but, more crucially, investigates determinants on the personal and environmental levels, unequal opportunities and the interdependency between context and competence for particular sections of the population. Two groups are singled out in the process: elderly persons and individuals with mental health impairments.The participation report is part of the National Action Plan to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). An independent scientific committee conceptualises the design of the report while accompanying and commenting upon its realisation. Currently, a second federal report on participation is emerging from the new concept.","Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz",2016 Sep,Germany,2016,10
24523566,The Influence of Social Systems on Patterns of Mitochondrial DNA Variation in Baboons.,"Behavior is influenced by genes but can also shape the genetic structure of natural populations. Investigating this link is of great importance because behavioral processes can alter the genetic diversity on which selection acts. Gene flow is one of the main determinants of the genetic structure of a population and dispersal is the behavior that mediates gene flow. Baboons (genus Papio) are among the most intensely studied primate species and serve as a model system to investigate the evolution of social systems using a comparative approach. The general mammalian pattern of male dispersal and female philopatry has thus far been found in baboons, with the exception of hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas). As yet, the lack of data on Guinea baboons (Papio papio) creates a taxonomic gap in genus-wide comparative analyses. In our study we investigated the sex-biased dispersal pattern of Guinea baboons in comparison to hamadryas, olive, yellow, and chacma baboons using sequences of the maternally transmitted mitochondrial hypervariable region I. Analyzing whole-range georeferenced samples (N = 777), we found strong evidence for female-biased gene flow in Guinea baboons and confirmed this pattern for hamadryas baboons, as shown by a lack of genetic-geographic structuring. In addition, most genetic variation was found within and not among demes, in sharp contrast to the pattern observed in matrilocal primates including the other baboon taxa. Our results corroborate the notion that the Guinea baboons' social system shares some important features with that of hamadryas baboons, suggesting similar evolutionary forces have acted to distinguish them from all other baboons.",International journal of primatology,2014,United States,2014,10
30903484,Placing prostate cancer disparities within a psychosocial context: challenges and opportunities for future research.,"Black men are more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with White men. Despite advances in prevention and treatment strategies, disparities in prostate cancer among Black men persist. While research on the causes of higher incidence and mortality is ongoing, there is limited evidence in the existing literature that clearly speaks to the potential psychological or social factors that may contribute to disparities in prostate cancer incidence. Given the lack of attention to this issue, we review scientific evidence of the ways in which social factors, including socioeconomic status and racial segregation, as well as psychological factors, like depression and anxiety, are related to subsequent prostate cancer risk, which could occur through behavioral and biological processes. Our objective is to illuminate psychosocial factors and their context, using a racial disparity lens, which suggests opportunities for future research on the determinants of prostate cancer. Ultimately, we aim to contribute to a robust research agenda for the development of new prostate cancer prevention measures to reduce racial disparities.",Cancer causes & control : CCC,2019 May,Netherlands,2019,10
30987864,The weathering hypothesis as an explanation for racial disparities in health: a systematic review.,"PURPOSE: The weathering hypothesis states that chronic exposure to social and economic disadvantage leads to accelerated decline in physical health outcomes and could partially explain racial disparities in a wide array of health conditions. This systematic review summarizes the literature empirically testing the weathering hypothesis and assesses the quality of the evidence regarding weathering as a determinant of racial disparities in health. METHODS: Databases (Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase) were searched for studies published in English up to July 1, 2017. Studies that tested the weathering hypothesis for any physical health outcome and included at least one socially or economically disadvantaged group (e.g., Blacks) for whom the weathering hypothesis applies were assessed for eligibility. Threats to validity were assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. RESULTS: The 41 included studies were rated as having overall good methodological quality. Most studies found evidence in support of the weathering hypothesis, although the magnitude of support varied by the health outcome and population studied. CONCLUSIONS: Future evaluations of the weathering hypothesis should include an examination of additional health outcomes and interrogate mechanisms that could link weathering to poor health.",Annals of epidemiology,2019 May,United States,2019,10

30897231,A multivariable analysis of childhood psychosocial behaviour and household functionality.,"BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health play a vital role in population health. Awareness of household social factors and their impact on health can help health professionals to provide effective strategies in health promotion, especially for children and adolescents showing signs of psychosocial dysfunction. The objective of this study was to explore the association between parents' perceptions of the psychosocial behaviour of their children and the functionality of their household. METHODS: This cohort study analysed data from the Coordinated Health Care for Complex Kids programme. The sample included 293 parents of children aged 4-17 years with chronic conditions, and from urban, low-income families. Psychosocial behaviour of the child was measured using the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17), which included subscales for internal, external, and attention symptoms. Household functionality was measured using the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale. Responses to both assessments were scored in a standard manner. RESULTS: There was a significant association between parents' perceptions of the psychosocial behaviour of their children and the functionality of the home environment. The mean Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale scores in the home environment improved from baseline to the first reassessment (the period between the two assessments ranged from 4 to 8 months). Additionally, positive PSC-17 screening results of the children decreased by 11% in the first reassessment. The odds of having a positive PSC-17 screening result also decreased in the first reassessment after receiving interventions. CONCLUSION: The association between psychosocial dysfunction and household functionality indicates the importance of family-centred care and taking the home environment into consideration when administering health services to low-income children with chronic conditions. This study brings attention to the more hidden factors that influence child mental health, which must be addressed to improve care delivery and child health outcomes.","Child: care, health and development",2019 Jul,England,2019,10
30516357,Novel psychosocial factor involved in diabetes self-care in the Japanese cultural context.,"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence shows that cultural context can influence the management of diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between interdependence, which is valued in the Eastern cultural context, and diabetes self-care behavior in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional survey of 161 Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus using well-established questionnaires. The association of an interdependent tendency with diabetes self-care activities was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Diabetes self-care activities had a negative correlation with interdependent tendency (r = -0.16, P = 0.047), and they had positive correlations with age (r = 0.42, P < 0.001), emotional support (r = 0.25, P = 0.001) and diabetes self-care support (r = 0.36, P < 0.001). When patients were divided into two groups at the median age (68 years), multiple regressions showed that interdependent tendency (beta = -0.20, P = 0.048), male sex (beta = -0.24, P = 0.023), emotional support (beta = 0.22, P = 0.028) and diabetes self-care support (beta = 0.39, P < 0.001) were significant determinants of diabetes self-care activities only in the younger group. CONCLUSIONS: Interdependence might influence diabetes self-care behavior, and intervention focusing on support from close others might lead patients to more successful care among Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially those aged <68 years.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2019 Jul,Japan,2019,10

The study has been ongoing since 1992, and focuses on the determinants, trajectories and consequences of physical, cognitive, emotional and social functioning. Strengths of the LASA study include its multidisciplinary character, the availability of over 25 years of follow-up, and the cohort-sequential design that allows investigations of longitudinal changes, cohort differences and time trends in functioning. The findings from LASA have been reported in over 600 publications so far (see www.lasa-vu.nl). This article provides an update of the design of the LASA study and its methods, on the basis of recent developments. We describe additional data collections, such as additional nine-monthly measurements in-between the regular three-yearly waves that have been conducted among the oldest old during 2016-2019, and the inclusion of a cohort of older Turkish and Moroccan migrants.",European journal of epidemiology,2019 Jul 25,Netherlands,2019,10
31041240,A critical appraisal of the maternal and child health scenario in a metropolitan city in India with reference to achievements of millennium development goals.,"Background: Post 2015, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will undergo a transition to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, it becomes necessary to assess the determinants influencing the present status of MDGs. This study was conducted to assess the progress, short comings related to the transition from MDGs to SDGs in a metropolitan city. It provides practical insights for extrapolating need based strategies related to the SDGs. Methods: Study was conducted in a metropolitan city, Mumbai. Situational analysis of the city was done using monthly and annual performance reports and key informant's interviews at city level. Qualitative analysis was done using thematic analysis. Results: The current infant mortality rate of Mumbai is 26.72 and under-five mortality rate is 38.7/1000 live births. The current MMR of mumbai is 88. The responses from the key informants' spanned three major themes: Concerns and challenges; Good practices and schemes in pipeline; and Opportunities envisioned. Eight major challenging areas were identified. Opportunities are sustainable models of public-private partnership; Involvement of NGOs and AYUSH practitioners; and IT sector involvement, HMIS, e- governance, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Conclusions: Significant progress has been made in the field of maternal and child health (MCH), and sustained efforts are required. Maternal mortality figures may be illusive because of the effect of migration and referral cases. Socio-demographic issues of development need to be addressed through governance. Mechanism for intersectoral coordination, IT support, surveillance, and tracking of pregnant mothers needs to be developed.

28540259,Conceptual Models of Social Determinants of Health: A Narrative Review.,"BACKGROUND: There are several conflicting conceptual models to explain social determinants of health (SDH) as responsible for most health inequalities. This study aimed to present these models in historical perspective and provide main component of SDH models as an SES indicators. METHODS: This was a narrative study using international databases to retrieve literature dealing with conceptual models of SDH. All publication in English language until Mar 2015 was included. The CASP and PRISMA were used to summarize the literature. RESULTS: Overall, 248 publications were retrieved and screened. After exclusion of irrelevant and duplicates, 94 citations were found to be relevant and 21 publications included in this review. In general, 21 models of SDH were found: some models presented before year 1995(n=4), some models presented between 1995 and 2005 (n=13) and some models presented after 2005 (n=4). However, we found three categories of indicators that contribute to SDH models and that were classic factors, fixed and demographic factors and proxy factors. CONCLUSION: Reduction of socioeconomic inequalities in health requires understanding of mechanisms and causal pathways; therefore, every country needs to design the specific model. As the available models are for developed countries, lack of a specific model for developing ones is tangible. As there is no gold standard related to SES indicators, therefore, it is proposed to use the various indicators based on life course approach, which leads to understanding and adopting effective policy interventions.",Iranian journal of public health,2017 Apr,Iran,2017,10
25551432,Intimate Partner Violence and its Health Impact on Ethnic Minority Women [corrected].,"In the United States, intimate partner violence (IPV) against women disproportionately affects ethnic minorities. Further, disparities related to socioeconomic and foreign-born status impact the adverse physical and mental health outcomes as a result of IPV, further exacerbating these health consequences. This article reviews 36 U.S. studies on the physical (e.g., multiple injuries, disordered eating patterns), mental (e.g., depression, post-traumatic stress disorder), and sexual and reproductive health conditions (e.g., HIV/STIs, unintended pregnancy) resulting from IPV victimization among ethnic minority (i.e., Black/African American, Hispanic/Latina, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American) women, some of whom are immigrants. Most studies either did not have a sufficient sample size of ethnic minority women or did not use adequate statistical techniques to examine differences among different racial/ethnic groups. Few studies focused on Native American/Alaska Native and immigrant ethnic minority women and many of the intra-ethnic group studies have confounded race/ethnicity with income and other social determinants of health. Nonetheless, of the available data, there is evidence of health inequities associated with both minority ethnicity and IPV. To appropriately respond to the health needs of these groups of women, it is necessary to consider social, cultural, structural, and political barriers (e.g., medical mistrust, historical racism and trauma, perceived discrimination, immigration status) to patient-provider communication and help-seeking behaviors related to IPV, which can influence health outcomes. This comprehensive approach will mitigate the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities related to IPV and associated health outcomes and behaviors.",Journal of women's health (2002),2015 Jan,United States,2015,10
30296634,"Intention, beliefs and mood assessed using electronic diaries predicts attendance at cardiac rehabilitation: An observational study.","BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitationis effective in promoting physical/psychological recovery following acute coronary syndrome. Yet, rates of attendance at outpatient cardiac rehabilitation by eligible patients are low. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the determinants of attendance at outpatient cardiac rehabilitation in acute coronary syndrome patients following discharge until cardiac rehabilitation commencement. DESIGN: A weekly electronic diary measured cardiac-related cognitions and mood and examined their relation to attendance at outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. SETTINGS: Three United Kingdom National Health Service secondary care settings in two Health Board areas in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Acute coronary syndrome patients were recruited from March 2012 to June 2013 prior to hospital discharge. Of 488 eligible patients referred for cardiac rehabilitation, 214 consented. METHODS: Consecutive patients completed a pre-hospital discharge questionnaire targeting age, diagnosis, social class and smoking history. Acute coronary syndrome patients then completed a weekly electronic diary from the first week of discharge until the start of cardiac rehabilitation. Multilevel structural equation models estimated the effects of initial, i.e. baseline and rate of change in cardiac-related cognition and mood on attendance. Intention to attend cardiac rehabilitation was reflected, log transformed, reported thereafter as ""do not intend"". The role of ""do not intend"" was explored as a mediator of the relationship between cardiac-related cognition and mood on attendance. RESULTS: 166 participants provided, on average, 5 weeks of diary entries before cardiac rehabilitation commenced. High intention (i.e. low ""do not intend"") to attend CR and its rate of increase over time predicted attendance. Low negative emotional representation, high perceived necessity, high confidence in maintaining function, low negative affect, and high positive affect following discharge predicted attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. The rate of change in cardiac-related mood and these cognitions was not predictive. Baseline and rate of change in ""do not intend"" entirely mediated relationships between a) perceived necessity, b) negative affect and attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Negative affect in the first weeks following discharge represents the key challenge to a patient maintaining their intention to attend cardiac rehabilitation. Intervention to improve attendance should focus on improving intention to attend following discharge and during recovery by improving patient understanding of cardiac rehabilitation and reducing negative affect.",International journal of nursing studies,2018 Dec,England,2018,10
28349171,"Intersections of poverty, race/ethnicity, and sex: alcohol consumption and adverse outcomes in the United States.","We examine whether intersectionality theory-which formalizes the notion that adverse health outcomes owing to having a marginalized social status, identity, or characteristic, may be magnified for individuals with an additional marginalized social status, identity, or characteristic-can be applied using quantitative methods to describe the differential effects of poverty on alcohol consumption across sex and race/ethnicity. Using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, we analyze longitudinal data from Black, Hispanic, and White drinkers (n = 21,140) to assess multiplicative interactions between poverty, as defined by the US Census Bureau, sex, and race/ethnicity, on adverse alcohol outcomes. Findings indicated that the effect of poverty on the past-year incidence of heavy episodic drinking was stronger among Black men and Black women in comparison to men and women of other racial/ethnic groups. Poverty reduction programs that are culturally informed may help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in the adverse outcomes of alcohol consumption.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2017 May,Germany,2017,10
27637270,"The Physical and Psychological Health of Migrants in Guangzhou, China: How Does Neighborhood Matter?","This study analyzed the health of migrants in 4 types of neighborhood in the city of Guangzhou in China. The research shows that the health of internal migrants in urban villages and private housing neighborhoods is much better than those living in older inner city neighborhoods (which are known as jiefang shequ) and unit neighborhoods (which are known as danwei). The reasons behind this are the facts that the migrants in urban villages tend to be relatively young and there tend to be better social and economic conditions in the private housing neighborhood. Moreover, among the 4 kinds of neighborhood, the gap between psychological health and physical health is the largest in urban villages. In addition, migrants who are younger, have better working conditions, and have higher levels of education have better health scores, and they tend to have more friends in the city, larger houses, better insurance, and more satisfaction with their neighborhood relationships, and they tend to be better adapted to urban life. As for the determinants of health, individual characteristics, community factors, and insurance are the most important factors. Specifically, individual age and age of housing have negative influences on physical health while insurance has a positive effect. This study shows that the type of neighborhood that migrants live in has a great impact on their psychological health, which can be improved by promoting neighborhood environments. Last, we propose that it is necessary to implement different strategies in different communities.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2016,United States,2016,10
28002578,Linking the Canadian Community Health Survey and the Canadian Mortality Database: An enhanced data source for the study of mortality.,"BACKGROUND: This study summarizes the linkage of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and the Canadian Mortality Database (CMDB), which was performed to examine relationships between social determinants, health behaviours and mortality in the household population. DATA AND METHODS: The 2000/2001-to-2011 Canadian Community Health Surveys were linked to the 2000-to-2011 CMDB using probabilistic methods based on common identifiers (names, date of birth, postal code and sex) for eligible respondents (85%; n = 614,774). Mortality records from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2011 for people aged 12 or older were eligible for linkage (n = 2.774 million). The linkage was enhanced with information from the Historical Tax Summary File. Quality assessment consisted of internal and external validation. Cox survival analysis (age-adjusted) was conducted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) associated with selected health behaviours. RESULTS: Overall, 5.3% of eligible CCHS respondents linked to a mortality record; false positive and false negative rates were 0.04% and 2.43%, respectively. Linkage rates were higher among males (5.8%) and people aged 75 or older (20.2%), reflecting known mortality risks. Survival analyses confirmed elevated mortality risk associated with heavy (HR 2.36, CI 1.84, 2.89) and light smoking (HR 1.91, CI 1.52, 2.33), compared with not smoking; underweight and obesity, compared with normal and overweight; low fruit and vegetable consumption; and lack of physical activity. INTERPRETATION: Linking health behaviour information from the CCHS to mortality data from the CMDB allows for a greater understanding of modifiable determinants of mortality.",Health reports,2016 Dec 21,Canada,2016,10
27172620,Two dimensions of trust in physicians in OECD-countries.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to analyse citizens' trust in physicians in 22 OECD countries. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors measure trust in physicians using items on generalised and particularised trust. Individual-level data are received from the ISSP Research Group (2011). The authors also utilise macro variables drawn from different data banks. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and xtlogit regression models. The main micro-level hypothesis is that low self-reported health is strongly associated with lower trust in physicians. The second micro-level hypothesis is that frequent meetings with physicians result in higher trust. The third micro-level hypothesis assumes that males, and older and better educated respondents, express higher trust compared to others. The first macro-level hypothesis is that lower income inequality leads to higher trust in physicians. The second macro-level hypothesis is that greater physician density leads to higher trust in physicians. FINDINGS: The authors found that the influence of individual and macro-level characteristics varies between trust types. Results indicate that both trust types are clearly associated with individual-level determinants. However, only general trust in physicians has weak associations with macro-level indicators (mainly physician density) and therefore on institutional cross-country differences. It seems that particularised trust in a physician's skills is more restricted to the individuals' health and their own experiences meeting doctors, whereas general trust likely reflects attitudes towards the prevalent profession in the country. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The findings hold significance for healthcare systems research and for research concerning social trust generally.",International journal of health care quality assurance,2016,England,2016,10
24101437,Optimizing health and health care systems for children with special health care needs using the life course perspective.,"To date, life course research in maternal and child health has largely focused on elucidating fetal and early life influences on adult health and less on promoting the health of children with special health care needs (CSHCN). Consideration of life course theory (LCT) for CSHCN is especially important given their increasing prevalence and comorbidity, their disproportionate vulnerability to weaknesses or instability in the health care system, and the growing evidence linking child and adult health and quality of life. In this commentary we seek to advance the consideration of LCT for CSHCN. We (1) briefly summarize key issues and the importance of a life course approach for CSHCN; (2) present illustrative findings from population-based cross-sectional data that serve to generate hypotheses that can be more rigorously examined when population-based longitudinal data become available; and (3) discuss the application of life course principles as a driving force in the continued implementation and improvement of integrated systems of care for CSHCN.",Maternal and child health journal,2014 Feb,United States,2014,10
29161900,Asthma Disparity Photovoice: The Discourses of Black Adolescent and Public Health Policymakers.,"BACKGROUND: Policies in U.S. public schools that address asthma management for Black adolescents may not sufficiently transform sociocultural determinants of disparities. A critical analysis of public health policy maker and adolescent discourses on asthma management using an ecological framework could inform policy development. This study describes the discourses of asthma management disparities of school and other public health policymakers and Black adolescents with asthma during a statewide asthma planning activity. METHOD: I conducted a qualitative critical discourse analysis on transcripts and phototexts from a photovoice project with Black adolescents with asthma (n = 19), an asthma-planning meeting with school and public health policymakers (n = 12), and an observation of a photovoice dissemination event that included the same adolescents and policymakers. RESULTS: Policymakers did not discuss sociocultural discourses concerning asthma management disparities such as racism and discrimination, but the adolescents did. The only shared discourses between adolescents and policymakers were on the management of indoor environments, health care quality, inadequate housing, and outdoor air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: Including Black adolescents in policymaking activities concerning asthma management disparities furthers the identification of differing and shared discourses. School policies should include multilevel strategies that address structural inequities. Photovoice presents an opportunity for including the voice of marginalized youth in policy-planning processes.",Health promotion practice,2018 Mar,United States,2018,10
27170791,"The Adolescent ""Expanded Medical Home"": School-Based Health Centers Partner with a Primary Care Clinic to Improve Population Health and Mitigate Social Determinants of Health.","INTRODUCTION: Access to high-quality health care is a crucial social determinant of health. We describe the implementation of an ""expanded medical home"" partnering a primary care practice (the Ypsilanti Health Center [YHC]) with local school-based health centers (the Regional Alliance for Healthy Schools [RAHS]), and to assess whether this model improves access to and quality of care for shared patients. METHODS: Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we define the steps in, barriers to, and facilitating factors in implementing the expanded medical home model. Visits and quality measures were assessed for patients seen by YHC only versus YHC/RAHS at baseline and during the intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, patients seen at YHC/RAHS had higher compliance with most quality metrics compared with those seen at YHC only. The proportion of shared patients significantly increased because of the intervention (P < .001). Overall, patients seen in the expanded medical home had a higher likelihood of receiving quality metric services than patients in YHC only (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-2.05) across all measures. CONCLUSIONS: Thoughtful and intentional implementation of an expanded medical home partnership between primary care physicians and school-based health centers increases the number of shared high-risk adolescent patients. Shared patients have improved compliance with quality measures, which may lead to long-term improved health equity.",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,2016 May-Jun,United States,2016,10
31550377,A Transdisciplinary Approach is Essential to Community-based Research with American Indian Populations.,"Social determinants of health and their effects on health outcomes create a complex system, with interaction between social, economic, physical, and biological factors necessitating research take a holistic approach. Transdisciplinary research, one of the three core values of the Collaborative Research Center for American Indian Health, seeks to go beyond methods of knowledge production occurring solely within disciplinary boundaries, because real-world societal problems do not adhere to such restrictions. Community involvement is an essential component for successful research partnerships with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities. We posit that transdisciplinary approaches, which considers community-level expertise as an equitable component on the research team, show great potential for advancing research in AI/AN communities.",American Indian and Alaska native mental health research (Online),2019,United States,2019,10
26171691,Risk and self-managing chronic joint pain: looking beyond individual lifestyles and behaviour.,"Self-managing chronic musculoskeletal pain is predominantly framed within a discourse of modifying behaviour, or lifestyle risk factors such as diet, weight loss and exercise by policymakers, researcher and clinicians. Little research has been conducted which explores how 'risk' is understood or encountered by those with joint pain and how it may relate to self-management. Drawing from serial interviews and a diary study with 22 participants, the findings demonstrate that people with chronic pain engage in a process of assessing and adapting to hazardous or pain conferring situations in relation to daily activities. 'Risks' are embedded within a dialectic between corporeal experience and the design features of everyday social environments. Self-management, in this context, is not necessarily solely related to following clinical advice, rather it includes dealing with 'risks' of pain, hazards relating to bodily limitations and the environment, and ensuring the ability to continue with valued activities. Findings contribute to sociological understandings of self-management and risk while demonstrating the limits of viewing self-management as an individualised endeavour of changing behaviour.",Sociology of health & illness,2015 Jul,England,2015,10

We surveyed 924 adults newly enrolling in HIV care at four clinics in Tanzania before the adoption of universal treatment eligibility, and collected longitudinal clinical data. Participants who defaulted from care were tracked in the community. Cumulative incidence of disengagement from care and death was estimated using competing risk methods. By 12 months after enrollment, 18.2% of patients had disengaged from care and 6.9% had died. Factors associated with disengagement included male sex (adjusted subhazard ratio [aSHR] versus female = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-2.89), provider-initiated HIV diagnosis (aSHR versus self-referred = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.03-2.86), ineligibility for antiretroviral treatment (ART) at enrollment (aSHR versus eligibility = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.84-4.32) and increased anticipated stigma score (aSHR = 1.04 per 5-point increase, 95% CI: 1.02-1.05). Higher life satisfaction score (aSHR = 0.97 per 5-point increase, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99) and having 1-2 close friends (aSHR versus none = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.47-0.71) were protective. The findings highlight the continued importance of social environment for HIV care outcomes and the potential of universal ART eligibility to reduce HIV care attrition.",AIDS care,2019 Dec 11,England,2019,10
31690306,Predicting skilled delivery service use in Ethiopia: dual application of logistic regression and machine learning algorithms.,"BACKGROUND: Skilled assistance during childbirth is essential to reduce maternal deaths. However, in Ethiopia, which is among the six countries contributing to more than half of the global maternal deaths, the coverage of births attended by skilled health personnel remains very low. The aim of this study was to identify determinants and develop a predictive model for skilled delivery service use in Ethiopia by applying logistic regression and machine-learning techniques. METHODS: Data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) was used for this study. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) tools were used for logistic regression and model building respectively. Classification algorithms namely J48, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used for model development. The validation of the predictive models was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Only 27.7% women received skilled delivery assistance in Ethiopia. First antenatal care (ANC) [AOR = 1.83, 95% CI (1.24-2.69)], birth order [AOR = 0.22, 95% CI (0.11-0.46)], television ownership [AOR = 6.83, 95% CI (2.52-18.52)], contraceptive use [AOR = 1.92, 95% CI (1.26-2.97)], cost needed for healthcare [AOR = 2.17, 95% CI (1.47-3.21)], age at first birth [AOR = 1.96, 95% CI (1.31-2.94)], and age at first sex [AOR = 2.72, 95% CI (1.55-4.76)] were determinants for utilizing skilled delivery services during the childbirth. Predictive models were developed and the J48 model had superior predictive accuracy (98%), sensitivity (96%), specificity (99%) and, the area under ROC (98%). CONCLUSIONS: First ANC and contraceptive uses were among the determinants of utilization of skilled delivery services. A predictive model was developed to forecast the likelihood of a pregnant woman seeking skilled delivery assistance; therefore, the predictive model can help to decide targeted interventions for a pregnant woman to ensure skilled assistance at childbirth. The model developed through the J48 algorithm has better predictive accuracy. Web-based application can be build based on results of this study.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2019 Nov 5,England,2019,10
21988872,Social determinants of delayed diagnosis of tuberculosis in a north China urban setting.,"A quantitative/qualitative mixed methodology was used to investigate treatment delay and determine social determinants of TB among 70 pulmonary TB patients in China. Median total diagnostic delay (TDD) time was 4 weeks for men and 5 weeks for women; 25% of patients experienced a TDD of 20 or more weeks. Seventy-six percent of patients who had a delay of more than 2 weeks attributed the delay to their own personal lack of awareness. Fifty-seven percent of the population reported experiencing more than one of the four common TB symptoms, and 30% reported experiencing three or more symptoms. Patients' qualitative descriptions of the process from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of TB described a circuitous and imprecise one. Delay in seeking treatment among TB patients in China is prolonged because of both personal and systemic reasons. It is essential that diagnostic delay be understood and reduced to decrease the burden of disease globally.",International quarterly of community health education,2010-2011,United States,2010,10
22135633,"Socio-demographic determinants of stigma among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Lagos, Nigeria.","BACKGROUND: Patients living with tuberculosis (TB) experience significant disruption of their social life and are exposed to stigma and discrimination. This situation impacts on treatment adherence by individual patients and on disease control especially in developing nations. Different aetiological propositions have been propounded, including the relationship of tuberculosis with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate self-reported stigma experience among TB patients in Lagos and examine its socio-demographic determinants. METHOD: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, recruiting 205 patients on treatment at two government-owned referral centres for tuberculosis, using self-administered questionnaires to collect each respondent's data. RESULT: Eighteen percent reported a previous stigma experience. Stigma experience was observed to be significantly determined by age, low socio-economic status, level of education below secondary level, disclosure of status, history of weight loss, previous smoking and alcohol history. Also, patients unable to work on clinic days were more likely to experience stigma. Sex, religion, marital status and ethnicity were not significant determinants. CONCLUSION: Experience of stigma among patients with tuberculosis is common and may adversely affect treatment adherence. Healthcare workers and policy makers need to pay closer attention to the identified determinants for effective tuberculosis control.",African health sciences,2011 Aug,Uganda,2011,10
31868830,Predictors of Opioid and Alcohol Pharmacotherapy Initiation at Hospital Discharge Among Patients Seen by an Inpatient Addiction Consult Service.,"BACKGROUND: Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and alcohol use disorder (MAUD) are effective and under-prescribed. Hospital-based addiction consult services can engage out-of-treatment adults in addictions care. Understanding which patients are most likely to initiate MOUD and MAUD can inform interventions and deepen understanding of hospitals' role in addressing substance use disorders (SUD). OBJECTIVE: Determine patient- and consult-service level characteristics associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation during hospitalization. METHODS: We analyzed data from a study of the Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT), an interprofessional hospital-based addiction consult service at an academic medical center. Researchers collected patient surveys and clinical data from September 2015 to May 2018. We used logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with medication initiation among participants with OUD, AUD, or both. Candidate variables included patient demographics, social determinants, and treatment-related factors. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-nine participants had moderate to severe OUD, AUD, or both and were not engaged in MOUD/MAUD care at admission. Past methadone maintenance treatment (aOR 2.07, 95%CI (1.17, 3.66)), homelessness (aOR 2.63, 95%CI (1.52, 4.53)), and partner substance use (aOR 2.05, 95%CI (1.12, 3.76) were associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation. Concurrent methamphetamine use disorder (aOR 0.32, 95%CI (0.18, 0.56)) was negatively associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation. CONCLUSIONS: The association of MOUD/MAUD initiation with homelessness and partner substance use suggests that hospitalization may be an opportunity to reach highly-vulnerable people, further underscoring the need to provide hospital-based addictions care as a health-system strategy. Methamphetamine's negative association with MOUD/MAUD warrants further study.",Journal of addiction medicine,2019 Dec 20,United States,2019,10
28232769,The Consequences of the Consequences: The Impact of the Environment on People With Aphasia Over Time.,"Understanding the impact of the environment on the participation of people with aphasia depends on one's perspective. A long-term perspective provides a unique insight into the myriad of ways in which the environment can influence the participation of people living with aphasia over decades. In this article, the authors present the real-life story of ""Hank,"" who has lived with aphasia for more than 15 years. The authors consider how 2 different conceptual frameworks-the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and the Social Determinants of Health-account for Hank's experience. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health is useful to conceptualize the range of factors that influence living with aphasia at a particular point in time. In contrast, the Social Determinants of Health is useful to conceptualize the cumulative impact of living with aphasia on long-term health and well-being. Viewing aphasia as a social condition that impacts social determinants of health has potentially wide ranging implications for service design and delivery and the role of speech-language pathologists.",Topics in language disorders,2017 Jan,United States,2017,10
20624293,Social-cognitive correlates of risky adolescent cycling behavior.,"BACKGROUND: Bicycle use entails high safety and health risks especially for adolescents. Most safety education programs aimed at adolescents focus on accident statistics and risk perceptions. This paper proposes the investigation of the social-cognitive correlates of risky cycling behaviors of adolescents prior to developing safety education programs. METHOD: Secondary school students aged 13 to 18 years (n = 1446) filled out questionnaires regarding bicycle behavior, risky intentions, accident experience, and social-cognitive determinants as suggested by the theory of planned behavior. RESULTS: Regression analysis revealed that the proximal variables (i.e., self-efficacy, attitudes towards drunk driving, personal norm regarding safekeeping of self and others, and compared risk) were able to predict 17% of the variance of risky behavior and 23% of the variance of risky intentions. The full model explained respectively 29% and 37% of the variance in risky behavior and risky intentions. Adolescents with positive attitudes towards risky behavior and low sense of responsibility report risky behavior, even when having been (close to) an accident. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents realize whether they are risk takers or not. This implies that the focus of education programs should not be on risk perceptions, but on decreasing positive attitudes towards alcohol in traffic and increasing sense of responsibility instead. Cognitions regarding near accidents should be studied, the role of safe cycling self-efficacy is unclear.",BMC public health,2010 Jul 12,England,2010,10
25247217,Style of coping and its determinants in adults with congenital heart disease in a developing country.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare coping strategies between adults with and without congenital heart disease and to scrutinize the associations between different available resources (e.g., social support) and adoption of certain coping strategies. DESIGN: The study has a cross-sectional case-control design. SETTING: The study was conducted in two university-affiliated heart hospitals in Tehran, Iran. PATIENTS: The participants comprised 347 persons (18-64 years) with and 353 individuals without congenital heart disease, matched by gender and age. OUTCOME MEASURES: Coping strategies, assessed with the Utrecht Coping List-short form, were compared between both groups. Block-wise multiple regression analyses were conducted to scrutinize the associations between different independent variables (e.g., demographic/socioeconomic statuses) and adoption of certain styles of coping (dependent variables) among all participants and separately for each group. RESULTS: The styles of coping in the patients were comparable with those of the control group. Multivariate analyses revealed that congenital heart disease per se was not associated with style of coping except for palliative reaction pattern. The active problem-solving coping style was associated with never married marital status, parenthood, unemployment, higher level of anxiety/somatic symptoms, lower level of depressive symptoms, and better social support. The avoidance behavior style was associated with having a low income, whereas the expression of emotion style was associated with higher anxiety symptoms, experience of financial strain, and income. None of the adopted coping strategies was related to the heart disease variables. CONCLUSIONS: The adults with congenital heart disease coped as well as adults without congenital heart disease. Marital status, parenthood, annual income, financial strain, psychological adjustment, and perceived social support were important explanatory factors in adopting a certain style of coping among adults with congenital heart disease. However, longitudinal studies with repeated measures are warranted.",Congenital heart disease,2014 Jul-Aug,United States,2014,10
25785579,Factors Affecting Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Cholangiocarcinoma in the Northeastern Region of Thailand.,"BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains a major health problem and causes high mortality in Northeastern Thailand. Patients with CCA have a poor prognosis, and little is known about their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its determinants. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate factors affecting HRQOL and its changes over time among CCA patients. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients with CCA were recruited during a 6-month period in 2011 in 5 tertiary hospitals in 4 provinces of northeastern Thailand. Health-related quality of life after diagnosis of CCA was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary questionnaire (Thai version 4). The HRQOL score of CCA patients at different times after diagnosis was compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Generalized estimating equation was used to identify factors affecting HRQOL among CCA patients. RESULTS: Of 237 eligible patients registered, 99 confirmed cases completed follow-up at 2 months. Overall HRQOL varied over time, with the score at baseline being significantly lower than 1 and 2 months later. An adjusted analysis showed that patients who were 60 to 69 years old had higher HRQOL scores than did younger patients. Patients using alternative medicine had lower HRQOL scores than did those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related quality-of-life scores among CCA patients changed over time and were related to age at recruitment and use of alternative medicine. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare providers should carefully communicate about the diagnosis and its implications. Patients with CCA, especially younger patients and those who have used traditional medicine, may benefit from counseling and help with mobilizing family and social support.",Cancer nursing,2015 Nov-Dec,United States,2015,10
24484301,Variations in maternal 5-HTTLPR affect observed sensitive parenting.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the genetic determinants of sensitive parenting. Two earlier studies examined the effect of the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) on sensitive parenting, but reported opposite results. In a large cohort we further examined whether 5-HTTLPR is a predictor of observed maternal sensitivity and whether observed child social fearfulness moderates the effect of 5-HTTLPR on maternal sensitivity. METHODS: The population-based cohort consisted of 767 mother-child dyads. Maternal sensitivity was repeatedly observed at the child's age of 14 months, 36 months and 48 months. Sensitivity was coded using the Ainsworth's rating scales for sensitivity and cooperation and the revised Erickson rating scales for Supportive presence and Intrusiveness. Child social fearfulness was observed using the Stranger Approach episode of the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery at 36 months. RESULTS: Repeated measurement analyses showed a consistent main effect of maternal 5-HTTLPR on sensitivity; mothers carrying the S-allele were more sensitive toward their children (p = .005). This effect was not explained by the child's 5-HTTLPR genotype. We found no evidence that child social fearfulness moderated the effect of 5-HTTLPR on sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that variations in maternal 5-HTTLPR genotype appear to be involved in the etiology of parenting behavior. The observed effects of this genetic variation are consistent with the notion that parenting may have a genetic component, but large studies are needed to find the specific small molecular effects.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",2014 Sep,England,2014,10
23445696,Empowerment of the rural parents/caregivers of children with heart diseases in Namibia to facilitate coping with the demands of caring at home.,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to describe how the parents/caregivers of children with heart diseases cope with the demands of caring for these children at home, with the purpose to develop a home-based health care programme to facilitate the parents/caregivers' coping with the demands of care. METHODS: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, and contextual study was conducted. Phenomenological data on the lived experiences of coping with the demands to care by the parents/caregivers and of living with the burden of the disease by the children were gathered and interpreted from a purposefully selected sample of 5 multiple cases of parents/caregivers and children with heart disease from the rural areas. RESULTS: The findings have revealed poor coping with the demands of caring among the parents/caregivers, as characterized by the experiences of emotional challenges, disruptive social functioning and social relations, lack of support from the family and societal organizations, financial difficulties and of course the experiences of decreased vitality by the children. As a result, the need to empower the parents/caregivers for them to cope with providing a continuum care to their children who have heart disease was identified. The dynamics to mitigate the negative experiences were conceptualized. Therefore, the interventions of a home-based health care programme as an interface to facilitate the parents/caregivers to cope with the challenges caused by the demands to care were developed. CONCLUSIONS: The need for empowerment of these parents/caregivers can be met through the implementation of multi-component interventions, which draw together all the possible determinants factors and the coping methods to facilitate coping.",Global journal of health science,2012 Dec 4,Canada,2012,10
28221952,Development of a Home Food Safety Questionnaire Based on the PRECEDE Model: Targeting Iranian Women.,"Food safety is an essential public health issue for all countries. This study was the first attempt to design and develop a home food safety questionnaire (HFSQ), in the conceptual framework of the PRECEDE (predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling constructs in educational diagnosis and evaluation) model, and to assess its validity and reliability. The HFSQ was developed by reviewing electronic databases and 12 focus group discussions with 96 women volunteers. Ten panel members reviewed the questionnaire, and the content validity ratio and content validity index were computed. Twenty women completed the HFSQ, and face validity was assessed. Women who were responsible for food handling in their households (n =320) were selected randomly from 10 health centers and completed the HFSQ based on the PRECEDE model. To examine the construct validity, a principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation was used. Internal consistency was determined with Cronbach's alpha. Reproducibility was checked by Kendall's tau after 4 weeks with 30 women. The developed HSFQ was considered acceptable with a content validity index of 0.88. Face validity revealed that 95% of the participants understood the questions and found them easy to answer, and 90% confirmed the appearance of the HFSQ and declared the layout acceptable. Principal component factor analysis revealed that the HFSQ could explain 33.7, 55.3, 34.8, and 60.0% of the total variance of the predisposing, reinforcing, practice, and enabling components, respectively. Cronbach's alpha was acceptable at 0.73. For Kendall's tauc, r = 0.89, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.85 to 0.93. The HFSQ developed based on the PRECEDE model met the standards of acceptable reliability and validity, which can be generalized to a wider population. These results can provide information for the development of effective communication strategies to promote home food safety.",Journal of food protection,2016 Dec,United States,2016,10
29084537,Social and environmental determinants of child health in Mongolia across years of rapid economic growth: 2000-2010.,"BACKGROUND: To understand the effect of economic growth on health, we investigated the trend in socio-economic and regional determinants of child health in Mongolia. This Central Asian country had the fastest economic growth amongst low and middle-income countries (LMICs) from 2000 to 2010 and a healthcare system in transition. METHODS: Data was from Mongolian multiple indicator cluster surveys (MICS) in 2000, 2005 and 2010. Child nutrition/growth was measured by height-for-age z-score (HAZ), weight-for-age z-score (WAZ), prevalence of stunted (HAZ < -2) and underweight (WAZ < -2) children. Access to health care was measured by prevalence of fully immunised children <5 years. Multivariate multi-level logistic mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of socio-economic and environmental health determinants on each outcome in each year; 2000, 2005 and 2010. T-tests were used to measure significant change in HAZ and WAZ over the decade. RESULTS: Overall, from 2000 to 2010, there was a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in all three outcomes, but the effect of socio-economic factors increased on both stunting and weight. In 2000, region was a significant determinant: children living in three provinces were significantly more likely to be stunted and less likely to be immunised than Ulaanbaatar, but this was not significant by 2010. By 2010, none of the factors were significant determinants of immunisation in children. In 2000, economic status had no effect on stunting (OR = 0.91; 95%CI:0.49,1.66), however by 2010, children in the poorest economic quintile were 4 times more likely to be stunted than the richest (OR = 0.24; 95% CI:0.13,0.45; p < 0.001). The effect of maternal education on stunting prevalence continued over the 10 years, in both 2000 and 2010 children were twice as likely to be stunted if their mother had no education compared to university education (2000 OR = 0.45; 95% CI:0.28,0.73, p < 0.01,2010 OR =0.55; 95% CI:0.35,0.87, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Economic growth in Mongolia from 2000 to 2010 resulted in an increase in the effect of social determinants of child health; whilst focused policy improved access to immunisation. Children with less educated mothers and lower household incomes should be targeted in interventions to reduce health inequity.",International journal for equity in health,2017 Oct 30,England,2017,10
31336284,Internet addiction and sleep problems: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The pathological use of the internet - conceptualized as 'internet addiction' - might be crucial in initiating and increasing sleep disturbances in the community. While inconsistent evidence is reported regarding the association of internet addiction and sleep disturbances, the severity of this association remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to increase our understanding of the relationship between internet addiction and sleep disturbances. A systematic review was conducted through Scopus, PubMed Central, ProQuest, ISI Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE using keywords related to internet addiction and sleep problems. Observational studies (cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies) focusing on association between internet addiction and sleep disturbances including sleep problems and sleep duration were selected. A meta-analysis using random-effect model was conducted to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for experiencing sleep problems and standardized mean differences (SMDs) for sleep duration. Eligible studies (N = 23) included 35,684 participants. The overall pooled OR of having sleep problems if addicted to the internet was 2.20 (95% CI: 1.77-2.74). Additionally, the overall pooled SMDs for sleep duration for the IA group compared to normal internet users was -0.24 (95% CI: -0.38, -0.10). Results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant OR for sleep problems and a significant reduced sleep duration among individuals addicted to the internet.",Sleep medicine reviews,2019 Oct,England,2019,10
26928216,Moving forward monitoring of the social determinants of health in a country: lessons from England 5 years after the Marmot Review.,"BACKGROUND: England has a long history of government-commissioned reviews of national inequalities. The latest review, the Marmot Review, was commissioned by a government headed by the same party (the Labour Party) that had introduced the National Health Service in 1948, but the review was implemented by a coalition of different parties (Conservatives and Liberal Democrats). At the same time, a government reform of health services took place, and the monitoring of the existing inequality strategy was changed. OBJECTIVES: This paper examines the lessons that can be learned about indicators for monitoring social determinants of health inequalities from the Marmot Review and recent health inequality strategies in England. DESIGN: The paper provides a narrative review of key findings on the collection, presentation, and analysis of routine data in England in the past 5 years, comparing what has been learned from the Marmot Review and other evaluations of the first health inequality strategy in England. RESULTS: The emphasis on monitoring has progressively shifted from monitoring a small number of targets and supporting information to frameworks that monitor across a wide range of determinants of both the causes of ill-health and of health service performance. As these frameworks become ever larger, some consideration is being given to the key indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Although the frameworks used in England for monitoring health inequality strategies have developed considerably since the first strategy began, lessons continue to be learned about how monitoring could be improved. Many of these are applicable to countries initiating or reviewing their strategies.",Global health action,2016,United States,2016,10
26747470,A systematic literature review of the key challenges for developing the structure of public health economic models.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the key methodological challenges for public health economic modelling and set an agenda for future research. METHODS: An iterative literature search identified papers describing methodological challenges for developing the structure of public health economic models. Additional multidisciplinary literature searches helped expand upon important ideas raised within the review. RESULTS: Fifteen articles were identified within the formal literature search, highlighting three key challenges: inclusion of non-healthcare costs and outcomes; inclusion of equity; and modelling complex systems and multi-component interventions. Based upon these and multidisciplinary searches about dynamic complexity, the social determinants of health, and models of human behaviour, six areas for future research were specified. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on: the use of systems approaches within health economic modelling; approaches to assist the systematic consideration of the social determinants of health; methods for incorporating models of behaviour and social interactions; consideration of equity; and methodology to help modellers develop valid, credible and transparent public health economic model structures.",International journal of public health,2016 Apr,Switzerland,2016,10
29267707,Healthier Saire: a intersectorial policy as a turning point for local equity.,"Public health studies see intersectoriality as a strategy to promote equity in addressing the social determinants of health. The municipality of Saire, a member of the Healthy Pernambuco Municipalities Network (RPMS), stands out for its adoption of an intersectorial policy, named A Healthier Saire. This present study examines how this policy has promoted local equity. It was a case study using a timeline to record critical events, analysis of documents, interviews and participant observation. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) was used as a theoretical reference, and showed how adoption of the municipal policy had been central in promoting local empowerment and equity. The results, based on the timeline, demonstrate that initially it was necessary to obtain a cognitive translation, conducted through the direct influence and responsibility of the RPMS, which facilitated a second, strategic translation, with the construction of a policy anchored on the municipal program - which is currently being translated logistically into concrete actions directed towards equity. Key factors in this process for promoting local equity were: the role of strategic leadership; the value given to training; and the retention and use of structures that had previously been built.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2017 Dec,Brazil,2017,10
28279627,Making New Connections: Insights from Primate-Parasite Networks.,"Social interactions are important in everyday life for primates and many other group-living animals; however, these essential exchanges also provide opportunities for parasites to spread through social groups. Network analysis is a unique toolkit for studying pathogen transmission in a social context, and recent primate-parasite network studies shed light on linkages between behavior and infectious disease dynamics, providing insights for conservation and public health. We review existing literature on primate-parasite networks, examining determinants of infection risk, issues of network scale and temporal dynamics, and applications for disease control. We also discuss analytical and conceptual gaps that should be addressed to improve our understanding of how individual and group-level factors affect infection risk, while highlighting interesting areas for future research.",Trends in parasitology,2017 Jul,England,2017,10
22491757,Quality of life and social determinants of anxiolytics and hypnotics use in women in Poland: a population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The majority of studies show a substantially higher consumption of anxiolytics and antidepressants among women than among men and in the age bracket above 45 years. AIMS: To analyse association between the use of hypnotics/anxiolytics, and various characteristics of Polish women, including health-related quality of life. METHOD: One thousand, five hundred and sixty (1,560) women aged 45-60 years completed a questionnaire dealing with the use of hypnotics/anxiolytics, demographic characteristics, environmental and work stress exposure, and self-reported quality of life (SF-36 form). RESULTS: The following variables were revealed as the predictors of hypnotic/anxiolytic use on univariate analysis: age; social pension; stress at work and environmental stress; hormone replacement therapy; headache; palpitations; mood swings or increased muscular tension; anger; duration of symptoms longer than one week; consulting a specialist; and low physical and mental health-related quality of life. The significant protective factors included: vocational and tertiary education; job satisfaction; and home as place of rest. The independent predictors of anxiolytic/hypnotic use included consulting a specialist and symptoms lasting more than one week, while job satisfaction and home as place of rest were the independent protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: The use of hypnotic/anxiolytic medication is strongly associated with environmental and psychosocial characteristics of women between 40 and 65 years of age.",The International journal of social psychiatry,2013 May,England,2013,10
25775932,Making the case for investment in public health: experiences of Directors of Public Health in English local government.,"BACKGROUND: Amid local government budget cuts, there is concern that the ring-fenced public health grant is being appropriated, and Directors of Public Health (DsPH) find it difficult to make the case for investment in public health activity. This paper describes what DsPH are making the case for, the components of their case and how they present the case for public health. METHODS: Thirteen semi-structured telephone interviews and a group discussion were carried out with DsPH (November 2013 to May 2014) in the Southern region of England. RESULTS: DsPH make the case for control of the public health grant and investing in action on wider determinants of health. The cases they present incorporate arguments about need, solutions and their effectiveness, health outcomes, cost and economic impact but also normative, political arguments. Many types of evidence were used to substantiate the cases; evidence was carefully framed to be accessible and persuasive. CONCLUSIONS: DsPH are responding to a new environment; economic arguments and evidence of impact are key components of the case for public health, although multiple factors influence local government (LG) decisions around health improvement. Further evidence of economic impact would be helpful in making the case for public health in LG.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2016 Jun,England,2016,10
25798475,A comparison of White and Hispanic women's stories of adjustment to the birth of a child.,"As part of a larger project designed to inform prevention and treatment of postpartum depression and promote positive mother-child relationships in diverse families, this study describes personal stories of postnatal adjustment from 14 White and 9 Hispanic women recruited from prenatal care clinics. Qualitative interviews conducted in the mothers' primary language (English or Spanish) were analyzed using a modified grounded theory content-analysis approach. The coding scheme developed to capture the women's discourse about their experiences included child temperament and health; intergenerational patterns; work demands and job loss; schedule changes; increased responsibilities; difficulties with parenting tasks; emotional distress; social stressors and resources; coping strategies; and changes in work, personal, social, and marital domains. More White mothers than Hispanic mothers reported changes in time structure, work stressors, use of psychotropic medication, informational support, and social support from other mothers and professionals; however, within-group differences were more evident than were cross-group ethnic differences. Analyses of qualitative interviews led to the integration of Belsky's Determinants of Parenting Model (1984) and the Double ABCX Model of Family Adjustment and Adaptation (McCubbin & Patterson, 1983) into a hybrid third theoretical framework.",Infant mental health journal,2014 May-Jun,United States,2014,10
26783759,Factors Contributing to Maternal and Child Mortality Reductions in 146 Low- and Middle-Income Countries between 1990 and 2010.,"INTRODUCTION: From 1990-2010, worldwide child mortality declined by 43%, and maternal mortality declined by 40%. This paper compares two sources of progress: improvements in societal coverage of health determinants versus improvements in the impact of health determinants as a result of technical change. METHODS: This paper decomposes the progress made by 146 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in lowering childhood and maternal mortality into one component due to better health determinants like literacy, income, and health coverage and a second component due to changes in the impact of these health determinants. Health determinants were selected from eight distinct health-impacting sectors. Health determinants were selected from eight distinct health-impacting sectors. Regression models are used to estimate impact size in 1990 and again in 2010. Changes in the levels of health determinants were measured using secondary data. FINDINGS: The model shows that respectively 100% and 89% of the reductions in maternal and child mortality since 1990 were due to improvements in nationwide coverage of health determinants. The relative share of overall improvement attributable to any single determinant varies by country and by model specification. However, in aggregate, approximately 50% of the mortality reductions were due to improvements in the health sector, and the other 50% of the mortality reductions were due to gains outside the health sector. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, countries improved maternal and child health (MCH) from 1990 to 2010 mainly through improvements in the societal coverage of a broad array of health system, social, economic and environmental determinants of child health. These findings vindicate efforts by the global community to obtain such improvements, and align with the post-2015 development agenda that builds on the lessons from the MDGs and highlights the importance of promoting health and sustainable development in a more integrated manner across sectors.",PloS one,2016,United States,2016,10
25326177,Inequalities in the social determinants of health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People: a cross-sectional population-based study in the Australian state of Victoria.,"INTRODUCTION: Aboriginal Australians are a culturally, linguistically and experientially diverse population, for whom national statistics may mask important geographic differences in their health and the determinants of their health. We sought to identify the determinants of health of Aboriginal adults who lived in the state of Victoria, compared with their non-Aboriginal counterparts. METHODS: We obtained data from the 2008 Victorian Population Health Survey: a cross-sectional computer-assisted telephone interview survey of 34,168 randomly selected adults. The data included measures of the social determinants of health (socioeconomic status (SES), psychosocial risk factors, and social capital), lifestyle risk factors, health care service use, and health outcomes. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) using a generalised linear model with a log link function and binomial distribution; adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Aboriginal Victorians had a higher prevalence of self-rated fair or poor health, cancer, depression and anxiety, and asthma; most notably depression and anxiety (PR = 1.7, 95% CI; 1.4-2.2). Determinants that were statistically significantly different between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Victorians included: a higher prevalence of psychosocial risk factors (psychological distress, food insecurity and financial stress); lower SES (not being employed and low income); lower social capital (neighbourhood tenure of less than one year, inability to get help from family, didn't feel valued by society, didn't agree most people could be trusted, not a member of a community group); and a higher prevalence of lifestyle risk factors (smoking, obesity and inadequate fruit intake). A higher proportion of Aboriginal Victorians sought help for a mental health related problem and had had a blood pressure check in the previous two years. CONCLUSIONS: We identified inequalities in health between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Victorians, most notably in the prevalence of depression and anxiety, and the social determinants of health (psychosocial risk factors, SES, and social capital). This has implications for evidence-based policy development and may inform the development of public health interventions.",International journal for equity in health,2014 Oct 18,England,2014,10
24316457,A mass phenomenon: the social evolution of obesity.,"This paper proposes a theory for the social evolution of obesity. It considers a society in which individuals experience utility from consumption of food and non-food, the state of their health, and the evaluation of their appearance by others. The theory explains under which conditions poor persons are more prone to be overweight although eating is expensive and it shows how obesity occurs as a social phenomenon such that body mass continues to rise long after the initial cause (e.g. a lower price of food) is gone. The paper investigates the determinants of a steady state at which the median person is overweight and how an originally lean society arrives at such a steady state. Extensions of the theory towards dietary choice and the possibility to exercise in order to lose weight demonstrate robustness of the basic mechanism and provide further interesting results.",Journal of health economics,2014 Jan,Netherlands,2014,10
21033147,[Predictors of return to work after occupational injury in a locomotive enterprise].,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the potential determinants of return to work (RTW) following work-related injury. METHODS: A historical cohort of workers with occupational injury in a state-owned locomotive vehicle company in central China was followed up for RTW. Demographic, employment and medical information was retrieved from the company archival documents; and post-injury information was interviewed by questionnaires. Univariate analysis and Cox Regression Model were used to examine the associations between potential determinants and outcomes of RTW. RESULTS: Three hundred of the 323 included cases (92.9%) eventually returned to work after the median absence of 43 days (average of 49.2 days). Factors from socio-demographic, clinical, economic and psychological domains were found affecting RTW in the univariate analyses. The multivariate analysis indicated that age, injury severity, injury locus, injury nature, pain in the injury locus, self-reported health status and pre-injury monthly salary were significant determinants of RTW. CONCLUSIONS: There are multidimensional factors affecting RTW after occupational injury. Proper clinical treatment and rehabilitation, as well as economic and social support to facilitate workers' RTW would be the priorities for intervention. Future studies should be conducted in a larger representative sample to confirm the findings and to develop a multidisciplinary intervention strategy towards promoting RTW.",Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases,2010 Jun,China,2010,10
29187122,Social determinants of cancer incidence and mortality around the world: an ecological study.,"Cancer continues to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity the world over. While the incidence of cancer is projected to increase by 70% over the next two decades, some research findings suggest a disproportionate distribution of new cancer cases and attendant fatalities across certain regions of the world, with poor and lower income countries worse affected at a time when advances in cancer research, medical technology, and drug development are giving rise to better cancer survival in developed countries. In this study, the role of selected social determinants of health in gauging cancer outcomes relative to incidence across various countries in different regions of the world was explored. The results indicated that the education index, income index, Gini coefficient, availability of cancer control policies and programs, as well as health system performance have an association with and are good predictors of the mortality to incidence ratio (MIR) of lung, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. In other words, populations with better education, higher incomes and lower inequalities, active cancer control policies and programs and high performing health systems have better cancer outcomes as reflected in lower MIRs relative to other populations.",Global health promotion,2019 Mar,England,2019,10
27178804,Social Determinants of Racial Disparities in CKD.,"Significant disparities in CKD rates and outcomes exist between black and white Americans. Health disparities are defined as health differences that adversely affect disadvantaged populations, on the basis of one or more health outcomes. CKD is the complex result of genetic and environmental factors, reflecting the balance of nature and nurture. Social determinants of health have an important role as environmental components, especially for black populations, who are disproportionately disadvantaged. Understanding the social determinants of health and appreciating the underlying differences associated with meaningful clinical outcomes may help nephrologists treat all their patients with CKD in an optimal manner. Altering the social determinants of health, although difficult, may embody important policy and research efforts, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for patients with kidney diseases, and minimizing the disparities between groups.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2016 Sep,United States,2016,10
31866239,Prevalence of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes-Related Complications and Their Association With Determinants Identified in Canada's Survey on Living With Chronic Diseases-Diabetes Component.,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, we estimated the prevalence of diabetes-related complications and the factors associated with them in Canadian patients with diabetes. METHODS: Data from the 2011 Survey on Living with Chronic Diseases in Canada---Diabetes Component (SLCDC-DM-2011) were used to calculate the weighted prevalence of 16 diabetes-related complications. A multivariable, sex-stratified logistic regression model was used to examine the association between each diabetes-related complication and select determinants. RESULTS: Among Canadian patients who self-reported having diabetes, 80.26% reported having at least 1 type of diabetes-related complication. The most frequently reported complications were high blood pressure (54.65%), cataracts (29.52%) and poor circulation (21.68%). Male patients were more associated to have at least 1 complication if they had an inappropriate body mass index (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39 to 6.23) and had a high level of glycated hemoglobin (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.05 to 5.13), were older (OR, 6.92; 95% CI, 1.82 to 24.74) and had diabetes for a longer period of time (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.71 to 6.85). Among the female patients, a longer duration diabetes was found to have a significant association with complications (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3.81). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that socioeconomic factors, including marital status, income and education, have a significant association with most types of complications. Our findings also confirm that low levels of physical activity and high levels of glycated hemoglobin were major determinants in many diabetes-related complications.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2019 Sep 24,Canada,2019,10
31182565,Creating Awareness for the Social Determinants of Health: Dental hygiene and nursing student interprofessional service-learning experiences.,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a service-learning interprofessional education (IPE) experience with dental hygiene students and undergraduate nursing students could reinforce learning related to Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) sub-competencies.Methods: Dental hygiene students were provided an IPE experience document to guide group discussion and written reflection prior to a school-based service-learning activity with nursing students. Dental hygiene students were responsible for conducting oral exams and providing oral hygiene instruction while nursing students were responsible for taking blood pressure, calculating body mass index, and classifying risk for obesity. The dental hygiene students completed individual written reflection assignments following the activity and the narrative responses were independently analyzed for themes related to the IPEC sub-competencies and for learning beyond the targeted sub-competencies.Results: Student reflection assignments confirmed that the learning outcomes were met. Themes from the written reflections indicated that students recognized social barriers related to health and the need for multiple professions to promote health. Responses also suggested the potential formation of negative bias.Conclusion: Service-learning activities enhance IPE and learning outcomes on the topic of social determinants of health. Group discussion and individual reflection are essential components to consider when designing a service-learning IPE experience.",Journal of dental hygiene : JDH,2019 Jun,United States,2019,10
27544487,Exposure of the German general population to platinum and rhodium - Urinary levels and determining factors.,"In this study the exposure of the general population in Germany to platinum and rhodium and its determinants was investigated in 259 participants (subdivided in three groups) by urine analyses and assessment of the dental status. Complementary, an interview including questions characterising possible exposure to traffic exhaust was conducted. The median excretion was 2.42ng platinum/g creatinine and 7.27ng rhodium/g creatinine. The detailed analysis of the collected data showed significant higher platinum excretion values with increasing number of surfaces covered with restorations containing precious metals (R=0.389; p<0.001), but also higher values for habitants of urban areas (median=3.43ng/g creatinine; 95th percentile=25.2ng/g) compared with those of rural areas (median=2.06ng/g creatinine; 95th percentile=20.0ng/g). Also, participants working in urban areas showed higher platinum excretion values (median=3.27ng/g; 95th percentile=19.6ng/g). Male participants living and working next to highly frequented roads showed higher rhodium excretion values (median=7.27ng/g; 95th percentile=13.5 ng/g). In summary, the study showed that exhaust emissions have an influence on platinum and rhodium excretion, but for platinum this influence is rather low compared to the influence of precious metals containing restorations.",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,2016 Nov,Germany,2016,10

RESULTS: The summary of the findings indicated 8 components and 25 subcomponents for health information needs of women during disasters. These information needs included primary needs and secondary needs such as psychological, social, cultural, support and rescue, policy-making, media coverage, and environmental needs. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study can be used by authorities and policy-makers during disasters and rescue efforts for the female population and can help improve the general health status of the society.",Journal of education and health promotion,2018,India,2018,10
20980087,"Infant mortality, season of birth and the health of older Puerto Rican adults.","The increasing prevalence of heart disease and diabetes among aging populations in low and middle income countries leads to questions regarding the degree to which endogenous early life exposures (exposures in utero) are important determinants of these health conditions. We devised a test using infant mortality (IMR) to verify if season of birth is a good indicator of early life (in utero) conditions that precipitate adult onset of disease. We linked annual IMR at the municipality (municipio) level from the late 1920s to early 1940s with individual birth year and place using a representative sample of older Puerto Rican adults (n = 1447) from the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. We estimated the effects of season of birth on adult heart disease and diabetes for all respondents and then for respondents according to whether they were born when IMR was lower or higher, controlling for age, gender, obesity, respondent's educational level, adult behavior (smoking and exercise) and other early life exposures (childhood health, knee height and childhood socioeconomic status (SES)). The pattern of effects suggests that season of birth reflects endogenous causes: (1) odds of heart disease and diabetes were strong and significant for those born during the lean season in years when IMR was lower; (2) effects remained consistent even after controlling for other childhood conditions and adult behavior; but (3) no seasonality effects on adult health for adults born when IMR was higher. We conclude that in this population of older Puerto Rican adults there is continued support that the timing of adverse endogenous (in utero) conditions such as poor nutrition and infectious diseases is associated with adult heart disease and diabetes. It will be important to test the validity of these findings in other similar populations in the developing world.",Social science & medicine (1982),2011 Mar,England,2011,10
22324562,Personal and environmental factors contributing to participation in romantic relationships and sexual activity of young adults with cerebral palsy.,"PURPOSE: To study determinants of romantic relationships and sexual activity of young adults with cerebral palsy (CP), focusing on personal and environmental factors. METHOD: A cohort study was performed with 74 young adults (46 men; 28 women) aged 20-25 years (SD 1.4) with CP (49% unilateral CP, 76% GMFCS level I, 85% MACS level I). All participants were of normal intelligence. Romantic relationships, sexual activity (outcome measures), personal and environmental factors (associated factors) were assessed. Associations were analyzed using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: More females than males with CP were in a current romantic relationship. Self-esteem, sexual esteem and feelings of competence regarding self-efficacy contributed positively to having current romantic relationships. A negative parenting style contributed negatively. Age and gross motor functioning explained 20% of the variance in experience with intercourse. In addition, sexual esteem and taking initiative contributed significantly to intercourse experience. CONCLUSIONS: For young adults with CP personal factors (20-35% explained variances) seem to contribute more than environmental factors (9-12% explained variances) to current romantic relationships and sexual experiences. We advice parents and professionals to focus on self-efficacy, self-esteem and sexual self-esteem in development of young adults with CP. [ IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: * The severity of gross motor functioning contributed somewhat to sexual activities, but not to romantic relationships.* High self-efficacy, self-esteem and sexual self-esteem can facilitate involvement in romantic and sexual relationships for young adults with CP.]",Disability and rehabilitation,2012,England,2012,10
22909103,Periodontal health and global public health.,"Chronic diseases are a growing burden to people, to health-care systems and to societies across the world. The rapid increase in the burden of chronic diseases is particularly prevalent in the developing countries. Periodontal disease is one of the two most important oral diseases contributing to the global burden of chronic disease. In addition to social determinants, periodontal health status is related to several proximal factors. Modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet and nutrition, obesity, psychological stress and insufficient personal/oral hygiene, are important and these principal risk factors for periodontal disease are shared by other chronic diseases. The present monograph is devoted to the existing evidence on the practice of public health related to periodontal health. Public health is defined as the process of mobilizing and engaging local, national and international resources to assure that people can be healthy. Social determinants of health, environmental hazards and unhealthy lifestyles are prioritized in modern public health-care. Disease prevention and health promotion are cornerstones in actions for public health. This volume of Periodontology 2000 is entitled 'Periodontal health and global public health'; the 12 articles of this volume discuss different aspects of this statement. It covers a range of subjects from public health issues to patient care. This monograph intends to stimulate community action research in the field of periodontology in order to help the development of appropriate public health intervention and relevant surveillance programs. It also expects to stimulate health authorities and professional organizations to initiate and support actions to promote periodontal health in their respective countries.",Periodontology 2000,2012 Oct,Denmark,2012,10

This study tried to investigate the relationships between information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model constructs as predictors of high school student's health-promoting lifestyle (HPL) in Southwest Iran. Methods This cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 400 students in Southwest Iran. Sample size required for this study was obtained using Soper's structural equation modeling (SEM) calculator. The stratified random sampling method was used in this study. A path analysis was taken to evaluate the HPL main determinants utilizing SEM. Results Information only had a significant indirect relationship with adolescents' HPL. But, both motivation and behavioral skills constructs had significant direct and indirect relationship with adolescents' HPL. The behavioral skill construct was the most imperative predictor variable. In general, behavioral skills construct (75%), motivation (66%) and knowledge (50%) constructs had the highest impact on HPL. The IMB model was able to explain 71% of the variance in adolescents' HPL. Conclusion The findings of the study showed that the IMB model was appropriate for explaining adolescents' HPL. It is necessary that actions are taken to improve behavioral skills and promote adolescents' HPL.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2018 Feb 5,Germany,2018,10
30318900,Perceived HIV risk as a predictor of sexual risk behaviors and discrimination among high-risk women.,"HIV risk perception and discrimination are important determinants of HIV prevention among vulnerable populations. Using Detroit's 2016 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) Survey, we evaluated demographic variables, risk behaviors, and perception of HIV stigma and discrimination stratified by perceived HIV risk (high, medium, low) in a sample of high-risk women. Significant variables were identified using Pearson Chi-squared tests and one-way analysis of variance tests. Among 541 females surveyed, 93.0% were black and 87.7% lived in poverty. Women's poverty (p = .010), employment (p = .012), insurance (p = .024) and homelessness status (p < .001) were all significantly associated with their level of HIV risk perception. Among women with low HIV risk perception (76.7%), the majority did not know their partner's HIV status at last intercourse (68.7%, p = .007), had unprotected anal/vaginal sex in the past year (86.7%, p = .025), participated in sex exchange (63.4%, p < .001), and did not use condoms with a partner with HIV-unknown status (87.2%, p < .001). Half of the women agreed or strongly agreed most people would not be friends with someone with HIV (50.4%), and 46.3% agreed or strongly agreed most people would support PLWH to live or work where they want. Compared to women with low HIV risk perception, women with high perceived HIV risk were more likely to agree or strongly agree most people would discriminate against someone with HIV (87.3% vs. 76.8%) and that people who got HIV via sex exchange or drugs got what they deserve (46.6% vs. 25.8%). Women's perceived HIV risk was not significantly associated with these discriminatory attitudes. Despite multiple risk behaviors significantly associated with the level of perceived HIV risk in the sample, the NHBS survey demonstrates many women with high-risk behaviors still perceive themselves to be at low risk. Our findings highlight a complex interaction of risk perception, risk behaviors and stigma surrounding HIV in high-risk women.",AIDS care,2019 Jun,England,2019,10
29980641,Socioeconomic determinants of outcome after childhood arterial ischemic stroke.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with worse 1-year neurologic outcomes and reduced access to rehabilitation services in children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS: From 2010 to 2014, the Vascular effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke (VIPS) observational study prospectively enrolled and confirmed 355 children (age 29 days-18 years) with AIS at 37 international centers. SES markers measured via parental interview included annual household income (US dollars) at the time of enrollment, maternal education level, and rural/suburban/urban residence. Receipt of rehabilitation services was measured by parental report. Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure scores were categorized as 0 to 1, 1.5 to 3, 3.5 to 6, and 6.5 to 10. Univariate and multivariable ordinal logistic regression models examined potential predictors of outcome. RESULTS: At 12 +/- 3 months after stroke, 320 children had documented outcome measurements, including 15 who had died. In univariate analysis, very low income (<US $10,000), but not other markers of SES, was associated with worse outcomes (odds ratio [OR] 3.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-6.88, p = 0.004). In multivariable analysis, including adjustment for stroke etiology, this association persisted (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.18-8.47, p = 0.02). Income did not correlate with receiving rehabilitation services at 1 year after stroke; however, quality and quantity of services were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multinational, prospective cohort of children with AIS, low income was associated with worse neurologic outcomes compared to higher income levels. This difference was not explained by stroke type, neurologic comorbidities, or reported use of rehabilitation services. The root causes of this disparity are not clear and warrant further investigation.",Neurology,2018 Aug 7,United States,2018,10
30503217,HTLV-1 is rare in Far North Queensland despite a significant burden of classically associated diseases.,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is hyperendemic amongst Indigenous Australians living in Central Australia. The epidemiology of the disease is poorly defined in other parts of Australia, despite a high prevalence of classically associated conditions. All HTLV-1 serology tests requested through public health facilities in Far North Queensland (FNQ) from January 1999 to December 2016 were reviewed. The person's age, sex, ethnicity, location, rationale for testing and result were recorded. There were 444 tests performed in 409 people; 217 (53%) were male; 171 (42%) identified as Indigenous Australians. Testing increased over time and was performed throughout the region, suggesting increasing awareness of the disease. Testing occurred in patients with haematological, neurological, dermatological and respiratory complaints, but only four (1%) had proven infection. Three of these individuals were in the same family and two were asymptomatic. One of the two symptomatic seropostive individuals had recurrent scabies infection, the other T-cell lymphoma. HTLV-1 infection is extremely uncommon in FNQ. The high rates of bronchiectasis and other associated conditions that are seen in the region are more likely to be addressed by public health policies focusing on the socioeconomic determinants of health.",Pathology,2019 Jan,England,2019,10
29279272,The effects of folate supplementation on lipid profiles among patients with metabolic diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although several studies have assessed the effect of folate supplementation on lipid profiles among patients with metabolic diseases, findings are inconsistent. This review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to summarize the evidence on the effects of folate supplementation on lipid profiles among patients with metabolic diseases. METHODS: Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) published in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases up to until 20 August 2017 were searched. Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias of included studies. Heterogeneity was measured with a Q-test and with I2 statistics. Data were pooled by using the fix or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity test results and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of thirteen randomized controlled trials were included. Folate supplementation did not affect systolic blood pressure (SMD -0.87; 95% CI, -1.83, 0.09) and diastolic blood pressure (SMD -0.59; 95% CI, -1.55, 0.37), and lipid profiles including triglycerides (SMD 0.10; 95% CI, -0.42, 0.63), total- (SMD 0.06; 95% CI, -0.31, 0.43), HDL- (SMD 0.04; 95% CI, -0.36, 0.44), VLDL- (SMD 0.08; 95% CI, -0.24, 0.41), and LDL-cholesterol (SMD -0.14; 95% CI, -0.55, 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Folate supplementation did not affect blood pressures and lipid profiles among patients with metabolic diseases. Additional prospective studies regarding the impact of folate supplementation on blood pressures and lipid profiles in patients with metabolic diseases are necessary.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2018 May,Netherlands,2018,10
26377742,Mind the gap: race/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity.,"Race/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in obesity are substantial and may widen in the future. We review nine potential mechanisms that recent research has used to explain obesity disparities. Those nine mechanisms fall into three broad groups-health behaviors, biological factors, and the social environment-which incorporate both proximate and upstream determinants of obesity disparities. Efforts to reduce the prevalence of obesity in the US population and to close race/ethnic and SES disparities in obesity will likely require the use of multifaceted interventions that target multiple mechanisms simultaneously. Unfortunately, relatively few of the mechanisms reviewed herein have been tested in an intervention framework.",Current diabetes reports,2015 Nov,United States,2015,10
29164171,Health Care Students' Attitudes About Alcohol Consumption During Pregnancy: Responses to Narrative Vignettes.,"This article explores medical, midwifery, and nurse practitioner students' attitudes about women who may consume alcohol throughout their pregnancies. Twenty-one health care students responded to a scenario-based vignette addressing alcohol consumption during pregnancy, as well as a semistructured interview, which were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis approach. Two primary themes related to students' attitudes concerning alcohol consumption during pregnancy were identified: (a) divergent recommendations for different women, based on perceptions of their level of education, culture/ethnicity, and ability to stop drinking; and (b) understanding the social determinants of health, including the normalization of women's alcohol consumption and potential partner violence. Health care professionals in training need further education about the risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). In addition, health care students need training in how to engage in reflective practice to identify their own stereotypical beliefs and attitudes and how these attitudes may affect their practice.",Global qualitative nursing research,2017 Jan-Dec,United States,2017,10
31429419,Potential for Integrating Mental Health Specialist Video Consultations in Office-Based Routine Primary Care: Cross-Sectional Qualitative Study Among Family Physicians.,"BACKGROUND: Although real-time mental health specialist video consultations have been proposed as an effective care model for treating patients with mental health conditions in primary care, little is known about their integration into routine practice from the perspective of family physicians. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the degree to which family physicians advocate that mental health specialist video consultations can be integrated into routine primary care, where most patients with mental health conditions receive treatment. METHODS: In a cross-sectional qualitative study, we conducted 4 semistructured focus groups and 3 telephonic interviews in a sample of 19 family physicians from urban and rural districts. We conducted a qualitative content analysis applying the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases framework in a combined bottom-up (data-driven) and top-down strategy for deriving key domains. RESULTS: Family physicians indicated that mental health specialist video consultations are a promising and practical way to address the most pressing challenges in current practice, that is, to increase the accessibility and co-ordination of specialized care. Individual health professional factors were the most frequently discussed topics. Specifically, family physicians valued the anticipated clinical outcomes for patients and the anticipated resources set for the primary care practice as major facilitators (16/19, 84%). However, family physicians raised a concern regarding a lack of facial expressions and physical interaction (19/19, 100%), especially in emergency situations. Therefore, most family physicians considered a viable emergency plan for mental health specialist video consultations that clearly delineates the responsibilities and tasks of both family physicians and mental health specialists to be essential (11/19, 58%). Social, political, and legal factors, as well as guideline factors, were hardly discussed as prerequisites for individual family physicians to integrate mental health specialist video consultations into routine care. To facilitate the implementation of future mental health specialist video consultation models, we compiled a checklist of recommendations that covers (1) buy-in from practices (eg, emphasizing logistical and psychological relief for the practice), (2) the engagement of patients (eg, establishing a trusted patient-provider relationship), (3) the setup and conduct of consultations (eg, reliable emergency plans), and (4) the fostering of collaboration between family physicians and mental health specialists (eg, kick-off meetings to build trust). CONCLUSIONS: By leveraging the primary care practice as a familiar environment for patients, mental health specialist video consultations provide timely specialist support and potentially lead to benefits for patients and more efficient processes of care. Integration should account for the determinants of practice as described by the family physicians.

22081449,Fair and just or just fair? Examining models of government--not-for-profit engagement under the Australian Social Inclusion Agenda.,"This paper explores the interrelationship between two contemporary policy debates: one focused on the social determinants of health and the other on social (inclusion) policy within contemporary welfare regimes. In both debates, academics and policy makers alike are grappling with the balance between universal and targeted policy initiatives and the role of local 'delivery' organizations in promoting health and social equality. In this paper, we discuss these debates in the context of a recent social policy initiative in Australia: the Social Inclusion Agenda. We examine two proposed models of engagement between the government and the not-for-profit welfare sector for the delivery of social services. We conclude that the two models of engagement currently under consideration by the Australian government have substantially different outcomes for the health of disadvantaged communities and the creation of a more socially inclusive Australia.",Health education research,2012 Aug,England,2012,10
24640712,"[The factor analysis results of the relationship of socio-demographic, clinical and functional indicators with the likelihood of identifying age-related disorders in the population in North-Western Russia].","By using the method of factor analysis (principal component method) the determinants of disease in elderly and senile patients were searched with an estimate of their influence degree in the population of the North-West Russia. The data from medical records of 712 patients of both sexes aged 59 to 98 years were analyzed. The factor 1 proved to be associated with: marital status, living conditions, family relationships, bad habits, appearance, cough, diet, hearing and vision, laxatives, joint health, ability to move and sleep disturbances. Factor 2 combined diseases of older: cerebral stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, kidney disease, obesity, thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, lung disease, anemia, arthritis, osteoporosis, the number of surgeries and joint diseases. The factor 3 was found to self-association ability before and after admission to the assessment of the patients' mental state for MMSE test after admission. It is concluded that the development of age-related (especially the musculoskeletal system pathology) is associated with social characteristics and living conditions of patients, and treatment of the most age-related diseases requires consideration of comorbidity.",Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,2013,Russia (Federation),2013,10
28953999,Multi-criteria decision analysis and spatial statistic: an approach to determining human vulnerability to vector transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi.,"BACKGROUND: Chagas disease (CD), caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected human disease. It is endemic to the Americas and is estimated to have an economic impact, including lost productivity and disability, of 7 billion dollars per year on average. OBJECTIVES: To assess vulnerability to vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi in domiciliary environments within an area undergoing domiciliary vector interruption of T. cruzi in Colombia. METHODS: Multi-criteria decision analysis [preference ranking method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) and geometrical analysis for interactive assistance (GAIA) methods] and spatial statistics were performed on data from a socio-environmental questionnaire and an entomological survey. In the construction of multi-criteria descriptors, decision-making processes and indicators of five determinants of the CD vector pathway were summarily defined, including: (1) house indicator (HI); (2) triatominae indicator (TI); (3) host/reservoir indicator (Ho/RoI); (4) ecotope indicator (EI); and (5) socio-cultural indicator (S-CI). FINDINGS: Determination of vulnerability to CD is mostly influenced by TI, with 44.96% of the total weight in the model, while the lowest contribution was from S-CI, with 7.15%. The five indicators comprise 17 indices, and include 78 of the original 104 priority criteria and variables. The PROMETHEE and GAIA methods proved very efficient for prioritisation and quantitative categorisation of socio-environmental determinants and for better determining which criteria should be considered for interrupting the man-T. cruzi-vector relationship in endemic areas of the Americas. Through the analysis of spatial autocorrelation it is clear that there is a spatial dependence in establishing categories of vulnerability, therefore, the effect of neighbors' setting (border areas) on local values should be incorporated into disease management for establishing programs of surveillance and control of CD via vector. CONCLUSIONS: The study model proposed here is flexible and can be adapted to various eco-epidemiological profiles and is suitable for focusing anti-T. cruzi serological surveillance programs in vulnerable human populations.",Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,2017 Oct,Brazil,2017,10
20712665,'Health equity through action on the social determinants of health': taking up the challenge in nursing.,"Reducing health inequities is a priority issue in Canada and worldwide. In this paper, we argue that nursing has a clear mandate to ensure access to health and health-care by providing sensitive empowering care to those experiencing inequities and working to change underlying social conditions that result in and perpetuate health inequities. We identify key dimensions of the concept of health (in)equities and identify recommendations to reduce inequities advanced in key global and Canadian documents. Using these documents as context, we advocate a 'critical caring approach' that will assist nurses to understand the social, political, economic and historical context of health inequities and to tackle these inequities through policy advocacy. Numerous societal barriers as well as constraints within the nursing profession must be acknowledged and addressed. We offer recommendations related to nursing practice, education and research to move forward the agenda of reducing health inequities through action on the social determinants of health.",Nursing inquiry,2010 Sep,Australia,2010,10
25885001,Social cognitive determinants of HIV voluntary counselling and testing uptake among married individuals in Dar es Salaam Tanzania: Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB).,"BACKGROUND: Cumulative evidence indicates increasing HIV infection among married individuals. Voluntary Counselling and Testing for HIV (HCT) is known to be an effective intervention to induce safer sex behaviour and access to early treatment, care and support among married individuals, which are important for HIV prevention. In this context, knowledge of factors associated with HCT uptake among married individuals is critical in promoting the use of the services. This study therefore intended to identify the social cognitive factors associated with acceptance of HCT among married individuals. METHODS: In a cross-sectional analytical study face to face questionnaires were administered among 200 randomly selected married individuals in Kinondoni district, Dar es Salaam Tanzania. The questionnaire included self-reported HCT, socio-demographic variables and social cognitive variables (attitude, subjective norms, perceived control and perceived risk). Logistic regression was used to identify the independent association of social cognitive predictors of HCT among married individuals. RESULTS: Nearly half (42%) of the respondents had never had HCT. Of the social cognitive constructs, the strongest predictor of HCT uptake was attitude (OR per additional score point = 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.10) followed by perceived behavioural control (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06). Subjective norm and perceived risk were not associated with HCT uptake. CONCLUSION: Public health interventions targeting married individuals should be designed to enhance their positive attitude towards HCT and empower them to overcome barriers to the use of the services.",BMC public health,2015 Mar 4,England,2015,10
27834244,Government Spending In Health And Nonhealth Sectors Associated With Improvement In County Health Rankings.,"There is little evidence to demonstrate the impact on local health outcomes of spending that occurs outside the health care sector. We leveraged novel data from the US Census Bureau to measure the independent impact of a community's health and nonhealth expenditures on a broad measure of overall health-the County Health Rankings-over time. Using lagged longitudinal models that accounted for correlations of health outcomes and expenditures within counties, we found significant positive associations between expenditures and County Health Rankings for seven of the fourteen expenditure categories examined: community health care and public health, public hospitals, fire protection, K-12 education, corrections, libraries, and housing and community development. These areas of social spending have modest but detectable positive associations with population health, whether or not they primarily target health. Achieving improved health outcomes through a culture-of-health ethos should involve the consideration of public expenditures in both health and other social service areas.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2016 Nov 1,United States,2016,10
25073937,Italian deprivation index and dental caries in 12-year-old children: a multilevel Bayesian analysis.,"Evidence from the literature has shown that people with a lower socioeconomic status enjoy less good health than people with a higher socioeconomic status. The Italian deprivation index (DI) was used with the aim to evaluate the association between the DMFT index and risk factors for dental caries, including city population and DI. The study included 4,305 12-year-old children living in 38 cities classified by demographic size as small, midsize and large. Zero-inflated negative binomial multilevel regression models were used to assess risk factors for DMFT and to address excess of zero DMFT and overdispersion through a Bayesian approach. The difference in the average level of DMFT among children living in cities with different DI quintile was not statistically significant (p = 0.578). The DI and ln(population), included as city-level fixed effects in the two-level variance components model, were not statistically significant. Consuming sweet drinks on average increased the mean DMFT of a susceptible child, while having a highly educated mother reduced it. Unobserved heterogeneity among cities was detected for the probability to be non-susceptible to caries (city-level variance = 0.26 with 95% credibility interval 0.09-0.57), while no territorial effect was found for the mean DMFT of the susceptible children. Our results suggest that the DI and city population did not play a role in explaining between-city variability. Interventions against social deprivation can be influential on the perception of oral health in Italian 12-year-old children to the extent that they can also affect individual level factors.",Caries research,2014,Switzerland,2014,10
30451477,"Analysis of the relationship between life expectancy and social determinants in a north-eastern region of Brazil, 2010-2017.","The process of population aging is a worldwide reality becoming a global public health challenge. Although population aging is especially noticeable in more developed regions, there has also been a significant advance in the quantity of elderly people in areas with unfavourable socioeconomic indicators, and a rapid growth in countries with a low level of economic development. This article presents an analysis based on spatial autocorrelation of the relationship between life expectancy and social determinants in a north-eastern region of Brazil. An ecological study was conducted using the secondary data of social, demographic, and health indicators of elderly people collected in the Brazilian Demographic Census of the 75 municipalities of the state of Sergipe. Spatial autocorrelation was evaluated using the Moran global index and the local indicators of space association. Multiple linear regression models were used to identify the relationship between life expectancy and social determinants. The South-eastern region of the state presented clusters with all indicators pointing to acceptable lifestyles, whereas the municipalities of the north-western and far-eastern regions were characterized by values demonstrating precarious living conditions. The high dependency ratio, illiteracy rate, and unemployment rate among elderly people had a negative impact on life expectancy. The evidence confirms that there is an autocorrelation between social determinants and life expectancy, indicating that the worse the social, economic, and health indicators are, the lower the life expectancy. This finding indicates the need to redirect public policies and formulate strategies aimed at reducing social and health inequalities.",Geospatial health,2018 Nov 12,Italy,2018,10
28974029,Social Determinants and Poor Diet Quality of Energy-Dense Diets of Australian Young Adults.,"This research aimed to determine the diet quality and socio-demographic determinants by level of energy-density of diets of Australian young adults. Secondary analysis of the Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey-2011/2012 for adults aged 18-34 years (n = 2397) was conducted. Diet was assessed by 24-h recalls. Dietary energy-density was calculated as dietary energy/grams of food (kJ/g) and the Healthy-Eating-Index-for-Australians (HEIFA-2013) was used to assess diet quality (highest score = 100). Dietary energy-density was examined with respect to diet quality and sociodemographic determinants including gender, highest tertiary-education attainment, country-of-birth, age, income, and socio-economic-index-for-area (SEIFA). Higher dietary energy-density was associated with lower diet quality scores (beta = -3.71, t (2394) = -29.29, p < 0.0001) and included fewer fruits and vegetables, and more discretionary foods. The mean dietary energy-density was 7.7 kJ/g and 7.2 kJ/g for men and women, respectively. Subpopulations most at risk of consuming high energy-dense diets included those with lower education, Australian and English-speaking countries of birth, and men with low income and women from areas of lower socio-economic status. Young adults reporting low energy-dense diets had higher quality diets. Intensive efforts are needed to reduce the high energy-density of young adults' diets, and should ensure they include populations of lower socio-economic status.","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2017 Oct 1,Switzerland,2017,10
26831199,Genetic associations at 53 loci highlight cell types and biological pathways relevant for kidney function.,"Reduced glomerular filtration rate defines chronic kidney disease and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), combining data across 133,413 individuals with replication in up to 42,166 individuals. We identify 24 new and confirm 29 previously identified loci. Of these 53 loci, 19 associate with eGFR among individuals with diabetes. Using bioinformatics, we show that identified genes at eGFR loci are enriched for expression in kidney tissues and in pathways relevant for kidney development and transmembrane transporter activity, kidney structure, and regulation of glucose metabolism. Chromatin state mapping and DNase I hypersensitivity analyses across adult tissues demonstrate preferential mapping of associated variants to regulatory regions in kidney but not extra-renal tissues. These findings suggest that genetic determinants of eGFR are mediated largely through direct effects within the kidney and highlight important cell types and biological pathways.",Nature communications,2016 Jan 21,England,2016,10

27021508,Parents' and staff's support for a childcare agency employee mandatory vaccination policy or agency certification program.,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine-preventable diseases pose a significant risk to children in childcare. However, few regulations exist regarding childcare staff vaccination. This study aimed to assess support for a childcare agency staff mandatory vaccination policy. METHODS: Surveys were distributed to staff and parents at 23 St Louis, Mo, childcare agencies during fall 2014. Staff and parents' support for a mandatory vaccination and/or agency certification program were compared using chi(2) tests. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted using a 2-level nested design and controlling for gender, race, age, and income to determine predictive models for support for a mandatory staff vaccination policy and/or agency certification program. RESULTS: Overall, 354 parents and staff participated (response rate, 32%). Most supported a mandatory staff vaccination policy (80.0%; n = 280) or agency certification program (81.2%; n = 285), and there were no differences between parents versus staff. Determinants of support for a mandatory policy included willingness to receive influenza vaccine annually, belief that vaccines are safe and effective, and support for the policy only if there were no costs. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong support for some type of childcare agency staff vaccination policy. Implementing such a policy/program should be a collaborative endeavor that addresses vaccine cost and access.",American journal of infection control,2016 Jul 1,United States,2016,10
29314275,An approach to the asthma-protective farm effect by geocoding: Good farms and better farms.,"BACKGROUND: The highly consistent association of growing up on a farm with a reduced asthma risk has so far been attributed to direct farm exposure. In contrast, geographic determinants of the larger environment have never been assessed. In this study, the effects of proximity to farms and environmental variables in relation to the residential address on asthma and atopy were assessed. METHODS: Addresses of 2265 children of the Bavarian arm of the GABRIELA study were converted into geocodes. Proximity to the nearest cow farm was calculated, and environmental characteristics were derived from satellite data or terrestrial monitoring. Bacterial diversity in mattress dust samples was assessed in 501 children by sequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicons. Logistic regression models were used to calculate associations between outcomes and exposure variables. RESULTS: Asthma and atopy were inversely associated with the presence of a farm within a radius of maximum 100 m. The environmental variables greenness, tree cover, soil sealing, altitude, air pollution differed not only between farm and non-farm children but also between farm children with and without another farm nearby. The latter distinction revealed strong associations with characteristics of traditional farms including a broader diversity of microbial exposure, which mainly contributed to the protective effect on asthma. In non-farm children, the protective effect of a farm nearby was completely explained by consumption of farm milk. CONCLUSIONS: Clustering of farms within a neighborhood of 100 m is strongly associated with the protective effect on asthma and may represent a more traditional style of farming with broader microbial exposure.",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,2018 May,England,2018,10

22115499,Testing the WHO responsiveness concept in the Iranian mental healthcare system: a qualitative study of service users.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals' experience of interacting with the healthcare system has significant impact on their overall health and well-being. To relate patients' experiences to a common set of standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the concept of health system responsiveness. This study aimed to assess if the WHO responsiveness concept reflected the non-medical expectations of mental healthcare users in Teheran. METHODS: In this qualitative study, four mixed focus group discussions were formed, comprising 53 mental health service users in Tehran, Iran, in 2010. Content analysis was performed for data analysis. Responses were examined in relation to the eight domains of the WHO's responsiveness model. RESULTS: There were many commonalities between the findings of this study and the eight domains of the WHO responsiveness model, although some variations were found. Effective care was a new domain generated from our findings. In addition, the domain of prompt attention was included in two new labelled domains: attention and access to care. Participants could not differentiate autonomy from choice of healthcare provider, believing that free choice is part of autonomy. Therefore these domains were unified under the name of autonomy. The domains of quality of basic amenities, access to social support, dignity and confidentiality were considered to be important for the responsiveness concept. Some differences regarding how these domains should be defined were observed, however. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the concept of responsiveness developed by the WHO is applicable to mental health services in Iran. These findings might help policy-makers' better understanding of what is useful for the improvement of mental health services.",BMC health services research,2011 Nov 25,England,2011,10
25128033,"Difference of the associations between self-rated health and demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and psychosocial work environment between two types of Chinese worksite.","BACKGROUND: Although studies of self-rated health (SRH) are conducted widely in developed countries, comprehensive assessments of the determinants of SRH in Chinese are scarce, particularly for working Chinese individuals. Determinants of SRH might differ among worksites based on differences in the nature and stress associated with different jobs, work intensity, and the lifestyles of employees. METHODS: Two thousand and forty questionnaires that addressed SRH, demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and the psychosocial work environment were administered to employees at two worksites. A total of 1644 subjects provided complete data for analysis (80.6% response rate). RESULTS: Participants from government departments had significantly better SRH than did those from high-tech enterprises (61.1% vs. 67.5%, respectively). Lifestyles were significantly less healthy at government departments compared with high-tech enterprises, whereas the psychosocial work environment was better. The results of unadjusted and adjusted models revealed differences between the potential health-influencing factors of participants based on their type of worksite. In logistic regression models, gender was strongly associated with SRH in all participants, whereas length of service was correlated with SRH only in participants from high-tech enterprises. In high-tech enterprises, good SRH was less common in physically inactive subjects vs. physically active participants (OR = 0.561). In government departments, passive smoking was negatively associated with SRH significantly. Social capital (OR = 1.073) and job control (OR = 1.550) were positively correlated with SRH in high-tech enterprises. Job control was the only psychosocial factor significantly associated with SRH in government departments. CONCLUSIONS: Participants from different types of worksite reported different SRH, healthy lifestyles, and psychosocial work environments. Moreover, the association between SRH and demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and the psychosocial work environment significantly differed by type of worksite.",BMC public health,2014 Aug 15,England,2014,10
26343960,Anticipated HIV Vaccine Acceptability among Sexually Active African-American Adult Women.,"An HIV vaccine, once it becomes available, could reduce vulnerability to HIV among African-American women. The purpose of this study was to assess determinants of HIV vaccine acceptability among African-American women across hypothetical levels of vaccine efficacy. Participants were recruited from a hospital-based family planning clinic in Atlanta, GA serving low-income patients (N = 321). Data were collected from audio-computer assisted surveys administered in the clinic waiting room. Psychosocial survey items were guided by Risk Homeostasis Theory (RHT) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify determinants of acceptability for two hypothetical HIV vaccines with 50% and 90% efficacy. Overall, 63% of participants would accept a vaccine with 50% efficacy and 85% would accept a vaccine with 90% efficacy. In multivariate analyses, odds of acceptability for a vaccine with 50% efficacy were higher among participants with greater perceived HIV vaccine benefits (AOR = 1.13, p < 0.001) and lower among participants with more than high school education (AOR = 0.47, p = 0.033) and greater perceived costs of HIV vaccination (AOR = 0.95, p = 0.010). Odds of acceptability for a vaccine with 90% efficacy were higher among participants with greater perceived costs of unprotected sex (AOR = 1.08, p = 0.026), HIV vaccine benefits (AOR = 1.23, p < 0.001) and self-efficacy for sex refusal (AOR = 1.11, p = 0.044). HIV vaccine acceptability was high, particularly for a vaccine with 90% efficacy. Findings suggest that demographic and psychosocial factors may impact acceptability of an eventual HIV vaccine. Once an HIV vaccine is available, interventions to maximize uptake may benefit from using RHT and SCT constructs to target relevant psychosocial factors, such as perceived benefits and perceived costs of vaccination.",Vaccines,2013 Apr 8,Switzerland,2013,10
26377522,Stigmatizing Images in Obesity Health Campaign Messages and Healthy Behavioral Intentions.,"Background Antiobesity campaigns blaming individual behaviors for obesity have sparked concern that an emphasis on individual behavior may lead to stigmatization of overweight or obese people. Past studies have shown that perpetuating stigma is not effective for influencing behavior. Purpose This study examined whether stigmatizing or nonstigmatizing images and text in antiobesity advertisements led to differences in health-related behavioral intentions. Method Participants in this experiment were 161 American adults. Measures included self-reported body mass index, weight satisfaction, antifat attitudes, and intention to increase healthy behaviors. Results Images in particular prompted intention to increase healthy behavior, but only among participants who were not overweight or obese. Conclusion Images and text emphasizing individual responsibility for obesity may influence behavioral intention among those who are not overweight, but they do not seem to be effective at altering behavioral intentions among overweight people, the target audience for many antiobesity messages. Images in antiobesity messages intended to alter behavior are influential and should be selected carefully.",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,2016 Aug,United States,2016,10
29331823,Pre-pregnancy maternal depressive symptoms and low birth weight and preterm birth outcomes: Assessment of adolescent background characteristics and birth outcomes in adulthood.,"PURPOSE: In the United States and other countries of the world , high prevalence of pre-pregnancy depressive symptoms and depression during pregnancy is an important public health concern, as they are associated with low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) outcomes in adulthood. However, the relationships among pre-pregnancy depressive symptoms, low birth weight, preterm birth outcomes and household characteristics have not been well established. METHODS: The study used data from 7120 adolescent female participants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data from Waves I (1994-1995 in-school interview), II (1996 as in-home), III (2001-2002 as in-home interview), IV (2008 as in-home interview) and Wave V is currently underway. The main outcomes were LBW and PTB. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) using a cut-off point of 24 to indicate higher depressive symptoms . Odds ratios were used as an estimate of the relative risk using generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS: In Wave I, prevalence of depressive symptoms among age groups 11-15 (54.1%) was higher than older adolescents (45.9%) were. With the exception of depressive symptoms reported in Wave II, respondents reporting depressive symptoms in Waves I and III had similar unadjusted rates of LBW or PTB infants in adulthood. Mothers reporting higher depressive symptoms in older adolescence (15-19 years) had elevated odds of LBW infants (3.58 [95% CI=1.81, 7.09]) in Wave III compared with others reporting low depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Undeniably, childhood socioeconomic circumstances are important determinants of disease risks and improved health functioning and in particular birth outcomes in adulthood. Since poorer households have fewer resources to cope with stressful events that generate mood and other depressive symptoms over the life course, findings of research suggest treating depressive symptoms prior to pregnancy will yield significant dividends for mothers and society. Furthermore, without careful control of household contexts, the association between depressive symptoms and birth outcomes is likely to be confounded.",Midwifery,2018 Mar,Scotland,2018,10
24634793,Role of suppressor variables in primary prevention obesity research: examples from two predictive models.,"Pediatric obesity is a pertinent public health challenge. Child physical activity and screen time behaviors enacted within the context of the family and home environment are important determinants of pediatric obesity. The purpose of this study was to operationalize five, maternal-facilitated, social cognitive theory constructs for predicting physical activity and screen time behaviors in children. A secondary purpose was to elucidate the function of suppressor variables in the design and implementation of family- and home-based interventions seeking to prevent pediatric obesity. Instrumentation included face and content validity of the measurement tool by a panel of experts, test-retest reliability of the theoretical constructs, and predictive validity of the constructs through structural equation modeling. Physical activity and screen time were modeled separately according to the five selected social cognitive theory constructs. Data were collected from 224 mothers with children between four and six years of age. Specification indices indicated satisfactory fit for the final physical activity and screen time models. Through a series of four procedures, the structural models identified emotional coping and expectations as suppressor variables for self-efficacy. Suppressor variables can complement program design recommendations by providing a suggested ordering to construct integration within an intervention.",ISRN obesity,2014,United States,2014,10
23611721,Determinants affecting pregnant women's utilization of prenatal screening for Down syndrome: a review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVE: Uptake rates for Down syndrome screening (DSS) in the Netherlands are low compared with those in Northern European countries (27% versus 61% in the United Kingdom and 90% in Denmark). These differences are unexpected, especially since the countries have similar cultural and social values. METHOD: To analyse factors that underlie differences in uptake we reviewed current literature on individual characteristics and healthcare system factors, which determine potential influential factors on utilization of DSS. RESULTS: Arguments ""Against abortion"" and ""Down syndrome (DS) not severe enough condition to terminate pregnancy"" correlated with declining DSS, whereas ""Perceived guidance of healthcare professional,"" ""Perceived negative attitude of society towards DS"" and ""Preparation/Early termination"" correlated with accepting DSS. However, the majority of determinants were used both in favour of accepting or declining DSS. CONCLUSIONS: Decision making regarding DSS seems a process with influences on different levels and subtle interactions rather than a dichotomous process. Utilization may also be influenced by the implicit way it is being offered, as an extra option or as part of routine care and how this offer is perceived by the social environment. Finally, national healthcare system characteristics, although underrepresented in the examined studies, may also influence participation in DSS.","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2013 Nov,England,2013,10
24089658,"Beliefs Underlying the Decision to Eat Breakfast: The Role of Theory-based Behavioral Analysis in the Development of Policy, Communication and Educational Interventions for Healthy Eating.","Policy, communication, and education efforts to influence any social or health outcome are more effective if based on an understanding of the underlying behaviors and their determinants. This conceptual paper outlines how behavioral theory can help design interventions for one healthy eating behavior, eating breakfast. More specifically, the paper illustrates how a prominent health behavior theory, the Reasoned Action Approach, can be used to guide formative research to identify factors underlying people's decisions. Select findings are presented from three studies of beliefs underlying eating breakfast: online surveys with 1185 undergraduates from a large university in Indiana; in-depth interviews with 61 adults from four Indiana worksites; and 63 in-depth interviews with students from three middle schools in rural Indiana. Analyses of data from the undergraduates demonstrated the role of self-efficacy. Analyses of data from the working adults revealed the importance of normative beliefs about what employers believed. Analyses comparing consequences perceived by adults with those perceived by middle school students found that both groups believed that eating breakfast would provide energy but only middle school students believed that eating breakfast would improve alertness. For each finding, the theory is presented, the finding is described, implications for interventions are suggested, and the need for additional research is outlined. In sum, theory-based behavioral research can help develop interventions at intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental levels that are warranted to encourage healthy eating.",Food studies,2011,United States,2011,10
26035413,Bounded rationality alters the dynamics of paediatric immunization acceptance.,"Interactions between disease dynamics and vaccinating behavior have been explored in many coupled behavior-disease models. Cognitive effects such as risk perception, framing, and subjective probabilities of adverse events can be important determinants of the vaccinating behaviour, and represent departures from the pure ""rational"" decision model that are often described as ""bounded rationality"". However, the impact of such cognitive effects in the context of paediatric infectious disease vaccines has received relatively little attention. Here, we develop a disease-behavior model that accounts for bounded rationality through prospect theory. We analyze the model and compare its predictions to a reduced model that lacks bounded rationality. We find that, in general, introducing bounded rationality increases the dynamical richness of the model and makes it harder to eliminate a paediatric infectious disease. In contrast, in other cases, a low cost, highly efficacious vaccine can be refused, even when the rational decision model predicts acceptance. Injunctive social norms can prevent vaccine refusal, if vaccine acceptance is sufficiently high in the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Cognitive processes can have major impacts on the predictions of behaviour-disease models, and further study of such processes in the context of vaccination is thus warranted.",Scientific reports,2015 Jun 2,England,2015,10
30516357,Novel psychosocial factor involved in diabetes self-care in the Japanese cultural context.,"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence shows that cultural context can influence the management of diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between interdependence, which is valued in the Eastern cultural context, and diabetes self-care behavior in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional survey of 161 Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus using well-established questionnaires. The association of an interdependent tendency with diabetes self-care activities was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Diabetes self-care activities had a negative correlation with interdependent tendency (r = -0.16, P = 0.047), and they had positive correlations with age (r = 0.42, P < 0.001), emotional support (r = 0.25, P = 0.001) and diabetes self-care support (r = 0.36, P < 0.001). When patients were divided into two groups at the median age (68 years), multiple regressions showed that interdependent tendency (beta = -0.20, P = 0.048), male sex (beta = -0.24, P = 0.023), emotional support (beta = 0.22, P = 0.028) and diabetes self-care support (beta = 0.39, P < 0.001) were significant determinants of diabetes self-care activities only in the younger group. CONCLUSIONS: Interdependence might influence diabetes self-care behavior, and intervention focusing on support from close others might lead patients to more successful care among Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially those aged <68 years.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2019 Jul,Japan,2019,10
20926404,Determinants of self-rated health in Spain: differences by age groups for adults.,"BACKGROUND: Identifying factors associated with self-rated health (SRH) in two age groups (16-49 and >/= 50 years) in the context of action for health promotion in adults. METHODS: The data used came from the household and adults questionnaires of the National Health Survey of Spain for 2006. SRH was categorized as positive (very positive or positive) and negative (fair, poor or very poor). Odds ratios for positive SRH compared with negative SRH were calculated using logistic regression models for complex samples. The determinants of the positive SRH were obtained for the total population and for two age groups. RESULTS: Among the population aged >/= 16 years, 66.6% reports positive SRH, 78.6% in the 16- to 49-year-old group and 47.7% in the >/= 50-year-old group. SRH worsens with age until the age of 49, whereas 50 years onwards older report better health than the younger. The influence of lifestyle on the SRH varies by age group among adults as well: in the younger age groups, obesity, smoking and non-alcohol are associated with poor SRH; in contrast, physical exercise only in leisure time and enough sleeping hours are associated with positive SRH in the >/= 50-year-old population. CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with SRH differ across age groups, particularly for lifestyle. Understanding the differences between the factors associated with the positive SRH is highly relevant for the design of specific programmes aimed at improving public health.",European journal of public health,2012 Feb,England,2012,10
28217589,Relationship between attachment styles and happiness in medical students.,"BACKGROUND: Attachment theory is one of the most important achievements of contemporary psychology. Role of medical students in the community health is important, so we need to know about the situation of happiness and attachment style in these students. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to assess the relationship between medical students' attachment styles and demographic characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on randomly selected students of Medical Sciences in Kurdistan University, in 2012. To collect data, Hazan and Shaver's attachment style measure and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire were used. The results were analyzed using the SPSS software version 16 (IBM, Chicago IL, USA) and statistical analysis was performed via t-test, Chi-square test, and multiple regression tests. RESULTS: Secure attachment style was the most common attachment style and the least common was ambivalent attachment style. Avoidant attachment style was more common among single persons than married people (P = 0.03). No significant relationship was observed between attachment style and gender and grade point average of the studied people. The mean happiness score of students was 62.71. In multivariate analysis, the variables of secure attachment style (P = 0.001), male gender (P = 0.005), and scholar achievement (P = 0.047) were associated with higher happiness score. CONCLUSION: The most common attachment style was secure attachment style, which can be a positive prognostic factor in medical students, helping them to manage stress. Higher frequency of avoidant attachment style among single persons, compared with married people, is mainly due to their negative attitude toward others and failure to establish and maintain relationships with others.",Journal of family medicine and primary care,2016 Jul-Sep,India,2016,10
29421468,Differentiating the effect of social enterprise activities on health.,"An emerging stream of literature has focused on the ways in which social enterprises might act on the social determinants of health. However, this previous work has not taken a sufficiently broad account of the wide range of stakeholders involved in social enterprises and has also tended to reduce and simplify a complex and heterogeneous set of organisations to a relatively homogenous social enterprise concept. In an attempt to address these gaps, we conducted an empirical investigation between August 2014 and October 2015 consisting of qualitative case studies involving in-depth semi-structured interviews and a focus group with a wide variety of stakeholders from three social enterprises in different regions of Scotland. We found that different forms of social enterprise impact on different dimensions of health in different ways, including through: engendering a feeling of ownership and control; improving environmental conditions (both physical and social); and providing or facilitating meaningful employment. In conclusion, we highlight areas for future research.",Social science & medicine (1982),2018 Mar,England,2018,10
23611831,A Feasibility and Efficacy Randomized Controlled Trial of an Online Preventative Program for Childhood Obesity: Protocol for the EMPOWER Intervention.,"BACKGROUND: The home and family environment is a highly influential psychosocial antecedent of pediatric obesity. Implementation of conventional family- and home-based childhood obesity interventions is challenging for parents, often requiring them to attend multiple educational sessions. Attrition rates for traditional interventions are frequently high due to competing demands for parents' time. Under such constraints, an Internet-based intervention has the potential to modify determinants of childhood obesity while making judicious use of parents' time. Theory-based interventions offer many advantages over atheoretical interventions, including reduced intervention dosage, increased likelihood of behavioral change, and efficient resource allocation. Social cognitive theory (SCT) is a robust theoretical framework for addressing childhood obesity. SCT is a behavior change model rooted in reciprocal determinism, a causal paradigm that states that human functioning is the product of a dynamic interplay of behavioral, personal, and environmental factors. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of the Enabling Mothers to Prevent Childhood Obesity Through Web-Based Education and Reciprocal Determinism (EMPOWER) program, an Internet-based, theory-driven intervention for preventing childhood overweight and obesity. The project goal is supported by two specific aims: (1) modification of four obesogenic protective factors related to childhood obesity (minutes engaged in physical activity, servings of fruits and vegetables consumed, servings of sugar-sweetened and sugar-free beverages consumed, and minutes engaged in screen time), and (2) reification of five maternal-mediated constructs of SCT (environment, expectations, emotional coping, self-control, and self-efficacy). METHODS: We will recruit mothers with children ages 4 to 6 years from childcare centers and randomly assign them to either the theory-based (experimental) or knowledge-based (control) arm of the trial. Data for the intervention will be collected at three intervals: baseline (week 0), posttest (week 4), and follow-up (8 weeks). At each phase of data collection, we will collect from both groups (1) measures of the four obesogenic protective factors, and (2) summated SCT construct scores. Constructs will be measured by a psychometrically valid and reliable SCT-based instrument. Behaviors will be evaluated by a behavior log. We will use a repeated-measures one-between-, one-within-participants design to evaluate intervention results. Constructs will be modified through Web-based learning modules, online interactive worksheets, and mother-child home-based activities. Process evaluation will assess program fidelity.",JMIR research protocols,2012 Jun 21,Canada,2012,10
29212553,Household knowledge and practices concerning malaria and indoor residual spraying in an endemic area earmarked for malaria elimination in Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) is a key intervention for reducing the burden of malaria infection. Effectiveness and success of this strategy are to a considerable extent dependent on knowledge and practice of the target community regarding the IRS. Iran has entered the malaria elimination phase, and IRS has been considered as the main strategy for malaria vector control. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the household knowledge and practices about malaria and IRS in Bashagard County, one of the malaria-endemic areas in the southeast of Iran. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 420 households in Bashagard County. The participants who were selected using a two-stage randomized cluster sampling procedure were subjected to a tested structured questionnaire. During the survey, direct observations were made concerning the use of IRS as well as housing conditions. The data were coded and analysed using SPSS version 19. RESULTS: Knowledge levels about malaria as a disease and the mosquito as its vector were high and of equal magnitude (85.5% and 85.4%, respectively), while knowledge levels of IRS were even higher (91.6%). The main source of households' information about malaria and IRS was primarily community health workers (73.3%). Despite positive perceptions towards IRS only 26.7% of respondents had sprayed their houses which is lower than the WHO targeted coverage of 80%. Respiratory disorders and headache (33.3%), food contamination (24.9%), discolouring of inner house walls (17.7%), difficulty in furniture's movement (13.8%), and unpleasant odour (10.4%) were the main reasons for IRS refusal. CONCLUSION: There is a discrepancy between knowledge about symptoms and the transmission route of malaria and control practices related to IRS use. Therefore, IRS campaigns accompanied with education for behaviour change should be considered to ensure householders' participation and cooperation in the IRS programme. Moreover, continuous evaluation and monitoring of IRS as well as conducting more surveys on knowledge, attitude, and practices are recommended to improve malaria control measures and to identify indicators for effective, successful, and sustainable malaria elimination programme.",Parasites & vectors,2017 Dec 6,England,2017,10
21143948,"Characteristics of a population of commuter cyclists in the Netherlands: perceived barriers and facilitators in the personal, social and physical environment.","BACKGROUND: Daily cycling to work has been shown to improve physical performance and health in men and women. It is very common in the Netherlands: the most recent data show that one quarter of commuting journeys are by bicycle. However, despite the effort going into campaigns to promote commuter cycling, about 30% of commuter journeys up to 5 kilometers are still by car. The question is how to stimulate commuter cycling more effectively. This article aims to contribute to a better understanding of the perceived barriers and facilitators of cyclists/non-cyclists and personal factors associated with commuter cycling. METHODS: A random sample of 799 Dutch employees (response rate 39.6%) completed an internet survey, which comprised two parts. One part of the questionnaire focused on the determinants of cycling behavior including equal numbers of personal, social factors and environmental factors. The other component focused on assessing data on physical activity (PA) behavior. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to analyze factors associated with commuter cycling. RESULTS: Meeting the physical activity guideline was positively associated with commuter cycling. Television viewing and working full-time were negatively associated. Twenty-six percent of the participants met the PA guideline simply by cycling to work, with health as the main reason. The main barriers for non-cyclists (60%) were perspiration when arriving at work, weather and travelling time. Shorter travelling times compared with other transportation modes were an important facilitator. Environmental factors were positively related to more frequent and more convenient commuter cycling, but they were hardly mentioned by non-cyclists. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a relatively large group fulfils the PA recommendations merely by cycling to work. Personal factors (i.e., perceived time and distance) are major barriers to commuter cycling and should be targeted in cycling campaigns, especially in subgroups living within cycling distance to work. Targeting environmental determinants in such campaigns seems to be less important in the Netherlands.",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2010 Dec 10,England,2010,10
26607868,"The associations between US state and local social spending, income inequality, and individual all-cause and cause-specific mortality: The National Longitudinal Mortality Study.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate government state and local spending on public goods and income inequality as predictors of the risks of dying. METHODS: Data on 431,637 adults aged 30-74 and 375,354 adults aged 20-44 in the 48 contiguous US states were used from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study to estimate the impacts of state and local spending and income inequality on individual risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for leading causes of death in younger and middle-aged adults and older adults. To reduce bias, models incorporated state fixed effects and instrumental variables. RESULTS: Each additional $250 per capita per year spent on welfare predicted a 3-percentage point (-0.031, 95% CI: -0.059, -0.0027) lower probability of dying from any cause. Each additional $250 per capita spent on welfare and education predicted 1.6-percentage point (-0.016, 95% CI: -0.031, -0.0011) and 0.8-percentage point (-0.008, 95% CI: -0.0156, -0.00024) lower probabilities of dying from coronary heart disease (CHD), respectively. No associations were found for colon cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; for diabetes, external injury, and suicide, estimates were inverse but modest in magnitude. A 0.1 higher Gini coefficient (higher income inequality) predicted 1-percentage point (0.010, 95% CI: 0.0026, 0.0180) and 0.2-percentage point (0.002, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.002) higher probabilities of dying from CHD and suicide, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical linkages were identified between state-level spending on welfare and education and lower individual risks of dying, particularly from CHD and all causes combined. State-level income inequality predicted higher risks of dying from CHD and suicide.",Preventive medicine,2016 Mar,United States,2016,10
28129546,"Hour-glass ceilings: Work-hour thresholds, gendered health inequities.","Long workhours erode health, which the setting of maximum weekly hours aims to avert. This 48-h limit, and the evidence base to support it, has evolved from a workforce that was largely male, whose time in the labour force was enabled by women's domestic work and care giving. The gender composition of the workforce has now changed, and many women (as well as some men) combine care-giving with paid work, a change viewed as fundamental for gender equality. However, it raises questions on the suitability of the work time limit and the extent it is protective of health. We estimate workhour-mental health thresholds, testing if they vary for men and women due to gendered workloads and constraints on and off the job. Using six waves of data from a nationally representative sample of Australian adults (24-65 years), surveyed in the Household Income Labour Dynamics of Australia Survey (N = 3828 men; 4062 women), our study uses a longitudinal, simultaneous equation approach to address endogeneity. Averaging over the sample, we find an overall threshold of 39 h per week beyond which mental health declines. Separate curves then estimate thresholds for men and women, by high or low care and domestic time constraints, using stratified and pooled samples. We find gendered workhour-health limits (43.5 for men, 38 for women) which widen further once differences in resources on and off the job are considered. Only when time is 'unencumbered' and similar time constraints and contexts are assumed, do gender gaps narrow and thresholds approximate the 48-h limit. Our study reveals limits to contemporary workhour regulation which may be systematically disadvantaging women's health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2017 Mar,England,2017,10
27041120,Health Implications of an Immigration Raid: Findings from a Latino Community in the Midwestern United States.,"Immigration raids exemplify the reach of immigration law enforcement into the lives of Latino community members, yet little research characterizes the health effects of these raids. We examined the health implications of an immigration raid that resulted in multiple arrests and deportations and occurred midway through a community survey of a Latino population. We used linear regression following principal axis factoring to examine the influence of raid timing on immigration enforcement stress and self-rated health. We controlled for age, sex, relationship status, years in the county in which the raid occurred, children in the home, and nativity. 325 participants completed the survey before the raid and 151 after. Completing the survey after the raid was associated with higher levels of immigration enforcement stress and lower self-rated health scores. Findings indicate the negative impact of immigration raids on Latino communities. Immigration discussions should include holistic assessments of health.",Journal of immigrant and minority health,2017 Jun,United States,2017,10
30229079,Efficiency of sequencing batch reactor for removal of organic matter in the effluent of petroleum wastewater.,"The main aim of this research was to study the biodegradation of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) using aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) at a pilot-Scale. The reactor was made of a 3mm-thick glass cylinder with an internal diameter of 12cm and height of 60cm. SBR operated in five phases. The first phase was filling the reactor for about 10min. the second phase was the main reactor for biological treatment of petroleum wastewater about 21.55h. The third phase was the sedimentation (1h). The fourth phase was decanting from the reactor for about 10min. The last phase consisted of idle for about 45min. The experiments showed that the mixed microbial mass is able to degrade high concentration of methanol up to 250mg/l, and concentration of MTBE up to 70mg/l for a 24h cycle. However, the mixed microbial mass is not able to degrade MTBE with concentration more than 70mg/l. Microorganisms were generally isolated from Fajr petrochemical wastewater treatment plant. Analysis showed that the mixed microbial mass able to biodegradation of COD up to 1350mg/l in effluent.

26163878,A longitudinal study on determinants of the intention to start smoking among Non-smoking boys and girls of high and low socioeconomic status.,"BACKGROUND: This study identifies differences in socio-cognitive factors as they relate to the intention to smoke among boys and girls living in high socioeconomic status (HSES) and low socioeconomic status (LSES) neighborhoods. METHODS: A total of 1,643 children (aged 10-12 years) completed a web-based questionnaire assessing their intention, attitude, social influences, and self-efficacy toward smoking at baseline and at one year follow-up. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relations between intention and predictor variables (i.e. attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy). Three-way interaction terms were added to the first analysis to examine potential interactions of gender, socioeconomic status and predictor variables. A 3-way interaction effect was present, and therefore subgroup analyses for HSES and LSES boys and girls were warranted. RESULTS: The results indicated that positive attitudes toward smoking were related to the intention to smoke among HSES boys, whereas HSES girls had higher intentions to smoke if they perceived fewer disadvantages of smoking (OR: 0.42; 95 % CI: 0.22-0.82). The intention to smoke among LSES boys was predicted by perceived social norms (OR: 0.49; 95 % CI: 0.25-0.93); in LSES girls, the smoking behavior of people in their environment was most strongly related to their smoking intention (OR: 5.55; 95 % CI: 2.81-10.93). CONCLUSIONS: To prevent youth smoking, HSES boys and girls may benefit from interventions that address attitudes. Boys from an LSES neighborhood may profit from smoking prevention interventions that target social norms, while LSES girls may benefit from strategies aimed at resisting the influence of smokers in their environment.

29025259,Using the capture-recapture method to estimate the human immunodeficiency virus-positive population.,"OBJECTIVES: The capture-recapture method was applied to estimate the number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals not registered with any data sources. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Lorestan Province, in the west of Iran, in 2016. Three incomplete sources of HIV-positive individuals, with partially overlapping data, were used, including: (a) transfusion center, (b) volunteer counseling and testing centers (VCTCs), and (c) prison. The 3-source capture-recapture method, using a log-linear model, was applied for data analysis. The Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion were used for model selection. RESULTS: Of the 2,456 HIV-positive patients registered in these 3 data sources, 1,175 (47.8%) were identified in transfusion center, 867 (35.3%) in VCTCs, and 414 (16.8%) in prison. After the exclusion of duplicate entries, 2,281 HIV-positive patients remained. Based on the capture-recapture method, 14,868 (95% confidence interval, 9,923 to 23,427) HIV-positive individuals were not identified in any of the registries. Therefore, the real number of HIV-positive individuals was estimated to be 17,149, and the overall completeness of the 3 registries was estimated to be around 13.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on capture-recapture estimates, a huge number of HIV-positive individuals are not registered with any of the provincial data sources. This is an urgent message for policymakers who plan and provide health care services for HIV-positive patients. Although the capture-recapture method is a useful statistical approach for estimating unknown populations, due to the assumptions and limitations of the method, the population size may be overestimated as it seems possible in our results.",Epidemiology and health,2017,Korea (South),2017,10
20491416,An international perspective on youth gambling prevalence studies.,"In the wake of rapid expansion of legal gambling internationally, studies of adolescent gambling involvement and problem gambling prevalence have been carried out in numerous jurisdictions. This paper reviews adolescent gambling prevalence studies that have been carried out in North America, Europe, and Oceania. Based on this review, work is clearly needed to assess the impact of survey methods on identified prevalence rates and to improve the measurement of problem gambling among adolescents. From a substantive perspective, several clear demographic and behavioral characteristics are associated with gambling involvement and problem gambling among youth. However, early assumptions about youth gambling and problem gambling must give way to more nuanced understandings of how these phenomena change in response to changes in the social and cultural environment. We may have traveled some distance down the road toward understanding the determinants as well as the distribution of youth gambling and problem gambling, but we still have a long way to go.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2010 Jan-Mar,Germany,2010,10

METHODS: In Step 1 of the IM protocol, a needs assessment was performed consisting of a review of the Dutch multidisciplinary guidelines on CANS, and of focus group sessions with employees with CANS (n=15) and with relevant experts (n=17). After the needs assessment, the objectives of the intervention and the determinants of self-management at work were formulated (Step 2). Furthermore, theory-based intervention methods and practical strategies were selected (Step 3), and an intervention program (including the eHealth module) was developed (Step 4). Finally, plans for implementation and evaluation of the program were developed (Steps 5 and 6). RESULTS: Step 1 of the IM protocol revealed that employees with CANS should be stimulated to search for information about the cause of their complaints, about how to deal with their complaints, and in which manner they can influence their complaints themselves. In Step 2, the overall goal of the intervention was defined as ""self-management behavior at work"" with the aim to alleviate the perceived disability of the participants. Step 3 described how the intervention methods were translated into practical strategies, and goal setting was introduced as an important method for increasing self-efficacy. The product of Step 4 was the final program plan, consisting of 6-weekly group sessions of 2.5 hours each and an eHealth module. In Step 5, a recruitment plan and course materials were developed, a steering committee was set up, trainers were recruited, and the final program was tested. In Step 6, an evaluation plan was developed, which consists of a randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up period and a qualitative evaluation (interviews) with some of the participants. CONCLUSION: This study resulted in a theory- and practice-based self-management program, based on behavioral change theories, guideline-related evidence, and practice-based knowledge that fits the needs of employees with CANS.",Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,2015,New Zealand,2015,10
31561920,"Black-White Disparities in Preterm Birth: Geographic, Social, and Health Determinants.","INTRODUCTION: Reducing racial/ethnic disparities in preterm birth is a priority for U.S. public health programs. The study objective was to quantify the relative contribution of geographic, sociodemographic, and health determinants to the black, non-Hispanic and white, non-Hispanic preterm birth disparity. METHODS: Cross-sectional 2016 U.S. birth certificate data (analyzed in 2018-2019) were used. Black-white differences in covariate distributions and preterm birth and very preterm birth rates were examined. Decomposition methods for nonlinear outcomes based on logistic regression were used to quantify the extent to which black-white differences in covariates contributed to preterm birth and very preterm birth disparities. RESULTS: Covariate differences between black and white women were found within each category of geographic, sociodemographic, and health characteristics. However, not all covariates contributed substantially to the disparity. Close to 38% of the preterm birth and 31% of the very preterm birth disparity could be explained by black-white covariate differences. The largest contributors to the disparity included maternal education (preterm birth, 11.3%; very preterm birth, 9.0%), marital status/paternity acknowledgment (preterm birth, 13.8%; very preterm birth, 14.7%), source of payment for delivery (preterm birth, 6.2%; very preterm birth, 3.2%), and hypertension in pregnancy (preterm birth, 9.9%; very preterm birth, 8.3%). Interpregnancy interval contributed a more sizable contribution to the disparity (preterm birth, 6.2%, very preterm birth, 6.0%) in sensitivity analyses restricted to all nonfirstborn births. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the known portion of the disparity in preterm birth is driven by sociodemographic and preconception/prenatal health factors. Public health programs to enhance social support and preconception care, specifically focused on hypertension, may provide an efficient approach for reducing the racial gap in preterm birth.",American journal of preventive medicine,2019 Nov,Netherlands,2019,10
23241967,"Informal confidential voting interviewing in a sexual risk assessment of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgenders (hijra) in Bangalore, India.","OBJECTIVE: The accuracy of self-reporting sensitive sexual risk behaviours is highly susceptible to misreporting. Informal confidential voting interviews (ICVIs) may minimise social desirability bias by increasing the privacy of the interview setting. The objective was to investigate determinants of risky behaviour among men who have sex with men (MSM) and 'hijra' (transgenders) reported through two interviewing tools: ICVIs and face-to-face interviews (FTFIs). METHODS: Cluster random sampling was used to recruit MSM in 85 cruising sites in Bangalore, including eight hammams (bath houses) and 77 public locations where MSM and hijra cruise for sex. Individuals were randomly allocated to one of the data collection methods(5:2 FTFI : ICVI). Data were analysed using standard regression and a profile regression approach that associates clusters of behaviours with our outcome (FTFI vs ICVI). RESULTS: A total of 372 MSM and hijra were interviewed for the FTFIs and 153 respondents completed ICVIs. Participants were more likely to report injecting drug use (4% vs 1%; p=0.008) and paying to have sex with a female sex worker (FSW) in the last year (28% vs 8%; p=0.001) in the ICVIs. There were no differences to questions on sociodemographics, sexual debut with another male, non-condom use (12% vs 14%), ever selling sex to men (58% vs 56%), current female partner (26% vs 20%) and non-condom use with a main female partner (17% vs 19%). CONCLUSIONS: The significant differences between interview modes for certain outcomes, such as intravenous drug use and sex with a FSW, demonstrate how certain behaviour is stigmatised among the MSM community. Nevertheless, the lack of effect of the interviewing tool in other outcomes may indicate either less reporting bias in reporting this behaviour or environmental factors such as the interviewers not adequately screening themselves from the respondent or a potential disadvantage of using other MSM as interviewers.",Sexually transmitted infections,2013 May,England,2013,10
27523784,Exploring spatial trends in Canadian incidence of hospitalization due to myocardial infarction with additional determinants of health.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the presence of spatial trends among rates of hospitalization due to myocardial infarction across health regions of Canada and the associated role of additional health determinants. STUDY DESIGN: An ecological study was conducted using aggregate data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information for age-standardized rates of myocardial infarction hospitalizations by health region in 2013. METHODS: Exploratory spatial data analyses were applied to myocardial infarction hospitalization rates including Moran's I for detecting global spatial autocorrelation. Local spatial dependence was examined using local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) to better identify the location of potential regional clusters. Linear and spatial regressions were applied to examine the role of additional health determinants. RESULTS: Significant spatial autocorrelation was observed for hospitalizations due to myocardial infarction for both sexes, independently and combined. This was largely present in the form of geographic disparities with cold spot clusters of low rates in the west, particularly British Columbia, and hot spot clusters of high rates moving east, especially in Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick. Additional disparities were observed with high rates clustered in Northern Ontario compared to clusters of low rates in Southern Ontario. Significant predictors included smoking, average income, education, and overweight or obesity and, after controlling for these, the central cold spot of low rates shifted east to Saskatchewan. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of spatial homogeneity suggests a necessity for better geographic-based preventive measures as determined by the varied needs of particular regions' communities. The demonstration that space matters in this context further indicates that spatial dependence should be included in additional investigations of myocardial infarction incidence and associated hospitalizations.",Public health,2016 Nov,Netherlands,2016,10
28673913,Relation between travel strategy and social organization of migrating birds with special consideration of formation flight in the northern bald ibis.,"A considerable proportion of the world's bird species undertake seasonal long-distance migrations. These journeys are energetically demanding. Two major behavioural means to reduce energy expenditure have been suggested: the use of thermal uplifts for a soaring-gliding migration style and travelling in echelon or V-shaped formation. Both strategies have immediate consequences for the social organization of the birds as they either cause large aggregations or require travelling in small and stable groups. Here, we first discuss those consequences, and second present an analysis of formation flight in a flock of northern bald ibis on their first southbound migration. We observe clear correlations between leading and trailing on the dyadic level but only a weak correlation on the individual level during independent flight and no convincing correlation during the human guided part of the migration. This pattern is suggestive of direct reciprocation as a means for establishing cooperation during formation flight. In general, we conclude that behavioural adaptations for dealing with physiological constraints on long-distance migrations either necessitate or ultimately foster formation of social groups with different characteristics. Patterns and social organization of birds travelling in groups have been elusive to study; however, new tracking technology-foremost lightweight GPS units-will provide more insights in the near future.This article is part of the themed issue 'Physiological determinants of social behaviour in animals'.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

25834791,"The economic burden of traumatic brain injury due to fatal traffic accidents in shahid rajaei trauma hospital, shiraz, iran.","BACKGROUND: Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) as a result of traffic accidents are one of the major causes of deaths, which lead to the loss of individuals' productive and working years of life. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to calculate the economic burden of traumatic brain injuries in fatal crashes at Shahid Rajaei Trauma Hospital, Shiraz, Iran for a period of five years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study the population included people who had died as a result of TBIs during 2009 to 2013 in Shiraz Shahid Rajaei Trauma Hospital. Cost and demographic data were obtained from the participants' medical records using data gathering forms, and some other information was also collected via telephone calls to the victims' families. Economic burden of TBIs due to traffic accidents, which led to death, was estimated using the human capital as direct costs of treatment, and the number of potential years of life lost and lost productivity as indirect costs. RESULTS: Deaths resulting from TBIs due to traffic accidents in Shiraz imposed 6.2 billion Rials (511000 USD) of hospital costs, 6390 potential years of life lost, and 506 billion Rials (20 million USD) of productivity lost. In the present study, the mean age of the individuals who died was 38.4 +/- 19.41 and the productivity lost per capita was 1.8 billion Rials (73000 USD). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicated that the economic burden of TBIs was high in fatal accidents in Fars Province so that it was equivalent to 0.00011% of Iran's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013. Therefore, more attention has to be paid to the rules to prevent the fatal accidents.",Archives of trauma research,2015 Mar,Netherlands,2015,10
29769063,Trends and factors associated with early initiation of breastfeeding in Namibia: analysis of the Demographic and Health Surveys 2000-2013.,"BACKGROUND: Early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) lowers the risk for all-cause mortality in babies, including those with low birth weight. However, rates of neonatal mortality and delayed initiation of breastfeeding remain high in most low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to assess the trends and factors associated with EIBF in Namibia from 2000 to 2013. METHODS: An analysis of EIBF trends was conducted using data from three Namibia Demographic Health Surveys. The present sample included singleton children younger than 2-years from 2000 (n = 1655), 2006-2007 (n = 2152) and 2013 (n = 2062) surveys. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse respondents' demographic, socioeconomic and obstetric characteristics. Factors associated with EIBF were assessed using univariate analysis and further evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: EIBF significantly decreased from 82.5% (confidence interval [CI]: 79.5-85.0) in 2000 to 74.9% (72.5-77.2) in 2013. Factors associated with EIBF in 2000 were urban residence (adjusted odds ratio 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36-0.93), poorer household wealth index (1.82, 1.05-3.17), lack of antenatal care (0.14, 0.03-0.81), small birth size (0.38, 0.24-0.63) and large birth size (0.51, 0.37-0.79). In 2013, factors associated with EIBF were maternal age of 15-19 years (2.28, 1.22-4.24), vaginal delivery (2.74, 1.90-3.93), married mothers (1.57, 1.16-2.14), delivery assistance from health professionals (3.67, 1.23-10.9) and birth order of fourth or above (1.52, 1.03-2.26). CONCLUSIONS: Namibia has experienced a declining trend in EIBF rates from 2000 to 2013. Factors associated with EIBF differed between 2000 and 2013. The present findings highlight the importance of continued commitment to addressing neonatal health challenges and strengthening implementation of interventions to increase EIBF in Namibia.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2018 May 16,England,2018,10
20656515,Life satisfaction and return to work after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"This study was conducted to investigate life satisfaction and employment status after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and to explain the associations between life satisfaction and demographic, disease-related, psychological, and personality characteristics. Subjects with SAH (n = 141) living at home 2-4 years after the SAH responded to a mailed questionnaire. Outcomes were life satisfaction, as measured with the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire 9 (LiSat-9), and employment status. Determinants in multiple regression analysis were demographic and SAH characteristics, subjective complaints (eg, mood disorder, fatigue, cognitive complaints), and personality characteristics (eg, neuroticism, passive coping style). Of the 141 subjects, 64 (46.7%) had a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of V (good outcome) at discharge. Mean subject age was 51.4 +/- 12.3 years, and mean time after SAH was 36.1 +/- 7.9 months. Of the 88 subjects who were working at the time of the SAH, 54 (61.4%) returned to work, but only 31 (35.2%) resumed their work completely. The subjects were least satisfied with their vocational situation (51.9% satisfied) and sexual life (51.7%) and were most satisfied with their relationships (75.2%-88.7%) and self-care ability (88.6%). Age (beta value = 0.17), return to work after SAH (0.19), disability at hospital discharge (0.25), worsened mood (-0.37), and passive coping (-0.25) together accounted for 47.2% of the life satisfaction scores. Our data indicate that return to work is a major issue for individuals who survive an SAH. Not returning to work, disability, depression, and passive coping are associated with reduced life satisfaction. Thus, vocational reintegration after SAH merits more attention during rehabilitation.",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,2011 Jul-Aug,United States,2011,10
24042004,Sensorimotor and psychosocial determinants of 3-year incident mobility disability in middle-aged and older adults.,"OBJECTIVE: to identify sensorimotor and psychosocial determinants of 3-year incident mobility disability. DESIGN: prospective. SETTING: population-based sample of community-dwelling older persons. PARTICIPANTS: community-living middle-aged and older persons (age: 50-85 years) without baseline mobility disability (n = 622). MEASUREMENTS: mobility disability, defined as self-reported inability to walk a quarter mile without resting or inability to walk up a flight of stairs unsupported, was ascertained at baseline and 3-year follow-up. Potential baseline determinant characteristics included demographics, education, social support, financial condition, knee extensor strength, visual contrast sensitivity, cognition, depression, presence of chronic conditions and history of falls. RESULTS: a total of 13.5% participant reported 3-year incident mobility disability. Age >/=75 years, female sex, knee extensor strength in the lowest quartile, visual contrast sensitivity <1.7 on the Pelli-Robson chart or significant depressive symptoms (CESD score >16) were independent determinants of 3-year incident mobility disability (ORs 1.84-16.51). CONCLUSIONS: low visual contrast sensitivity, poor knee extensor strength and significant depressive symptoms are independent determinants of future onset of mobility disability.",Age and ageing,2014 Jan,England,2014,10
30685297,Potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition in older adults results in significant personal, social, and economic burden. To combat this complex, multifactorial issue, evidence-based knowledge is needed on the modifiable determinants of malnutrition. Systematic reviews of prospective studies are lacking in this area; therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the modifiable determinants of malnutrition in older adults. METHODS: A systematic approach was taken to conduct this review. Eight databases were searched. Prospective cohort studies with participants of a mean age of 65 years or over were included. Studies were required to measure at least one determinant at baseline and malnutrition as outcome at follow-up. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible therefore the findings of each study were synthesized narratively. A descriptive synthesis of studies was used to present results due the heterogeneity of population source and setting, definitions of determinants and outcomes. Consistency of findings was assessed using the schema: strong evidence, moderate evidence, low evidence, and conflicting evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included in the final review. Thirty potentially modifiable determinants across seven domains (oral, psychosocial, medication and care, health, physical function, lifestyle, eating) were included. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and were of a low quality. There is moderate evidence that hospitalisation, eating dependency, poor self-perceived health, poor physical function and poor appetite are determinants of malnutrition. Moderate evidence suggests that chewing difficulties, mouth pain, gum issues co-morbidity, visual and hearing impairments, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity levels, complaints about taste of food and specific nutrient intake are not determinants of malnutrition. There is low evidence that loss of interest in life, access to meals and wheels, and modified texture diets are determinants of malnutrition. Furthermore, there is low evidence that psychological distress, anxiety, loneliness, access to transport and wellbeing, hunger and thirst are not determinants of malnutrition. There appears to be conflicting evidence that dental status, swallowing, cognitive function, depression, residential status, medication intake and/or polypharmacy, constipation, periodontal disease are determinants of malnutrition. CONCLUSION: There are multiple potentially modifiable determinants of malnutrition however strong robust evidence is lacking for the majority of determinants. Better prospective cohort studies are required. With an increasingly ageing population, targeting modifiable factors will be crucial to the effective treatment and prevention of malnutrition.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019 Dec,England,2019,10
28937075,"A comparison of socioeconomic level among hemodialysis patients and normal controls in the fars province, Iran.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem and it is suggested that low socioeconomic status (SES) may increase the risk of renal failure. The aim of this study was to report and compare the SES of hemodialysis patients (HD) and normal population in Shiraz, Iran. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated 519 HD patients and 900 normal controls. We asked about SES using a questionnaire. The participants were categorized into three groups according to their SES as low, medium, and high SES. Of the 1419 participants, 454 (31.7%), 581 (40.6%), and 395 (27.6%) were grouped in low, medium, and high SES, respectively. Most of our normal controls (43.5%) were in the medium SES group and most of the HD patients (61.3%) were in the low SES group. HD patients had a significantly lower SES score than the normal population (P <0.001). A pattern of decrease in the child number and increase in the marital age was seen associated with a rise in SES status among the two groups. In contrast with the control population, a pattern of increasing age was seen in the HD patients with a higher SES status (P = 0.038). In conclusion, SES was significantly lower in HD patients than the normal population. People with CKD and limited education or lower income should be targeted for early intervention.","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2017 Sep-Oct,Saudi Arabia,2017,10
29671791,The Antecedents and Consequences of Health Literacy in an Ecological Perspective: Results from an Experimental Analysis.,"This study analyses the relationship between the antecedents and consequences of health literacy (HL) at the ecological level among the nations involved in the European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU). The antecedents and consequences were investigated by means of proxy indicators. The HL was measured using the 47-item HLS-EU questionnaire (HLS-EUQ47) and the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). The two measures stood in significant correlation to the outcomes of the sub-discipline of the Euro Health Consumer Index (r = 0.790 for HLS-EUQ47; r = 0.789 for NVS). The HLS-EUQ47 also stood in correlation to the percentage of population with post-secondary education (r = 0.810), the reading performance for 15-year-old students (r = 0.905), the presence of a national screening program for breast (r = 0.732) or cervical cancer (r = 0.873). The NVS stood in correlation with the unemployment rate (r = &minus;0.778), the Gross Domestic Product (r = 0.719), the Gini coefficient (r = &minus;0.743), the rank of the Euro Patient Empowerment Index (r = &minus;0.826), the expenditure on social protection (r = 0.814), the Consumer Empowerment Index (r = 0.898), the percentage of adults using the internet for seeking health information (r = 0.759), the prevalence of overweight individuals (r = &minus;0.843), the health expenditure (r = 0.766), as well as the percentage of individuals using the internet for interacting with public authorities (r = 0.755). This study provides some preliminary considerations regarding alternative means by which to study HL and proposes new methods for experimentation.

Yet, literature suggests challenges in completing a timely LAM transition. To guide program implementation in Bangladesh, this study identified factors influencing women's transition decisions. Eighty postpartum women, comprising 40 who transitioned from LAM(3) and 40 who did not,(4) participated. Half of each group participated in in-depth interviews to explore the decision-making process. All participants responded to a ""Barrier Analysis"" questionnaire to identify differences in eight behavioral determinants. More than half of transitioners switched to another modern method before or within the same month that LAM ended. Of the 18 transitioners who delayed,(5) 15 waited for menses to return. For non-transitioners, key barriers included waiting for menses to return, misconceptions on return to fertility, and perceived lack of familial support. The LAM transition can help women prevent unintended pregnancy during the first year postpartum. Increased emphasis on counseling women about the risk of pregnancy, and misconceptions about personal fertility patterns are critical for facilitating the transition. Strategies should also include interventions that train health workers and improve social support.",Evaluation and program planning,2015 Jun,England,2015,10
30155586,Patterns and Predictors of HIV-Status Disclosure Among Pregnant Women in South Africa: Dimensions of Disclosure and Influence of Social and Economic Circumstances.,"HIV-status disclosure may improve psychosocial health and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), but existing insights suffer from methodological limitations. We explored disclosure over time during pregnancy and postpartum among 1347 HIV-positive women in Cape Town. Among 995 women diagnosed HIV-positive before the pregnancy and entering antenatal care (median age 30 years), 95% had disclosed to >/= 1 individual. In Mokken scale analysis, we observed two separate dimensions of disclosure: disclosure to a male partner, and disclosure to family/community members. Among 352 women diagnosed during the pregnancy and initiating ART (median age 27 years), 61% disclosed to a male partner and 71% to a family/community member by 12 months after diagnosis. Relationship status modified the impact of pregnancy intentions and poverty on disclosure to a male partner. These unique data provide important insights into dimensions of disclosure during pregnancy and postpartum, and suggest that women's social and economic circumstances are central determinants of disclosure.",AIDS and behavior,2018 Dec,United States,2018,10
26996457,Absence of hepatitis delta infection in a large rural HIV cohort in Tanzania.,"OBJECTIVES: The epidemiological and clinical determinants of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in Sub-Saharan Africa are ill-defined. The prevalence of HDV infection was determined in HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected individuals in rural Tanzania. METHODS: All HBV-infected adults under active follow-up in the Kilombero and Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) were screened for anti-HDV antibodies. For positive samples, a second serological test and nucleic acid amplification were performed. Demographic and clinical characteristics at initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) were compared between anti-HDV-negative and -positive patients. RESULTS: Among 222 HIV/HBV co-infected patients on ART, 219 (98.6%) had a stored serum sample available and were included in the study. Median age was 37 years, 55% were female, 46% had World Health Organization stage III/IV HIV disease, and the median CD4 count was 179 cells/mul. The prevalence of anti-HDV positivity was 5.0% (95% confidence interval 2.8-8.9%). There was no significant predictor of anti-HDV positivity. HDV could not be amplified in any of the anti-HDV-positive patients and the second serological test was negative in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: No confirmed case of HDV infection was found among over 200 HIV/HBV co-infected patients in Tanzania. As false-positive serology results are common, screening results should be confirmed with a second test.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2016 May,Canada,2016,10
27834253,"Housing, Transportation, And Food: How ACOs Seek To Improve Population Health By Addressing Nonmedical Needs Of Patients.","Addressing nonmedical needs-such as the need for housing-is critical to advancing population health, improving the quality of care, and lowering the costs of care. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are well positioned to address these needs. We used qualitative interviews with ACO leaders and site visits to examine how these organizations addressed the nonmedical needs of their patients, and the extent to which they did so. We developed a typology of medical and social services integration among ACOs that disentangles service and organizational integration. We found that the nonmedical needs most commonly addressed by ACOs were the need for transportation and housing and food insecurity. ACOs identified nonmedical needs through processes that were part of the primary care visit or care transformation programs. Approaches to meeting patients' nonmedical needs were either individualized solutions (developed patient by patient) or targeted approaches (programs developed to address specific needs). As policy makers continue to provide incentives for health care organizations to meet a broader spectrum of patients' needs, these findings offer insights into how health care organizations such as ACOs integrate themselves with nonmedical organizations.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2016 Nov 1,United States,2016,10
21178017,"Race, sex, and age differences in heart failure-related hospitalizations in a southern state: implications for prevention.","BACKGROUND: Because heart failure (HF) is the final common pathway for most heart diseases, we examined its 10-year prevalence trend by race, sex, and age in Tennessee. METHODS AND RESULTS: HF hospitalization data from the Tennessee Hospital Discharge Data System were analyzed by race, sex, and age. Rates were directly age-adjusted using the Year 2000 standard population. Adult (age 20+ years) inpatient hospitalization for primary diagnosis of HF (HFPD) increased from 4.2% in 1997 to 4.5% in 2006. Age-adjusted hospitalization for HF (per 10 000 population) rose by 11.3% (from 29.3 in 1997 to 32.6 in 2006). Parallel changes in secondary HF admissions were also noted. Age-adjusted rates were higher among blacks than whites and higher among men than women. The ratios of black to white by sex admitted with HFPD in 2006 were highest (9:1) among the youngest age categories (20 to 34 and 35 to 44 years). Furthermore, for each age category of black men below 65 years, there were higher HF admission rates than for white men in the immediate older age category. In 2006, the adjusted rate ratios for HFPD in black to white men ages 20 to 34 and 35 to 44 years were odds ratio, 4.75; 95% confidence interval, 3.29 to 6.86 and odds ratio, 5.10; 95% confidence interval, 4.15 to 6.25, respectively. Hypertension was the independent predictor of HF admissions in black men ages 20 to 34 years. CONCLUSIONS: The higher occurrence of HF among young adults in general, particularly among young black men, highlights the need for prevention by identifying modifiable biological and social determinants to reduce cardiovascular health disparities in this vulnerable group.",Circulation.

26960962,"Determinants of intimate partner violence during pregnancy among married women in Abay Chomen district, Western Ethiopia: a community based cross sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence during pregnancy is the most common form of violence that harms the health of women and the fetus but practiced commonly in developing countries. There is scarcity of information regarding intimate partner violence during pregnancy in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of intimate partner violence during recent pregnancy in Abay Chomen district, Western Ethiopia. METHODS: Community based cross sectional study was conducted among married pregnant women in Abay Chomen district in April, 2014 using a standard WHO multi-country study questionnaire. Two hundred eighty two randomly selected pregnant women aged 15-49 years participated in the study. Logistic regression and multivariate analysis were employed. RESULTS: The prevalence of intimate partner violence during recent pregnancy was 44.5% (95% CI, 32.6, 56.4). More than half 157 (55.5%) experienced all three forms of intimate partner violence during recent pregnancy. The joint occurrence of intimate partner physical and psychological violence during recent pregnancy as well as joint occurrence of intimate partner physical and sexual violence was 160 (56.5%). Pregnant women who were ever lived with their partner's family were 46% less likely to experience recent intimate partner violence. Dowry payment decreases intimate partner violence during recent pregnancy (AOR 0.09, 95% CI 0.04, 0.2) and pregnant women who didn't undergo marriage ceremony during their marriage were 79% are less likely to experience violence (AOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.1, 0.44). CONCLUSION: Nearly half of interviewed pregnant women experienced intimate partner violence during pregnancy implying the prevalence of such practice in the study site. To that end, increasing community awareness about the consequences of the practice could be important. Moreover, as health extension workers works closely with households, they could be crucial players to increase community awareness about intimate partner violence on pregnant mothers and halt it or its risk factors.",BMC women's health,2016 Mar 10,England,2016,10
30970224,Epigenetic-genetic chromatin footprinting identifies novel and subject-specific genes active in prefrontal cortex neurons.,"Human prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with broad individual variabilities in functions linked to personality, social behaviors, and cognitive functions. The phenotype variabilities associated with brain functions can be caused by genetic or epigenetic factors. The interactions between these factors in human subjects is, as of yet, poorly understood. The heterogeneity of cerebral tissue, consisting of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, complicates the comparative analysis of gene activities in brain specimens. To approach the underlying neurogenomic determinants, we performed a deep analysis of open chromatin-associated histone methylation in PFC neurons sorted from multiple human individuals in conjunction with whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. Integrative analyses produced novel unannotated neuronal genes and revealed individual-specific chromatin ""blueprints"" of neurons that, in part, relate to genetic background. Surprisingly, we observed gender-dependent epigenetic signals, implying that gender may contribute to the chromatin variabilities in neurons. Finally, we found epigenetic, allele-specific activation of the testis-specific gene nucleoporin 210 like (NUP210L) in brain in some individuals, which we link to a genetic variant occurring in <3% of the human population. Recently, the NUP210L locus has been associated with intelligence and mathematics ability. Our findings highlight the significance of epigenetic-genetic footprinting for exploring neurologic function in a subject-specific manner.-Gusev, F. E., Reshetov, D. A., Mitchell, A. C., Andreeva, T.

Meanwhile news surrounding the on-going Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa are frightening. This study assessed the relevance of the social networking media in spreading awareness about EVD prevention and control in Southwestern Nigeria. METHODS: Descriptive cross sectional study among 400 youths selected using multistage sampling method. Research instruments used were semi structured self administered questionnaires that were analyzed using the SPSS software version 17.0. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty (95.0%) of respondents were members of a social network. Several misconceptions trailed the spread of information about EVD. Though only 21(7.3%) bothered to ascertain the reliability of such information before use, 332 (83.0%) believed that SM can also be used to dispel rumours on health information, 337(84.3%) said they would like the use of SM regulated, while 206 (51.6%) still believed that SM is effective in disseminating health information among youths. Only 79.4% had good knowledge of EVD, and 30.7% of respondents had misinformation about EVD. Determinants of good level of knowledge about EVD through SM contacts include being a male, having SM as the first source of information on EVD and believing that SM could assist to disseminate and improve health information. CONCLUSION: Misconceptions spread through the SM fuelled the ongoing EVD outbreak in West Africa. There is a need for the concerned authority to create awareness through SM contacts as well as regulate its use.",The Pan African medical journal,2015,Uganda,2015,10
31581377,Differences in Overweight/Obesity Among Youth in a Midwest State by Rural-Urban Continuum Codes.,"BACKGROUND: A disparity in overweight/obesity prevalence exists between rural and urban youth; however, definitions of 'rural' vary widely and the degree to which rurality impacts overweight/obesity prevalence is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the school height and weight data in a rural Midwest state to determine differences in overweight and obesity prevalence among youth by using Rural-Urban Continuum (RUC) codes to define county-level degree of urbanization. METHODS: De-identified statewide data were obtained in electronic format from the state Department of Health. Height, weight, sex and age were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) z-scores, which were used to determine BMI percentile and categories. The county variable was used to assign a RUC code to each individual. Logistic regression was used to examine binary weight classifications by rural status while controlling for age, sex and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Odds of obesity and of overweight/obesity were higher among rural youth compared to non-rural. Odds of overweight/obesity increased with increasing rurality. Compared to youth who lived in counties with a RUC code of 3, youth who lived in counties with RUC codes of 5, 7, 8 and 9 had greater odds of overweight/obesity. The number of youth classified as 'rural' ranged from 11-48 percent, depending on how 'rural' was defined. Likewise, overweight/obesity prevalence differed by 4.6 percent depending on how 'rural' was defined. CONCLUSIONS: Consistently defining 'rural' and determining degree of rurality is important in understanding how geographic location plays a role in overweight/obesity among youth. Future research should work to assess the physical and social environments of these different types of rural areas to better understand the role that rurality plays in contributing to overweight/obesity among youth. Assessing social determinants of health and its impact on health in rural youth is essential for designing effective public health interventions that can be implemented to address the issue.",South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,2019 Sep,United States,2019,10
21976326,Where health disparities begin: the role of social and economic determinants--and why current policies may make matters worse.,"Health disparities by racial or ethnic group or by income or education are only partly explained by disparities in medical care. Inadequate education and living conditions-ranging from low income to the unhealthy characteristics of neighborhoods and communities-can harm health through complex pathways. Meaningful progress in narrowing health disparities is unlikely without addressing these root causes. Policies on education, child care, jobs, community and economic revitalization, housing, transportation, and land use bear on these root causes and have implications for health and medical spending. A shortsighted political focus on reducing spending in these areas could actually increase medical costs by magnifying disease burden and widening health disparities.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2011 Oct,United States,2011,10
23251832,Social Determinants of Stroke as Related to Stress at Work among Working Women: A Literature Review.,"In adult life, many of the social determinants of health are connected to working life. Yet, our knowledge of the role of work-related factors for the risk of stroke is fairly limited. In contemporary occupational health research, the Demand-Control Model (DCM) is frequently used to measure work stress. Previous literature reviews of the association of work stress and cardiovascular disease (CVD) do not include stroke as a specific outcome. Results regarding work stress and the risk of CVD are less evident in working women. With the focus on working women, the purpose of the present paper was to review the current research into the DCM in relation to stroke and to scrutinize potential gender differences. A literature search was performed and eight studies from three countries were identified. Based on the reviewed studies, there is some evidence that high psychological demands, low job control, and job strain are associated with increased stroke risk in women as well as in men. Any major reduction in deaths and disability from stroke is likely to come from decreasing social inequalities in health, and reducing work stress has a potential to contribute to a reduced risk of stroke in working populations.",Stroke research and treatment,2012,United States,2012,10

Chronic disease states previously seen only in adulthood are emerging during childhood, and health inequalities by social class are increasing. Advocacy to ensure environmental health and to protect from the biological embedding of toxic stress has become a fundamental part of pediatrics. We have presented the rationale for addressing environmental and social determinants of children's health, the epidemiology of issues facing children's health, recent innovations in pediatric medical education that have incorporated public health principles, and policy opportunities that have arisen with the passage of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.",American journal of public health,2012 Dec,United States,2012,10
29420660,Contextual and individual factors associated with dental services utilisation by Brazilian adults: A multilevel analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Inequalities in the utilisation of dental services in Brazil are remarkable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of contextual and individual factors with the utilisation of dental services by Brazilian adults using the Andersen's behavioural model. METHODS: Individual-level data from 27,017 adults residents in the State capitals who were interviewed in the 2013 Brazilian National Health Survey were pooled with contextual city-level data. The outcomes were non-utilisation of dental services and last dental visit over 12 months ago. Individual predisposing variables were age, sex, race/skin colour, schooling and social network. Individual enabling variables included income, health insurance and registration in primary health care. Individual need variables were self-perceived dental health and self-reported missing teeth. Multilevel logistic regression models were performed to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the association of contextual and individual predisposing, enabling and need-related variables with dental services outcomes. RESULTS: Predisposing (OR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.81-0.97) and enabling (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.85-0.96) contextual factors were associated with non-utilisation of dental services. Individual predisposing (sex, race/skin colour, schooling), enabling (income, health insurance) and need (self-perceived oral health, missing teeth) were associated with non-utilisation of dental services and last dental visit over 12 months ago. The latter was also associated with other individual predisposing (age, social network) and need (eating difficulties due to oral problems) characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Individual and contextual determinants influenced dental services utilisation in Brazilian adults. These factors should be on the policy agenda and considered in the organisation of health services aiming to reduce oral health inequalities related to access and utilisation of dental services.",PloS one,2018,United States,2018,10
28148602,An Assessment of Global Oral Health Education in U.S. Dental Schools.,"Dental schools need to produce graduates who are adequately prepared to respond to the complex needs and challenges of the increasingly diverse and interconnected world in which they will practice dentistry. To enhance discussions about the coverage of global oral health competencies in dental education, the aims of this study were to assess how global health education is currently incorporated into predoctoral dental training in the U.S. and which global oral health competencies are being covered. Surveys were emailed to all 64 accredited U.S. dental schools during the 2015-16 academic year. Respondents from 52 schools completed the survey (response rate 81%). The results showed that social determinants of oral diseases and conditions, how to identify barriers to use of oral health services, and how to work with patients who have limited dental health literacy were covered in the greatest number of responding schools' curricula. Key areas of global health curricula that were covered rarely included global dental infrastructure, data collection design, and horizontal and vertical programming approaches to health improvement. Despite current dialogue on the addition of global oral health competencies to dental curricula, only 41% of the responding schools were currently planning to expand their global oral health education. Based on these results, the authors conclude that it may be most feasible for dental schools to add recommended global oral health competencies to their curricula by incorporating didactic content into already established courses.",Journal of dental education,2017 Feb,United States,2017,10
31376832,Development of an online public health curriculum for medical students: the public health commute.,"BACKGROUND: As public health becomes increasingly central to the practice of medicine, educational efforts are necessary to prepare medical students to apply public health concepts in their care of patients. There are few accessible and informative tools to prepare students to engage with population health challenges. METHODS: We distributed an online questionnaire to clinical students, querying gaps in their education on public health topics. Based upon the responses, we developed a web-based curriculum for medical students rotating at a public safety-net hospital on pediatrics, medicine, primary care, psychiatry, and surgery services from April-December 2017 (available at www.publichealthcommute.com ). Students received guiding questions and media-based resources (e.g. podcasts, TedTalks, YouTube videos) in weekly modules addressing topics in public health. Each module incorporated 30 min of mobile-optimized content, including specific data relating the topic to the Central Harlem community. Familiarity with public health was assessed with pre- and post-program quizzes, including 10 multiple-choice and 2 open-ended questions. RESULTS: Among the 70 participating students, 59 (84%) completed both the pre- and post-assessments. The five-week curriculum covered health systems, social determinants, race, substance use, violence, and alternative care models. After completing the five-week curriculum, the mean correct score on a multiple-choice quiz rose from 57 to 66% (p = 0.001). In the qualitative section of the test, students were asked what public health topics should be taught in medical school. Frequently suggested topics included social determinants of health (25%), epidemiology (25%), health systems (25%), insurance (21%), policy (17%), economics (17%), racism (15%), and health disparities (8%). When asked how public health will impact their medical career, students frequently responded that it would greatly impact their clinical practice (49%), choice of residency program (17%), and decision to pursue advocacy or additional degrees (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Learners participating in this five-week online public health curriculum demonstrated a significant increase in public health knowledge. The online format allowed for high participation across five different specialty rotations, and community-specific data allowed students to recognize the importance of public health in medical practice.",BMC medical education,2019 Aug 3,England,2019,10

The objective of this qualitative study is to examine the interaction between socioeconomic status (SES) and body weight in order to understand underprivileged women's increased vulnerability to chronic diseases after menopause. By drawing specifically on Pierre Bourdieu's sociocultural theory of practice, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted from May to December of 2013 to investigate the health practices of clinically overweight, postmenopausal women living an underprivileged life in Canada. Findings emphasise that poor life conditions undermine personal investment in preventive health and weight loss, showing the importance for policy makers to bring stronger consideration on upstream determinants of health.",Sociology of health & illness,2017 Nov,England,2017,10
31286999,Investigating the effect of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing on pain intensity in patients with primary dysmenorrhea: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Unpleasant experience with the previous menstruation can increase the sensitivity to pain which may lead to moderate to severe pain in patients with dysmenorrhea. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological method to alleviate the distress from unpleasant memories and related events and can be used for other conditions such as anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. This protocol was designed to investigate the effect of EMDR therapy on pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhea. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial was designed in compliance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). Female students who have moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea (based on a visual analogue scale [VAS] score of at least 4 for two consecutive months) and who live in dormitories at Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in Qazvin, Iran will be invited to participate in the study. The total sample size will be 88 girls, who will be randomly assigned to intervention (N = 44) and control (N = 44) groups. EMDR therapy will be performed for the intervention group, while the control group can use sedative or other pain relife methods as their routin... There will be six treatment sessions, which will be held twice a week. The duration of each session is 30-90 min, according to the convenience of each participant. The data will be collected using the demographic characteristics questionnaire, the VAS, the Subjective Units of Anxiety or Distress Scale (SUD), and the Validity of Cognition Scale (VOC). The data on pain intensity due to primary dysmenorrhea in both groups will be collected at 1 and 2 months before the intervention (to identify eligible participants) and 1 and 2 months after the intervention (follow-ups). Data will be analyzed by using SPSS version 25 software and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc tests. A P value of less than 0.05 will be considered significant. DISCUSSION: The results are expected to provide the information on the efficacy of EMDR therapy to manage moderate to severe pain in patients with primary dysmenorrhea. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research proposal is approved by the human ethics committee of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences (IR.QUMS.REC.1397.100).

27642750,Correlation of Lipid Profile and Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in 10-14 Year Old Children.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The role of lipid profile in predicting the risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children is not clearly established. Our aim is to screen non-diabetic children aged 10-14 years for risk of developing T2DM and evaluate the association of abnormal lipids and socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Data on race/ethnicity, family history, body mass index percentile, blood pressure and presence of neck pigmentation (acanthosis nigricans) were collected from 149 non-diabetic children. Using these factors, children were classified into low risk (<3 risk factors) and high risk (>3 risk factors) groups. Logistic regression model and chi-square tests were used to evaluate the association of blood lipid profile and demographic variables. Independent t-test was used to compare the ratio of Total Cholesterol (TC) and High Density Lipids (HDL) with T2DM risk. RESULTS: 60% of children were at high risk for developing T2DM. HDL (p<0.001), triglycerides (p=0.02) and TC/HDL ratio (p<.001) were significantly abnormal in high risk group. Low SES showed a marginal association with high risk group. There were no gender or age differences between high and low risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: The significant determinants associated with high risk group were modifiable factors providing an opportunity for early intervention and prevention.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",2016,Germany,2016,10
25929959,A Political and Social History of HIV in South Africa.,"For the past 25 years, South Africa has had to deal with the inexorable and monumental rise of HIV. From one or two isolated cases, in the late 1980s, South Africa now has an estimated 6.4 million people infected with HIV, with high rates of concomitant tuberculosis, which will profoundly affect the country for decades to come. For nearly 10 years, the South African government's response to the HIV epidemic was described as denialist, which was estimated to have resulted in the deaths of 330,000 people because lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART) was not provided (Chigwedere et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 49:410-15, 2008; Heywood 2004). However, the story of the HIV and AIDS response in South Africa over the past 5 years is one of great progress after almost a decade of complex and tragic denialism that united civil society in a way not seen since the opposition to apartheid. Today, South Africa can boast of close to 3 million people on ART, by far the largest number in the world. Prevention efforts appear to be yielding results but there continues to be large numbers of new infections, with a profound peak in incidence in young women aged 15 to 24 years. In addition, infections occur across the gender spectrum in older age groups. As a result of the massive increase in access to ART after 2004 and particularly after 2008 as political will towards the HIV ART programme improved, there has been a marked increase in life expectancy, from 56 to 61 years in the period 2009-2012 alone; the aggressive expansion of the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) to HIV-positive pregnant women has been accompanied by dramatic decrease in HIV transmission to infants; and a 25 % decrease in child and infant mortality rates in the period 2009-2012. This progress in access is significantly due to a civil society movement that was prepared to pose a rights-based challenge to a governing party in denial and to brave health officials, politicians and clinicians working in a hostile system to bring about change.",Current HIV/AIDS reports,2015 Jun,United States,2015,10
29393150,Contextual and Individual Determinants of Root Caries in Older People.,"The aim of this study was to identify the association of the presence of root caries in older people with contextual and individual determinants using a multilevel model. Data from the National Survey of Oral Health collected in Brazil were used. A sample of older Brazilians (aged 65-74 years) was included and selected through multistage probability cluster sampling, using probability proportional to size. Contextual variables of municipalities and individual variables of older people were included. Descriptive, bivariate, and multilevel analyses were conducted. Of the 3,926 older people included in the study, 934 (21.8%) had at least 1 tooth with root caries. There seemed to be no pattern of involvement between the anterior and posterior teeth in the dental arches. Multilevel analysis showed a higher presence of root caries among older people resident in municipalities that were noncapital cities (OR = 1.50), who were over 70 years of age (odds ratio, OR = 1.22), had nonwhite skin color (OR 1.35), had coronal caries (OR = 5.58), were dissatisfied with their teeth and mouth (OR = 1.47), and had self-perceived dental treatment needs (OR = 1.33).

We selected a representative sample of 7490 non-pregnant and sexually active women between 15 and 49 years of age. Multivariate logistic regressions were fitted and effects of relevant demographic variables controlled. Only one-in-three women were current users of modern contraceptives. Modern contraceptive use enabling and inhibiting (barrier) environments were significant predictors of use. Exposure to family planning information regardless of the delivery method significantly associated with improved use. Women who visited a health clinic in the last 12 months increased their odds of using modern contraceptives by 54%.

28628586,Building a Pediatric Oral Health Training Curriculum for Community Health Workers.,"OBJECTIVES: Community health workers (CHWs) are a promising approach to oral health promotion in high-risk populations. This article describes the process of creating a pediatric oral health CHW training curriculum. DESIGN: Existing curricula were identified through outreach efforts to experts in the oral health and CHW fields, as well as PubMed and Google searches. After coding basic information, curricula were mapped to define oral health domains. Then group discussion was employed to determine final curriculum contents. SETTING: United States. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Curricula were included if they addressed oral health, were in English or Spanish, involved US populations, did not target dental clinicians, and whether sufficient data could be obtained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Curricula were evaluated for delivery format, number of hours, target audience, inclusion of CHWs, completeness, and oral health content. RESULTS: Eighteen unique curricula were identified; 14 (78%) were CHW specific. Pathologic factors, caries formation, toothbrushing basics, flossing, nutrition, sugar-sweetened beverages, oral health recommendations, baby bottle tooth decay, fluoride treatments, and fluoride were covered to some extent in 75% of curricula. More than half did not mention types of teeth, oral health during pregnancy, antifluoride, cultural humility, and special needs populations. After comparing CHW curricula with non-CHW curricula, the original 26 oral health domains were condensed into 10 CHW training domains. CONCLUSION: Using existing evidence and expert insight, an oral health CHW training curriculum outline was created that emphasizes behaviors, social support, and navigation assistance to promote preventive oral health behaviors in families of young children. This has implications beyond oral health. CHW programs are expanding to address the social determinants of health. The process of creating this curriculum and its basic elements can be applied to other disease areas. Clearly defined trainings that are made publicly available, such as this one, support efforts to standardize the CHW field in preparation for CHW certification and reimbursement in the future.",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,2018 May/Jun,United States,2018,10

METHODS: Mortality and estimated residential population data from New South Wales, Australia, over 2010-2012 was used to calculate life expectancy. Inequalities by sociodemographic groups were partitioned into age group- and cause-of-death-specific contributions. RESULTS: The largest contributions to SES differentials in life expectancy were observed at 60-84 years of age; for cancer, cardiovascular, endocrine and respiratory causes of death; and additionally external causes of death for males. Sex inequalities ranged from 3.6 to 5.2 years, with common causes of death such as cardiovascular disease and cancer in late adulthood (60+ years) accounting for the bulk of the differences. Smaller differences in life expectancy were observed by remoteness, with the largest contributions observed in ages 85 years and above, and for cardiovascular, mental, cancer and external causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: Common causes of death in late adulthood accounted for the bulk of life expectancy inequalities. Implications for public health: Development of policy and interventions aimed at addressing social determinants, such as proposed by the WHO's Global Plan of Action, are needed to help reduce sociodemographic inequalities in lifespan.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2018 Apr,Australia,2018,10

Determinants and related factors to sense of social security is one of the most important research priorities, especially in adolescents and young people. Objective: To identify the factors affecting the social security of the youth. Methods: In 2017, using conventional content analysis, and benefiting from semi-structured in-depth interviews, we conducted a qualitative study exploring the opinions of young people about their feelings regarding social security. First, a targeted sampling method was determined to collect the data. Participants were young volunteers aged 18 to 30 who were selected from Tehran, the capital of Iran. Inclusion criteria for participants were willingness to participate in the study and ability to express their experiences. Data was extracted from 21 participants. Results: The participants consisted of 21 young people who met the study inclusion criteria, of whom 12 participants were male. Their mean age was 24.4+/-0.41 years and their education varied from primary school to master's degree. Under two main categories of the need for economic and financial security and the need for a safe society, we extracted 11 subcategories following 32 codes. According to the findings, most participants agreed on the important role that sense of social security has in their lives and their health. Conclusion: The important role of sense of social security in participant's lives and health was the main important point of our findings, emphasized by most of participants.

27664009,Offspring Socioeconomic Status and Parent Mortality Within a Historical Population.,"Considering a network approach to health determinants, we test the hypothesis that benefits of high socioeconomic status (SES) may be transmitted up the generational ladder from offspring to parents. Studies that examine own SES and own health outcomes, or SES of parents and outcomes of young or adolescent children, are common. Those that investigate SES of offspring and their association with parental health are rare. Employing data from a historical population of individuals extracted from a comprehensive population database that links demographic and vital records across generations, this study tests the hypothesis that higher offspring SES associates with lower parental mortality after controlling for parental SES. The sample includes 29,972 individuals born between 1864 and 1883 whose offspring were born between 1886 and 1920. SES is operationalized using Nam-Powers occupational status scores divided into quartiles and a category for farmers. Models assess mortality risk after age 40. Included is a test for whether effects are proportional across parents who died younger and older. Estimated life expectancies across categories of offspring SES conditioned on parental SES are calculated to illustrate specifically how differences in SES relate to differences in years lived. Results indicate a longevity penalty for those whose offspring have low SES and a longevity dividend for those with high-SES offspring. The influence of offspring attributes on well-being of parents points to fluid and myriad linkages between generations.",Demography,2016 Oct,United States,2016,10

The higher prevalence of this dramatic phenomenon in Iran is a serious social and health problem. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to combine the results from available studies to examine the epidemiology and socio-demographic characteristics of individuals who attempted self-immolation in Iran. METHOD: Pertinent studies were identified by searching the electronic bibliographic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Iran Medex, Magiran, Medlib and Scientific Information Database (SID) (2000-October 2016). Meta-analysis was used to summarize the research results on socio-demographic risk factors of self-immolation in Iran. The STROBE checklist was used to assess quality of the study. The random effect model was employed in the meta-analysis to account for the observed heterogeneity among the selected studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (sample size=5717) were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated average age of individuals who attempted self-immolation was 27.31 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.81-28.81) years. Women account for 70% (95% CI: 64-77) of all self-immolation attempts in Iran. Thirty-nine (95% CI: 34-43) per cent of all self-immolation were among singles. Nineteen (95% CI: 16-22) per cent of self-immolators had mental disorder. Meta-regression model showed that the average age of individuals who attempted self-immolation increased significantly over the period between 2000 to 2016 (P-value=0.006).

This process results from the confrontation of different viewpoints which seek to address social production vis-a-vis their project, with the possibility of updating the hegemonic mode of production and consumption or the emergence of counter-hegemonic rationales. Health, as one of the SDGs, has the challenge of imposing an intersectorial agenda that addresses its social determinants, in a process of participative governance able to build a hierarchy of priorities based on the needs of the territory and build techno-political solutions based on the ecology of knowledge, constituting a strategic-situational and communicative management process. The consistency in formulation of the agenda and potential challenges to its implementation are analyzed, considering its intersectoriality, its strategic governance and management, and especially an assessment of its effectiveness. Moreover, it tests the evaluative tools used and their ability to analyze the consistency in the formulation of the agenda.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2014 Nov,Brazil,2014,10
28119160,Evaluation of prepulse inhibition and memory impairments at early stage of cirrhosis may be considered as a diagnostic index for minimal hepatic encephalopathy.,"Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), which represents the early stage of this condition, is not clinically apparent and is prevalent in up to 80% of patients. The poor outcomes of MHE encouraged us to identify more simple methods for early diagnosis of MHE. To this purpose, we evaluated the contemporary manifestations of motor, cognitive and sensorimotor gaiting deficits following bile duct-ligation (BDL). Male Wistar rats were undergone BDL to induce cirrhosis and locomotor, spatial learning and memory and sensorimotor gating were assessed 2, 3, and 4weeks after the operation by rotarod, Morris water-maze and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests. PPI was examined 6weeks after BDL until appearance of hepatic encephalopathy. Results showed that although PPI was significantly enhanced in the 6-week BDL animals, locomotor activity reduced in 4-week BDL rats compared to the BDL rats after a 2-week period. The total distance travelled and swimming time to reach the platform increased in the 4-week BDL rats and, in contrast, the percentage of time spent and space travelled in correct quadrant decreased. Moreover, memory index decreased in the 3-week BDL group compared to sham-operated group. It was observed an increase in global PPI in 3- and 4-week BDL animals in comparison with either 2-week BDL or sham-operated rats. Consequently, it is indicated that BDL animals manifest spatial learning and memory deficits and PPI disruption in early stage of HE and evaluation of these factors can be considered as indices for simple and early diagnosis of MHE.",Physiology & behavior,2017 May 1,United States,2017,10
28218688,Determinants of Health Care Services Utilization among First Generation Afghan Migrants in Istanbul.,"There is insufficient empirical evidence on the correlates of health care utilization of irregular migrants currently living in Turkey. The aim of this study was to identify individual level determinants associated with health service and medication use. One hundred and fifty-five Afghans completed surveys assessing service utilization including encounters with primary care physicians and outpatient specialists in addition to the use of prescription and nonprescription medicines. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to examine associations between service use and a range of predisposing, enabling, and perceived need factors. Health services utilization was lowest for outpatient specialists (20%) and highest for nonprescription medications (37%). Female gender and higher income predicted encounters with primary care physicians. Income, and other enabling factors such as family presence in Turkey predicted encounters with outpatient specialists. Perceived illness-related need factors had little to no influence on use of services; however, asylum difficulties increased the likelihood for encounters with primary care physicians, outpatient services, and the use of prescription medications. This study suggests that health services use among Afghan migrants in Turkey is low considering the extent of their perceived illness-related needs, which may be further exacerbated by the precarious conditions in which they live.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2017 Feb 17,Switzerland,2017,10
29160194,SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF LOW FERTILITY IN BRAZIL.,"An increasing number of developing countries are experiencing below replacement fertility rates. Although the factors associated with low fertility in developed countries have been widely explored in the literature, studies of low fertility in middle- and low-income countries continue to be rare. To help fill this gap, Brazil was used as a case study to assess whether human development, gender equality and the ability of mothers with young children to work are associated with the likelihood of married or cohabiting women to have a child. For this purpose, multilevel logistic regressions were estimated using the 1991, 2000 and 2010 Brazilian Demographic Censuses. It was found that human development was negatively associated with fertility in the three periods analysed. Gender equality and the ability of mothers with young children to work were positively associated with the odds of having higher order births in Brazil in 2000 and 2010. In 1991, these variables were not associated with higher order births, and gender equality was negatively associated with first births. The positive association found in 2000 and 2010 may constitute a reversal of the relationship that in all likelihood prevailed earlier in the demographic transition when gender equality was most likely negatively correlated with fertility levels.",Journal of biosocial science,2017 Nov,England,2017,10

The study aims to assess the rate of vaccine uptake among medical students, its associated barriers and levels of awareness. A cross sectional study was done at a University Hospital in Saudi Arabia on 421 medical students by self administered questionnaire from February to March 2015. The immunization rate of seasonal influenza vaccine was just 20.7% in 2015, while it was 57% for cumulative of previous three-year period. The intended uptake among those offered vaccination was 68%. The significant determinants of vaccine uptake were clinical years of medical study (p<0.05) and previous history of vaccination (p<0.0001). The major sources influencing vaccine uptake decision were health department guidelines, medical training, social and media influence. Barriers of vaccination constituted, assumption of not being at risk of influenza (37.9%), vaccine side effects (28.9%), questioned effectiveness of the vaccine (14.5%), and inability to allocate time (11%). Knowledge levels were unsatisfactory and males scored lower (5.4+/-1.7) than females (6.5+/-1.4) out of total score of 9. Both knowledge and uptake of annual influenza vaccination was inadequate.

31454895,Association between Sociodemographic Factors and Dietary Patterns in Children Under 24 Months of Age: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding early-life complementary feeding dietary patterns and their determining factors could lead to better ways of improving nutrition in early childhood. The purpose of this review was to evaluate evidence of the association between sociodemographic factors and dietary patterns (DPs) in children under 24 months. METHODS: Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Central, NICE guidelines, and Trip database were searched for observational studies that evaluated sociodemographic factors and their associations with DP. RESULTS: Seven studies were selected for the present review. High education level among mothers was inversely associated with unhealthy DPs and positively associated with healthy DPs. Higher household income was negatively associated with unhealthy DPs. Four studies showed a positive association between low household income and unhealthy DPs and three studies showed a positive association between higher household income and healthy DPs. Additionally, in younger mothers, body mass index (BMI >/= 30.0 kg/m(2)) and number of children were positively associated with unhealthy DPs. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence of a positive association between mothers' higher education level, higher household income, higher maternal age, and healthy dietary patterns as well as a negative association between these factors and unhealthy dietary patterns. Further studies from low- and middle-income countries are needed for comparison with associations showed in this review.",Nutrients,2019 Aug 26,Switzerland,2019,10
28620637,"Evaluation of the Effects of Three Plant Species (Myrtus Communis L., Camellia Sinensis L., Zataria Multiflora Boiss.) on the Healing Process of Intraoral Ulcers in Rats.","STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Use of traditional medicine to relieve human sufferings has a very long history. The effects of these plants in wound curing and subsequently making the best mucosa patch for treatment of oral ulcers is still under investigation. PURPOSE: The main goal of present research work is to assess the efficacy of Myrtus communis L., Camellia sinensis L. and Zataria multiflora Boiss. on oral ulcer recovery process in rats. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this study, 60 healthy adult male rats in 5 groups were investigated. A wound with 2 mm diameter was punched into the hard palate of each rat. For topical application, a mucosa patch of materials or blank was packed into the wound. Histological samples were harvested on post injury days 2, 4, 6, and 8. RESULTS: This study showed that there were no significant differences between groups in the reduction of weight. Comparison of clinical wound size showed that group Myrtus communis L had the greatest reduction in wound size on days 4, 6 and 8, which was significantly different from the other groups. The highest thickness of epithelium was observed in groups Myrtus communis L and Camellia sinensis L on days 6 and 8. Group Myrtus communis L showed the highest values on days 6 and 8. This study showed a lower mononuclear cell counts in group Myrtus communis L on days 6 and 8 compared to other groups which was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed that Myrtus communis L. has significant effects on oral wound healing processes. These favorable results might introduce a new group of material or medicine derived from this plant.","Journal of dentistry (Shiraz, Iran)",2017 Jun,Iran,2017,10
25985223,[Families with Migrant Backgrounds as Target Group of Early Interventions: Results of a Social Early Warning System in a Metropolitan Region].,"OBJECTIVES: Families with migrant backgrounds (MB) are exposed to several psychosocial risk factors that increase the likelihood of impaired child development, in particular. QUESTIONS: We investigated whether families with MB differ from families without MB regarding their psychosocial stressors in the period of pregnancy and birth. METHOD: As part of a social early warning system in an obstetrics clinic in Germany n=502 families with MB were compared with n=349 families without MB with respect to the degree of stress and stress factors on the basis of an initial screening of risk factors for child maltreatment by a midwife or physician and a subsequent structured clearing interview by social education workers during the mothers' inpatient hospitalisation. RESULTS: For families without MB, a significantly higher total score was found in the risk screening (M=3,9 points vs. M=2,9 points) in comparison to families with MB. While families with MB compared to families without MB were faced more frequently by social stressors, e. g., financial problems or a difficult housing situation (81 vs. 37%), they were less frequently impacted by mental strain (27 vs. 48%), young fathers (2 vs. 10%) and maternal psychiatric diseases (3 vs. 17%), according to the risk screening. Socio-economic determinants such as social inclusion and living environment were found to be important factors influencing the psychosocial stress level of families.

30736801,Fruit and vegetable consumption and mental health across adolescence: evidence from a diverse urban British cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption (FV) and mental health in adolescence is sparse and inconsistent. Social determinants of FV include ethnicity, family environments and economic disadvantage. We investigated the relationship between FV and mental health in the British multi-ethnic Determinants of Adolescents (now young Adult) Social well-being and Health (DASH) longitudinal study. METHODS: A longitudinal study of 4683 adolescents living in London at age 11-13 years and followed up at 14-16 years. FV was measured using validated questions on the number of portions consumed daily. Mental health was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire as mean Total Difficulties Score (TDS) and by classification as a 'probable clinical case' (TDS > 17). Social measures included ethnicity, parenting and socioeconomic circumstances. Multilevel modelling was used to investigate the association between FV and mental health throughout adolescence. RESULTS: Low FV was common among adolescents, with approximately 60-70% of adolescents reporting < 5 portions/day and 20-30% reporting < 1 portion/day. In late adolescence, most ethnic minority groups reported lower FV than their White peers. In fully adjusted models, < 1 portion/day remained a significant correlate with mean TDS (Coef: 0.55, 0.29-0.81, P < 0.001) and TDS > 17 (Odds Ratio: 1.43, 1.11-1.85, P = 0.007). Gender- or ethnic-specific effects were not observed. Low parental care partly attenuated the association between FV and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Low FV is a longitudinal correlate of poor mental health across adolescence. A focus on FV in parenting interventions could yield interrelated benefits across developmental outcomes given its importance to both physical and socioemotional health.",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2019 Feb 8,England,2019,10
20973843,Grasping the thistle: The role of alcohol brief interventions in Scottish alcohol policy.,"ISSUE: Scotland has experienced a substantial rise in alcohol-related harm, which is now one of the biggest public health challenges it faces. APPROACH: Alcohol problems in Scotland are described along with national alcohol policy response in addressing them. The role of a program of Alcohol Brief Interventions is discussed therein. KEY FINDINGS: In Scotland, considerable proportions of the population are drinking hazardously or harmfully, common across different age and socioeconomic groups. Rising consumption has been set in wider environmental changes with alcohol becoming more available and affordable. Scotland has had one of the fastest growing chronic liver disease mortality rates in the world at a time when rates in most of Western Europe are falling. Scotland's alcohol policy has an explicit aim to reduce population consumption and includes legislative measures to tackle price and availability. A national program to deliver Alcohol Brief Interventions for hazardous drinkers is a key plank of this wider strategy. A portfolio of studies will monitor and evaluate national policy and, through contribution analysis, describe the role Alcohol Brief Interventions play in reducing alcohol misuse. IMPLICATIONS: Effective alcohol policy recognises that determinants of health not only lie at individual level, but include wider social, environmental and economic factors. Scotland's policy is addressing these determinants with both population-based and population-targeted interventions. CONCLUSION: Scotland has a serious problem with alcohol. A comprehensive, evidence-based, resourced alcohol policy is being implemented, which will need continual review to ensure it remains anchored in evidence while maintaining its ambition.[Graham LJC, MacKinnon D.

25019254,Personality and prosocial behavior: linking basic traits and social value orientations.,"Concerning the dispositional determinants of prosocial behavior and cooperation, work based on the classic 5 personality factors, and especially Agreeableness, has turned out somewhat inconsistent. A clearer picture has emerged from consideration of the HEXACO model of personality--though supported entirely by hypothetical behavior as criterion, so far. Thus, in 2 studies and a reanalysis, we investigated ""actual behavior"" in the form of individually and socially consequential distribution decisions. As expected, HEXACO Honesty-Humility consistently predicted prosocial behavior, including a theory-consistent pattern on the facet level. Importantly, this pattern might explain why five-factor Agreeableness has only sometimes been found to account for prosocial behavior. Indeed, further results indicate that five-factor Agreeableness comprises some aspects that are predictive of prosocial behavior--aspects well covered by HEXACO Honesty-Humility--but also others that play no role for this criterion. As such, the links between five-factor Agreeableness and prosocial behavior are well-covered by HEXACO Honesty-Humility, but not vice versa. Taken together, these findings hint that especially HEXACO Honesty-Humility (and certain aspects of five-factor Agreeableness) account for prosocial behavior--thus explaining previous inconsistencies and providing a more nuanced understanding of the links between basic personality and prosocial or cooperative behavior.",Journal of personality and social psychology,2014 Sep,United States,2014,10
26791057,Sex Versus Gender-Related Characteristics: Which Predicts Outcome After Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Young?,"BACKGROUND: ""Gender"" reflects social norms for women and men, whereas ""sex"" defines biological characteristics. Gender-related characteristics explain some differences in access to care for premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS); whether they are associated with cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study estimated associations between gender and sex with recurrent ACS and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (e.g., ACS, cardiac mortality, revascularization) over 12 months in patients with ACS. METHODS: We studied 273 women and 636 men age 18 to 55 years from GENESIS-PRAXY (GENdEr and Sex determInantS of cardiovascular disease: from bench to beyond-Premature Acute Coronary SYndrome), a prospective observational cohort study, who were hospitalized for ACS between January 2009 and April 2013. Gender-related characteristics (e.g., social roles) were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire, and a composite measure of gender was derived. Outcomes included recurrent ACS and MACE over 12 months. RESULTS: Feminine roles and personality traits were associated with higher rates of recurrent ACS and MACE compared with masculine characteristics. This difference persisted for recurrent ACS, after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio from score 0 to 100: 4.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 19.27), and was a nonstatistically significant trend for MACE (hazard ratio: 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.90 to 2.66). A possible explanation is increased anxiety, the only condition that was more prevalent in patients with feminine characteristics and that rendered the association between gender and recurrent ACS nonstatistically significant (hazard ratio: 3.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.81 to 15.61). Female sex was not associated with outcomes post-ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Younger adults with ACS with feminine gender are at an increased risk of recurrent ACS over 12 months, independent of female sex.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2016 Jan 19,United States,2016,10
25422855,Environmental role in influenza virus outbreaks.,"The environmental drivers of influenza outbreaks are largely unknown. Despite more than 50 years of research, there are conflicting lines of evidence on the role of the environment in influenza A virus (IAV) survival, stability, and transmissibility. With the increasing and looming threat of pandemic influenza, it is important to understand these factors for early intervention and long-term control strategies. The factors that dictate the severity and spread of influenza would include the virus, natural and acquired hosts, virus-host interactions, environmental persistence, virus stability and transmissibility, and anthropogenic interventions. Virus persistence in different environments is subject to minor variations in temperature, humidity, pH, salinity, air pollution, and solar radiations. Seasonality of influenza is largely dictated by temperature and humidity, with cool-dry conditions enhancing IAV survival and transmissibility in temperate climates in high latitudes, whereas humid-rainy conditions favor outbreaks in low latitudes, as seen in tropical and subtropical zones. In mid-latitudes, semiannual outbreaks result from alternating cool-dry and humid-rainy conditions. The mechanism of virus survival in the cool-dry or humid-rainy conditions is largely determined by the presence of salts and proteins in the respiratory droplets. Social determinants of heath, including health equity, vaccine acceptance, and age-related illness, may play a role in influenza occurrence and spread.",Annual review of animal biosciences,2015,United States,2015,10
24977627,Utilization patterns of cervical cancer screening in Italy.,"The aim of this study is to identify the use of cervical cancer screening and sociodemographic determinants associated with proper screening, overscreening, and underscreening in the Italian target population. Cross-sectional data from the national last available survey 'Health and use of health care in Italy,' conducted between December 2004 and September 2005, were analyzed. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the risk factors associated independently with Pap test utilization. Our final sample included 36,161 women aged 25-64 years. Among women who reported having a Pap smear at least once, 20,920 (81.6%) repeated the Pap smear after the first one: 15,454 (74.3%) more than once every 3 years ('OVER' screening) and 2599 (12.4%) less than once every 3 years ('UNDER' screening). Among the independent risk factors associated with 'OVER' screening were higher social class [odds ratio (OR)=1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.39], being a former smoker (OR=1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.28), and having had two or more pregnancies in the last 5 years (OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.70), whereas 'UNDER' screening was associated with the age group of 55-64 years (OR=2.11, 95% CI 1.76-2.53) and being divorced (OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.71).

31620344,Latissimus Dorsi Musculocutaneous Flap Inset Innovation in Breast Reconstruction.,"BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction is distinct among plastic surgery techniques. This study analysed the results of breast reconstruction with the Latissimus dorsi (LD) myocutaneous flap as a strategy for better coverage and positioning of the implant. METHODS: Twenty patients who underwent surgery between September 2013 and September 2016 were enrolled. Fourteen patients underwent reconstruction with LD and tissue expander (TE) exchanged later with implant. Six patients were reconstructed with LD and implant. The complications, problems, and aesthetic improvement associated with the use of implants placed under LD muscle were assessed. RESULTS: 0ne case required an expander removal because of deflation of TE, also one case had seroma formation due to recurrence of breast cancer and also one case had seroma in donor site. No asymmetry was detected in the inframammary fold (IMF) position between reconstructed and normal regions. After the procedure, 80% of the patients reported that their expectations were met, 95% reported no functional limitations, and 5% reported mild limitations that ameliorated with physiotherapy. The placement of implants (prostheses or expanders) under the muscle with using the LD muscle flap to cover the implant improved the breast contour by softening the inframammary crease and positioning the implants in the upper and medial quadrants of the new breasts. CONCLUSION: Breast reconstruction using silicone implants and the LD muscle flap can have excellent outcomes with low rates of complications. Placing the implant under a layer of muscle improved the harmony of the upper quadrants during breast reconstruction.",World journal of plastic surgery,2019 Sep,Iran,2019,10
30703163,The benefits of sensation on the experience of a hand: A qualitative case series.,"BACKGROUND: The experience of upper limb loss involves loss of both functional capabilities and the sensory connection of a hand. Research studies to restore sensation to persons with upper limb loss with neural interfaces typically measure outcomes through standardized functional tests or quantitative surveys. However, these types of metrics cannot fully capture the personal experience of living with limb loss or the impact of sensory restoration on this experience. Qualitative studies can demonstrate the viewpoints and priorities of specific persons or groups and reveal the underlying conceptual structure of various aspects of their experiences. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following a home use trial of a neural-connected, sensory-enabled prosthesis, two persons with upper limb loss were interviewed about their experiences using the sensory restoration system in unsupervised, unconstrained settings. We used grounded theory methodology to examine their experiences, perspectives, and opinions about the sensory restoration system. We then developed a model to describe the impact of sensation on the experience of a hand for persons with upper limb loss. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of sensation was complex and included concepts such as the naturalness of the experience, sensation modality, and the usefulness of the sensory information. Sensation was critical for outcome acceptance, and contributed to prosthesis embodiment, confidence, reduced focus and attention for using the prosthesis, and social interactions. Embodiment, confidence, and social interactions were also key determinants of outcome acceptance. This model provides a unified framework to study and understand the impact of sensation on the experience of limb loss and to understand outcome acceptance following upper limb loss more broadly.",PloS one,2019,United States,2019,10
23873728,Can a nudge keep you warm? Using nudges to reduce excess winter deaths: insight from the Keeping Warm in Later Life Project (KWILLT).,"Nudges are interventions that aim to change people's behaviour through changing the environment in which they choose rather than appealing to their reasoning. Nudges have been proposed as of possible use in relation to health-related behaviour. However, nudges have been criticized as ethically dubious because they bypass peoples reasoning and (anyway) are of little help in relation to affecting ill-health that results from social determinants, such as poverty. Reducing the rate of excess winter deaths (EWDs) is a public health priority; however, EWD seems clearly to be socially determined such that nudges arguably have little role. This article defends two claims: (i) nudges could have a place in tackling even the heavily socially determined problem of EWD. We draw on evidence from an empirical study, the Keeping Warm in Later Life Project (KWILLT), to argue that in some cases the risk of cold is within the person's control to some extent such that environmental modifications to influence behaviour such as nudges are possible. (ii) Some uses of behavioural insights in the form of nudges are acceptable, including some in the area of EWD. We suggest a question-based framework by which to judge the ethical acceptability of nudges.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2014 Mar,England,2014,10
25174960,Violence and reproductive health preceding flight from war: accounts from Somali born women in Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: Political violence and war are push factors for migration and social determinants of health among migrants. Somali migration to Sweden has increased threefold since 2004, and now comprises refugees with more than 20 years of war experiences. Health is influenced by earlier life experiences with adverse sexual and reproductive health, violence, and mental distress being linked. Adverse pregnancy outcomes are reported among Somali born refugees in high-income countries. The aim of this study was to explore experiences and perceptions on war, violence, and reproductive health before migration among Somali born women in Sweden. METHOD: Qualitative semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 17 Somali born refugee women of fertile age living in Sweden. Thematic analysis was applied. RESULTS: Before migration, widespread war-related violence in the community had created fear, separation, and interruption in daily life in Somalia, and power based restrictions limited access to reproductive health services. The lack of justice and support for women exposed to non-partner sexual violence or intimate partner violence reinforced the risk of shame, stigmatization, and silence. Social networks, stoicism, and faith constituted survival strategies in the context of war. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors reinforced non-disclosure of violence exposure among the Somali born women before migration. Therefore, violence-related illness might be overlooked in the health care system. Survival strategies shaped by war contain resources for resilience and enhancement of well-being and sexual and reproductive health and rights in receiving countries after migration.",BMC public health,2014 Aug 30,England,2014,10
29930967,Integrating Social Determinants of Health into Primary Care Clinical and Informational Workflow during Care Transitions.,"Context: Care continuity during transitions between the hospital and home requires reliable communication between providers and settings and an understanding of social determinants that influence recovery. Case Description: The coordinating transitions intervention uses real time alerts, delivered directly to the primary care practice for complex chronically ill patients discharged from an acute care setting, to facilitate nurse care coordinator led telephone outreach. The intervention incorporates claims-based risk stratification to prioritize patients for follow-up and an assessment of social determinants of health using the Patient-centered Assessment Method (PCAM). Results from transitional care are stored and transmitted to qualified healthcare providers across the continuum. Findings: Reliance on tools that incorporated interoperability standards facilitated exchange of health information between the hospital and primary care. The PCAM was incorporated into both the clinical and informational workflow through the collaboration of clinical, industry, and academic partners. Health outcomes improved at the study practice over their baseline and in comparison with control practices and the regional Medicaid population. Major Themes: Current research supports the potential impact of systems approaches to care coordination in improving utilization value after discharge. The project demonstrated that flexibility in developing the informational and clinical workflow was critical in developing a solution that improved continuity during transitions. There is additional work needed in developing managerial continuity across settings such as shared comprehensive care plans. Conclusions: New clinical and informational workflows which incorporate social determinant of health data into standard practice transformed clinical practice and improved outcomes for patients.","EGEMS (Washington, DC)",2017 Jul 4,England,2017,10
29558922,Why are some groups physically active and others not? A contrast group analysis in leisure settings.,"BACKGROUND: This field study aims to investigate the determinants of physical activity of particularly active and inactive groups in their leisure environments. In order to consider the context in which physical activity occurs and to investigate whether cultural settings may influence physical activity, we conducted the study at pools in different cultural environments - Hawai'i and Germany. METHODS: This study presents the quantitative data of a systematic (covert) participant observation. We recorded the physical activity of face-to-face interacting groups and analysed categories such as group size, estimated age of the group members, and verbal communication patterns. Total observation period was eight and a half months. In total, we observed 907 groups with the groups' size varying between 2 and 8 members. For the general statistics, we accessed the significance of differences regarding the degree of physical activity dependent on the target variables. To better understand activity promoting and hindering mechanisms, special attention is given to the identification of contrasting factors that characterise groups which are very active or very inactive. For this, we conducted a classification tree analysis. RESULTS: General statistical analysis shows that, overall, the most differentiating factor regarding physical activity was the body shape of the group members. While obese groups had the lowest average activity level, groups mainly consisting of people with an athletic body shape were the most physically active. Yet, classification tree analysis reveals that obesity itself does not necessarily determine physical inactivity levels. The identification of six contrasting clusters highlights that besides the body shape several factors interact regarding a group's physical level. Such interacting factors were for example the degree of communication within the group, the gender- and age-related composition of the group, but also the equipment that had been brought to the beach/pool. Obese people were particularly inactive when they were members of frequently communicating, age-heterogeneous groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that several social factors determine the physical activity of very active and very inactive groups. In order to promote physical activity, future health initiatives should target these factors of a person's network.",BMC public health,2018 Mar 20,England,2018,10
20352355,Economic dependence and unprotected sex: the role of sexual assertiveness among young urban mothers.,"In the USA, sexual intercourse is the leading route of human immunodeficiency virus transmission among women, primarily through their main partner. Because male condom use is not directly under a woman's control, gender inequalities may help shape this sexual risk behavior. To examine this association, data came from follow-up interviews of young, primarily minority, pregnant women enrolled in a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Specifically, we aimed to determine the relationship between economic dependence on a male partner and condom use, and to establish whether this relationship was mediated by sexual assertiveness. Overall, 28% of women reported being economically dependent on a male partner. Young women dependent on a male partner were 1.6 times more likely to report not using a condom at last sex than women not dependent on their partner (95% confidence interval = 1.11-2.32; p = 0.01). Sexual assertiveness mediated the relationship between economic dependence and condom use (Sobel = 2.05, p = 0.04). Coupled with past research, this study supports the premise that sexual behaviors may be rooted in a complex web of social determinants. Addressing gender inequalities in contextual factors may promote healthier decisions within sexual relationships.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2010 May,United States,2010,10
31664894,Uncovering extensive post-translation regulation during human cell cycle progression by integrative multi-'omics analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Analysis of high-throughput multi-'omics interactions across the hierarchy of expression has wide interest in making inferences with regard to biological function and biomarker discovery. Expression levels across different scales are determined by robust synthesis, regulation and degradation processes, and hence transcript (mRNA) measurements made by microarray/RNA-Seq only show modest correlation with corresponding protein levels. RESULTS: In this work we are interested in quantitative modelling of correlation across such gene products. Building on recent work, we develop computational models spanning transcript, translation and protein levels at different stages of the H. sapiens cell cycle. We enhance this analysis by incorporating 25+ sequence-derived features which are likely determinants of cellular protein concentration and quantitatively select for relevant features, producing a vast dataset with thousands of genes. We reveal insights into the complex interplay between expression levels across time, using machine learning methods to highlight outliers with respect to such models as proteins associated with post-translationally regulated modes of action. CONCLUSIONS: We uncover quantitative separation between modified and degraded proteins that have roles in cell cycle regulation, chromatin remodelling and protein catabolism according to Gene Ontology; and highlight the opportunities for providing biological insights in future model systems.",BMC bioinformatics,2019 Oct 29,England,2019,10
28362911,Socioeconomic Factors Explain Racial Disparities in Invasive Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Disease Rates.,"Background: Invasive community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) incidence in the United States is higher among black persons than white persons. We explored the extent to which socioeconomic factors might explain this racial disparity. Methods: A retrospective cohort was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program surveillance data for invasive community-associated MRSA cases (isolated from a normally sterile site of an outpatient or on hospital admission day </=3 in a patient without specified major healthcare exposures) from 2009 to 2011 in 33 counties of 9 states. We used generalized estimating equations to determine census tract-level factors associated with differences in MRSA incidence and inverse odds ratio-weighted mediation analysis to determine the proportion of racial disparity mediated by socioeconomic factors. Results: Annual invasive community-associated MRSA incidence was 4.59 per 100000 among whites and 7.60 per 100000 among blacks (rate ratio [RR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-1.80). In the mediation analysis, after accounting for census tract-level measures of federally designated medically underserved areas, education, income, housing value, and rural status, 91% of the original racial disparity was explained; no significant association of black race with community-associated MRSA remained (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, .92-1.20). Conclusions: The racial disparity in invasive community-associated MRSA rates was largely explained by socioeconomic factors. The specific factors that underlie the association between census tract-level socioeconomic measures and MRSA incidence, which may include modifiable social (eg, poverty, crowding) and biological factors (not explored in this analysis), should be elucidated to define strategies for reducing racial disparities in community-associated MRSA rates.",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2017 Mar 1,United States,2017,10
29932474,Determinants of stakeholders' attitudes to xenotransplantation.,"BACKGROUND: Advances in xenotransplantation have the potential to resolve the issue of organ shortages. Despite this, the procedure is expected to meet with a degree of resistance from the public. The purpose of this study was to identify the relevant factors influencing stakeholders' attitudes towards xenotransplantation. METHODS: A multidimensional survey instrument measuring attitudes to xenotransplantation, including the factors that predict such attitudes, was developed based on earlier studies and validated. It was then completed by 469 respondents who were stratified in accordance with stakeholder groups in Malaysia. A single-step SEM analysis was then conducted to estimate the measurement and create a structural model using IBM SPSS Amos version 20 with a maximum-likelihood function. RESULTS: The attitudes of Malaysian stakeholders towards xenotransplantation were moderately positive (mean score of 4.20). The most important direct predictor of attitude to xenotransplantation was perceived benefit (beta = 0.59, P < .001) followed by perceived moral concern (beta = -0.32, P < .001). Perceived risk had a strong positive association with moral concern (beta = 0.65, P < .001), while attitude to nature had a positive association with perceived benefit (beta = 0.16, P < .01) and a negative association with perceived risk (beta = -0.19, P < .01). Religiosity had a positive relationship with perceived risk (beta = 0.13, P < .05) while engagement with biotechnology had a positive relationship with perceived benefits (beta = 0.26, P < .001) and a negative association with risks (beta = -0.15, P < .05) and moral issues (beta = -0.11, P < .05). CONCLUSION: The Malaysian stakeholders were cautious about xenotransplantation. This study showed that their views regarding the application are complex and multifaceted.",Xenotransplantation,2018 Nov,Denmark,2018,10
26269788,Shiraz medical students' perceptions of their colleagues' professional behavior.,"INTRODUCTION: Today, development of professionalism is a critical aim of medical schools. Studies have demonstrated that medical students' perceived level of professionalism is inadequate worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the medical students' perceptions of their colleagues' professional behavior. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study with 280 medical students at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in their fifth to seventh year of study as the sample. The study was performed during one month in 2013, using stratified random sampling method. The instrument of the study was the Persian version of the questionnaire of the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM).The questionnaire includes demographic information, questions about the meaning of the professionalism, history of medical ethics education programs and 12 behavioral questions. The data were analyzed using student t-test and Pearson correlation test. The significance level was set as 0.05. RESULTS: Forty percent of respondents did not know the meaning of professionalism. The mean+/-SD score of behavioral questions was 5.91+/-1.2 on a scale from 0 to 10. The mean+/-SD score of excellence questions was 4.94+/-1.7. It was 7.05+/-1.9 for 'honor/integrity', and 6.07+/-2.1 for 'altruism/respect' questions. There was a significant association between gender and excellence score (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Medical students assessed their colleagues' professional behavior as poor. They did not have proper information about professionalism. Medical students are future general practitioners and respecting medical ethics by them is very important in a perfect health system. Universities should emphasize the importance of teaching professionalism to medical students and faculty members, using innovative education methods.",Journal of advances in medical education & professionalism,2015 Jul,Iran,2015,10
23840753,Determinants of change in children's sedentary time.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the determinants of sedentary time during childhood contributes to the development of effective intervention programmes. PURPOSE: To examine family and home-environmental determinants of 1-year change in objectively measured sedentary time after-school and at the weekend. METHODS: Participants wore accelerometers at baseline and 1 year later. Longitudinal data for after-school and weekend analyses were available for 854 (41.5%male, mean +/- SD age 10.2 +/- 0.3 years) and 718 (41.8%male, age 10.2 +/- 0.3 years) participants. Information on 26 candidate determinants, including socioeconomic status (SES), availability of electronic media and parental rules for sedentary behaviours was self-reported by children or their parents at baseline. Change in the proportion of registered time spent sedentary was used as the outcome variable in multi-level linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and baseline sedentary time. Simple and multiple models were run and interactions with sex explored. RESULTS: Children from higher socioeconomic status families exhibited greater increases in after-school (beta; 95% CI for change in % time spent sedentary 1.02; 0.37, 1.66) and weekend (1.42; 0.65, 2.18) sedentary time. Smaller increases in after-school sedentary time were observed in children with more siblings (-1.00; -1.69, -0.30), greater availability of electronic media (-0.81; -1.29, -0.33) and, for boys, more frequent family visits to the park (-1.89; -3.28, -0.51) and family participation in sport (-1.28; -2.54, -0.02). Greater maternal weekend screen-time (0.45; 0.08, 0.83) and, in girls, greater parental restriction on playing outside (0.91; 0.08, 1.74) were associated with larger increases in weekend sedentary time. The analytical sample was younger, more likely to be female, had lower BMI and was of higher SES than the original baseline sample. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention strategies aimed at reducing parents' weekend screen-time, increasing family participation in sports or recreation (boys) and promoting freedom to play outside (girls) may contribute towards preventing the age-related increase in sedentary time.",PloS one,2013,United States,2013,10
31062253,Efficacy of duloxetine and gabapentin in pain reduction in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,"INTRODUCTION: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common form of arthritis in elders which can lead to reduced daily activity and quality of life. It is important to administer a proper treatment with high efficacy and low side effects. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of duloxetine and gabapentin in patients with moderate to severe knee OA. METHOD: In this randomized clinical trial, 150 patients with moderate to severe knee OA were randomly allocated to receive duloxetine 30 mg (n = 50), gabapentin 300 mg (n = 50), or acetaminophen 1000 mg (n = 50) all twice a day for 12 weeks. Pain severity using visual analogue scale (VAS) and functional status using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were measured before, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after intervention. RESULTS: WOMAC total and its subscale score were significantly lower in duloxetine compared to gabapentin in 2 weeks and 1 months after intervention, with no significant difference at the end of the third month. Both gabapentin and duloxetine groups had significantly more reduction in pain VAS and WOMAC and its subscales compared to acetaminophen group, with no significant difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both gabapentin and duloxetine have similar and acceptable effects in pain reduction and improvement of functional status in patients with knee OA at the end of the third month's treatment. Duloxetine effects begin from the first weeks, while gabapentin effects begin gradually with the best at the end of the third month. KEY POINTS: * Medical treatment is used for releiving pain in knee osteoarthritis. * Gabapentin and duloxetine are both effective in reducing pain in knee osteoarthritis.",Clinical rheumatology,2019 Oct,Germany,2019,10
27558902,Methods for a longitudinal cohort of refugee children in a regional community in Australia.,"PURPOSE: Few studies explore the long-term health and well-being of refugee children. A longitudinal cohort of refugee children was created to determine health and well-being outcomes over time. This article describes the methodology used to conduct this study, including sample characteristics and effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies. PARTICIPANTS: Newly arrived refugee children settling in a regional part of Australia aged 6 months to 15 years were recruited between 2009 and 2013 and 85% were followed for an average of 31 months. METHOD AND DESIGN: General practitioners conducted health and pathology examinations shortly after arrival. Additional follow-up assessments were conducted by the research team at an average of 13 months after arrival for the first (year 2) and 31 months for the second (year 3) assessment. Children under 5 years had developmental and children aged 4-17 years had social-emotional screening. Families were assessed for risk and protective factors using a structured interview and the Social Readjustment Ratings Scale. Parent experience of the research was explored. FINDINGS TO DATE: Eligibility criteria were met by 158 of 228 (69%) newly arrived children, 61 of whom (39%) were enrolled. Retention was 100% (n=61) at year 2 and 85% at year 3. The study sample was younger than and had an over-representation of African refugees as compared to the eligible population. Parents reported that the research was respectful. FUTURE PLANS: This study demonstrates that a longitudinal cohort study in refugee children is feasible and acceptable, and retention rates can be high. The establishment of this cohort provides the opportunity to analyse valuable data about the early settlement experience, risk and protective factors and long-term health and well-being outcomes in refugee children. These are necessary to identify refugee children in need of additional support and to guide future service delivery.",BMJ open,2016 Aug 24,England,2016,10
30004138,"Differential impact of socioeconomic position across life on oral cancer risk in Kerala, India: An investigation of life-course models under a time-varying framework.","OBJECTIVES: The incidence of oral cancer has been rapidly increasing in India, calling for evidence contributing to a deeper understanding of its determinants. Although disadvantageous life-course socioeconomic position (SEP) is independently associated with the risk of these cancers, the explanatory mechanisms remain unclear. Possible pathways may be better understood by testing which life-course model most influences oral cancer risk. We estimated the association between life-course SEP and oral cancer risk under three life-course models: critical period, accumulation and social mobility. METHODS: We recruited incident oral cancer cases (N = 350) and controls (N = 371) frequency-matched by age and sex from two main referral hospitals in Kozhikode, Kerala, India, between 2008 and 2012. We collected information on childhood (0-16 years), early adulthood (17-30 years) and late adulthood (above 30 years) SEP and behavioural factors along the life span using interviews and a life-grid technique. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for the association between life-course SEP and oral cancer risk using inverse probability weighted marginal structural models. RESULTS: Relative to an advantageous SEP in childhood and early adulthood, a disadvantageous SEP was associated with oral cancer risk [(OR = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.99, 3.81) and (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.79), respectively]. In addition, participants who were in a disadvantageous (vs advantageous) SEP during all three periods of life had an increased oral cancer risk (OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 2.61, 9.06). The childhood to early adulthood social mobility model and overall life-course trajectories indicated strong influence of exposure to disadvantageous SEP in childhood on the risk for oral cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Using novel approaches to existing methods, our study provides empirical evidence that disadvantageous childhood SEP is critical for oral cancer risk in this population from Kerala, India.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,2018 Dec,Denmark,2018,10
29588824,The status and predictors of hypertension preventive nutritional behaviors in adolescents based on the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior.,"Background: Malnutrition is an important factor affecting hypertensive incidence. Since the unhealthiest nutritional behaviors are rooted in childhood attitudes and experiences, applying educational interventions to these age groups will be most useful in the formation of preventive nutritional behaviors. Objective: To determine the predictive power of the TPB on hypertension in junior high-school students. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 160 junior high-school students in Kashmar, Iran in academic year commencing 2-13-2014, selected through random sampling. The participants completed a researcher-made questionnaire consisting of a demographic information form and a section to evaluate the constructs of the TPB. The data collected were analyzed in SPSS-16 using the correlation Wilcoxon statistics test, the one-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression analysis. Results: The mean age of the students was 13.51. A total of 47% of the students had snacked on potato chips and cheese puffs, 45% had eaten high-fat foods and 51.2% had eaten cookies and chocolates within the past week. The variable of behavioral intention predicted 32% of the variations in preventive nutritional behaviors by itself. The Pearson product-moment correlation analysis found that hypertension preventive nutritional behaviors were significantly correlated with attitude (p<0.001, r=0.38), perceived behavioral control (p<0.001, r=0.38), and behavioral intention. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between subjective norms and attitude (p<0.028, r=0.173), perceived behavioral control and attitude (p<0.003, r=0.231), behavioral intention and attitude (p<0.001, r=0.370), behavioral intention and subjective norms (p<0.030, r=0.171) and between behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control (p<0.001, r=0.484). Conclusion: The examined students revealed an adequate adherence to preventive nutritional behaviors. Nutrition education interventions should be developed based on variables such as behavioral intention and its determinants, i.e. attitude, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms.",Electronic physician,2018 Jan,Iran,2018,10
24812484,Comparing responsible and non-responsible drivers to assess determinants of road traffic collisions: time to standardise and revisit.,"OBJECTIVES: In 1994, Robertson and Drummer formalised the responsibility analysis as an alternative to case-control studies in the study of road traffic crashes. Our objective was to assess whether published responsibility studies respected standards defining adequate case-control studies. SETTING: Using Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar, we identified responsibility studies indexed until October 2013, which cited Robertson and Drummer's paper. After reviewing titles, abstracts and reference lists, we selected original studies comparing responsible and non-responsible drivers, published in peer-reviewed journals or proceedings. DATA AND ANALYSIS: We applied a grid to judge the conformity of the responsibility assessment to the original definition, and whether methods addressing representativeness of selection, accuracy of measures of exposures, confounding variables, and power met standards defining adequate case-control studies. RESULTS: Of 205 titles, we identified 20 papers. Methods of responsibility assessment were the original in three papers. Variations across studies concerned the number of mitigating factors included, or the use of questionnaires rather than police data (n=3). The ratio responsible/non-responsible drivers varied from 0.90 to 5.31, due to major variations in sampling methods, threshold selection, and data completeness. Selection or measurement issues were discussed in 13 papers, but seldom addressed in the design. A comparison of confounding factors in responsible and non-responsible drivers was presented in five papers. CONCLUSIONS: Basic requirements of case-control studies are often not or not clearly met in responsibility studies. There is a need to revisit the method and to adapt existing publication standards to the way responsibility studies are reported.",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,2014 Dec,England,2014,10
22688344,"Neighborhood safety as a correlate of tobacco use in a sample of urban, pregnant women.","OBJECTIVES: Environmental context has been increasingly recognized as an important determinant of health behavior. This study examined the effects of self-reported neighborhood violence and perceived safety on tobacco use in a sample of low-income, pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women (N=1521) being treated at an urban emergency room completed a baseline interview where neighborhood safety (self-reported neighborhood violence and perceived safety) as well as individual (demographics, depression symptoms, stress, tobacco use, substance abuse) and social variables (prenatal social environment and number of close friends) were evaluated cross-sectionally. Tobacco use was measured again in a telephone interview at 22 weeks gestation. RESULTS: In a logistic regression model of baseline smoking status, self-reported neighborhood violence was significantly associated with being a smoker independent of age, education status, attendance to prenatal care, gestational age and lifetime use of cocaine and marijuana. In a regression model estimating the relationship between these baseline variables and continued prenatal smoking, baseline smoking emerged as the strongest correlate of continued smoking during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that self-reported neighborhood violence had a stronger association with early pregnancy cigarette use compared to ongoing cigarette use in a sample of low-income, pregnant women. Prospective trials are needed to fully elucidate the relationship between individual and social-environmental determinants of tobacco use in this high-risk population.",Addictive behaviors,2012 Oct,England,2012,10
22020911,Epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Slovak Republic.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The prevalence of H. pylori differs significantly both between and within countries. In general infection correlates inversely to socioeconomic conditions. The aim of our study was to asses the prevalence and social determinants of H. pylori in a sample of Slovak population aged 18+ years by means of 13C-urea breath test (UBT). METHODOLOGY: Participants were randomly chosen according to their workplace. Balanced distribution by county was not a condition. H. pylori status was investigated by means of UBT. Cut-off for negativity of H. pylori for delta over baseline (DOB) was 3.5. Participants' health status and social characteristics were based on data from self-completed questionnaires. RESULTS: Epidemiological research was done on sample of 1838 responders (39% men, 61% women). Responders had in 6% basic general education, in 41% high school education, in 53% academic education. In 645 responders (35%) the UBT was positive. Most frequent indicated complaints were meteorism, nausea and pyrosis (26%, 20% and 18%). By comparing the data from questionnaires we found only statistical significant results showing an increase of H. pylori infection by age. All the results of our study were statistical non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the overall current prevalence of H. pylori in the Slovak republic was 35%.",Hepato-gastroenterology,2012 May,Greece,2012,10
24717400,"Attitudes toward menopause among middle-aged women in Semnan, Iran.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The menopause marks a major biological transition in the lives of all women. Understanding the attitude of women about menopause facilitates the implementation of public health policies that focus on improving women's health. This study was designed to determine the attitude of a group of Iranian women toward menopause with respect to sociodemographic variables and menopausal status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Primary Health Centers of Semnan during 2012. A total of 747 women aged 45-60 years were interviewed. Sociodemographic characteristics and attitude toward menopause were collected through a structured pretested questionnaire. The attitude scale consisted of 17 questions, each rated on a five-point Likert scale with a total score of 85 points. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age of women was 51.3 (+/-4.5) years. Women were classified as premenopausal (38.4%), perimenopausal (16.9%), and postmenopausal (44.8%). The majority of respondents (63.5%) were illiterate or have had low level of education (<9 years), and 86.3% were unemployed. The mean (+/-SD) attitude score was 53.3 (+/-6.8). Most of the women (71%) had neutral attitude, 22.8% had positive, and only 6.3% had negative attitude toward menopause. Menopausal status, educational level, marital status, place of residency, and employment were not associated with women's attitude. CONCLUSION: In general, women's attitude toward menopause ranged from neutral to positive. The attitude did not differ significantly on the basis of menopausal status, educational level, marital status, place of residency, and employment.",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,2014 Apr,England,2014,10
31696088,Development and psychometric assessment of the sexual health education necessity scale: An exploratory mixed method study.,"Background: Sexual health education is a controversial issue within the Iranian context. Thus, the present study was conducted to explore the necessity of sex education among young single women and develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Sexual Health Education Necessity Scale. Methods: This was an exploratory mixed method study. Young single women (51 women in the first phase and 110 women in the second phase of the study) aged 18-34 years were recruited in the study. In the first phase, qualitative methods were applied to generate items. In the second phase, psychometric properties, such as face, content, and construct validity, and reliability of the Sexual Health Education Necessity Scale were evaluated. In the first phase, an item pool was developed that included 17 statements related to sexual health education necessity. In the second phase, item reduction was applied using exploratory factor analysis and the final version of the questionnaire containing 9 items was developed. Also, content, face, and construct validity were assessed. Moreover, Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest were calculated to evaluate the reliability of the questionnaire. SPSS software (version 21) was used for data analysis and p value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: In the qualitative phase, 4 key themes emerged regarding sex education, which included the effects of sex education, principles of sex education, content of sex education, and organizations responsible for sex education. An item pool containing 17 statements was generated and used for psychometric evaluation. The results of the exploratory factor analysis showed a 2-factor solution for the scale, which collectively accounted for the 56.04% of the variance. Final CVR and CVI were found to be 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest of the instrument was found to be 0.78 and 0.80, respectively. Conclusion: Sexual Health Education Necessity Scale can be used for exploring dominant beliefs that may be obstacles for providing sex education in conservative societies; therefore, correcting these beliefs could help to design an appropriate sexual health education program.",Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,2019,Iran,2019,10
29555691,Emotional Health Among Youth Experiencing Family Homelessness.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Youth who are homeless with adult family members comprise 37% of the US homeless population, yet mental health among this group has not yet been well described. We aimed to compare the risk of suicidality, and factors that may protect against it, between family-homeless and nonhomeless youth. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data, representing 62 034 eighth- to 12th-graders, to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of emotional distress, self-injury, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide in the past 12 months for youth who experienced family homelessness in the past 12 months compared with housed youth, controlling for covariates. We then tested whether developmental assets moderated these outcomes. RESULTS: Four percent (n = 4594) of youth (mean age 14.9 years) were homeless with an adult family member. Among these, 29.1% (n = 1317; aOR: 2.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.34-2.69) reported self-injury, 21% (n = 940; aOR: 2.30, 95% CI: 2.14-2.48) reported suicidal ideation, and 9.3% (n = 416; aOR: 3.24, 95% CI: 2.91-3.60) reported suicide attempts. Developmental assets decreased the odds of these outcomes for all youth but were less protective for homeless youth. CONCLUSIONS: Youth experiencing recent family homelessness are at higher risk of suicidality than their nonhomeless peers, suggesting homelessness itself as a marker of risk. Factors that protect emotional health are less impactful among youth experiencing recent family homelessness. Thus, interventions among homeless youth may need to address social determinants of health such as stable housing and adversity in addition to developmental assets.",Pediatrics,2018 Apr,United States,2018,10
31200705,Determinants of the quality of care relationships in long-term care - a participatory study.,"BACKGROUND: The quality of the care relationship between a client and a professional is important in long-term care, as most clients depend on support for a lengthy period. The three largest client groups who receive long-term care in the Netherlands are older adults who are physically or mentally frail, people with mental health problems and people with intellectual disabilities. There is little clarity about how generic and variable the determinants of the quality of care relationships are across these client groups. The aim of this study is to explore and compare the determinants of the quality of care relationships in these three client groups in long-term care. METHODS: This participatory study involving clients as co-researchers was held in three healthcare organizations, each providing long-term care to one client group. The research was conducted by three teams consisting of researchers and co-researchers. We interviewed clients individually and professionals in focus groups. The focus was on care relationships with professionals where there is weekly recurring contact for at least 3 months. Clients and professionals were selected using a convenience sample. The interviews were coded in open, axial and selective coding. The outcomes were compared between the client groups. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 30 clients and 29 professionals. Determinants were categorized into four levels: client, professional, between client and professional, and context. The findings show that the majority of the determinants apply to the care relationships within all three client groups. At the professional level, eleven generic determinants were found. Eight determinants emerged at the client level of which two were found in two client groups only. At the level between a client and a professional, six determinants were found of which one applied to mental healthcare and disability care only. Five determinants were found at the contextual level of which two were specific for two client groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study yielded a variety of determinants that came to the fore in all three client groups in long-term care. This suggests that including a homogenous client group from a single care setting is not necessary when studying the quality of long-term care relationships.",BMC health services research,2019 Jun 14,England,2019,10
25881160,Inequality in oral health related to early and later life social conditions: a study of elderly in Norway and Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: A life course perspective recognizes influences of socially patterned exposures on oral health across the life span. This study assessed the influence of early and later life social conditions on tooth loss and oral impacts on daily performances (OIDP) of people aged 65 and 70 years. Whether social inequalities in oral health changed after the usual age of retirement was also examined. In accordance with ""the latent effect life course model"", it was hypothesized that adverse early-life social conditions increase the risk of subsequent tooth loss and impaired OIDP, independent of later-life social conditions. METHODS: Data were obtained from two cohorts studies conducted in Sweden and Norway. The 2007 and 2012 waves of the surveys were used for the present study. Early-life social conditions were measured in terms of gender, education and country of birth, and later-life social conditions were assessed by working status, marital status and size of social network. Logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to analyse the data. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to adjust estimates for missing responses and loss to follow-up. RESULTS: Early-life social conditions contributed to tooth loss and OIDP in each survey year and both countries independent of later-life social conditions. Lower education correlated positively with tooth loss, but did not influence OIDP. Foreign country of birth correlated positively with oral impacts in Sweden only. Later-life social conditions were the strongest predictors of tooth loss and OIDP across survey years and countries. GEE revealed significant interactions between social network and survey year, and between marital status and survey year on tooth loss. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the latent effect life course model in that early and later life social conditions had independent effects on tooth loss and OIDP among the elderly in Norway and Sweden. Between age 65 and 70, inequalities in tooth loss related to marital status declined, and inequalities related to social network increased.",BMC oral health,2015 Feb 10,England,2015,10
27098976,Determinants of prompt and adequate care among presumed malaria cases in a community in eastern Rwanda: a cross sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: In order to understand factors influencing fever/malaria management practices among community-based individuals, the study evaluated psychosocial, socio-demographic and environmental determinants of prompt and adequate healthcare-seeking behaviours. METHODS: A quantitative household (HH) survey was conducted from December 2014 to February 2015 in Ruhuha sector, Bugesera district in the Eastern province of Rwanda. HHs that reported having had at least one member who experienced a fever and/or malaria episode in the previous 3 months prior to the study were included in the analysis. Healthcare-seeking behaviours associated with the last episode of illness were analysed. Socio-demographic, health facility access, long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs), data on malaria knowledge, data and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) related variables (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control) with regard to fever/malaria healthcare seeking, were collected. The primary outcome was prompt and adequate care defined as: (1) seeking advice or treatment at a health facility (health centre or hospital) or from a community health worker (CHW); (2) advice or treatment seeking within same/next day of symptoms onset; (3) received a laboratory diagnosis; (4) received advice or treatment; and, (5) reported completing the prescribed dose of medication. Determinants of prompt and adequate care among presumed malaria cases were evaluated using a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 302 (21 %) of the 1410 interviewed HHs reported at least one member as having experienced a fever or malaria within the 3 months prior to the survey. The number of HHs (where at least one member reported fever/malaria) that reported seeking advice or treatment at a health facility (health centre or hospital) or from a CHW was 249 (82.4 %). Of those who sought advice or treatment, 87.3 % had done so on same/next day of symptoms developing, 82.8 % received a laboratory diagnosis, and more than 90 % who received treatment reported completing the prescribed dosage. Prompt and adequate care was reported from 162 of the 302 HHs (53.6 %) that experienced fever or malaria for one or more HH members. Bivariate analyses showed that head of household (HoH)-related characteristics including reported knowledge of three or more malaria symptoms, having health insurance, being able to pay for medical services, use of LLINs the night before the survey, having a positive attitude, perceiving social support, as well as a high-perceived behavioural control with regard to healthcare seeking, were all significantly associated with prompt and adequate care. In the final logistic regression model, a high-perceived behavioural control (odds ratio (OR) 5.068, p = 0.042), having a health insurance (OR 2.410, p = 0.044) and having knowledge of malaria symptoms (OR 1.654, p = 0.049) significantly predicted prompt and adequate care. CONCLUSIONS: To promote prompt and adequate care seeking for malaria in the area, particular emphasis should be placed on community-focused strategies that promote early malaria symptom recognition, increased health insurance coverage and enhanced perceived behavioural control with regard to healthcare-seeking.",Malaria journal,2016 Apr 21,England,2016,10
30688817,Fostering Cross-Sector Partnerships: Lessons Learned From a Community Care Team.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe lessons learned during the development and implementation of a community care team (CCT) and the applicability of this model in movement toward cross-sector team-based care coordination. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: Primary care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Cross-sector CCTs composed of primary care and community service providers are a care coordination approach that attends to the individual's social determinants of health, enhances the individual's capacity to manage treatment and self-care demands of multiple chronic health conditions, improves the care experience, and impacts well-being. A collaborative CCT decreased the use of acute care services and the costs of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: As reported in this study, use of interprofessional collaborative health care teams in planning care and services for individuals is a standard of practice for case management. Cross-sector partnerships provide the opportunity to maximize the contributions of health care and community service providers that address both chronic health conditions and social determinants of health, minimize fragmentation and costs of care, and promote collaborative care coordination. Community care teams offer sophisticated care coordination not otherwise available to medically complex high-need individuals who require assistance in navigating the medical and financial systems that exist in health care today.",Professional case management,2019 Mar/Apr,United States,2019,10
31777338,Green spaces and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.,"BACKGROUND: Green spaces have been proposed to be a health determinant, improving health and wellbeing through different mechanisms. We aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence from longitudinal studies that have investigated green spaces and their association with all-cause mortality. We aimed to evaluate this evidence with a meta-analysis, to determine exposure-response functions for future quantitative health impact assessments. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies on green spaces and all-cause mortality. We searched for studies published and indexed in MEDLINE before Aug 20, 2019, which we complemented with an additional search of cited literature. We included studies if their design was longitudinal; the exposure of interest was measured green space; the endpoint of interest was all-cause mortality; they provided a risk estimate (ie, a hazard ratio [HR]) and the corresponding 95% CI for the association between green space exposure and all-cause mortality; and they used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as their green space exposure definition. Two investigators (DR-R and DP-L) independently screened the full-text articles for inclusion. We used a random-effects model to obtain pooled HRs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018090315. FINDINGS: We identified 9298 studies in MEDLINE and 13 studies that were reported in the literature but not indexed in MEDLINE, of which 9234 (99%) studies were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts and 68 (88%) of 77 remaining studies were excluded after assessment of the full texts. We included nine (12%) studies in our quantitative evaluation, which comprised 8 324 652 individuals from seven countries. Seven (78%) of the nine studies found a significant inverse relationship between an increase in surrounding greenness per 0.1 NDVI in a buffer zone of 500 m or less and the risk of all-cause mortality, but two studies found no association. The pooled HR for all-cause mortality per increment of 0.1 NDVI within a buffer of 500 m or less of a participant's residence was 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97; I(2), 95%). INTERPRETATION: We found evidence of an inverse association between surrounding greenness and all-cause mortality. Interventions to increase and manage green spaces should therefore be considered as a strategic public health intervention. FUNDING: World Health Organization.",The Lancet.

25403924,Relationships between actual and desired workplace characteristics and job satisfaction for community health workers in China: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Community health workers are the main providers of community health services in China and have been important in the process of health system reform that has been in place since 2009. Therefore, it is critical that healthcare managers and policy decision makers motivate current staff and improve their job satisfaction. This study examined workplace characteristics and their contribution to job satisfaction in community health workers in Heilongjiang Province, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 448 community health workers, from three cities in Heilongjiang province, was conducted between October 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012. Multistage sampling procedures were used to measure socioeconomic and demographic status, job satisfaction, and both actual and desired workplace characteristics. Factor analysis was conducted to determine the main factors contributing to workplace characteristics, and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the key determinants of job satisfaction. RESULTS: Eight groups of factors were identified as the most important workplace characteristics. These comprised system and policy; fringe benefits; work itself; work relationships; professional development; recognition; work environment; and remuneration. In all cases, all desired workplace characteristics were higher than the associated actual workplace characteristics. The main determinants of job satisfaction were occupation, years worked in health service institution, and five subscales representing the gap between desired and actual workplace characteristics, which were system and policy; fringe benefits; working relationship; professional development; and remuneration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that managers wishing to enhance job satisfaction should assess workplace characteristics comprehensively and design mechanisms that reduce the gap between actual and desired workplace characteristics.",BMC family practice,2014 Nov 18,England,2014,10
28733927,Nut intake and 5-year changes in body weight and obesity risk in adults: results from the EPIC-PANACEA study.,"PURPOSE: There is inconsistent evidence regarding the relationship between higher intake of nuts, being an energy-dense food, and weight gain. We investigated the relationship between nut intake and changes in weight over 5 years. METHODS: This study includes 373,293 men and women, 25-70 years old, recruited between 1992 and 2000 from 10 European countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Habitual intake of nuts including peanuts, together defined as nut intake, was estimated from country-specific validated dietary questionnaires. Body weight was measured at recruitment and self-reported 5 years later. The association between nut intake and body weight change was estimated using multilevel mixed linear regression models with center/country as random effect and nut intake and relevant confounders as fixed effects. The relative risk (RR) of becoming overweight or obese after 5 years was investigated using multivariate Poisson regressions stratified according to baseline body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: On average, study participants gained 2.1 kg (SD 5.0 kg) over 5 years. Compared to non-consumers, subjects in the highest quartile of nut intake had less weight gain over 5 years (-0.07 kg; 95% CI -0.12 to -0.02) (P trend = 0.025) and had 5% lower risk of becoming overweight (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.92-0.98) or obese (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.90-0.99) (both P trend <0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of nuts is associated with reduced weight gain and a lower risk of becoming overweight or obese.",European journal of nutrition,2018 Oct,Germany,2018,10
24885213,Social capital in association with health status of women in reproductive age: study protocol for a sequential explanatory mixed methods study.,"BACKGROUND: Women's health is a general health priority. Preserving and improving women's health is not only a basic human right, but it is also essential for the health of all nations. Women's health in Reproductive age affects long-term health of theirs, their family members, and community. Origins of health inequalities are very complicated. Health outcomes are influenced by biological, social and political factors, so to improve women's health it is necessary to recognize all these factors. Social capital is one of the social determinants of health that might play a considerable role in health inequalities. The association between social capital and health varies according on the sample studied, the type of health outcome and the context in which it is studied. This mixed methods study was designed to determine and explore of relationship between social capital and health status of women of reproductive age in Tehran (capital city of Iran) with its specific social-cultural characteristics. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is sequential explanatory mixed methods study, follow-up explanations variant, with two strands (phases). This design will be implemented in two distinct phases. The first phase is a population-based cross-sectional survey on 770 women of reproductive age residing in any of the 22 municipal districts across Tehran. Based on a need to further understand the quantitative results, researchers will implement a second qualitative phase that is designed to help explain the initial quantitative results. Finally, the researchers will present an interpretation about explanation of quantitative results using the qualitative data. DISCUSSION: This study promotes women's health by determining the priorities and designing evidence-based interventions founded on the basic and insightful information provided on social capital and the status of the health of women.",Reproductive health,2014 May 9,England,2014,10
29756635,Trends in the use of mammography for early breast cancer detection in Switzerland: Swiss Health Surveys 2007 and 2012.,"AIMS: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. We assessed changes in the use of breast cancer screening 2007-2012 in Switzerland, and associations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants. METHODS: We used the nationwide and representative data from the Swiss Health Surveys 2007 and 2012. We analysed the self-reported use of mammography in the last 12 months (proportion of population) among women aged 40-79 years, and opportunistic (without clinical symptoms, initiated by the woman or a physician) and programmatic screening mammography (as part of a systematic screening programme). We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses (presented as adjusted odds ratios, aORs). RESULTS: The use of any mammography in the last 12 months declined from 19.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.7-20.5%) in 2007 to 11.7% (95% CI 10.7-12.6%) in 2012. This decline was more pronounced in regions with a long-standing or no cantonal breast cancer screening programme (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.6, and aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.6, respectively), but remained relatively stable in regions with a recently introduced programme (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.3, p-value from test for interaction 0.01). Opportunistic screening dropped from 12.0% (95% CI 10.9-13.2%) in 2007 to 6.2% (95% CI 5.5-6.9%; p <0.001) in 2012, whereas the use of programmatic mammography remained stable at 3.1% (95% CI 2.6-3.7%). Use of any mammography was higher in women aged 50-69 years, residing in a region with a systematic screening programme in place, and women having a private hospital stay insurance, but was not associated with education level and non-Swiss citizenship. CONCLUSIONS: Overall attendance of breast cancer screening is low in Switzerland and decreased between 2007 and 2012, despite expanding cantonal mammography screening programmes. Many factors may have contributed to this decline, including the ongoing scientific and public debates on the value of breast cancer screening.",Swiss medical weekly,2018,Switzerland,2018,10
28799072,Cervical Cancer Literacy in Women of Reproductive Age and Its Related Factors.,"Cancer health literacy, which is the ability to search, understand, and use health information to make appropriate health decisions, plays an important role in the use of preventative and screening information. The present study aims to evaluate cervical cancer health literacy in women of reproductive age and its related factors. In this cross-sectional study, 231 women of reproductive age who referred to health centers of Khuzestan Province, Iran, were selected via convenience sampling. A valid and reliable measure was employed to collect information about various dimensions of cervical cancer health literacy, including having access to, reading, understanding, appraising, using, and communicating it. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS 16. Data analysis was conducted by independent sample t test, one-way ANOVA, Spearman's correlation, chi-square, and linear regression. The participants' average health literacy score was 97.88 +/- 12.7 (from 135 points), and 47.2% of the participants had limited health literacy. Health literacy was associated with education, employment, income, searching, mothers' and young friends' counseling, and duration of the study time (p < 0.05). In linear regression model, there was a significant association between income (p = 0.011), searching (p = 0.01), study time (p = 0.009), and young friends' counseling (p = 0.002) and cervical cancer literacy scores. In this study, no significant association was observed between age and health literacy. This study indicated that the cervical cancer literacy in women of reproductive age was not at good levels. Health workers should pay more attention to groups who are at greater risk of having low health literacy. Moreover, targeting and tailoring educational interventions with respect to different levels of cervical cancer literacy might increase cervical cancer screening.",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2019 Feb,England,2019,10
26551902,Commentary on: Are we overpathologizing everyday life? A tenable blueprint for behavioral addiction research. Addictions as a psychosocial and cultural construction.,"This commentary proposes a complementary perspective to that developed by Billieux, Schimmenti, Khazaal, Maurage and Heeren (2015). The addiction-as-disease approach tends to sideline explanatory factors of a psychosocial, cultural, political, or historical nature. I therefore suggest taking into account not only the personal characteristics (loss of self-control, impulsivity) related to the disease model, but also the social determinants of addictive behaviors (weak social ties, social exclusion, hyperindividualism, poverty, unemployment, etc.). Moreover, the disease model of addiction removes addictive behaviors from the cultural and historical contexts that shape them. I argue that the cultural and historical reasons for which certain factors (such as loss of self-control) became so important in the explanation of addictive behaviors should be more thoroughly considered.",Journal of behavioral addictions,2015 Sep,Hungary,2015,10
26969124,Utility of linking primary care electronic medical records with Canadian census data to study the determinants of chronic disease: an example based on socioeconomic status and obesity.,"BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) used in primary care contain a breadth of data that can be used in public health research. Patient data from EMRs could be linked with other data sources, such as a postal code linkage with Census data, to obtain additional information on environmental determinants of health. While promising, successful linkages between primary care EMRs with geographic measures is limited due to ethics review board concerns. This study tested the feasibility of extracting full postal code from primary care EMRs and linking this with area-level measures of the environment to demonstrate how such a linkage could be used to examine the determinants of disease. The association between obesity and area-level deprivation was used as an example to illustrate inequalities of obesity in adults. METHODS: The analysis included EMRs of 7153 patients aged 20 years and older who visited a single, primary care site in 2011. Extracted patient information included demographics (date of birth, sex, postal code) and weight status (height, weight). Information extraction and management procedures were designed to mitigate the risk of individual re-identification when extracting full postal code from source EMRs. Based on patients' postal codes, area-based deprivation indexes were created using the smallest area unit used in Canadian censuses. Descriptive statistics and socioeconomic disparity summary measures of linked census and adult patients were calculated. RESULTS: The data extraction of full postal code met technological requirements for rendering health information extracted from local EMRs into anonymized data. The prevalence of obesity was 31.6 %. There was variation of obesity between deprivation quintiles; adults in the most deprived areas were 35 % more likely to be obese compared with adults in the least deprived areas (Chi-Square = 20.24(1), p < 0.0001). Maps depicting spatial representation of regional deprivation and obesity were created to highlight high risk areas. CONCLUSIONS: An area based socio-economic measure was linked with EMR-derived objective measures of height and weight to show a positive association between area-level deprivation and obesity. The linked dataset demonstrates a promising model for assessing health disparities and ecological factors associated with the development of chronic diseases with far reaching implications for informing public health and primary health care interventions and services.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2016 Mar 11,England,2016,10
20929529,"Cardiovascular risk profile: cross-sectional analysis of motivational determinants, physical fitness and physical activity.","BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with physical fitness and, to a lesser extent, physical activity. Lifestyle interventions directed at enhancing physical fitness in order to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases should be extended. To enable the development of effective lifestyle interventions for people with cardiovascular risk factors, we investigated motivational, social-cognitive determinants derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and other relevant social psychological theories, next to physical activity and physical fitness. METHODS: In the cross-sectional Utrecht Police Lifestyle Intervention Fitness and Training (UP-LIFT) study, 1298 employees (aged 18 to 62) were asked to complete online questionnaires regarding social-cognitive variables and physical activity. Cardiovascular risk factors and physical fitness (peak VO2) were measured. RESULTS: For people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (78.7% of the total population), social-cognitive variables accounted for 39% (p < .001) of the variance in the intention to engage in physical activity for 60 minutes every day. Important correlates of intention to engage in physical activity were attitude (beta = .225, p < .001), self-efficacy (beta = .271, p < .001), descriptive norm (beta = .172, p < .001) and barriers (beta = -.169, p < .01). Social-cognitive variables accounted for 52% (p < .001) of the variance in physical active behaviour (being physical active for 60 minutes every day). The intention to engage in physical activity (beta = .469, p < .001) and self-efficacy (beta = .243, p < .001) were, in turn, important correlates of physical active behavior.In addition to the prediction of intention to engage in physical activity and physical active behavior, we explored the impact of the intensity of physical activity. The intensity of physical activity was only significantly related to physical active behavior (beta = .253, p < .01, R2 = .06, p < .001). An important goal of our study was to investigate the relationship between physical fitness, the intensity of physical activity and social-cognitive variables. Physical fitness (R2 = .23, p < .001) was positively associated with physical active behavior (beta = .180, p < .01), self-efficacy (beta = .180, p < .01) and the intensity of physical activity (beta = .238, p < .01).For people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors, 39.9% had positive intentions to engage in physical activity and were also physically active, and 10.5% had a low intentions but were physically active. 37.7% had low intentions and were physically inactive, and about 11.9% had high intentions but were physically inactive. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to our ability to optimize cardiovascular risk profiles by demonstrating an important association between physical fitness and social-cognitive variables. Physical fitness can be predicted by physical active behavior as well as by self-efficacy and the intensity of physical activity, and the latter by physical active behavior.Physical active behavior can be predicted by intention, self-efficacy, descriptive norms and barriers. Intention to engage in physical activity by attitude, self-efficacy, descriptive norms and barriers. An important input for lifestyle changes for people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors was that for ca. 40% of the population the intention to engage in physical activity was in line with their actual physical active behavior.",BMC public health,2010 Oct 7,England,2010,10
28734170,Web-based physical activity interventions: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVES: It was estimated that approximately 60% of the world's population is classified as inactive or insufficiently active. This meta-analysis investigated the effect of web-based interventions on different types of physical activity (PA) measurements in general population and potential moderating variables. STUDY DESIGN: PubMed, CINAHL, EBSCOhost, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid, and ScienceDirect literature searches were conducted to identify studies investigating the effect of web-based interventions on PA. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials on PA changes reported in moderate to vigorous intensity, walking, and step count in the intervention group in comparison with the control group were pooled with a fixed-effects model separately. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies comprising 16,476 and 14,475 subjects in intervention and control groups respectively were included. Web-based interventions had positive and significant effect on increasing PA. Of 14 trials reporting moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), five showed a significant increase in the MVPA level after the intervention. There was significant heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.001 and I(2) = 67.8%). Of six trials that reported the number of steps by using the pedometer, three showed a significant increase for the step counts in intervention groups (P < 0.001 and I(2) = 93.3%), of 14 trials assessed PA level by reporting walking minutes per week, four studies showed a significant increase in walking minutes. There was significant heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.001, I(2) = 68.1%). Overall, the effect of web-based interventions seemed to be influenced by the characteristics of mean age of participants, trial duration, and study quality (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The web-based PA interventions had a positive significant effect on increasing all the three types of PA among the general population. However, the effects appear to depend on the design of the study, age, and duration of studies.",Public health,2017 Nov,Netherlands,2017,10
22930369,Do you want to convince me or to be understood?: preference-consistent information sharing and its motivational determinants.,"In two experiments, we provide evidence for a fundamental discussion asymmetry, namely, preference-consistent information sharing. Despite being in a dyadic situation requiring open information exchange and being given no incentive to do so, participants communicated more information that supported their individually preferred decision alternative than information that contradicted it. Preference-consistent information sharing was not caused by biased recall and occurred in written as well as in face-to-face communication. Moreover, we tested whether preference-consistent information sharing was influenced by statements by bogus discussion partners indicating that they held a congruent versus incongruent preference to the participants' preference and that they understood versus did not understand the participants' preference. We found that when partners stated that they understood the participants' preference, subsequent preference-consistent information sharing was considerably reduced. This indicates that a motivation to be understood by others might be an important driving force underlying preference-consistent information sharing.",Personality & social psychology bulletin,2012 Dec,United States,2012,10
23185355,"Predictors of condom use behaviors based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) among female sex workers: a cross-sectional study in Hubei Province, China.","BACKGROUND: HIV infection related to commercial sexual contact is a serious public health issue in China. The objectives of the present study are to explore the predictors of condom use among female sex workers (FSWs) in China and examine the relationship between Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two cities (Wuhan and Suizhou) in Hubei Province, China, between July 2009 and June 2010. A total of 427 FSWs were recruited through mediators from the 'low-tier' entertainment establishments. Data were obtained by self-administered questionnaires. Structural equation models were constructed to examine the association. We collected 363 valid questionnaires. Within the context of HBM, perceived severity of HIV mediated through perceived benefits of condom use had a weak effect on condom use (r=0.07). Perceived benefits and perceived barriers were proximate determinants of condom use (r=0.23 and r=-0.62, respectively). Self-efficacy had a direct effect on perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, which was indirectly associated with condom use behaviors (r=0.36). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The HBM provides a useful framework for investigating predictors of condom use behaviors among FSWs. Future HIV prevention interventions should focus on increasing perceived benefits of condom use, reducing barriers to condoms use, and improving self-efficacy among FSWs.",PloS one,2012,United States,2012,10
31805886,"Social determinants of delivery mode in Jiangsu, China.","BACKGROUND: Less evidence exists regarding the association of social determinants and delivery mode in Jiangsu, and if the trend is influenced by the type of residence. This study aims to identify the significant social determinants of delivery mode, and also to compare the main differences in delivery mode between urban and rural areas. METHODS: We used data from the cross-sectional National Health Service Surveys conducted in Jiangsu Province in 2013. For the purposes of this study, information from women (15-64 years old) who had experienced childbirth the last 5 years were examined, and a total of 1365 participants were selected as research subjects. RESULTS: Participants using vaginal delivery mode and cesarean delivery mode were found in 616 (45.1%) and 751(54.9%) participants, respectively. The proportion of women using cesarean delivery was 53.5% in rural area and 58.2% in urban area. Meanwhile, our results showed that women in middle Jiangsu were more likely to use cesarean delivery, and cesarean delivery is more prevalent among richer women. We also find that the more use of prenatal care visit, the more use of cesarean delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This study validated the relationship between social determinants and the mode of delivery in Jiangsu province. Social determinants are contextual factors, which may vary by region and additional work is needed to fully understand these relationships globally. Further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms and pathways across various populations, and these social determinants should be incorporated into future multi-level interventions designed to decrease the cesarean delivery rate.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2019 Dec 5,England,2019,10
30862512,Screening for Social Determinants of Health in Pediatric Resident Continuity Clinic.,"OBJECTIVE: Describe current practices in systematic screening for social determinants of health (SDH) in pediatric resident clinics enrolled in the Continuity Research Network (CORNET). METHODS: CORNET clinic directors were surveyed on demographics, barriers to screening, and screening practices for 15 SDH, including the screen source, timing of screening, process of administering the screen, and personnel involved in screening. Incidence rate ratios were tabulated to investigate relationships among screening practices and clinic staff composition. RESULTS: Clinic response rate was 41% (65/158). Clinics reported screening for between 0 and 15 SDH (median, 7). Maternal depression (86%), child educational problems (84%), and food insecurity (71%) were the items most commonly screened. Immigration status (17%), parental health literacy (19%), and parental incarceration (21%) were least commonly screened. Within 3 years, clinics plan to screen for 25% of SDH not currently being screened. Barriers to screening included lack of time (63%), resources (50%), and training (46%). CONCLUSIONS: Screening for SDH in our study population of CORNET clinics is common but has not been universally implemented. Screening practices are variable and reflect the complex nature of screening, including the heterogeneity of the patient populations, the clinic staff composition, and the SDH encountered.",Academic pediatrics,2019 Nov - Dec,United States,2019,10
21592383,Canada's Compassionate Care Benefit: is it an adequate public health response to addressing the issue of caregiver burden in end-of-life care?,"BACKGROUND: An increasingly significant public health issue in Canada, and elsewhere throughout the developed world, pertains to the provision of adequate palliative/end-of-life (P/EOL) care. Informal caregivers who take on the responsibility of providing P/EOL care often experience negative physical, mental, emotional, social and economic consequences. In this article, we specifically examine how Canada's Compassionate Care Benefit (CCB)--a contributory benefits social program aimed at informal P/EOL caregivers--operates as a public health response in sustaining informal caregivers providing P/EOL care, and whether or not it adequately addresses known aspects of caregiver burden that are addressed within the population health promotion (PHP) model. METHODS: As part of a national evaluation of Canada's Compassionate Care Benefit, 57 telephone interviews were conducted with Canadian informal P/EOL caregivers in 5 different provinces, pertaining to the strengths and weaknesses of the CCB and the general caregiving experience. Interview data was coded with Nvivo software and emerging themes were identified by the research team, with such findings published elsewhere. The purpose of the present analysis was identified after comparing the findings to the literature specific to caregiver burden and public health, after which data was analyzed using the PHP model as a guiding framework. RESULTS: Informal caregivers spoke to several of the determinants of health outlined in the PHP model that are implicated in their burden experience: gender, income and social status, working conditions, health and social services, social support network, and personal health practises and coping strategies. They recognized the need for improving the CCB to better address these determinants. CONCLUSIONS: This study, from the perspective of family caregivers, demonstrates that the CCB is not living up to its full potential in sustaining informal P/EOL caregivers. Effort is required to transform the CCB so that it may fulfill the potential it holds for serving as one public health response to caregiver burden that forms part of a healthy public policy that addresses the determinants of this burden.",BMC public health,2011 May 18,England,2011,10
22267320,Provision of support strategies and services: results from an internet-based survey of community-based breastfeeding counselors.,"This study examined the determinants of support strategies and services provided by community-based breastfeeding counselors (CBBCs) and compared differences in extent of support provided by paid and volunteer counselors. Participants (N = 847) in this internet-based survey were mostly White/Caucasian (74.9%), college-educated (59.0%), and paid CBBCs (63.8%). The majority (75.9%) of volunteer CBBCs compared with their paid full-time (52.1%) and paid part-time (47.4%) counterparts had completed college. Being a full-time paid compared with volunteer/unpaid CBBC was associated with face-to-face counseling (OR = 3.69; 95% CI: 1.93, 7.06), use of client-centered counseling skills (OR = 6.23; 95% CI: 3.40, 11.45), making referrals to social service agencies (OR = 13.18; 95% CI: 6.86, 25.32), and helping position baby (OR = 3.77; 95% CI: 1.64, 8.69). Because of the disparities in CBBC usage of breastfeeding support strategies and continuing education between paid and volunteer CBBCs, there is a need to examine differences in training curricula and determine the facilitators and barriers of continuing education.",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,2012 Feb,United States,2012,10
27281346,"The feeding-nutrition connection, three aspects for its understanding.","Feeding is not an isolated concept; it is linked to biological, psychological, cultural, political and economic determinants. Physiologically the meeting of the biological need is very important, but when a group is subjected to a diet that only satisfies hunger and does not provide for nutrients, chronic deficient nutritional stages appear that impact social welfare and health. In this paper, we present three instances of nutritional problems that affect the Mexican population: child malnourishment, obesity and food security. This article exposes some of its social determinants and public policies that address them considering the collective health and its sociology, in the context of social inequality. We highlight the need for public policies that consider social inclusion, for the collective food security, and not merely the pursuit of satisfying hunger, but also to have an accessible, nutritious, and varied diet to prevent alterations in the health of the people.",Medwave,2016 Apr 12,Chile,2016,10
31465696,"Discontinuation of Exclusive Breastfeeding in Ghana: A Longitudinal, One-Group Observational Study of Postnatal Mothers With Children 0-6 Months old.","BACKGROUND: Although exclusive breastfeeding of infants has several benefits, in Ghana only 52% of children under 6 months old are breastfed exclusively. However, researchers have not conducted longitudinal observational studies to examine exclusive breastfeeding discontinuation and determine risk factors. RESEARCH AIMS: (1) To determine exclusive breastfeeding discontinuation, and (2) to examine those factors linked to discontinued exclusive breastfeeding. METHODS: A longitudinal, one-group observational study was conducted. A total of 322 mothers who had normal and full-term delivery at a district level referral hospital from January to December 2017 were recruited, followed-up every month, and subsequently interviewed after 6 months postpartum. Data were collected using validated questionnaires. Binary and multivariable Poisson regression analyses were the statistical analytical methods used. RESULTS: Respondents' mean age was 29.78 years (SD = 5.20). Among the 322 mothers who initiated breastfeeding with human milk at birth, 108 (34%) discontinued exclusive breastfeeding before 6 months postpartum. After controlling for possible covariates, attending antenatal care 4 or less times during pregnancy (aRR = 6.54; 95% CI [1.77-24.22]; p = .005); lack of support from family to breastfeed exclusively (aRR = 2.41; 95% CI [1.23-4.71]; p = .010), outside pressure to provide other food to the baby < 6 months postpartum (aRR = 1.87; 95% CI [1.01-3.46]; p = .045), and living in an urban area (aRR = 2.10; 95% CI [1.17-3.75]; p = .013) significantly increased the risks of discontinuing exclusive breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: Universal exclusive breastfeeding may not be achieved without tackling the key determinants of discontinuation of exclusive breastfeeding. Health facility and community-based exclusive breastfeeding promotion interventions are therefore needed.",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,2019 Aug 29,United States,2019,10

30525004,"HORMONAL PARAMETERS AND SEMEN MICROBIOLOGICAL PATTERN OF INFERTILE MALES: A COMPARATIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN BENIN CITY, SOUTH SOUTH NIGERIA.","Background: In many Nigerian studies, male factors were responsible for up to 50 to 70% of infertility. Aim: To evaluate the contribution of endocrinopathy and bacteriospermia to male infertility in Benin. Study design: A comparative cross-sectional study. Setting: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Central Hospital, Benin City. Methodology: Male partners of 355 couples who presented with infertility over 8 months were studied. The data collected included socio-demographics, clinical features, hormonal assays, semen analysis, and semen culture. These were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21.0, employing both univariate and bivariate analyses, and multivariate logistic regression to identify independent determinants of abnormal semen analysis. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 34.98+/-4.67 years and mean duration of infertility was 4.5+/-2.17 years. A total of 59.7% patients were of low socioeconomic status. The participants had at least a primary school education, and 81.7% dwelt in the urban areas of the state. Secondary infertility was the commonest (82.3%); while 56.6% of the subjects were overweight and 14.9% obese. 66.5% of participants had abnormal semen parameters. Oligospermia was the commonest (22.8%) abnormality. The commonest hormonal disorders were abnormality of luteinizing hormone (79.1%) and follicle stimulating hormones (26.8%). There was positive semen culture in 162(43.6%) of participants, of which 135(83.3%) had abnormal semen analysis (p=0.000). Men with positive semen culture had more than four-fold odds of having abnormal semen analysis (OR=4.554; 95%CI=2.761-7.513). Conclusion: This study has shown that male endocrinopathy and bacteriospermia contributed significantly to male infertility in our environment.",Journal of the West African College of Surgeons,2017 Jul-Sep,Nigeria,2017,10
31516685,A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis on the Prevalence of HBsAg in Health Care Workers from Eastern Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Countries.,"Background: The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of HBsAg in Health Care Workers (HCWs) in Eastern Mediterranean Region Office (EMRO) and Middle Eastern countries from 2000 to 2016. Methods: In a meta-analysis study, the databases of PubMed, ISI, Ovid, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Persian databases were searched for relevant articles on the prevalence of HBsAg in HCWs in EMRO and Middle Eastern countries. Homogeneity was assessed based on Cochran's Q-test results. Results: A total of 43 articles (110,179 people) were included. The pooled prevalence of HBsAg in HCWs of EMRO and Middle East countries was found 2.77% (95%CI: 2.64-2.83). The specific prevalence of HBsAg was 2.84% (95% CI: 2.6-3.11) in EMRO and 2.22% (95%CI: 2.13-2.31) in Middle Eastern countries. The highest and lowest prevalence rates of HBsAg among HCWs for countries with more than one study were 6.85% (95% CI: 5.74%-8.16%) in Sudan and 1.00% (95% CI: 0.94%-1.07%) in Turkey, respectively. The trends of HBsAg prevalence among HCWs decreased from 2000 to 2016. Conclusions: Based on the World Health Organization classification of HBV prevalence, intermediate HBsAg prevalence rates were detected in HCWs of EMRO and Middle East countries during 2000-2016.",International journal of preventive medicine,2019,Iran,2019,10
31011549,Data on THMs concentration and spatial trend in water distribution network (a preliminary study in center of Iran).,"The Trihalomethanes (THMs) formed due to a reaction between water disinfection chlorine and some natural organic matters, as chlorinated by products. The aim of this study was determination of THMs values and spatial trend in Yazd city water distribution network, in center of Iran. Sampling of tap water was done in two autumn and winter seasons. The THMs value were measured by using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS), Agilent Company 6890 N. The spatial analysis of THMs values was carried out using ArcGIS 10.1 to show the spatial spreading. The Kriging method was used to draw distribution maps. Using the Kriging method to illustrate the difference or precision of forecasts is relatively easy compared to the other interpolation methods. Also, the acceptable level of % RMSE (Root mean square error) was calculated for Kriging method (% RMSE > 40). Thus, this protocol as integrated between data and geraphic could easily used for reporting of THMs level in studies of water distribution network. Finally, the maximum THMs value were obtained lower than USEPA and WHO guidelines for drinking water (THMs < 40 ppb).",MethodsX,2019,Netherlands,2019,10
23618114,Health-related quality of life of Canadian Forces veterans after transition to civilian life.,"OBJECTIVES: Describe health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of former Canadian Forces (CF) men and women in uniform (Veterans) after transition to civilian life, and compare to age- and sex-adjusted Canadian norms. METHODS: The 2010 Survey on Transition to Civilian Life was a national computer-assisted telephone survey of CF Regular Force personnel who released during 1998-2007. HRQoL was assessed using the SF-12 Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Summary scores. Descriptive analysis of HRQoL was conducted for socio-demographic, health, disability and determinants of health characteristics. RESULTS: Mean age was 46 years (range 20-67). Compared to age- and sex-adjusted Canadian averages, PCS (47.3) was low and MCS was similar (52.0). PCS and MCS were variably below average for middle age groups and lowest for non-commissioned ranks, widowed/divorced/separated, 10-19 years of service, physical and mental health conditions, disability, dissatisfaction with finances, seeking work/not working, low social support and difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Among Veterans Affairs Canada clients, 83% had below-average physical PCS, 49% had below-average MCS, and mean PCS (38.2) was significantly lower than mean MCS (48.3). CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL varied across a range of biopsychosocial factors, suggesting possible protective factors and vulnerable subgroups that may benefit from targeted interventions. These findings will be of interest to agencies supporting Veterans in transition to civilian life and to researchers developing hypotheses to better understand well-being in Canadian Veterans.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2013 Jan 7,Switzerland,2013,10
30744419,Psychometric Evaluation of the Persian eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) Among Elder Iranians With Heart Failure.,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) using classical test theory and modern test theory among elderly Iranian individuals with heart failure (HF). Individuals with objectively verified HF ( n = 388, 234 males, mean age = 68.9 +/- 3.4) completed the (i) eHEALS, (ii) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, (iii) Short Form 12, (iv) 9-item European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale, and (v) 5-item Medication Adherence Report Scale. Two types of analyses were carried out to evaluate the factorial structure of the eHEALS: (i) confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in classical test theory and (ii) Rasch analysis in modern test theory. A regression model was constructed to examine the associations between eHEALS and other instruments. CFA supported the one-factor structure of the eHEALS with significant factor loadings for all items. Rasch analysis also supported the unidimensionality of the eHEALS with item fit statistics ranging between 0.5 and 1.5. The eHEALS was significantly associated with all the external criteria. The eHEALS is suitable for health-care providers to assess eHealth literacy for individuals with HF.",Evaluation & the health professions,2019 Feb 11,United States,2019,10
29388465,Understanding the Impact of Fibromyalgia on Men: Findings From a Nationwide Survey.,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a serious condition that affects approximately four million people in the United States, and is underdiagnosed in men. The objective of this study was to understand this phenomenon by examining multiple impacts of fibromyalgia on men in regard to interactions in society and the U.S. health system. A qualitative survey was administered to 1,163 respondents both online and in-person in Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, DC. Thematic analyses of the survey responses suggest that men with FM have negative experiences with (1) physical and mental health, (2) quality of life, (3) relationships, and (4) careers as a result of FM. Interactions with health-care providers were deterred by (1) potential for misdiagnosis or dismissal of symptoms, (2) stigma of having a condition primarily affecting women, (3) differences in treatment of men and women with FM, and (4) need for health education resources. These findings dictate a need to improve communication between health-care providers and male FM patients.",American journal of men's health,2018 Jul,United States,2018,10
27763839,Individual- and community-level determinants of Inuit youth mental wellness.,"OBJECTIVES: Following the onset of intensive colonial intervention and rapid social change in the lives of Inuit people, youth in Nunavik have experienced high rates of mental health problems and suicide. Inuit people describe a broad range of contextual influences on mental wellness based on lived experience, but most epidemiological studies have focused on individual risk factors and pathologies. This study aimed to assess the influence of multiple determinants of mental wellness among Inuit youth in Nunavik, including culturally meaningful activities, housing and community social characteristics. METHODS: Mental wellness was measured in the form of two primary outcomes: self-esteem and suicidal ideation. Using cross-sectional data from the 2004 Nunavik Inuit Health Survey and multilevel regression modelling, we estimated associations between these two outcomes and various independent individual- and community-level explanatory factors among Inuit youth. All variables were selected to reflect Inuit perspectives on determinants of mental wellness. The study design and interpretation of results were validated with Inuit community representatives. RESULTS: Pride in Inuit identity, traditional activities, community-level social support and community-level socio-economic status were found to be protective. Barriers to participating in traditional activities, household crowding and high community rates of violence were risk factors. CONCLUSION: These findings support Inuit perspectives, expand the scope of epidemiological analysis of Inuit mental wellness and reinforce the need for locally informed, community-wide approaches to mental wellness promotion for Inuit youth.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2016 Oct 20,Switzerland,2016,10
20573676,Disclosure patterns of mode of conception among mothers and fathers-5-year follow-up of the Copenhagen Multi-centre Psychosocial Infertility (COMPI) cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Most studies on disclosure of mode of conception after fertility treatment have focused on donor insemination. We present a large, longitudinal cohort study of fertility patients who conceived through a variety of fertility treatments, including both non-donor and donor techniques. METHODS: A cohort of 2812 women and men (n = 1406 couples) received questionnaires when initiating fertility treatment and at 1-year and 5-year follow-ups. At the 5-year follow up, the response rate was 69.4% and 1036 of the responding participants had at least one child born after fertility treatment. Around 66% of the children were conceived with in vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination with partners semen, 26% with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, 7% with donor gametes and <1% with other treatments. The parents were asked whether they already had or intended to disclose the conception method to the child and to others. We used logistic regression to identify determinants among women and men for disclosure. RESULTS: Most of the parents had disclosed or intended to disclose the mode of conception to the child, and almost everyone had disclosed to someone else. Not having used donor gametes was a significant determinant of disclosure both to the child and to other people among women and men. Having disclosed to other people was a significant predictor for having disclosed or intending to disclose to the child. Among women, low social class was a significant determinant of disclosure to the child. Among men, satisfaction with the medical treatment was a significant determinant of disclosure to other people. CONCLUSIONS: We found a large majority who had or intended to disclose to the child how he/she was conceived. Non-disclosure was significantly related to the use of donor gametes.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",2010 Aug,England,2010,10
31155271,"Improving health with programmatic, legal, and policy approaches to reduce gender inequality and change restrictive gender norms.","Evidence that gender inequalities and restrictive norms adversely affect health is extensive; however, far less research has focused on testing solutions. We first comprehensively reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey literature for rigorously evaluated programmes that aimed to reduce gender inequality and restrictive gender norms and improve health. We identified four mutually reinforcing factors underpinning change: (1) multisectoral action, (2) multilevel, multistakeholder involvement, (3) diversified programming, and (4) social participation and empowerment. Following this review, because little research has investigated the effects of national-level law and policy reforms, we conducted original quasi-experimental studies on laws and policies related to education, work, and income, all social determinants of health in which deep gender inequalities exist. We examined whether the laws and policies significantly affected health outcomes and gender norms, and whether law-induced and policy-induced changes in gender norms mediated the health effects, in areas for which longitudinal data existed. Laws and policies that made primary education tuition-free (13 intervention countries with the law and/or policy and ten control countries without) and that provided paid maternity and parental leave (seven intervention and 15 control countries) significantly improved women's and their children's health (odds ratios [OR] of 1.16-2.10, depending on health outcome) and gender equality in household decision making (OR 1.46 for tuition-free and 1.45 for paid maternity and parental leave) as a proxy indicator of gender norms. Increased equality partially mediated the positive effects on health outcomes. We conclude by discussing examples of how improved governance can support gender-equitable laws, policies, and programmes, immediate next steps, and future research needs.","Lancet (London, England)",2019 Jun 22,England,2019,10
21316803,Determination of factors required to increase uptake of influenza vaccination among hospital-based healthcare workers.,"A questionnaire study was performed in all eight University Medical Centers in The Netherlands to determine the predictors of influenza vaccination compliance in hospital-based healthcare workers (HCWs). Demographical, behavioural and organisational determinants were assessed based on behavioural and implementation models. Multivariable regression analysis was applied to assess the independent predictors for influenza vaccine uptake. Age >40 years, the presence of a chronic illness, awareness of personal risk and awareness of risk of infecting patients, trust in the effectiveness of the vaccine to reduce the risk of infecting patients, the HCWs' duty to do no harm and their duty to ensure continuity of care, finding vaccination useful despite the constant flow of visitors and having knowledge of the Health Council's advice, social influence and convenient time for vaccination were all independently associated with vaccine uptake. The accuracy of the prediction model was very high (area under the receiver operating curve: 0.95). Intervention programmes to increase influenza vaccine uptake among HCWs should target the relevant determinants identified in this study.",The Journal of hospital infection,2011 Apr,England,2011,10
30684408,Acceptance of Mobile Health Apps for Disease Management Among People With Multiple Sclerosis: Web-Based Survey Study.,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps might have the potential to promote self-management of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) in everyday life. However, the uptake of MS apps remains poor, and little is known about the facilitators and barriers for their efficient utilization, such as technology acceptance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the acceptance of mHealth apps for disease management in the sense of behavioral intentions to use and explore determinants of utilization among people with MS based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). METHODS: Participants for this Web-based cross-sectional study were recruited throughout Germany with the support of regional MS associations and self-help groups. To identify determinants of intention to use MS apps, a measure based on the UTAUT was adapted with 4 key determinants (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions) and extended by Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) and electronic health literacy. Potential influencing effects of both MS and computer self-efficacy (C-SE) as mediators and fatigue as a moderator were analyzed using Hayes's PROCESS macro (SPSS version 3.0) for IBM SPSS version 24.0. RESULTS: A total of 98 participants (mean age 47.03 years, SD 10.17; 66/98, 67% female) with moderate fatigue levels completed the survey. Although most participants (91/98, 92%) were daily smartphone users, almost two-thirds (62/98, 63%) reported no experience with MS apps. Overall, the acceptance was moderate on average (mean 3.11, SD 1.31, minimum=1 and maximum=5), with lower scores among persons with no experience (P=.04) and higher scores among current users (P<.001). In multiple regression analysis (R(2)=63% variance explained), performance expectancy (beta=.41) and social influence (beta=.33) were identified as significant predictors of acceptance (all P<.001). C-SE was confirmed as a partial mediator in the relationship between IU and acceptance (indirect effect: B=-.095, 95% CI -0.227 to -0.01). Furthermore, a moderated mediation by C-SE was shown in the relationship between IU and behavioral intentions to use MS apps for low (95% CI -0.42 to -0.01) and moderate levels (95% CI -0.27 to -0.01) of fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this exploratory pilot study indicates for the first time that positive expectations about the helpfulness for self-management purposes and social support might be important factors to be considered for improving the acceptance of MS apps among smartphone users with MS. However, given some inconsistent findings, especially regarding the role of effort expectancy and IU and self-efficacy, the conceptual model needs replication with a larger sample of people with MS, varying more in fatigue levels, and a longitudinal assessment of the actual usage of MS apps predicted by acceptance in the sense of behavioral intentions to use.",JMIR formative research,2018 Dec 12,Canada,2018,10

Intervention: Survey of patient satisfaction with antenatal and delivery care to inform quality improvement (QI) initiatives aimed at reducing neonatal mortality. Main Outcome Measure: Overall satisfaction with antenatal and delivery care (reported as excellent or very good). Results: In multivariate logistic regression analysis, high perceived quality [odds ratio (OR) = 3.03, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.565.88], respect [OR = 4.13, 95% CI: 2.16-7.89], and confidentiality [SK: OR = 7.50, 95% CI: 2.16-26.01], [Kirehe: OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.60-3.94] were associated with higher overall satisfaction with ANC, while having >/=1 child compared to none [OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25-0.84] was associated with lower satisfaction. For maternity services, <5 years of school versus >/=5 years [OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.026-0.69] and higher cleanliness [OR = 19.23, 95% CI: 2.22-166.83], self-reported quality [OR = 10.52, 95% CI: 1.81-61.22], communication [OR = 8.78, 95%CI: 1.95-39.59], and confidentiality [OR = 8.66, 95% CI: 1.20-62.64] were all positively associated with high satisfaction. Higher comfort [OR: 0.050, 95% CI: 0.0034-0.71] and Kirehe vs. SK district [OR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.042-1.01] were associated with lower satisfaction.

31217925,The role of hormones in renal disease and ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"The patients with renal diseases, especially end-stage renal disease (ESRD), are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disturbances. Some hormones such as brain natriuretic peptide appear to be important serum biomarkers in predicting cardiac death in ESRD patients. Renal diseases cause inflammation, anemia, uremic toxins, fluid overload, and electrolyte disturbance. Kidney transplantation is considered the choice treatment for patients with ESRD. Ischemia-reperfusion (IR), which occurs during renal transplantation is one of the factors that affect the outcome of renal transplantation. Renal graft rejection is the result of IR injury and there is no effective treatment to prevent IR injury. Reperfusion after ischemia may cause injury through generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, inflammatory responses by increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins (IL), and apoptotic processes, and leads to acute kidney injury (AKI). Thus, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory hormones, which inhibit these pathways, can protect against IR injury and improve transplanted renal function in patients with ESRD.",Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,2019 May,Iran,2019,10
25428143,Relationship between risk factors and in-hospital mortality due to myocardial infarction by educational level: a national prospective study in Iran.,"INTRODUCTION: Since no hospital-based, nationwide study has been yet conducted on the association between risk factors and in-hospital mortality due to myocardial infarction (MI) by educational level in Iran, the present study was conducted to investigate relationship between risk factors and in-hospital mortality due to MI by educational level. METHODS: In this nationwide hospital-based, prospective analysis, follow-up duration was from definite diagnosis of MI to death. The cohort of the patients was defined in view of the date at diagnosis, hospitalization and the date at discharge (recovery or in-hospital death due to MI). 20750 patients hospitalized for newly diagnosed MI between April, 2012 and March, 2013 comprised sample size. Totally, 2511 deaths due to MI were obtained. The data on education level (four-level) were collected based on years of schooling. To determine in-hospital mortality rate and the associated factors with mortality, seven statistical models were developed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of the studied patients, 9611 (6.1%) had no education. in-hospital mortality rate was 8.36 (95% CI: 7.81-8.9) in women and 6.12 (95% CI: 5.83-6.43) in men per 100 person-years. This rate was 5.56 in under 65-year-old patients and 8.37 in over 65-year-old patients. This rate in the patients with no, primary, high school, and academic education was respectively 8.11, 6.11, 4.85 and 5.81 per 100 person-years. Being woman, chest pain prior to arriving in hospital, lack of thrombolytic therapy, right bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia, smoking and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were significantly associated with increased hazard ratio (HR) of death. The adjusted HR of mortality was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.06-1.52), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.77-1.13), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.57-0.91) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.66-1.01) in the patients with respectively illiterate, primary, secondary and high school education compared to academic education. CONCLUSION: A disparity was noted in post-MI mortality incidence in different educational levels in Iran. HR of death was higher in illiterate patients than in the patients with academic education. Identifying disparities per educational level could contribute to detecting the individuals at high risk, health promotion and care improvement by relevant planning and interventions in clinics and communities.",International journal for equity in health,2014 Nov 27,England,2014,10
30019496,Determinants of organ donation registration.,"Rates of organ donor registration range from 20% to 60% throughout the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine sociogeographic differences in organ donor registration rates throughout Missouri to identify varying patterns The organ donor registration rate from each Department of Motor Vehicle office in Missouri was extracted from the National Organ Registration database, office locations were geocoded, and census tract level sociodemographic characteristics were extracted. Spatial regression analyses were conducted to identify relationships between location of DMV offices and census tract-level concentrated disadvantage. Census tract-level concentrated disadvantage (education attainment, poverty, single-headed households) had a significant negative relationship with organ donor registration rates. Yet, census tract-level African American/Black resident concentration was not significantly related to organ donor registration rates. These findings suggest that race-based interventions to recruit organ donors may no longer be necessary. Yet, identifying how characteristics of concentrated disadvantage may be more influential in determining organ donor registration. Gaining a better understanding of how individual decisions are made is integral in the context of increased life expectancy in conjunction with the complex management of chronic conditions.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2018 Nov,United States,2018,10
25218728,Diabetes in China: a societal solution for a personal challenge.,"China has a large burden of diabetes: in 2013, one in four people with diabetes worldwide were in China, where 11.6% of adults had diabetes and 50.1% had prediabetes. Many were undiagnosed, untreated, or uncontrolled. This epidemic is the result of rapid societal transition that has led to an obesogenic environment against a backdrop of traditional lifestyle and periods of famine, which together puts Chinese people at high risk of diabetes and multiple morbidities. Societal determinants including social disparity and psychosocial stress interact with factors such as low-grade infection, environmental pollution, care fragmentation, health illiteracy, suboptimal self-care, and insufficient community support to give rise to diverse subphenotypes and consequences, notably renal dysfunction and cancer. In the China National Plan for Non-Communicable Disease Prevention and Treatment (2012-15), the Chinese Government proposed use of public measures, multisectoral collaborations, and social mobilisation to create a health-enabling environment and to reform the health-care system. While awaiting results from these long-term strategies, we advocate the use of a targeted and proactive approach to identify people at high risk of diabetes for prevention, and of private-public-community partnerships that make integrated care more accessible and sustainable, focusing on registry, empowerment, and community support. The multifaceted nature of the societal and personal challenge of diabetes requires a multidimensional solution for prevention in order to reduce the growing disease burden.",The lancet.

29351781,"MINDMAP: establishing an integrated database infrastructure for research in ageing, mental well-being, and the urban environment.","BACKGROUND: Urbanization and ageing have important implications for public mental health and well-being. Cities pose major challenges for older citizens, but also offer opportunities to develop, test, and implement policies, services, infrastructure, and interventions that promote mental well-being. The MINDMAP project aims to identify the opportunities and challenges posed by urban environmental characteristics for the promotion and management of mental well-being and cognitive function of older individuals. METHODS: MINDMAP aims to achieve its research objectives by bringing together longitudinal studies from 11 countries covering over 35 cities linked to databases of area-level environmental exposures and social and urban policy indicators. The infrastructure supporting integration of this data will allow multiple MINDMAP investigators to safely and remotely co-analyse individual-level and area-level data. Individual-level data is derived from baseline and follow-up measurements of ten participating cohort studies and provides information on mental well-being outcomes, sociodemographic variables, health behaviour characteristics, social factors, measures of frailty, physical function indicators, and chronic conditions, as well as blood derived clinical biochemistry-based biomarkers and genetic biomarkers. Area-level information on physical environment characteristics (e.g. green spaces, transportation), socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. neighbourhood income, residential segregation, residential density), and social environment characteristics (e.g. social cohesion, criminality) and national and urban social policies is derived from publically available sources such as geoportals and administrative databases. The linkage, harmonization, and analysis of data from different sources are being carried out using piloted tools to optimize the validity of the research results and transparency of the methodology. DISCUSSION: MINDMAP is a novel research collaboration that is combining population-based cohort data with publicly available datasets not typically used for ageing and mental well-being research. Integration of various data sources and observational units into a single platform will help to explain the differences in ageing-related mental and cognitive disorders both within as well as between cities in Europe, the US, Canada, and Russia and to assess the causal pathways and interactions between the urban environment and the individual determinants of mental well-being and cognitive ageing in older adults.",BMC public health,2018 Jan 19,England,2018,10
27123012,Determinants of Early Marriage from Married Girls' Perspectives in Iranian Setting: A Qualitative Study.,"Early marriage is a worldwide problem associated with a range of health and social consequences for teenage girls. Designing effective health interventions for managing early marriage needs to apply the community-based approaches. However, it has received less attention from policymakers and health researchers in Iran. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore determinants of early marriage from married girls' perspectives. The study was conducted from May 2013 to January 2015 in Ahvaz, Iran. A purposeful sampling method was used to select fifteen eligible participants. Data were collected through face-to-face, semistructured interviews and were analyzed using the conventional content analysis approach. Three categories emerged from the qualitative data including ""family structure,"" ""Low autonomy in decision-making,"" and ""response to needs."" According to the results, although the participants were not ready to get married and intended to postpone their marriage, multiple factors such as individual and contextual factors propelled them to early marriage. Given that early marriage is a multifactorial problem, health care providers should consider a multidimensional approach to support and empower these vulnerable girls.",Journal of environmental and public health,2016,United States,2016,10
31702691,Teaching Health Advocacy: A Systematic Review of Educational Interventions for Postgraduate Medical Trainees.,"PURPOSE: A systematic review was undertaken to characterize the training approaches that are currently being implemented in postgraduate medical education to teach residents advocacy skills. METHOD: An initial search was conducted in MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and PsycINFO in November 2016 (updated in December 2017) for articles discussing postgraduate medical education interventions covering advocacy. Articles published between 1995 and 2017 were included. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts (and, if needed, the full text) for inclusion; disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted from studies to characterize the content and pedagogy of the interventions by mapping them to the CanMEDS health advocate core competencies and key concepts. RESULTS: A total of 3,027 unique abstracts were retrieved; 2,864 were excluded upon title and abstract review, and another 85 were excluded upon full-text review. Seventy-eight total articles were included. More studies involved residents from pediatrics, psychiatry, primary care or preventative medicine, or internal medicine than from emergency medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, or neurology. Published interventions varied widely by pedagogical approach and assessment method. CONCLUSIONS: Using the CanMEDS framework, this review maps the breadth and nature of postgraduate medical education interventions in health advocacy, with applicability to community organizations, program directors, educators, and administrators working to develop advocacy training interventions. Areas of focus included adapting practice to respond to the needs of or advocacy in partnership with patients, communities, or populations served; determinants of health; health promotion; mobilizing resources as needed; and social accountability.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2019 Nov 5,United States,2019,10
30301437,Socioeconomic inequalities in health during the Great Recession: A scoping review of the research literature.,"Aims: The so-called 'Great Recession' in Europe triggered widespread concerns about population health, as reflected by an upsurge in empirical research on the health impacts of the economic crisis. A growing body of empirical studies has also been devoted to socioeconomic inequalities in health during the Great Recession. The aim of the current study is to summarise this health inequality literature by means of a scoping review. Methods: We have performed a scoping review of the research literature (English language) published in the years 2012-2017. Only empirical papers with (a) health status measured on the individual level, (b) information on socioeconomic position (i.e. employment status, educational level, income/wealth, and/or occupational class), and (c) data from European countries in both pre- and post-crisis years were considered relevant. In total, 49 empirical studies fulfilled these inclusion criteria. Results: The empirical findings in the 49 included studies predominantly show that socioeconomic inequalities in health either increased or remained stable from pre- to post-crisis years. Two-thirds (65%) of the studies found evidence of either increasing or partially increasing health inequalities. Thus, people in lower socioeconomic strata fared worse overall in terms of health during the Great Recession, compared to people with higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: The Great Recession in Europe tends to be followed by increasing socioeconomic inequalities in health. Policymakers should take note of this finding. Widening socioeconomic inequalities in health is a major cause of concern, in particular if health deterioration among 'vulnerable groups' is caused by accelerating cumulative disadvantages.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2019 Aug,Sweden,2019,10
25985223,[Families with Migrant Backgrounds as Target Group of Early Interventions: Results of a Social Early Warning System in a Metropolitan Region].,"OBJECTIVES: Families with migrant backgrounds (MB) are exposed to several psychosocial risk factors that increase the likelihood of impaired child development, in particular. QUESTIONS: We investigated whether families with MB differ from families without MB regarding their psychosocial stressors in the period of pregnancy and birth. METHOD: As part of a social early warning system in an obstetrics clinic in Germany n=502 families with MB were compared with n=349 families without MB with respect to the degree of stress and stress factors on the basis of an initial screening of risk factors for child maltreatment by a midwife or physician and a subsequent structured clearing interview by social education workers during the mothers' inpatient hospitalisation. RESULTS: For families without MB, a significantly higher total score was found in the risk screening (M=3,9 points vs. M=2,9 points) in comparison to families with MB. While families with MB compared to families without MB were faced more frequently by social stressors, e. g., financial problems or a difficult housing situation (81 vs. 37%), they were less frequently impacted by mental strain (27 vs. 48%), young fathers (2 vs. 10%) and maternal psychiatric diseases (3 vs. 17%), according to the risk screening. Socio-economic determinants such as social inclusion and living environment were found to be important factors influencing the psychosocial stress level of families. CONCLUSION: Explanations and implications for research and practice are discussed.",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),2015 Oct,Germany,2015,10
29450072,Hispanic health in the USA: a scoping review of the literature.,"Hispanics are the largest minority group in the USA. They contribute to the economy, cultural diversity, and health of the nation. Assessing their health status and health needs is key to inform health policy formulation and program implementation. To this end, we conducted a scoping review of the literature and national statistics on Hispanic health in the USA using a modified social-ecological framework that includes social determinants of health, health disparities, risk factors, and health services, as they shape the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. These social, environmental, and biological forces have modified the epidemiologic profile of Hispanics in the USA, with cancer being the leading cause of mortality, followed by cardiovascular diseases and unintentional injuries. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in improved access to health services for Hispanics, but challenges remain due to limited cultural sensitivity, health literacy, and a shortage of Hispanic health care providers. Acculturation barriers and underinsured or uninsured status remain as major obstacles to health care access. Advantageous health outcomes from the ""Hispanic Mortality Paradox"" and the ""Latina Birth Outcomes Paradox"" persist, but health gains may be offset in the future by increasing rates of obesity and diabetes. Recommendations focus on the adoption of the Health in All Policies framework, expanding access to health care, developing cultural sensitivity in the health care workforce, and generating and disseminating research findings on Hispanic health.",Public health reviews,2016,England,2016,10
22273395,"Patient views on determinants of compliance with tuberculosis treatment in the eastern cape, South Africa: an application of q-methodology.","BACKGROUND: : Tuberculosis (TB) constitutes one-quarter of all avoidable deaths in developing countries. In the Eastern Cape, South Africa, TB is a public health problem of epidemic proportion. Poor compliance and frequent interruption to treatment are associated with increased transmission rates, morbidity, and costs to TB control programs. This study explored determinants of (non-)compliance from the patients' perspective. METHODS: : Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients (33 treatment compliers and 34 treatment non-compliers) and 14 community health workers from local community clinics and the hospital in the township of Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Q-methodology was used. Patients rank ordered 32 opinion statements describing determinants of treatment compliance from the TB adherence model. By-person factor analysis was used to explore patterns in the rankings of statements by compliers and non-compliers. These patterns were interpreted and described as patient views on determinants of compliance with treatment. Patients and community health workers selected the top five determinants of compliance and non-compliance. RESULTS: : Compliers believed that completing treatment would cure them of TB. Economic prospects were crucial for compliance. Compliers felt that the support of the government disability grant helped with compliance. Non-compliers believed that stigmatization had the greatest impact on non-compliance, together with the burden of disease, the arrangements involved with receiving treatment, restrictions accompanying treatment, and the association of TB with HIV/AIDS infection. CONCLUSIONS: : Stigmatization makes TB a 'social disease'. Individual motivation and self-efficacy appear to have a considerable effect on compliance, but, for non-compliers, the general lack of job prospects and being able to provide for themselves or their family also makes TB very much an 'economic disease'.",The patient,2010 Sep 1,New Zealand,2010,10
24761239,Sexual activity and urological morbidities among nigerian menopausal women: findings from a community based survey.,"BACKGROUND: Menopause represents the end of women reproductive career and it is at this time they begin to manifest morbidities such as urinary incontinence. AIM: To document proximate determinants of sexual activity and urological morbidities of menopausal women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a community survey conducted among 254 menopausal women Mokola in Ibadan, Nigeria in 2008. Respondents were selected using cluster sampling technique. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to obtain information on their characteristics, pattern of urological and sexual activities. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariable tests were performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 15.0 (Chicago, IL USA) and statistical significance was set at P value less than 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of subjects was 60.3 (standard deviation = 10.2 years). About 33.5% (85/254) was still sexually active. About 68% (173/254) reported a reduction in sexual frequency since menopause while 31.5% (80/254) reported no change. The mean self-rated sexual performance score was 4.3 based on a numerical scale where 10 is the maximum obtainable. Significant predictors of reduction in sexual activity were age at menopause and education. Those between 45 and 49 years were less likely than those at 55 years or more (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21; 95% confidence interval OR = 0.05-0.87) while women with at least secondary education were thrice less likely than those with none to report a reduction in sexual activity after menopause. Less than a tenth reported urinary incontinence as a complaint. Urge incontinence was the most commonly reported followed by dysuria and stress incontinence. Less than a quarter of them had requested for a form of treatment. CONCLUSION: Sexual performance of Nigerian menopausal women is associated with age at menopause and education. Non-fistulous urinary incontinence is now being mentioned as a complaint contrary to the widely held view that it is part of the aging process. Therefore, awareness creation on management opportunities should be shared with them.",Annals of medical and health sciences research,2014 Mar,India,2014,10
30021934,"In the Digital Era, Is Community Outrage a Feasible Proxy Indicator of Emotional Epidemiology? The Case of Meningococcal Disease in Sardinia, Italy.","The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the relationship between official data on invasive meningococcal disease cases in Sardinia and the reporting of the cases by a regional online newspaper and (ii) to identify indicators useful for understanding the community outrage related to health events. Cases of meningococcal disease, selected from articles published between 1999 and 2016 on a regional newspaper database, were compared to those reported to the Infectious Disease Information Service. In order to evaluate the equality of the two distribution records, the Kolgomorov Smirnov test for two samples was applied. A community outrage indicator was obtained by calculating the number of published articles for each case of meningococcal disease identified. The outrage indicator was evaluated in comparison with other phenomena: drinking water supply limitation and domestic accidents. Overall, 2724 articles on meningitis/sepsis referring to 89 cases related to meningococcal disease were considered. Significant differences between the distribution of cases officially reported and those found in the newspaper (combined K-S = 0.39; p = 0.08) were not observed. The meningococcal disease outrage indicator showed an average of seven items per case. Comparing the meningococcal disease outrage indicator with those regarding the limitation of drinking water supplies and domestic accidents, a different risk perception by the reference media was found, with the highest outrage for meningococcal disease. The present study supports the role played by emotional factors as behavioral determinants in emerging threats to public health. The analysis of the data allowed us to highlight that the proposed outrage indicator could be a feasible proxy of emotional epidemiology. Finally, data confirm that meningitis is perceived as a highly outrageous health threat.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2018 Jul 18,Switzerland,2018,10
29642166,An investigation into psychological stress and its determinants in Xinjiang desert oil workers.,"The present study aims to investigate psychological stress and its determinants in Xinjiang field oil workers. Specifically, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying psychological stress by comprehensively and quantitatively evaluating the processes involved in psychological stress, the factors which influence it, and their relationship.The participants were 1200 field oil workers in Xinjiang who had been in service for at least 1 year. A structural equation model based on data from the symptom checklist, social support research scale, personality questionnaire, occupational burnout questionnaire, and occupational stress questionnaire was constructed to investigate the social (environmental) factors that influence physiological stress and the interplay among these factors.The positive incidence of psychological stress in the field oil workers in Xinjiang was 12.54%. The structural equation model indicated that the main factors that influenced psychological stress in these workers included social support (0.077), occupational role (0.165), personal strain response (0.139), personality (0.189), and occupational burnout (0.380). Among these factors, occupational role, personality, and occupational burnout had a relatively strong predictive power for psychological stress reactions. The cortisol level in workers with positive psychological stress was significantly higher than that in workers with negative psychological stress.Occupational stress, personality, and occupational burnout exert an impact on psychological stress in field oil workers. Therefore, interventions to address these factors should be taken to reduce the incidence of psychological stress.",Medicine,2018 Apr,United States,2018,10
25266185,Relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and psoriasis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease for which no specific reason has been found although various reasons have been suggested. Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium, which is essentially considered the cause of acute and chronic gastritis. Recently, several reports have suggested that H pylori could play a role in triggering psoriasis. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between H pylori seropositivity and psoriasis. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: This was a case-control study performed on patients with psoriasis vulgaris and healthy individuals in Fatemiye Hospital (referral center for the treatment of skin diseases), Semnan, Iran, during April 2011 to April 2012. METHODS: A case-control study including 61 patients with psoriasis vulgaris (case group) and 61 healthy individuals (control group) without any known gastrointestinal complications were enrolled. All cases were tested for H pylori infection with serology (immunoglobulin G [IgG] anti-H pylori) using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS: Ten (16.4%) of the psoriatic patients and 8 (13%) of the control groups had an H pylori seropositive test result; the average of IgG serum level was 17.3 IU/ML in psoriatic patients and 16.1 IU/ML in the control group. The difference of serum level between the 2 groups was not meaningful (P=.302). CONCLUSION: Our finding indicated that there was neither a significant relationship between psoriasis and the serum level of IgG anti-H pylori, nor a significant relationship between psoriasis severity and the serum level of IgG anti-H pylori. Further studies should be designed to find out whether infection with H pylori is one of the reasons causing or aggravating psoriasis.",Annals of Saudi medicine,2014 May-Jun,Saudi Arabia,2014,10

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. Data on age, weekly frequency of skipping breakfast, physical activity and hours of television viewing were collected. Information on birth weight, parental age, parental educational levels, parental weight and height, and mother's employment status were gathered through self-administrated questionnaires given to the parents. SETTING: Elementary schools in Rasht. SUBJECTS: A total of 6635 children (3551 boys and 3084 girls) attending elementary schools in Rasht were studied. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of overweight was 11.5 % and 15.0 % for boys and girls, respectively; while the overall prevalence of obesity was 5.0 % and 5.9 %, respectively. Children with more educated mothers had a higher prevalence of overweight than children with less educated mothers. Logistic regression analysis showed that children with overweight/obese parents, children with more educated mothers and children who often skipped breakfast were more prone to overweight and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that overweight and obesity is a public health concern in this age group in Rasht. The observed sex and social differences in the prevalence of overweight and obesity call for policy makers' attention.",Public health nutrition,2010 Feb,England,2010,10
30962846,The Determinants of Salivary Cotinine Concentration in Smokeless Tobacco Users.,"BACKGROUND: Smokeless tobacco products due to their high nicotine content are highly addictive and ultimately lead to an increased risk of oral cavity, laryngeal and oesophagal cancer. AIM: This research was conducted with the aim of assessing the relationship between the salivary cotinine concentration and demographic characteristics and smokeless tobacco use for the first time in tradespeople in Chabahar, Iran. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 150 different tradespeople using smokeless tobacco in Chabahar who were selected through simple random sampling in 2018. In addition to the salivary cotinine measurement, data were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire with demographic and behavioural items. The data obtained were analysed in SPSS-16 using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: The mean salivary cotinine score was 887.7 +/- 180.7 in men and 611.2 +/- 139.7 in women, making for a significant intergroup difference (P = 0.043). The mean salivary cotinine score was higher in those who used two or more smokeless tobacco products compared to those who used one type of tobacco, and a significant difference was observed between the type of smokeless tobacco used and the salivary cotinine score in the participants (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the regression analysis, the type of smokeless tobacco used was a strong predictor of the concentration of salivary cotinine in the participants. It is, therefore, necessary for the government to adopt appropriate policies and take educational measures to reduce the vending and use of these substances.",Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,2019 Mar 15,North Macedonia,2019,10
28760264,Modeling spatio-temporal variations of substance abuse mortality in Iran using a log-Gaussian Cox point process.,"Substance use disorder is one of the main mental health problems in Iran. In this paper, the six-monthly counts of deaths due to substance abuse in Iran at provincial level between March 21, 2005, and March 20, 2014, were modeled using a log-Gaussian Cox point process model. By assuming population density as the exposure variable, the considered model incorporated known and unknown influential factors in order to describe spatio-temporal variations in the relative risk of substance abuse mortality. We found evidence of spatial heterogeneity and inequality by gender in deaths related to substance abuse across Iran. This study provides the first evidence in Iran on the spatio-temporal heterogeneity in mortality caused by substance use disorders.",Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology,2017 Aug,Netherlands,2017,10
27834254,Integrating Social And Medical Data To Improve Population Health: Opportunities And Barriers.,"Recent efforts in medical settings to identify social determinants of health have focused primarily on screening for the purpose of improving care for individual patients and getting standardized data into electronic health records (EHRs). Relatively little attention has been given to processes needed to extract data on social determinants of health out of medical records with adequate validity and efficiency to facilitate analysis across individual encounters to inform population health efforts relevant to the health care sector. In this article we describe the rationale for extracting data on social determinants of health from EHRs, including the potential influence of aggregated data on quality improvement activities and health care payment reform. We then discuss opportunities and challenges to pulling these data from EHRs to enable population-level applications, focusing on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, as one potential data aggregation resource. Standardizing methods for extracting data on social determinants of health from EHRs will require understanding current challenges and refining existing translation tools.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2016 Nov 1,United States,2016,10

29599395,Exploring factors impacting early childhood health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and communities: protocol for a population-based cohort study using data linkage (the 'Defying the Odds' study).,"INTRODUCTION: Empirical evidence on family and community risk and protective factors influencing the comparatively high rates of potentially preventable hospitalisations and deaths among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants and children is limited. As is evidence on geographical variation in these risks. The 'Defying the Odds' study aims to explore the impact of perinatal outcomes, maternal social and health outcomes and level of culturally secure service availability on the health outcomes of Western Australian (WA) Aboriginal infants and children aged 0-5 years. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study combines a retrospective cohort study that uses state-wide linked health and administrative data from 12 data sources for multiple generations within Aboriginal families in WA, with specifically collected survey data from health and social services supporting Aboriginal families in regions of WA. Data sources include perinatal/birth registration, hospital, emergency department, mental health services, drug and alcohol service use, mortality, infectious disease notifications, and child protection and family services. Multilevel regression models will be used to examine the intensity of admissions and presentations, mortality, intensity of long stays and morbidity-free survival (no admissions) for Aboriginal children born in WA in 2000-2013. Relationships between maternal (and grand-maternal) health and social factors and child health outcomes will be quantified. Community-level variation in outcomes for Aboriginal children and factors contributing to this variation will be examined, including the availability of culturally secure services. Online surveys were sent to staff members at relevant services to explore the scope, reach and cultural security of services available to support Aboriginal families across selected regions of WA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approvals have been granted for the study. Interpretation and dissemination are guided by the study team's Aboriginal leadership and reference groups. Dissemination will be through direct feedback and reports to health services in the study and via scientific publications and policy recommendations.",BMJ open,2018 Mar 28,England,2018,10
26730714,Use of Public Oral Health Services by the Adult Population: A Multilevel Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: It is important to assess context to explain inequalities in oral health, particularly with regard to the type of service used; thus, this study aimed to identify the social determinants of public dental service use by adults and to assess whether, beyond the level individual, existing inequalities are also expressed in the context in which individuals are embedded. METHODS: A multilevel analysis with three levels of aggregation of variables was performed. The individual variables were derived from the database of the SB Minas Gerais project-a survey of oral health status of the population of Minas Gerais, a state of the Brazilian Southeast region. The variable at the neighborhood level came from the Census of 2010. The variables at the municipal level were obtained from available public databases relating to oral health services. At the municipal level, the Human Development Index (HDI) variable was chosen to represent quality of life in the municipalities. RESULTS: In the final model, the following individual variables were associated with greater use of public dental services: lower income (PR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.53; 2.58), higher number of residents at home (PR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.11; 1.68) and higher number of teeth requiring treatment (PR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.20; 1.84). With regard to context variables, a poorer infrastructure (PR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40; 0.96) leads to a lower use of public services. CONCLUSION: The use of public services is associated with family income, how this income is divided in households, the need for treatment presented by the individual and the organization of the existing oral health service infrastructure in the municipality.",PloS one,2016,United States,2016,10
22182307,Determinants of quality of life in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: Limited evidence exists on the determinants of quality of life (QoL) specific to adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Further, it appears no study has compared the determinants of QoL between T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) groups. The objectives of this study were to examine: (1) determinants of QoL in adults with T1D; and, (2) differences in QoL determinants between T1D and T2D groups. METHODS: The Alberta Longitudinal Exercise and Diabetes Research Advancement (ALEXANDRA) study, a longitudinal study of adults with diabetes in Alberta, Canada. Adults (18 years and older) with T1D (N = 490) and T2D (N = 1,147) provided information on demographics (gender, marital status, education, and annual income), personality (activity trait), medical factors (diabetes duration, insulin use, number of comorbidities, and body mass index), lifestyle behaviors (smoking habits, physical activity, and diet), health-related quality of life (HRQL) and life satisfaction. Multiple regression models identified determinants of HRQL and life satisfaction in adults with T1D. These determinants were compared with determinants for T2D adults reported in a previous study from this population data set. Factors significantly associated with HRQL and life satisfaction in either T1D or T2D groups were further tested for interaction with diabetes type. RESULTS: In adults with T1D, higher activity trait (personality) score (beta = 0.28, p < 0.01), fewer comorbidities (beta = -0.27, p < 0.01), lower body mass index (BMI)(beta = -0.12, p < 0.01), being a non-smoker (beta = -0.14, p < 0.01), and higher physical activity levels (beta = 0.16, p < 0.01) were associated with higher HRQL. Having a partner (beta = 0.11, p < 0.05), high annual income (beta = 0.16, p < 0.01), and high activity trait (personality) score (beta = 0.27, p < 0.01) were significantly associated with higher life satisfaction. There was a significant age x diabetes type interaction for HRQL. The T2D group had a stronger positive relationship between advancing age and HRQL compared to the T1D group. No interaction was significant for life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Health services should target medical and lifestyle factors and provide support for T1D adults to increase their QoL. Additional social support for socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals living with this disease may be warranted. Health practitioners should also be aware that age has different effects on QoL between T1D and T2D adults.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2011 Dec 19,England,2011,10

Two hundred thirteen women who had delivered healthy babies at term were enrolled. A structured questionnaire containing demographic data and the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Score were used, followed by a telephone interview after 8 weeks to determine the feeding outcome. Women of Malay ethnicity with higher education level who had received breastfeeding counseling had a significantly more favorable attitude toward breastfeeding. Ethnicity was found to be a significant determinant in the success of breastfeeding, whereas returning to work was a major reason for discontinuing breastfeeding. In ensuring a successful breastfeeding practice, apart from knowledge and attitude, issues surrounding culture and traditions as well as improving deliverance of readily available support should be addressed.",Breastfeeding medicine : the official journal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine,2014 Jul-Aug,United States,2014,10

Methods: This is a cross-sectional analytical observational study with a probabilistic sample of 384 adolescents between 15 and 19 years old. Data collection was carried out in schools and included self-reporting questionnaires to assess the functional health literacy, socioeconomic classification, self-perceived health, and quality of life. The reliability of internal consistency of the functional health literacy instrument was determined by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using hierarchical data entry according to the level of determination of the theoretical model established. In order to evaluate the association, a significance level of 5% was considered, while the Odds Ratio used as a measure of the magnitude of the associations. Results: The functional health literacy instrument presented a coefficient of 0.766, indicating adequate internal consistency. More than half of teenagers presented good functional health literacy. In the final model of multivariate analysis, the variables not practicing a religion (p = 0.006; OR = 2.108); social domain of quality of life (p = 0.004; OR = 1.022); and educational domain of quality of life (p = 0.009; OR = 1.019) remained associated with functional health literacy. Conclusion: Not practicing a religion and the increase in the scores of social and educational domains of quality of life increased the chances of better functional health literacy.",CoDAS,2017 Aug 10,Brazil,2017,10
28834003,Breastfeeding beyond the big smoke: Who provides support for mothers in rural Western Australia?,"INTRODUCTION: Despite strong and growing evidence for the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months of age, few infants in developed countries reach this milestone. Although breastfeeding practice and its determinants are well described for women in metropolitan areas, there is limited evidence for rural and regional areas of Australia. This paper describes the influence of advice and support on breastfeeding duration for women in rural areas of Western Australia in the first 6 months of their infants' lives. METHODS: A cohort of 427 women and their infants were recruited from hospitals in regional Western Australia and followed up for a period of 12 months. Information about feeding methods was gathered in hospital and at a further seven follow-up contacts. RESULTS: Women who had attended antenatal classes were less likely to have ceased exclusively breastfeeding before 6 months than those who had not attended classes (aHR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41-0.91). No significant associations were found between provision of information alone and duration of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding advice and support in the first 6 months was most commonly sought from Child Health Nurses, General Practitioners and friends. CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal group education is effective in supporting breastfeeding duration for rural women and should be a key priority for rural health service providers. Health professionals are common sources of breastfeeding support postnatally, however creating and maintaining positive and supportive social networks for mothers might also contribute to increasing the proportion of rural infants who meet the World Health Organization guidelines for exclusive breastfeeding.",The Australian journal of rural health,2017 Dec,Australia,2017,10
28261406,"The Impact of ""See the City You Serve"" Field Trip: An Educational Tool for Teaching Social Determinants of Health.","BACKGROUND : There has been limited evaluation of tools for teaching social determinants of health (SDOH). OBJECTIVE : We evaluated a field trip as a tool for teaching SDOH to incoming medical interns. METHODS : Incoming interns from The George Washington University participated in a bus field trip of Washington, DC, guided by community partners. The field trip introduced trainees to local neighborhoods. Pre- and postactivity surveys developed by the authors were analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Reflection responses were recorded and counted for recurrent themes. RESULTS : Incoming interns participated in 2015 (85 of 90, 94%) and in 2016 (96 of 116, 83%). Postactivity, basic knowledge of DC geographic health disparities increased, and a greater percentage of interns reported being at least somewhat comfortable understanding the neighborhoods from which their patients come (2015: 58% versus 89%, P < .0001; 2016: 65% versus 88%, P < .0001); identifying challenges to health care that affect low-income patients (2015: 74% versus 90%, P < .0023); describing community resources (2015: 29% versus 67%, P < .0001; 2016: 29% versus 50%, P < .0001); and referring patients to local community resources (2015: 25% versus 64%, P < .0001; 2016: 36% versus 52%, P < .0001). Interns reported that this experience improved their understanding of patients' background and local resources, and that they would change the way they practice. CONCLUSIONS : A bus field trip guided by community partners is a feasible way to increase residents' perception of their understanding of local disparities and comfort in addressing SDOH.",Journal of graduate medical education,2017 Feb,United States,2017,10
31777338,Green spaces and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.,"BACKGROUND: Green spaces have been proposed to be a health determinant, improving health and wellbeing through different mechanisms. We aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence from longitudinal studies that have investigated green spaces and their association with all-cause mortality. We aimed to evaluate this evidence with a meta-analysis, to determine exposure-response functions for future quantitative health impact assessments. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies on green spaces and all-cause mortality. We searched for studies published and indexed in MEDLINE before Aug 20, 2019, which we complemented with an additional search of cited literature. We included studies if their design was longitudinal; the exposure of interest was measured green space; the endpoint of interest was all-cause mortality; they provided a risk estimate (ie, a hazard ratio [HR]) and the corresponding 95% CI for the association between green space exposure and all-cause mortality; and they used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as their green space exposure definition. Two investigators (DR-R and DP-L) independently screened the full-text articles for inclusion. We used a random-effects model to obtain pooled HRs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018090315. FINDINGS: We identified 9298 studies in MEDLINE and 13 studies that were reported in the literature but not indexed in MEDLINE, of which 9234 (99%) studies were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts and 68 (88%) of 77 remaining studies were excluded after assessment of the full texts. We included nine (12%) studies in our quantitative evaluation, which comprised 8 324 652 individuals from seven countries. Seven (78%) of the nine studies found a significant inverse relationship between an increase in surrounding greenness per 0.1 NDVI in a buffer zone of 500 m or less and the risk of all-cause mortality, but two studies found no association. The pooled HR for all-cause mortality per increment of 0.1 NDVI within a buffer of 500 m or less of a participant's residence was 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97; I(2), 95%). INTERPRETATION: We found evidence of an inverse association between surrounding greenness and all-cause mortality. Interventions to increase and manage green spaces should therefore be considered as a strategic public health intervention. FUNDING: World Health Organization.",The Lancet.

20721780,"The relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and lung disorders in Northern Plains and Southwest American Indians.","OBJECTIVE: Research within the past decade has suggested that mental disorders are associated with lung disorders. This study compared the association of lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and lifetime major depression with lung disorders in two American Indian (AI) tribal communities. DESIGN: A total of 2622 tribal members (1414 in the Northern Plains and 1208 in the Southwest) aged 18-57 years completed an interview assessing psychiatric diagnoses and physical health, including lung disorders. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios for the association of PTSD and major depression with lung disorders. RESULTS: The prevalence of lung disorders was 17% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 15, 19) in the Northern Plains and 13% (95% CI: 11, 15) in the Southwest. In the Northern Plains, men with lung disorders had a higher prevalence of PTSD and major depression than men without lung disorders, and women with lung disorders had a higher prevalence of major depression than women without lung disorders. Neither PTSD nor major depression was associated with lung disorders in men or women living in the Southwest. In the Northern Plains, major depression remained significantly associated with lung disorders in both men (OR=3.1, 95% CI: 1.5, 6.4) and women (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.1) even after adjusting for age, education, smoking, alcohol abuse, and PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Depression, but not PTSD, was associated with lung disorders in AIs living in the Northern Plains. Differences between the Northern Plains and the Southwest underscore the importance of recognizing unique characteristics of tribes and tribal communities. The increasing prevalence of lung disorders in AIs heightens the need for further work to help explain social, cultural, and clinical determinants of these disorders and their associations to PTSD and depression, and ultimately to help provide more effective clinical treatment and preventive care.",Ethnicity & health,2010 Dec,England,2010,10
25936544,Consistent determinants of health-related quality of life in the first 12 months after stroke: a prospective study in Nigeria.,"BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of stroke survivors can be described as an important and holistic index of stroke outcome. To enhance this all encompassing construct, information on its predictors at different phases of stroke is required. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to identify consistent determinants of HRQoL over the course of 1 year after stroke in Nigeria. METHODS: Information on socio-demographic, clinical, and functioning attributes of 55 consecutive individuals with first-ever stroke were obtained during acute admission and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke. Attributes of functioning namely, motor performance, functional activity, and participation were assessed using the Simplified Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the motor-Functional Independence Measure, and the London Handicap Scale, respectively. HRQoL was also assessed with the Health-Related Quality of Life in Stroke Patients-40 scale at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Attributes that were associated with HRQoL at these time points were identified using bivariate and multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: Among the independent variables, concurrently assessed participation was the sole significant (P < 0.0001) determinant of HRQoL at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively accounting for 70%, 64%, and 75% variance in HRQoL. At 12 months, participation (P < 0.0001), and functional activity (P < 0.05) accounted for 83% variance in HRQoL, with better functional activity and participation associated with better HRQoL. CONCLUSION: The outcome of this study indicates that optimizing post-stroke functional activity and participation through proven and effective rehabilitation strategies may result in better HRQoL in stroke survivors.",Topics in stroke rehabilitation,2015 Apr,England,2015,10
27875321,"The impact of selected environmental, behavioral and psychosocial factors on schoolchildren's somatic and mental health.","Children develop rapidly and many exogenous determinants of health significantly affect their somatic and mental development. There is a subjective perception of cognitive load associated with the educational process. The aim of the study is to assess individual environmental, behavioral and psychosocial factors influencing physical health and to investigate the amount of mental load in children. We investigated 87 schoolchildren (47 girls and 40 boys) aged 10-12 years, who were attending primary school in Bratislava. To assess values of selected factors we used a questionnaire form and personality characteristics were estimated by standardized psycho-diagnostic and IQ tests [range of classic fear, social-situation anxiety and jitters [skala Klasickeho strachu a Socialno-situacnej (in Slovak)] (KSAT), Eyesenck Personality Questionnaire for children (EPQ), Raven's IQ test]. Self-reported perception of mental load was assessed by questionnaire of subjective feelings and states (SFS). Children's body parameters were assessed using anthropometric measurements [height, weight, chest, abdominal and hip girth, Rohrer's index (RI), body mass index (BMI)] and a body fat measurement method (skinfold thickness). The results confirmed a significant relationship between higher parameters of overweight and obesity and irregular breakfast eating (p<0.05), absence of family dining (p<0.05), exposure to tobacco smoke in the family environment (p<0.01) and mother's level of education (p<0.05). Almost 60% of children reported high mental effort and cognitive load associated with the educational process. We note a close relationship between the higher mental load and the score of neuroticism (p<0.01). The physical and mental health of schoolchildren is significantly affected by exogenous factors. Therefore, in terms of protection and promotion of children's health, it is important to evaluate and monitor environmental risk factors and to form their healthy habits.",Reviews on environmental health,2017 Mar 1,Germany,2017,10
23711401,Penetrating or stricturing diseases are the major determinants of time to first and repeat resection surgery in Crohn's disease.,"BACKGROUND: About 80% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) require bowel resection and up to 65% will undergo a second resection within 10 years. This study reports clinical risk factors for resection surgery (RS) and repeat RS. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study, using data from patients included in the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort. Cox regression analyses were performed to estimate rates of initial and repeated RS. RESULTS: Out of 1,138 CD cohort patients, 417 (36.6%) had already undergone RS at the time of inclusion. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the probability of being free of RS was 65% after 10 years, 42% after 20 years, and 23% after 40 years. Perianal involvement (PA) did not modify this probability to a significant extent. The main adjusted risk factors for RS were smoking at diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.33; p = 0.006), stricturing with vs. without PA (HR = 4.91 vs. 4.11; p < 0.001) or penetrating disease with vs. without PA (HR = 3.53 vs. 4.58; p < 0.001). The risk factor for repeat RS was penetrating disease with vs. without PA (HR = 3.17 vs. 2.24; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The risk of RS was confirmed to be very high for CD in our cohort. Smoking status at diagnosis, but mostly penetrating and stricturing diseases increase the risk of RS.",Digestion,2013,Switzerland,2013,10
27044694,Childhood Poverty and Its Effect on Health and Well-being: Enhancing Training for Learners Across the Medical Education Continuum.,"OBJECTIVE: Childhood poverty is unacceptably common in the US and threatens the health, development, and lifelong well-being of millions of children. Health care providers should be prepared through medical curricula to directly address the health harms of poverty. In this article, authors from The Child Poverty Education Subcommittee (CPES) of the Academic Pediatric Association Task Force on Child Poverty describe the development of the first such child poverty curriculum for teachers and learners across the medical education continuum. METHODS: Educators, physicians, trainees, and public health professionals from 25 institutions across the United States and Canada were convened over a 2-year period and addressed 3 goals: 1) define the core competencies of child poverty education, 2) delineate the scope and aims of a child poverty curriculum, and 3) create a child poverty curriculum ready to implement in undergraduate and graduate medical education settings. RESULTS: The CPES identified 4 core domains for the curriculum including the epidemiology of child poverty, poverty-related social determinants of health, pathophysiology of the health effects of poverty, and leadership and action to reduce and prevent poverty's health effects. Workgroups, focused on each domain, developed learning goals and objectives, built interactive learning modules to meet them, and created evaluation and faculty development materials to supplement the core curriculum. An editorial team with representatives from each workgroup coordinated activities and are preparing the final curriculum for national implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive, standardized child poverty curriculum developed by an international group of educators in pediatrics and experts in the health effects of poverty should prepare medical trainees to address child poverty and improve the health of poor children.",Academic pediatrics,2016 Apr,United States,2016,10
30240436,Adherence to hospital nutritional status monitoring and reporting guidelines.,"AIMS OF THE STUDY: Despite the widespread existence of guidelines regarding undernutrition monitoring and reporting, there is scarce information whether they are followed. We aimed to evaluate the adherence to guidelines regarding undernutrition monitoring and reporting as well as their determinants in a university hospital. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of discharged patients with data on Nutritional Risk Screening score (NRS-2002) from the department of internal medicine of the Lausanne University Hospital for years 2013-14. Adherence to the hospital monitoring guidelines, i.e.: 1) discharged patients with NRS-2002 score>/=3 should have prealbumin levels measured, and 2) discharged patients with prealbumin levels<0.20 g/l should be rechecked 7 days afterwards, was assessed. Reporting of nutritionally 'at-risk' status in the discharge letter was also assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine potential determinants of adherence to guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 2,539 discharged patients with NRS-2002 data, 1,605 (63.0%) were nutritionally 'at-risk'. Complete adherence to the monitoring guideline was observed in 238 (14.8%) of 'at-risk' patients. After multivariable analysis, adherence to the first step of monitoring guideline was associated with older age (>/= 80 years) [OR (95% CI): 2.03 (1.29-3.18)], high comorbidity index [1.36 (1.05-1.77)], and nutritional management [5.57 (4.38-7.07)]. Nutritional management was also associated with adherence to the second step of monitoring [3.98 (2.33-6.78)]. Adherence to the reporting guideline was observed in 343 (21.4%) of 'at-risk' patients. Multivariable analysis showed that adherence to the reporting guideline was associated with NRS-2002 score>4 [1.97 (1.47-2.64)], nutritional management [3.80 (2.85-5.07)], and adherence to the monitoring guideline [3.33 (2.35-4.71)].

25637274,Promoting the inclusion of Afghan women and men in research: reflections from research and community partners involved in implementing a 'proof of concept' project.,"INTRODUCTION: With mounting evidence that poor maternal and child health outcomes are related to the social determinants of health, researchers need to engage with vulnerable and isolated communities to gather the evidence that is essential to determine appropriate solutions. Conventional research methods may not ensure the degree and quality of participation that is necessary for meaningful study findings. Participatory methods provide reciprocal opportunities for often excluded communities to both take part in, and guide the conduct of research. METHOD/DESIGN: The Having a baby in a new country research project was undertaken to provide evidence about how women and men of refugee background experience health services at the time of having a baby. This two year, multifaceted proof of concept study comprised: 1) an organisational partnership to oversee the project; 2) a community engagement framework including: female and male Afghan community researchers, community and sector stakeholder advisory groups and community consultation and engagement. DISCUSSION: Inclusive research strategies that address power imbalances in research, and diversity of and within communities, are necessary to obtain the evidence required to address health inequalities in vulnerable populations. Such an approach involves mindfully adapting research processes to ensure that studies have regard for the advice of community members about the issues that affect them. Researchers have much to gain by committing time and resources to engaging communities in reciprocal ways in research processes.",International journal for equity in health,2015 Jan 31,England,2015,10

METHODS: Convenience sampling was employed to obtain a sample of 998 adults aged 18 years and older (646 males and 352 females) in the city of Kermanshah. A 2-part self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data over the period between March 1 and May 30, 2017. The first part was designed to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors (10 items). The second part consisted of the EuroQoL 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) EuroQoL-3-level and the EuroQoL visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) questions. A multiple linear regression model was used to determine the factors associated with the EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS score among study participants. RESULTS: The mean values for the EQ-5D index and the EQ-VAS score were 0.74 (standard deviation [SD], 0.19) and 80.9 (SD, 16.5), respectively. The highest percentage of self-reported problems ('some' and 'severe' problems) across the 5 dimensions of the EQ-5D index were associated with the dimensions of anxiety/depression (35.3%) and pain/discomfort (32.9%). The percentage of self-reported problems for the dimensions of usual activities, mobility, and self-care were 19.0, 12.8, and 8.9%, respectively. Our regression analyses indicated that there were statistically significant positive associations between being physically active, monthly household income per capita, and post-secondary education and the EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS score. In contrast, negative associations were found between older age, being married, having a chronic disease, and smoking and the EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS score. A negative association was also found between being uninsured and the EQ-5D index. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that interventions aiming to improve physical activity, to prevent chronic diseases, and to reduce the smoking rate among adults living in the city of Kermanshah may improve their HRQoL.",Epidemiology and health,2017,Korea (South),2017,10
24101437,Optimizing health and health care systems for children with special health care needs using the life course perspective.,"To date, life course research in maternal and child health has largely focused on elucidating fetal and early life influences on adult health and less on promoting the health of children with special health care needs (CSHCN). Consideration of life course theory (LCT) for CSHCN is especially important given their increasing prevalence and comorbidity, their disproportionate vulnerability to weaknesses or instability in the health care system, and the growing evidence linking child and adult health and quality of life. In this commentary we seek to advance the consideration of LCT for CSHCN. We (1) briefly summarize key issues and the importance of a life course approach for CSHCN; (2) present illustrative findings from population-based cross-sectional data that serve to generate hypotheses that can be more rigorously examined when population-based longitudinal data become available; and (3) discuss the application of life course principles as a driving force in the continued implementation and improvement of integrated systems of care for CSHCN.",Maternal and child health journal,2014 Feb,United States,2014,10

Data come from 1272 participants (aged >/=60 years) of the Bambui cohort study of aging during 11 years of follow-up. Outcome measures were systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and hypertension control. Potential confounding variables were demographic characteristics, socioeconomic position (schooling and household income), and health indicators (smoking, sedentary lifestyle, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, waist circumference, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases), including antihypertensive drug use. We used 370 539 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to estimate each individual's African, European, and Native American trihybrid ancestry proportions. Median African, European, and Native American ancestry were 9.6%, 84.0%, and 5.3%, respectively. Among those with African ancestry, 59.4% came from East and 40.6% from West Africa. Baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure, controlled hypertension, and their respective trajectories, were not significantly (P>0.05) associated with level (in quintiles) of African genomic ancestry. Similar results were found for West and East African subcontinental origins. Lower schooling level (<4 years versus higher) showed a significant and positive association with systolic blood pressure (Adjusted beta=2.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-4.99). Lower monthly household income per capita (<USD 180.00 versus higher) showed an inverse association with hypertension control (beta=-0.35; 95% confidence interval, -0.63 to -0.08, respectively).

Increased oxidative stress and inflammatory conditions may cause a negative impact on the immune responses. The present study aimed to assess the levels of oxidative/inflammatory stress biomarkers in HZ patients compared with the controls. This case-control study included 43 HZ patients and 47 age-matched controls. Melatonin (MLT), Indole-dioxygenase (IDO), Interleukin-18 (IL-18), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), ferritin, C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and total homocysteine (tHcy) levels were measured and compared in both groups. The significant high levels of IDO, IL-18, IL-6, ferritin, hsCRP, and tHcy, as well as low levels of MLT were found in HZ patients compared with the controls (P < 0.001); these significant differences were also associated with rash and pain severity (P < 0.001). The final logistic regression model with the area under the curve (0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.00) showed the association of HZ with decreased level of MLT (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98; P = 0.007) and increased levels of tHcy (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06-2.19; P = 0.02). The findings showed increased inflammation-associated oxidative stress in HZ patients. Elevated tHcy levels and reduced MLT levels may be associated with the manifestation of HZ.

Dimensions of home walking exercise were measured by logs and reports of biweekly telephone calls with the intervention nurse. The selection of personal, cognitive, and environmental determinants of home walking was guided by social cognitive theory. Participants walked more frequently if they were exercising before they entered the study, had less depressive symptoms, and were living with friends or family. Duration of walks was influenced by supervised exercise training; living with spouse, friends, or family; and physical conditioning. Participants who walked most consistently over the course of the year had more supervised exercise sessions as part of the dyspnea self-management program, exercised regularly before entering the program, and perceived a gain in social support over the year. These findings can be used to tailor exercise interventions to the specific needs of patients and improve the likelihood of consistent exercise participation.","Geriatric nursing (New York, N.Y.)",2011 May-Jun,United States,2011,10
21221755,Mastery moderates the negative effect of stigma on depressive symptoms in people living with HIV.,"Stigma continues to have a negative effect on the care, treatment, and support of people living with HIV. This study presents baseline data from 825 participants taking part in a cohort study that collects data on the clinical profile and social determinants of health of people with HIV. We performed multivariate regression analysis to evaluate whether mastery and social support moderated the negative effect of stigma on depressive symptoms. Stigma was associated with depressive symptoms after controlling for potential demographic and clinical confounders. In addition, higher levels of mastery and social support were associated with lower levels of depression. However, only mastery moderated the negative effects of stigma on depressive symptoms. For individuals with high levels of mastery, greater exposure to stigma does not translate into greater distress.

31008709,Acute Flares of Knee Osteoarthritis (the ACT-FLARE Study): Protocol for a Web-Based Case-Crossover Study in Community-Dwelling Adults.,"BACKGROUND: The cardinal feature of osteoarthritis (OA) is pain. Although heterogeneity in pain and function have been demonstrated in the long-term course of OA, the more proximate determinants of acute flare-ups remain less clear. How short-term intermittent or transient exposures trigger acute flare-ups has important implications for effective and sustainable self-management strategies. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to identify potential triggers of acute flares in knee OA. Secondary objectives are to determine their course and consequences and describe high-risk participant profiles. METHODS: We carried out a Web-based case-crossover study. This study aims to recruit 620 community-dwelling adults aged >/=40 years, resident in England, and who have knee pain, with or without a recorded diagnosis of knee OA, and no preexisting diagnosis of inflammatory arthropathy. Participants will be recruited via 3 routes: (1) general practice registers, (2) offline community advertisement, and (3) online social media advertisement. By using questionnaires comparing periods before participants' self-reported flare-up episodes (hazard periods) with periods during the study when their knee OA symptoms are stable (control periods), triggers preceding flare-ups will be identified and examined using conditional logistic regression. Time-to-resolution of flare-up will be examined by monitoring people's daily pain, bothersomeness, and medication usage until the participant reports when their flare-up episode ends. Rates of flare-ups will be examined across different participant and flare characteristics using regression models to identify high-risk participant profiles. A study-specific Patient Advisory Group (PAG) is providing suggestion, input, and ongoing support for all stages of the research process. RESULTS: Participant recruitment opened in July 2018 and is anticipated to continue for 6 months. The study results will be disseminated through a number of channels, including relevant national or international conferences and peer-reviewed publication in a medical journal, via advocacy or charity organizations, such as Versus Arthritis and across social media. Findings will be fed back to members of our PAG, study participants, and clinicians from participating primary care general practices. The PAG will also take an active role in the overall dissemination strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide empirical evidence to help patients identify common knee OA flare triggers and provide health care professionals with questions to identify patients at most risk of frequent flare-ups.

Nowadays, researchers are looking for an indirect method to measure weight and height. Self-reported Body Mass Index (BMI) is ever more served as an alternative method for direct weight and height measurement. Misreporting is a usual concern in self-reported BMI, thus, this study set explored the association and degree of agreement of self-reported BMI with weight perception, Self-Rated Health (SRH), and appearance satisfaction in people living in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: 722 men and women (268 men and 454 women) aged 30-64 years were selected using Cluster Multi-stage Sampling with the Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) method from each area. The questionnaire included demographic and socioeconomic variables and self-reported weight and height and questions related to weight and health perception, and appearance satisfaction. Independent samples T-test compared the mean of scales and differences in characteristics between BMI categories, analyzed using chi-square test. The Cohen's kappa coefficient examined the association between self-reported BMI and weight perception, SRH, and appearance satisfaction. RESULTS: The mean self-reported weight was 80.79 +/- 12.87 in men and 68.33 +/- 11.53 in women. The results of the agreement analysis for weight perception were Kappa = 0.38 with p < 0.0001 for women and Kappa = 0.23 with p <0.0001 for men. This measure of agreement, while statistically significant, is fair agreement. SRH and appearance satisfaction were not significantly correlated with self-reported BMI. CONCLUSION: The measurements of height and weight can cause significant imprecisions in calculation of BMI, which is used as a guide for identifying persons at risk of disease. Direct measurement of height and weight should be performed whenever possible for optimal measurements in clinical practice and clinically oriented researches.",Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders,2015,Switzerland,2015,10
29952687,Physiotherapists' experiences with a blended osteoarthritis intervention: a mixed methods study.,"INTRODUCTION: E-Exercise is an effective 12-week blended intervention consisting of around five face-to-face physiotherapy sessions and a web-based application for patients with hip/knee osteoarthritis. In order to facilitate effective implementation of e-Exercise, this study aims to identify physiotherapists' experiences and determinants related to the usage of e-Exercise. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed methods design embedded in a randomized controlled trial comparing e-Exercise with usual physiotherapy in patients with hip/knee osteoarthritis. Usage of e-Exercise was based on recruitment rates of 123 physiotherapists allocated to e-Exercise and objective web-based application usage data. Experiences and determinants related to e-Exercise usage were investigated with a questionnaire and clarified with semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Of the 123 physiotherapists allocated to e-Exercise, 54 recruited more than one eligible patient, of whom 10 physiotherapists continued using e-Exercise after the study period. Physiotherapists had mixed experiences with e-Exercise. Determinants related to intervention usage were appropriateness, added value, time, workload, professional autonomy, environmental factors, and financial consequences. Physiotherapists recommended to improve the ability to tailor e-Exercise to the individual needs of the patient patients' individual needs. DISCUSSION: Determinants related to the usage of e-Exercise provided valuable information for the implementation of e-Exercise on broader scale. Most importantly, the flexibility of e-Exercise needs to be improved. Next, there is a need for education on how to integrate an online program within physiotherapy.",Physiotherapy theory and practice,2018 Jun 28,England,2018,10
30081522,Dietary and Physical Activity Behaviours in African Migrant Women Living in High Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Framework Synthesis.,"Dietary and physical activity behaviours during preconception and in pregnancy are important determinants of maternal and child health. This review synthesised the available evidence on dietary and physical activity behaviours in pregnant women and women of childbearing age women who have migrated from African countries to live in high income countries. Searches were conducted on Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Pubmed, CINAHL, Scopus, Proquest, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library. Searches were restricted to studies conducted in high income countries and published in English. Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out in duplicate. Findings were synthesised using a framework approach, which included both a priori and emergent themes. Fourteen studies were identified; ten quantitative and four qualitative. Four studies included pregnant women. Data on nutrient intakes included macro- and micro-nutrients; and were suggestive of inadequacies in iron, folate, and calcium; and excessive sodium intakes. Dietary patterns were bicultural, including both Westernised and African dietary practices. Findings on physical activity behaviours were conflicting. Dietary and physical activity behaviours were influenced by post-migration environments, culture, religion, and food or physical activity-related beliefs and perceptions. Further studies are required to understand the influence of sociodemographic and other migration-related factors on behaviour changes after migration.",Nutrients,2018 Aug 3,Switzerland,2018,10
28357452,Determinants of health-related quality of life for patients after urinary lithotripsy: ureteroscopic vs. shock wave lithotripsy.,"PURPOSE: To compare the longitudinal health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after surgical intervention with ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL) and shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) and to evaluate the factors affecting HRQoL in urolithiasis patients. METHODS: A total of 262 patients who underwent lithotripsy (SWL, n = 61; URSL, n = 201) for upper urinary tract calculi treatment between June 2012 and January 2015 were evaluated. All patients were administered the Short-Form 36-item survey (SF-36) to assess HRQoL at four timepoints: before surgery, on the day of discharge, and 1 and 6 months after lithotripsy. Stone-free rates, complications, and analgesic requirements were evaluated to compare the effects of the two procedures on HRQoL. RESULTS: At the day of discharge, patients in the URSL group had significantly lower mean scores on five different subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire, namely, physical functioning, role-physical, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The stone-free rate at 3 months after lithotripsy was significantly lower in the SWL group (72.1% vs. URSL, 93.0%; p < 0.001). The hospital stay was shorter in the SWL group (2.1 +/- 0.07 vs. URSL, 4.1 +/- 0.13 days; p < 0.001), and the analgesia requirements were also lower in the SWL group (0.3 +/- 0.08 vs. URSL, 0.9 +/- 0.20; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The post-lithotripsy HRQoL was superior for SWL compared to URSL on the discharge date despite the lower stone-free rate of the former. The longer hospital stay and higher postoperative pain appeared to be the determinants of the lower HRQoL in the URSL group.",Urolithiasis,2018 Apr,Germany,2018,10
23823817,Evaluation of an HIV-related behavior change project for female sex workers in Central China.,"BACKGROUND: As female sex workers (FSWs) were becoming the driving force behind the HIV epidemic in Central China, a project to promote condom use by FSWs was implemented from 2004 to 2009. In this study, we discussed the evaluation of the project, the factors associated with condom use among FSWs within the Chinese context, and proposed suggestions for future interventions for FSWs in China. METHODS: Two surveys using structured questionnaires were conducted in 2004 and 2009. Data collected from the surveys were analyzed and guided by a behavior change framework. We reviewed relevant articles to supplement the information that was not able to be obtained from the surveys. RESULTS: In general, the HIV prevalence among FSWs remained low (less than 1%) in the 5 years. With a high coverage of interventions for all FSWs in Central China, the project yielded better outcomes than the national average over the same time period. The awareness about HIV and condom use grew dramatically during the project period. The four factors/ determinants that influence the behavior of FSWs using condoms are population characteristics, opportunity, ability, and motivation. Statistical model shows that the significant variables for using a condom are age, availability of services, HIV-related knowledge, and intention. CONCLUSIONS: With a high coverage of interventions for FSWs, the project achieved its goals. The differences among workplaces of FSWs may serve as a symbol of their socioeconomic status, patterns of condom use, and therefore risks of acquiring HIV.",Chinese medical journal,2013 Jul,China,2013,10
23617730,Heavy consumption of dental services; a longitudinal cohort study among Finnish adults.,"BACKGROUND: A reform to Dental Care legislation in 2002 abolished age limits restricting adults' use of public dental services in Finland. In the Public Dental Service (PDS) unit of Espoo, the proportion of adult patients rose from 36% to 57%. The aim of this study was to investigate heavy use of dental services by adults and its determinants. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study was undertaken based on a PDS patient register. Of all adults who attended the PDS in Espoo in 2004, those who had six or more visits (n=3,173) were assigned to the heavy user group and a comparison group of low users (n=22,820) had three or fewer dental visits. A sample of 320 patients was randomly selected from each group. Baseline information (year 2004) on age, sex, number and type of visit, oral health status and treatment provided was collected from treatment records. Each group was followed-up for five years and information on the number and types of visit was recorded for each year from 2005 to 2009. RESULTS: Most heavy users (61.6%) became low users and only 11.2% remained chronic heavy users. Most low users (91.0%) remained low users. For heavy users, the mean number of dental visits per year (3.0) during the follow-up period was significantly lower than initially in 2004 (8.3) (p<0.001) but 74.8% of heavy users had had emergency visits compared with 21.6% of the low users (p<0.001).A third (33%) of the visitors in each group had no proper examination and treatment planning during the 5-year follow-up period and two or more examinations were provided to fewer than half of the heavy (46.1%) or low (46.5%) users.The mean number of treating dentists was 5.7 for heavy users and 3.8 for low users (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frequent emergency visits were characteristic of heavy users of dental services. Treatment planning was inadequate, probably partly due to the many dentists involved and too many patients requesting care. Better local management and continuous education are needed to ensure good quality adult dental care and to reduce heavy consumption.",BMC oral health,2013 Apr 24,England,2013,10
30383824,Comparison of perceptions of domestic elder abuse among healthcare workers based on the Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior (KAB) model.,"It is generally agreed that healthcare workers are ideally positioned to recognize and diagnose cases of elder abuse. However, little is known about their knowledge and understanding of this issue. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the perceptions of different groups of healthcare workers toward elder abuse in Japan, using the Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior (KAB) model. Home-visit nurses, medical doctors, care managers, care workers, public health nurses, and social workers, with experience of dealing with elder abuse received self-administered questionnaire surveys that inquired regarding demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding elder abuse. A total of 311 healthcare workers participated in this survey. To compare the differences among the groups, a one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test, and a Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Steel-Dwass tests were used in accordance with data normality. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore variables that predicted the healthcare workers' perceptions, and covariance structure analysis was used to examine whether the KAB model can accurately predict healthcare workers' perceptions. Multiple comparisons showed significant differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding elder abuse among the abovementioned six groups. Age, sex, and years of work related to the care of elderly were extracted as significant determinants of healthcare workers' perceptions of elder abuse. The examination of the KAB model with covariance structure analysis yielded a model with strong goodness-of-fit. These findings emphasize the need to take effective measures to improve their perceptions as well as review the role of each healthcare worker so that they can be more concerned with and involved in the safeguarding of the elderly. Given the strong goodness-of-fit demonstrated by the KAB model, education of healthcare workers on both the knowledge of, and attitudes toward, elder abuse may help in improving healthcare workers' behavior in dealing with elder abuse.",PloS one,2018,United States,2018,10
29470109,Determinants of the Intention of Senegal's Physicians to Use Telemedicine in Their Professional Activities.,"BACKGROUND: In Senegal, physicians are unevenly distributed, leading to unequal access to healthcare in underserved areas. Telemedicine is seen as a potential means to address this problem. INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine's potential to improve access depends, in part, on physicians' intention to use the technology. In Senegal that intention is not well known. This study aimed to determine that intention and the factors that influence it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study between January and February 2015 with a random sample of 168 physicians working in public hospitals and 153 in district health centers in Senegal. Data were collected using two questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, and linear regression. RESULTS: The intention to use telemedicine by physicians working in public hospitals and district health centers was moderate and was positively correlated with their attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. The intention of the physicians working in public hospitals was also positively correlated with their region and status as contract employee, but negatively with their status as government employee. That of the physicians working in district health centers was negatively correlated with their age and years of practice. DISCUSSION: These results showed that, overall, the intention of Senegal's physicians to use telemedicine was moderate and could be improved by acting on factors related to their perceived behavioral control and other factors correlated with their intention. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' intention to use telemedicine in Senegal is fair but could be improved by addressing the factors identified in this study.",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,2018 Nov,United States,2018,10
29668210,Care coordination for children with special needs in Medicaid: lessons from Medicare.,"OBJECTIVES: To provide actionable recommendations for improving care coordination programs for children with special healthcare needs (CSHCN) in Medicaid managed care. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review and interviews with stakeholders and policy experts to adapt lessons learned from Medicare care coordination programs for CSHCN in Medicaid managed care. METHODS: We reviewed syntheses of research on Medicare care coordination programs to identify lessons learned from successful programs. We adapted findings from Medicare to CSHCN in Medicaid based on an environmental scan and discussions with experts. The scan focused on Medicaid financing and eligibility for care coordination and how these intersect with Medicaid managed care. The expert discussions included pediatricians, Medicaid policy experts, Medicaid medical directors, and a former managed care executive, all experienced in care coordination for CSHCN. RESULTS: We found 6 elements that are consistently associated with improved outcomes from Medicare care coordination programs and relevant to CSHCN in Medicaid: 1) identifying and targeting high-risk patients, 2) clearly articulating what outcomes programs are likely to improve, 3) encouraging active engagement between care coordinators and primary care providers, 4) requiring some in-person contact between care coordinators and patients, 5) facilitating information sharing among providers, and 6) supplementing care coordinators' expertise with that of other clinical experts. CONCLUSIONS: States and Medicaid managed care organizations have many options for designing effective care coordination programs for CSHCN. Their choices should account for the diversity of conditions among CSHCN, families' capacity to coordinate care, and social determinants of health.",The American journal of managed care,2018 Apr,United States,2018,10
29951424,A professional commitment scale for clinical nurses: A study protoco.,"Background: As the largest and most fundamental group targeted by programs developed to improve quality of care, nurses should be the focus of attention in the management of human resources in the field of health care. A review of literature on this subject revealed the lack of scales designed for measuring professional commitment in nurses. The present study was designed to develop a scale to measure professional commitment in clinical nurses and examine its psychometric properties. Methods: This study will develop a professional commitment scale for clinical nurses within one qualitative and one quantitative step. The first step of the study will entail a review of the literature on the subject and interviews with clinical nurses so as to develop the categories and the items. The second step, the quantitative step, will analyze the items extracted in the qualitative step, determining the features of the topics and factor structure of the scale. The initial scale will be completed by 300 clinical nurses. The correlation among the topics, the construct validity, and reliability of the scale will also be examined in this step. Results and Discussion: This study will develop an instrument that can measure professional commitment in clinical nurses. Given the lack of instruments for measuring professional commitment in clinical nurses, the findings of this study may be of help to nursing managers, authorities, and the health system in general.",Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,2017,Iran,2017,10
30465284,Knowledge brokering: (mis)aligning population knowledge with care of fat bodies.,"OBJECTIVE: Two prominent Canadian knowledge brokers aim to influence how primary care clinicians address obesity, through the dissemination of texts: the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (guideline) and the Canadian Obesity Network (5As). While written for the same clinician and adult patient population, the recommendations differ. This analysis highlights active decisions that produced the difference. METHODS: Frame analysis of the guideline and 5As texts. RESULTS: The brokers both frame obesity as a chronic and pathological threat to health, at least to a point. The guideline texts frame obesity primarily as a sign of a behavioural problem, discrediting or ignoring many complicating sources of knowledge. In contrast, the 5As frames obesity as complex through diversifying the knowledge foundation embedded in the texts (e.g., including fat-related stigmatisation; health status differences among those classified as obese). Both de-emphasize social and environmental determinants of weight and health. CONCLUSION: Frames of problems used by brokers are not neutral, nor are decisions about how knowledge is excluded and included. Knowledge brokering, no matter how scientific and systematic, is limited by its frame. Recognizing the limits of each frame supports reflexivity in knowledge brokering and interventions taken to enhance health.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2018 Dec,Switzerland,2018,10
19946784,Social and clinical determinants of quality of life in Parkinson's disease in Austria: a cohort study.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a reduction of health-related quality of life (HrQoL). Demographic and clinical determinants of HrQoL in PD have been previously investigated, but less is known about its social determinants. Data on HrQoL in Austrian patients with PD are not available. The objective of this cross-sectional survey was to evaluate HrQoL of Austrian patients with PD and to provide a comprehensive analysis of its social and clinical determinants. Outpatients (n = 100) with idiopathic PD were recruited in the Department of Neurology of the University Innsbruck. Clinical status was estimated using the Unified Parkison's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). HrQoL was evaluated using a generic instrument, the EuroQol (EQ5D and EQ-VAS). Independent determinants of HrQoL were assessed in multivariate regression analysis. The proportion of PD patients with moderate or severe problems in at least one dimension of the EQ5D was significantly higher than in the general population (90.1 vs. 35.1%, P < 0.001). The mean EQ-VAS score in PD was lower than in the general population (48.9 +/- 19.6 vs. 77.0 +/- 20.8, P < 0.001). Social support (number of household members) was identified as an independent social determinant of HrQoL. Demographic and clinical determinants were age, depression, UPDRS and motor fluctuations. The analysis of determinants of HrQoL showed that a greater attention should be paid to social support and home care. Our data on HrQoL in PD should be considered in the development of new health care programs.",Journal of neurology,2010 Apr,Germany,2010,10
26385988,Dads Get Sad Too: Depressive Symptoms and Associated Factors in Expectant First-Time Fathers.,"This cross-sectional study aims to determine the prevalence and determinants of depressive symptoms in first-time expectant fathers during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. As part of a prospective study examining depressive symptoms in men over the first postnatal year, 622 men (mean age = 34.3 years, +/-5.0 years) completed standardized online self-report questionnaires measuring depressed mood, physical activity, sleep quality, social support, marital adjustment, life events, financial stress, and demographics during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. The Edinburgh Depression Scale was used to assess depressed mood. Partners also completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale in the third trimester. The results revealed that 13.3% of expectant fathers exhibited elevated levels of depressive symptoms during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. Significant independent factors associated with antenatal depressive symptoms in men were poorer sleep quality, family history of psychological difficulties, lower perceived social support, poorer marital satisfaction, more stressful life events in the preceding 6 months, greater number of financial stressors, and elevated maternal antenatal depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of including fathers in the screening and early prevention efforts targeting depression during the transition to parenthood, which to date have largely focused only on women. Strategies to promote better sleep, manage stress, and mobilize social support may be important areas to address in interventions tailored to new fathers at risk for depression during the transition to parenthood.",American journal of men's health,2017 Sep,United States,2017,10
26729863,The spreading of misinformation online.,"The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15--where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., ""echo chambers."" Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades' size.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2016 Jan 19,United States,2016,10
23561030,Disadvantaged populations in maternal health in China who and why?,"BACKGROUND: China has made impressive progress towards the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for maternal and reproductive health, but ensuring that progress reaches all segments of the population remains a challenge for policy makers. The aim of this review is to map disadvantaged populations in terms of maternal health in China, and to explain the causes of these inequities to promote policy action. METHODS: We searched PUBMED, Popline, Proquest and WanFang and included primary studies conducted in mainland China. Experts were also contacted to identify additional studies. Disadvantaged populations in terms of MDG 5 and the reasons for this disadvantage explored by authors were identified and coded based on the conceptual framework developed by the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. RESULTS: In China, differences in maternal health service utilization and the maternal mortality ratio among different income groups, and among regions with different socio-economic development still exist, although these differences are narrowing. Groups with low levels of education and ethnic minorities utilize maternal health care less frequently and experience higher maternal mortality, although we could not determine whether these differences have changed in the last decade. Rural-to-urban migrants use maternal health care and contraception to a lower extent than permanent residents of cities, and differential maternal mortality shows a widening trend among these groups. Gender inequity also contributes to the disadvantaged position of women. Intermediary factors that explain these inequities include material circumstances such as long distances to health facilities for women living in remote areas, behavioral factors such as traditional beliefs that result in reduced care seeking among ethnic minorities, and health system determinants such as out-of-pocket payments posing financial barriers for the poor. CONCLUSIONS: Inequity in maternal health continues to be an issue worthy of greater programmatic and monitoring efforts in China.",Global health action,2013 Apr 3,United States,2013,10
31405683,The prevalence of osteoporosis among Iranian postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder that is common in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. Different studies have reported different prevalence of osteoporosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of osteoporosis in Iranian postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. Search for eligible articles was performed using the keywords of osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone mineral density, OP, bone loss, Post menopaus*, diabetes, hyperglycemia, and Iran, and their possible combinations in the following databases: Scientific Information Database (SID), MagIran, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Heterogeneity between studies was examined with I(2). The data were analyzed using the meta-analysis method and random effects model with Stata version 11.0. The analysis of 4 papers with a sample size of 562 showed that the prevalence of osteoporosis in the lumbar spine and femoral neck of the Iranian post-menopausal women with type II diabetes was 25.26% (95% CI: 7.22-30.30) and 17.45% (95% CI: 0.25-34.65), respectively. Also, the prevalence of osteopenia in the lumbar spine and femoral neck of these patients was 45.23% (95% CI: 40.66-49.79) and 44.53% (95% CI: 36.60-52.47), respectively. There was no relationship between the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia with sample size, year of publication, age and body mass index. Osteoporosis and osteopenia are prevalent in women, so healthy lifestyle education for these postmenopausal women are necessary to reduce the prevalence of these problems.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2019 Jul - Aug,Netherlands,2019,10
26920364,Prevalence and factors associated with violence and abuse of older adults in Mexico's 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Factors associated with violence and the abuse of older adults are understudied and its prevalence in Mexico has not been reported. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and factors associated with violence and abuse of older adults in Mexico. METHODS: We used Mexico's 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey, which included a sample of 8,894 individuals who are 60 years or older and who self-reported a negative health event related to robbery, aggression or violence in the previous 12 months. We used chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test to analyze the variables related to violence. Adjusted estimates were completed with multiple logistic regression models for complex surveys. RESULTS: The prevalence of violence was 1.7 % for both men and women. In 95 % of the cases, the aggression was from an unknown party. Verbal aggressions were the most prevalent (60 %). Among men, physical aggression was more common. Violence frequently occurred in the home (37.6 %); however, men were primarily assaulted in public places (42.4 %), in comparison to women (30.7 %). There were also differences in the risk factors for violence. Among men, risk was associated with younger age (60-64 years), higher education (secondary school or above) and higher socioeconomic status. Among women, risk was associated with depression, not being the head of the family, and region of the country. CONCLUSIONS: Violence against older adults presents differently for men and women, which means it is necessary to increase knowledge about the dynamics of the social determinants of violence, particularly in regards to the role of education among men. The relatively low prevalence found in this study may reflect the difficulty and fear of discussing the topic of violence. This may occur because of cultural factors, as well as by the perception of helplessness perpetuated by the scarce access to social programs that ensure protection and problem solving with regards to the complex social determinants of individual and family violence that this population group endures.",International journal for equity in health,2016 Feb 27,England,2016,10
29371220,Ethnic Differences in Prevalence of Post-stroke Depression.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about ethnic differences in poststroke depression (PSD) in the United States. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of PSD at 90 days after first-ever stroke and to examine ethnic differences in the prevalence between Mexican Americans (MAs) and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Stroke cases from 2011 to 2015 were identified from the BASIC project (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi)-a population-based stroke surveillance study in south Texas. Participants were interviewed at the onset of stroke (baseline interview) and approximately 90 days post-stroke (outcome interview). PSD was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8. Inverse probability weights were generated to account for differential attrition, and weighted logistic regression was used to investigate the association between ethnicity and PSD. The study sample consisted of 586 first-ever stroke patients who completed nonproxy baseline and outcome interviews and had depression assessment. Approximately, 60% of them were MAs, and 40% were NHWs. After accounting for attrition, the prevalence of depression at 90 days post-stroke was 30.4% for MAs (95% confidence interval, 25.0%-35.9%) and 20.7% for NHWs (95% confidence interval, 15.7%-25.7%). The crude odds of PSD in MAs was 1.69 times greater than that in NHWs (95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.51). The odds ratio decreased by 23.6% after adjustment for education (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-2.02) and was further attenuated with additional adjustment for other covariates. CONCLUSIONS: MAs had a higher prevalence of PSD at 90 days than NHWs. The ethnic difference was explained by sociodemographic and health factors, especially low educational attainment.",Circulation.

25928001,"Young adult's own and parental social characteristics predict injury morbidity: a register-based follow-up of 135,000 men and women.","BACKGROUND: Sociodemographic differences in injury mortality are well-established, but population-level studies on social patterns of injury morbidity remain few in numbers, particularly among young adults. Yet injuries are the leading cause of mortality, morbidity and disability among young people. Studies among children have shown steep social gradients in severe injuries, but less is known on the social patterning of injuries in late adolescence and early adulthood, when young people are in the process of becoming independent adults. This study examines how young adults' current living arrangements, education, main economic activity, and parental social background are associated with hospital-treated injuries in late adolescence and early adulthood. METHODS: The study uses prospective, individual-level data gathered from several administrative sources. From a representative 11% sample of the total Finnish population, we included young people between ages 17-29 years during the follow-up (N = 134,938). We used incidence rates and Cox proportional hazards models to study hospital-treated injuries and poisonings in 1998-2008. RESULTS: Higher rates of injury were found among young adults living alone, single mothers, the lower educated and the non-employed, as well as those with lower parental social background, experience of childhood family changes or living with a single parent, and those who had left the parental home at a young age. Injury risks were consistently higher among young adults with lower education, but current living arrangements and main economic activity showed some age-related nuances in the associations: both earlier and later than average transitions in education, employment, and family formation associated with increased injury risks. The social differentials were strongest in poisonings, intentional self-harm, and assaults, but social patterns were also found in falls, traffic-related injuries and other unintentional injuries, underlining the existence of multiple distinct mechanisms and pathways behind the differentials. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to adulthood is a life period of heightened risk of injury, during which both parental social background and the young people's own social position are important determinants of serious injuries that require inpatient care.",BMC public health,2015 Apr 28,England,2015,10
30156438,A Review of Modifiable Risk Factors for Severe Obesity in Children Ages 5 and Under.,"Early-onset severe obesity in childhood presents a significant clinical challenge signaling an urgent need for effective and sustainable interventions. A large body of literature examines overweight and obesity, but little focuses specifically on the risk factors for severe obesity in children ages 5 and younger. This narrative review identified modifiable risk factors associated with severe obesity in children ages 5 and younger: nutrition (consuming sugar sweetened beverages and fast food), activity (low frequency of outdoor play and excessive screen time), behaviors (lower satiety responsiveness, sleeping with a bottle, lack of bedtime rules, and short sleep duration), and socio-environmental risk factors (informal child care setting, history of obesity in the mother, and gestational diabetes). The lack of literature on this topic highlights the need for additional research on potentially modifiable risk factors for early-onset severe obesity.",Childhood obesity (Print),2018 Oct,United States,2018,10
27840340,The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on Quality of Life in Women with Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: The women with breast cancer experience high rates of morbidity due to different treatments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of aerobic exercise in the quality of life (QoL) among women suffering from breast cancer in Hamadan, western Iran. METHODS: Participants who had consummated the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in exercise group (n=30) and control group (n=30). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The mean age was 42.70 +/-9.6 and 43.50 +/-8.60 yr old in exercise and control groups, respectively. The quality of life was assessed by two widely used standard questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23). The exercise group received supervised exercise 2 days per week for 10 weeks. Through two stages (before and after intervention) these groups were evaluated. Analyzing the data was performed by SPSS/20.0, using t-test, chi-squared and ANCOVA. P<0.05 was regarded as significant level. RESULTS: The global health status QoL, based on EORTC QLQ-C30, developed significantly in the exercise group (48.76+/-24.96 vs. 81.79+/-16.34) in comparison with the controls (47.75 +/-15.73 vs. 52.88 +/-14.51) (P<0.001). The exercise intervention was associated with substantial development in total score of functions and symptoms of QoL using EORTC QLQ-BR23 (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The statistically and clinically crucial developments were indicated in functions and symptoms of QoL in response to exercise in breast cancer women.",Journal of research in health sciences,2016 Summer,Iran,2016,10
26307654,Genome-wide association study of prostate cancer-specific survival.,"BACKGROUND: Unnecessary intervention and overtreatment of indolent disease are common challenges in clinical management of prostate cancer. Improved tools to distinguish lethal from indolent disease are critical. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide survival analysis of cause-specific death in 24,023 prostate cancer patients (3,513 disease-specific deaths) from the PRACTICAL and BPC3 consortia. Top findings were assessed for replication in a Norwegian cohort (CONOR). RESULTS: We observed no significant association between genetic variants and prostate cancer survival. CONCLUSIONS: Common genetic variants with large impact on prostate cancer survival were not observed in this study. IMPACT: Future studies should be designed for identification of rare variants with large effect sizes or common variants with small effect sizes.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2015 Nov,United States,2015,10
31431969,Exploring the illness representations of people with psoriatic arthritis: a secondary analysis of focus group data.,"Background: PsA is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, affecting the joints and connective tissue. According to the common-sense model (CSM), patients develop illness beliefs when faced with new symptoms, which determine their emotional and behavioural response to the condition. The CSM includes five beliefs: identity, consequence, cause, time line and control. These are important determinants of outcomes and have been shown to influence adherence to medication. Methods: A secondary analysis of eight focus groups held across five hospital sites and including 41 participants was undertaken. Participants were sampled for a range of phenotypes and domains of disease activity: men = 20 and women = 21; mean (s.d.): age = 58 (11.4) years; disease duration = 9 (8.3) years; and HAQ = 1 (0.7). Results: The analysis provided evidence to support the existence of the five illness beliefs among patients with PsA and evidence that these representations affected the way patients engaged with their condition. The results showed that many participants experienced high levels of uncertainty in relationship to the illness representation. The role of external social and environmental factors was also shown to influence participants' illness representations and the way they made sense of their PsA. Conclusion: This research highlights a new theme of uncertainty within illness representations and how this impacts on the way in which people living with PsA manage their condition. A greater understanding of the uncertainty that patients might have about their condition and its treatment could provide clinicians with an opportunity to address misinformed illness representations.",Rheumatology advances in practice,2018,England,2018,10
28289559,Comparison of 3D laser-based photonic scans and manual anthropometric measurements of body size and shape in a validation study of 123 young Swiss men.,"BACKGROUND: Manual anthropometric measurements are time-consuming and challenging to perform within acceptable intra- and inter-individual error margins in large studies. Three-dimensional (3D) laser body scanners provide a fast and precise alternative: within a few seconds the system produces a 3D image of the body topography and calculates some 150 standardised body size measurements. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to enhance the small number of existing validation studies and compare scan and manual techniques based on five selected measurements. We assessed the agreement between two repeated measurements within the two methods, analysed the direct agreement between the two methods, and explored the differences between the techniques when used in regressions assessing the effect of health related determinants on body shape indices. METHODS: We performed two repeated body scans on 123 volunteering young men using a Vitus Smart XXL body scanner. We manually measured height, waist, hip, buttock, and chest circumferences twice for each participant according to the WHO guidelines. The participants also filled in a basic questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean differences between the two scan measurements were smaller than between the two manual measurements, and precision as well as intra-class correlation coefficients were higher. Both techniques were strongly correlated. When comparing means between both techniques we found significant differences: Height was systematically shorter by 2.1 cm, whereas waist, hip and bust circumference measurements were larger in the scans by 1.17-4.37 cm. In consequence, body shape indices also became larger and the prevalence of overweight was greater when calculated from the scans. Between 4.1% and 7.3% of the probands changed risk category from normal to overweight when classified based on the scans. However, when employing regression analyses the two measurement techniques resulted in very similar coefficients, confidence intervals, and p-values. CONCLUSION: For performing a large number of measurements in a large group of probands in a short time, body scans generally showed good feasibility, reliability, and validity in comparison to manual measurements. The systematic differences between the methods may result from their technical nature (contact vs. non-contact).",PeerJ,2017,United States,2017,10
28647446,Social and Geographic Determinants of Hysterectomy in Ontario: A Population-Based Retrospective Cross-Sectional Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether social factors (neighbourhood education and income) and geographic factors (urban or rural dwelling and local service area) are associated with hysterectomy rates, proportion of hysterectomies performed minimally invasively, and hysterectomy complication and readmission rates in Ontario. METHODS: The Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database was used to perform a population-based retrospective cross-sectional study on women who had an abdominal, vaginal, and laparoscopic hysterectomy in 2007 for benign gynaecologic conditions in hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Crude and age-standardized rates of hysterectomy, proportion of hysterectomy performed minimally invasively (vaginal or laparoscopic), and rates of surgical complications were analyzed by neighbourhood educational attainment, neighbourhood income, rural or urban residency, and health service delivery area (Canadian Task Force Classification of Study Design II). RESULTS: A total of 13 511 women who underwent hysterectomy were included. Age-standardized hysterectomy rates were higher for the lowest neighbourhood educational quartile compared with the highest (relative risk [RR] 1.49; 95% CI 1.39-1.60), higher with rural compared with urban dwelling (RR 1.54; 95% CI 1.47-1.61), varied with local health service delivery area (Local Health Integration Network [LHIN]) (range 133.4-439.5 per 100 000 women), and also varied non-linearly with neighbourhood income quintile. Proportion of hysterectomies performed minimally invasively did not vary with neighbourhood education or income, were higher for rural compared with urban areas (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.03-1.19), and varied with LHIN (range 30.0-62.9 per 100 hysterectomies). Surgical complications varied with neighbourhood educational quartile, but not with income or urban or rural residence. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable social and geographic variation exists in rates of hysterectomy in Ontario, whereas only geographic variation is seen in use of minimally invasive routes. Surgical complication rates vary only by neighbourhood education. Such findings suggest inequities in hysterectomy practice in Ontario, and there is a need to evaluate factors influencing patients' decision making, physicians' clinical and surgical practice, and health system policies to help address the observed disparities.",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,2017 Oct,Netherlands,2017,10
25458718,Leading the way towards universal health coverage: a call to action.,"Policy innovations and lessons associated with the quest for universal health coverage in Latin America are the result of a complex epidemiological transition, an extended process of democratisation, and high economic growth in recent times that has facilitated additional investments in health. The goal of universal health coverage is part of a third generation of health-system reforms, which implies a comprehensive scope of policy interventions, including the introduction of explicit ethical frameworks, the enhanced attention to financial arrangements, and the transformation of major dimensions of the organisation of health systems. The call for action emphasises the next steps that could help reach the goal of universal health coverage both in the Latin American region and the rest of the developing world.","Lancet (London, England)",2015 Apr 4,England,2015,10
24848662,Medicalization of global health 4: The universal health coverage campaign and the medicalization of global health.,"Universal health coverage (UHC) has emerged as the leading and recommended overarching health goal on the post-2015 development agenda, and is promoted with fervour. UHC has the backing of major medical and health institutions, and is designed to provide patients with universal access to needed health services without financial hardship, but is also projected to have 'a transformative effect on poverty, hunger, and disease'. Multiple reports and resolutions support UHC and few offer critical analyses; but among these are concerns with imprecise definitions and the ability to implement UHC at the country level. A medicalization lens enriches these early critiques and identifies concerns that the UHC campaign contributes to the medicalization of global health. UHC conflates health with health care, thus assigning undue importance to (biomedical) health services and downgrading the social and structural determinants of health. There is poor evidence that UHC or health care alone improves population health outcomes, and in fact health care may worsen inequities. UHC is reductionistic because it focuses on preventative and curative actions delivered at the individual level, and ignores the social and political determinants of health and right to health that have been supported by decades of international work and commitments. UHC risks commodifying health care, which threatens the underlying principles of UHC of equity in access and of health care as a collective good.",Global health action,2014,United States,2014,10

Further, we assess how parental monitoring may be modified by pubertal maturation and older sibling risky behavior. Data on delinquent peer affiliation, pubertal maturation, parental monitoring, older sibling risky behavior, and dating involvement were gathered through observations and surveys from adolescents, mothers, older siblings, and teachers. Results indicate that lower levels of parental monitoring and higher levels of older sibling risky behavior were related to adolescents' dating involvement through delinquent peer affiliation. Pubertal maturation was directly related to dating involvement for early daters. Findings emphasize the value of examining social and biological factors, in concert, over time.",Journal of research on adolescence : the official journal of the Society for Research on Adolescence,2017 Mar,United States,2017,10
27566118,Correlates of Mental Illness and Wellbeing in Children: Are They the Same? Results From the UK Millennium Cohort Study.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate a framework of correlates of both mental illness and wellbeing in a large, current, and nationally representative sample of children in the United Kingdom. METHOD: An ecologic framework of correlates including individual (sociodemographic and human capital), family, social, and wider environmental factors were examined in 12,347 children aged 11 years old from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. Mental illness and wellbeing scores were standardized to allow comparisons, and the variance explained by the different predictors was estimated. RESULTS: Mental illness and wellbeing were weakly correlated in children (r = 0.2), and their correlates were similar in some instances (e.g., family structure, sibling bullying, peer problems) but differed in others (e.g., family income, perceived socioeconomic status, cognitive ability, health status, neighborhood safety). The predictors included in the study explained 47% of the variance in symptoms of mental illness, with social relationships, home environment, parent health, cognitive ability, socioeconomic status, and health factors predicting large amounts of variance. A comparatively lower 26% of the variance in wellbeing was explained by the study variables, with wider environment, social relationships, perceived socioeconomic status, and home environment predicting the most variance. CONCLUSION: Correlates of children's mental illness and wellbeing are largely distinct, stressing the importance of considering these concepts separately and avoiding their conflation. This study highlights the relevance of these findings for understanding social gradients in mental health through the life course and the conceptualization and development of mental illness and wellbeing in childhood as precursors to lifelong development in these domains.",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,2016 Sep,United States,2016,10
29033347,A multilevel stakeholder approach for identifying the determinants of implementation of government-funded community pharmacy services at the primary care level.,"BACKGROUND: A key early step to enhance the integration of community pharmacy services (CPSs) into primary care practice is identifying key determinants of practice (i.e., critical circumstances that influence the implementation of such services). Involving relevant stakeholders in identifying key determinants enables findings to be more relevant to the context in which CPSs will be implemented. OBJECTIVE: To identify key determinants of practice that can influence the implementation of government-funded CPSs in a primary health network in Australia. METHODS: A stakeholder collaborative approach was used, encompassing two phases. In the first phase, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ground-level stakeholders in Western Sydney between August 2016 to October 2016. Framework analysis was used to code and analyse the data from the interviews into determinants of pharmacy practice. In the second phase, a workshop was conducted with a mixed-group of ground-level and system-level stakeholders from the primary health network to identify key determinants. A four-quadrant prioritization matrix was employed in the workshop to classify determinants based on their importance and feasibility. RESULTS: Sixty-five determinants of practice that can influence CPS implementation were identified in Phase 1. These determinants were allocated at different levels of the healthcare system, and can exist as a barrier or facilitator or both. Twenty-two key determinants were selected in Phase 2, of which three were agreed to be addressed initially: (1) Patient understanding of the aims of the service; (2) Commitment of the organization and its leaders to provide services; (3) Coordination of the healthcare system to prompt collaboration between pharmacists and GPs. CONCLUSIONS: This collaborative stakeholder approach identified a set of key determinants of pharmacy practice in this Australian primary care setting. To enhance the implementation of CPSs in this region, initial efforts should be aimed at developing implementation strategies based on these key determinants of practice.",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,2018 Aug,United States,2018,10
22554124,Predictors of knowledge of H1N1 infection and transmission in the U.S. population.,"BACKGROUND: The strength of a society's response to a public health emergency depends partly on meeting the needs of all segments of the population, especially those who are most vulnerable and subject to greatest adversity. Since the early stages of the H1N1 pandemic, public communication of H1N1 information has been recognized as a challenging issue. Public communication is considered a critical public health task to mitigating adverse population health outcomes before, during, and after public health emergencies. To investigate knowledge and knowledge gaps in the general population regarding the H1N1 pandemic, and to identify the social determinants associated with those gaps, we conducted a survey in March 2010 using a representative random sample of U.S. households. METHODS: Data were gathered from 1,569 respondents (66.3% response rate) and analyzed using ordered logistic regression to study the impact of socioeconomic factors and demographic characteristics on the individual's knowledge concerning H1N1 infection and transmission. RESULTS: Results suggest that level of education and home ownership, reliable indicators of socioeconomic position (SEP), were associated with knowledge of H1N1. Level of education was found to be directly associated with level of knowledge about virus transmission [OR = 1.35, 95% C.I. 1.12-1.63]. Home ownership versus renting was also positively associated with knowledge on the signs and symptoms of H1N1 infection in particular [OR = 2.89, 95% C.I. 1.26-6.66]. CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers and public health practitioners should take specific SEP factors into consideration when implementing educational and preventive interventions promoting the health and preparedness of the population, and when designing communication campaigns during a public health emergency.",BMC public health,2012 May 3,England,2012,10
31831535,Factors influencing active tuberculosis case-finding policy development and implementation: a scoping review.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore antecedents, components and influencing factors on active case-finding (ACF) policy development and implementation. DESIGN: Scoping review, searching MEDLINE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the World Health Organization (WHO) Library from January 1968 to January 2018. We excluded studies focusing on latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, passive case-finding, childhood TB and studies about effectiveness, yield, accuracy and impact without descriptions of how this evidence has/could influence ACF policy or implementation. We included any type of study written in English, and conducted frequency and thematic analyses. RESULTS: Seventy-three articles fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Most (67%) were published after 2010. The studies were conducted in all WHO regions, but primarily in Africa (22%), Europe (23%) and the Western-Pacific region (12%). Forty-one percent of the studies were classified as quantitative, followed by reviews (22%) and qualitative studies (12%). Most articles focused on ACF for tuberculosis contacts (25%) or migrants (32%). Fourteen percent of the articles described community-based screening of high-risk populations. Fifty-nine percent of studies reported influencing factors for ACF implementation; mostly linked to the health system (eg, resources) and the community/individual (eg, social determinants of health). Only two articles highlighted factors influencing ACF policy development (eg, politics). Six articles described WHO's ACF-related recommendations as important antecedent for ACF. Key components of successful ACF implementation include health system capacity, mechanisms for integration, education and collaboration for ACF. CONCLUSION: We identified some main themes regarding the antecedents, components and influencing factors for ACF policy development and implementation. While we know much about facilitators and barriers for ACF policy implementation, we know less about how to strengthen those facilitators and how to overcome those barriers. A major knowledge gap remains when it comes to understanding which contextual factors influence ACF policy development. Research is required to understand, inform and improve ACF policy development and implementation.",BMJ open,2019 Dec 11,England,2019,10
28056891,"Addressing health inequities in Ontario, Canada: what solutions do the public support?","BACKGROUND: As public opinion is an important part of the health equity policy agenda, it is important to assess public opinion around potential policy interventions to address health inequities. We report on public opinion in Ontario about health equity interventions that address the social determinants of health. We also examine Ontarians' support and predictors for targeted health equity interventions versus universal interventions. METHODS: We surveyed 2,006 adult Ontarians through a telephone survey using random digit dialing. Descriptive statistics assessed Ontarians' support for various health equity solutions, and a multinomial logistic regression model was built to examine predictors of this support across specific targeted and broader health equity interventions focused on nutrition, welfare, and housing. RESULTS: There appears to be mixed opinions among Ontarians regarding the importance of addressing health inequities and related solutions. Nevertheless, Ontarians were willing to support a wide range of interventions to address health inequities. The three most supported interventions were more subsidized nutritious food for children (89%), encouraging more volunteers in the community (89%), and more healthcare treatment programs (85%). Respondents who attributed health inequities to the plight of the poor were generally more likely to support both targeted and broader health equity interventions, than neither type. Political affiliation was a strong predictor of support with expected patterns, with left-leaning voters more likely to support both targeted and broader health equity interventions, and right-leaning voters less likely to support both types of interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that the Ontario public is more supportive of targeted health equity interventions, but that attributions of inequities and political affiliation are important predictors of support. The Ontario public may be accepting of messaging around health inequities and the social determinants of health depending on how the message is framed (e.g., plight of the poor vs. privilege of the rich). These findings may be instructive for advocates looking to raise awareness of health inequities.",BMC public health,2017 Jan 5,England,2017,10
22369675,Determinants of adult functional outcome in adolescents receiving special educational assistance.,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the role of IQ, autistic traits and challenging behaviours in affecting adult outcomes among adolescents who receive special educational assistance. METHODS: A total of 58 participants were recruited from an ongoing longitudinal study. All received assessments of IQ, behavioural patterns (using the Childhood Behaviour Checklist - CBCL) and autistic traits (using the Social Communication Questionnaire - SCQ) during adolescence and were followed up 6 years later (at a mean age of 22 years) using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHO-DAS II) to assess functional outcome. RESULTS: A significant positive relationship was found between CBCL score and WHO-DAS II score (beta = 0.511, P = 0.001). IQ score showed a negative relationship with total WHO-DAS II score (beta = -0.247, P = 0.04). SCQ score was not found to significantly influence total WHO-DAS II score (beta = -0.028, P = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Although the role of global intellectual ability is important, these results stress the highly predictive value of adolescent behaviours on functional outcomes in adult life among young adults receiving special educational assistance.",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,2013 Aug,England,2013,10

Adult men and women were interviewed in depth, using a detailed checklist by the first author. A total of 1239 respondents 634 women and 605 men, were interviewed, only 44 women (7%) claimed that they had earlier participated in leprosy work, about 92% of the women felt that they had the potential to take part in leprosy work, and 70% showed willingness to participate. Factors that would encourage and facilitate more women to participate in leprosy work, included financial support (32.8%), convincing the family to grant permission (88%), and delegating them to work in proximity to their residences (15%). Some women respondents (11.0%) felt that they would provide their services voluntarily for social good. Women suggested that work should be delegated as per their capabilities and skills, and they should be given proper orientation, training and guidance. Hardly 5% of ASHA's in the clusters examined participated in leprosy related work, which needs stringent steps to re-orient and encourage them to undertake leprosy related work. It is concluded that rural Indian women are keen to play an important role in the national leprosy eradication program, with minimal support from the government and nongovernmental agencies in a truly community-based approach. This will benefit vast numbers of leprosy affected women as well as others.",Indian journal of leprosy,2014 Jul-Sep,India,2014,10
22329910,The economic impact of stroke in The Netherlands: the euro-Restore4Stroke study.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke has a considerable socio-economic impact worldwide and is the leading cause of disabilities in the Western world. Economic studies of stroke focus merely on physical aspects and clinical interventions. To our current knowledge there is no comprehensive economic study investigating the economic impact of stroke including psychological and social aspects. The euro-Restore4Stroke project, part of a large comprehensive research programme Restore4Stroke, aims to investigate the total economic impact of stroke in the Netherlands. METHODS: Two trial-based economic evaluation studies will be conducted within the euro-Restore4Stroke project: one focussing on a self-management intervention and one on an augmented cognitive behavioural therapy intervention. Both include cost-effectiveness analyses and cost-utility analyses as primary research methods. Furthermore, a cost-of-illness study investigating costs after stroke attached to a cohort study and a record linkage study in which four databases are linked to investigate patterns of health care consumption before and after stroke, are embedded in euro-Restore4Stroke. All studies will be performed from a societal perspective. The primary outcome measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis is the increase in health status on the primary outcome scales. Within the cost-utility analysis, the primary outcome measure is quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for which an indirect preference-based technique will be used. In the self-management study we will also look at the estimation of health effects on informal caregivers. Cost outcomes in the cost-of-illness study will be computed with a cost questionnaire and linkage of several databases will be used to derive outcomes in the record linkage study. DISCUSSION: euro-Restore4Stroke will provide new insights and evidence for the economic impact of psychosocial consequences after stroke. Besides being innovative in various ways (i.e. focussing on the chronic phase after stroke and including personal factors as possible determinants of long-term re-integration including quality of life in a prospective longitudinal design), a major strength of euro-Restore4Stroke is that we include impact on informal caregivers. The outcomes of this study will provide health care decision makers with valuable and necessary information regarding stroke care related decisions.

28676190,Barriers to Addressing Social Determinants of Health in Pediatric Nursing Practice: An Integrative Review.,"PROBLEM: Despite a substantial body of knowledge regarding the importance of the social determinants of health, recognizing and responding to the psychosocial circumstances of seriously and chronically ill children and their families is not well established in routine pediatric nursing care. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The search process focused on psychological and social determinants and care in the healthcare setting. Searches were limited to research and review publications written in the English language. The quality of evidence was graded using the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. RESULTS: Thirteen publications were identified for inclusion. Healthcare providers do recognize emotional distress experienced by patients, but feel unable to address psychosocial issues due to the lack of time, a lack of confidence in their own communication skills, and the perception that patients and their families prioritize physical care over psychosocial care. For patients and their families the main issue was that the healthcare system was focused on physical care with little opportunity to talk about psychosocial concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest barrier to addressing the social determinants of health in the pediatric context is the dominance of the 'medical model' of care. Also, many healthcare providers believe that they lack the communication skills necessary to talk about psychosocial issues. IMPLICATIONS: The way forward will be to empower nurses through the sharing of knowledge of the social determinants of health, the development of skills in relationship building and therapeutic communication, and the mentorship of compassionate family-centered care.",Journal of pediatric nursing,2017 Nov - Dec,United States,2017,10
24281310,Views of parents in four European countries about the effect of food on the mental performance of primary school children.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Several factors affect the mental performance of children. The importance that parents attribute to food-related determinants, compared with genetic, socio-economic and school environment, was investigated. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Parents of school children (aged 4-11) were recruited through state primary schools in four European countries. Interviews were conducted in which participants were asked to sort 18 cards representing possible determinants of four elements of mental performance (attention, learning, mood and behaviour) according to perceived strength of effect. Determinants were identified from the literature and grouped in six categories: food-related, school environment, physical, social, psychological and biological. Effects were scored: 0=none; 1=moderate; and 2=strong. Views were compared between and within countries. RESULTS: Two hundred parents took part (England: 53; Germany: 45; Hungary: 52; Spain: 50). Differences existed between countries in the proportions reporting university education and being in employment. Taking all countries together, parents consider the food category (mean 1.33) to have a lower impact on a child's mental performance than physical (activity and sleep, 1.77), psychological (mood and behaviour, 1.69) and school environment (1.57). Social (1.12) and biological (0.91) determinants were ranked lower than food. Of determinants in the food category, parents thought regularity of meals had more influence on mental performance (1.58) than what a child eats now (1.36), food at school (1.35), nutrition as a baby/infant (1.02). CONCLUSION: Scope exists to improve parental awareness of the repercussions of their dietary choices for the mental performance of their children.",European journal of clinical nutrition,2014 Jan,England,2014,10
27434718,New views on global child health: global solutions for care of vulnerable children in the United States.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper provides a brief overview of the current landscape of global child health and the impact of social determinants on the world's children. In the United States (US), global child health (GCH) has increasingly been highlighted as a priority area by national organizations, such as the National Academy of Medicine and American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as individual pediatricians committed to ensuring the health of all children regardless of geographic location. Although GCH is commonly used to refer to the health of children outside of the US, here, we highlight the recent call for GCH to also include care of US vulnerable children. Many of the lessons learned from abroad can be applied to pediatrics domestically by addressing social determinants that contribute to health disparities. RECENT FINDINGS: Using the 'three-delay' framework, effective global health interventions target delays in seeking, accessing, and/or receiving adequate care. In resource-limited, international settings, novel health system strengthening approaches, such as peer groups, community health workers, health vouchers, cultural humility training, and provision of family-centered care, can mitigate barriers to healthcare and improve access to medical services. SUMMARY: The creative use of limited resources for pediatric care internationally may offer insight into effective strategies to address health challenges that children face here in the US. The growing number of child health providers with clinical experience in resource-limited, low-income countries can serve as an unforeseen yet formidable resource for improving pediatric care in underserved US communities.",Current opinion in pediatrics,2016 Oct,United States,2016,10
23026889,From perception to functional outcome in schizophrenia: modeling the role of ability and motivation.,"CONTEXT Schizophrenia remains a highly disabling disorder, but the specific determinants and pathways that lead to functional impairment are not well understood. It is not known whether these key determinants of outcome lie on 1 or multiple pathways. OBJECTIVE To evaluate theoretically based models of pathways to functional outcome starting with early visual perception. The intervening variables were previously established determinants of outcome drawn from 2 general categories: ability (ie, social cognition and functional capacity) and beliefs/motivation (ie, defeatist beliefs, expressive and experiential negative symptoms). We evaluated an integrative model in which these intervening variables formed a single pathway to poor outcome. DESIGN This was a cross-sectional study that applied structural equation modeling to evaluate the relationships among determinants of functional outcome in schizophrenia. SETTING Assessments were conducted at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS One hundred ninety-one clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited from the community. RESULTS A measurement model showed that the latent variables of perception, social cognition, and functional outcome were well reflected by their indicators. An initial untrimmed structural model with functional capacity, defeatist beliefs, and expressive and experiential negative symptoms had good model fit. A final trimmed model was a single path running from perception to ability to motivational variables to outcome. It was more parsimonious and had better fit indices than the untrimmed model. Further, it could not be improved by adding or dropping connections that would change the single path to multiple paths. The indirect effect from perception to outcome was significant. CONCLUSIONS The final structural model was a single pathway running from perception to ability to beliefs/motivation to outcome. Hence, both ability and motivation appear to be needed for community functioning and can be modeled effectively on the same pathway.",Archives of general psychiatry,2012 Dec,United States,2012,10
30566808,[The Effect of Medical Social Characteristics and Style of Life of Mothers on Premature Delivery Risks in the Arctic Region of the Russian Federation].,"The article presents the analysis of distribution of medical social characteristics and determinants of style of life of mothers in the groups with premature and urgent/delayed deliveries registered in the Register of deliveries of the Arkhangelsk oblast from 01.01.12 to 31.12.14 (n = 43 327). As compared with the group of urgent/delayed deliveries in the group of premature deliveries (n = 2458 or 5.8% of total number of deliveries), the analysis revealed a large percentage mothers characterizing by non-working, single or without marriage registration, smoking, alcohol abusing, lately registered with their pregnancy, lower education level, aged 35 and older, surplus body mass/obesity. The regression analysis generating odds ratio adjusted to all analyzed characteristics, established statistically reliable increasing of risk of premature delivery in primipara and secundipara females older than 35 years and also having the mentioned risk factors except absence of employment of mother. The established risk factors of premature delivery are to be considered in planning activities on their prevention at the individual level.","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",2018 Sep,Russia (Federation),2018,10
26355562,How could she? Psychosocial analysis of ten homicide cases committed by women.,"OBJECTIVE: Ten percent of all homicide perpetrators are female and homicidal acts committed by women are mostly a result of interpersonal conflicts. We carried out a retrospective psychosocial analysis of ten homicide cases committed by women with an urban mid-European background. We evaluated characteristic determinants regarding 1) deed circumstances and motives, 2) the perpetrators, and 3) the victims. Results were compared with the literature on female and male homicides. METHOD: Autopsy records of the Institute of Legal Medicine of the University Hospital of Dusseldorf, Germany, during the time period from 2006 to 2011 were searched for homicides committed by female perpetrators. Prosecution files were reviewed for further information. RESULTS: The sample comprised N = 10 female homicide perpetrators and eleven victims. The mentioned determinants of the homicide were fairly consistent. All deeds occurred in the domestic context; they were mostly unplanned. All perpetrators were socially isolated and faced socially challenging situations. Most perpetrators were of low socioeconomic status. Furthermore, all victims were helpless and/or dependent on the perpetrator. The presence of a major psychiatric disorder was uncommon and, in contrast to male perpetrators, most women had no previous convictions. DISCUSSION: The potential value of these core findings in our sample regarding prevention is discussed.",Journal of forensic and legal medicine,2015 Nov,England,2015,10

To prevent re-introduction, receptivity, vulnerability, and health system capacity of foci should be monitored using appropriate tools. This study aimed to design an applicable model to monitor predicting factors of re-introduction of malaria in highly prone areas. METHODS: This exploratory, descriptive study was conducted in a pre-elimination setting with a high-risk of malaria transmission re-introduction. By using nominal group technique and literature review, a list of predicting indicators for malaria re-introduction and outbreak was defined. Accordingly, a checklist was developed and completed in the field for foci affected by re-introduction and for cleared-up foci as a control group, for a period of 12 weeks before re-introduction and for the same period in the previous year. Using field data and analytic hierarchical process (AHP), each variable and its sub-categories were weighted, and by calculating geometric means for each sub-category, score of corresponding cells of interaction matrices, lower and upper threshold of different risks strata, including low and mild risk of re-introduction and moderate and high risk of malaria outbreaks, were determined. The developed predictive model was calibrated through resampling with different sets of explanatory variables using R software. Sensitivity and specificity of the model were calculated based on new samples. RESULTS: Twenty explanatory predictive variables of malaria re-introduction were identified and a predictive model was developed. Unpermitted immigrants from endemic neighbouring countries were determined as a pivotal factor (AHP score: 0.181). Moreover, quality of population movement (0.114), following malaria transmission season (0.088), average daily minimum temperature in the previous 8 weeks (0.062), an outdoor resting shelter for vectors (0.045), and rainfall (0.042) were determined. Positive and negative predictive values of the model were 81.8 and 100 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduced a new, simple, yet reliable model to forecast malaria re-introduction and outbreaks eight weeks in advance in pre-elimination and elimination settings. The model incorporates comprehensive deterministic factors that can easily be measured in the field, thereby facilitating preventive measures.",Malaria journal,2016 Mar 2,England,2016,10
29881520,"Risky behaviors of taxi drivers in Bandar Abbas, Iran.","Background and aim: It has been revealed that taxi drivers break more traffic rules than ordinary drivers. Such risky behaviors include stopping at prohibited areas and sudden change of direction. The present study aimed to determine the Risky Behaviors of Taxi Drivers in Bandar Abbas, Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 184 taxi drivers were randomly selected from eight taxi stations located at different parts of Bandar Abbas city in 2016. Taxi drivers' risky behaviors were evaluated via a 20-item questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 19, using descriptive statistics and independent-samples t-test. The p-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the drivers was 45.1 (+/-11.1) years. The mean of their occupational experience was 18.7 (+/-10.8) years. The risky behaviors which showed the highest frequency were respectively, failure to use signal-lights, driving too close to the cars in front, refusing to drive within the lanes and erratic lane changing.The lowest frequency belonged to running a red light, ignoring 'no entry' signs and taking illegal U-turns. Risky driving behaviors were shown to be significantly more prevalent among drivers with previous experience of crashes or tickets than drivers with no such experiences (p<0.01). Conclusion: Increasing the role of police supervision for the strict implementation of driving laws, and modification of the drivers' behavior and implementation of periodic training programs on drivers' safety issues can be considered for reducing taxi drivers' unsafe behaviors.",Electronic physician,2018 Apr,Iran,2018,10
29369113,The Influence of Presurgical Factors on the Rehabilitation Outcome of Patients Following Hip Arthroplasty.,"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationship between sociodemographic information, anthropometric values, clinical and presurgery factors, and length of stay (LOS) in older adult patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to predict which factors can delay the start of the rehabilitation program and increase the corresponding LOS. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in an orthopedic inpatient unit with 40 patients undergoing THA. FINDINGS: The Morse Fall Scale scores and pain intensity scores delayed the commencement of the rehabilitation program. Gender and social support were important determinants of LOS and rehabilitation outcome following THA. The weight of the lower limb without osteoarthritis followed by pain intensity and overweight patients also influenced LOS. CONCLUSIONS/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Functional outcomes after THA are variable, and the rehabilitation process is an important factor to regain their normal level of physical functioning. This factor can have an impact in the discharge of patients, in resource allocation and in health care of older adult patients.",Rehabilitation nursing : the official journal of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses,2019 Jul/Aug,United States,2019,10
29377503,Association between sociodemographic determinants and health outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes in Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: Concurrent multifactorial treatment is needed to reduce consequent risks of diabetes, yet most studies investigating the relationship between sociodemographic factors and health outcomes have focused on only one risk factor at a time. Swedish health care is mainly tax-funded, thus providing an environment that should facilitate equal health outcomes in patients, independent of background, socioeconomic status, or health profile. This study aimed at investigating the association between several sociodemographic factors and diabetes-related health outcomes represented by HbA1c , systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, predicted 5-year risk of cardiovascular disease, and statin use. METHODS: This large retrospective registry study was based on patient-level data from individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during 2010 to 2011 (n = 416,228) in any of 7 Swedish regions (~65% of the Swedish population). Health equity in diabetes care analysed through multivariate regression analyses on intermediary outcomes (HbA1c , systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein), predicted 5-year risk of cardiovascular disease and process (i.e., statin use) after 1-year follow-up, adjusting for several sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: We observed differences in intermediary risk measures, predicted 5-year risk of cardiovascular disease, and process dependent on place of birth, sex, age, education, and social setting, despite Sweden's articulated vision of equal health care. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes patients' health was associated with sociodemographic prerequisites. Furthermore, in addition to demographics (age and sex) and disease history, educational level, marital status, and region of birth are important factors to consider when benchmarking health outcomes, e.g., average HbA1c level, and evaluating the level of health equity between organizational units or between different administrative regions.",Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,2018 May,England,2018,10

However, there is the existence of socioeconomic-related inequalities in dental service utilization, especially denture service. The aim of this study was to assess the determinants associated with inequalities in denture service utilization among older Thai people using the Andersen Behavioural model. METHOD: This cross-sectional study involved secondary data analysis of the 2014 survey of older Thai people (N = 38,695). The dependent variable was a public denture service utilization over the past 5 years. Determinants were classified as predisposing and enabling factors. Predisposing variables included age, sex, education, economic condition and dependency status. Enabling variables included working status, health behaviours, health care utilization experience and social/community support. Data were analysed by using bivariate and multivariable analyses at alpha = 0.05. For bivariate analysis, chi-square test was used to determine the association between dependent and each independent variable. Then, all variables were incorporated into a multivariable binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds of denture service utilization were significantly higher for individuals who were older, female, and had a higher educational level and health-promoting behaviors. A positive dose-response relationship was demonstrated between denture service utilization and increased quartile of household assets. CONCLUSIONS: Predisposing variables had a greater impact than enabling variables in denture service utilization among older Thai people. Despite free public denture service, socioeconomic-related inequalities persist. The government needs to reduce socioeconomic disparities to improve denture treatment inequality.",BMC oral health,2019 Oct 15,England,2019,10
30789825,An exploratory study into social and healthcare variables of maternal mortality: a case-control study.,"Background Regarding the important role the mothers' health plays in shaping nations' well-being, this study endeavored to explore the main social and healthcare factors related to maternal mortality. Methods In this case-control study, data (viz., all maternal mortalities) were gathered from the national maternal mortality surveillance system. Likewise, control data (viz., alive mothers) were obtained from mother health records in 22 health centers located in 21 cities of Isfahan, Iran. The data were related to the years 2001-2016. Case and control groups were matched according to year of delivery, mother's age at delivery time and city of residence. Results Analysis of the gathered data revealed that during the years 2001-2016, 171 maternal mortalities occurred in Isfahan. In view of that, 523 mothers were selected as the control group. Most of the mothers attended high school (36%), were housewives (64%), delivered by cesarean section (59%) and suffered from different kinds of proximate medical causes (55%). The logistic regression results showed that being an immigrant, having a history of proximate medical cause, vaginal delivery and illiteracy raised the odds ratios (ORs) of maternal mortality up to 5.87, 4.41, 2.28 and 1.84 times, respectively. In contrast, using public antenatal care and planned pregnancy have had a protective, significant effect on maternal mortality (ORs <1). Conclusion The results suggested that in addition to social factors including immigrant status and low level of education which led to the increase of maternal mortality, healthcare factors including proximate medical causes, delivery method and antenatal care seem to be essential in tackling the issue of maternal mortality.",Journal of perinatal medicine,2019 May 27,Germany,2019,10
23376305,"Sense of place as a determinant of people's attitudes towards the environment: implications for natural resources management and planning in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.","Integrating people's values and perceptions into planning is essential for the successful management of natural resources. However, successful implementation of natural resources management decisions on the ground is a complex task, which requires a comprehensive understanding of a system's social and ecological linkages. This paper investigates the relationship between sense of place and people's attitudes towards their natural environment. Sense of place contributes towards shaping peoples' beliefs, values and commitments. Here, we set out to explore how these theoretical contributions can be operationalized for natural resources management planning in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia. We hypothesise that the region's diverse range of natural resources, conservation values and management pressures might be reflected in people's attachment to place. To tests this proposition, variables capturing socio-demographics, personal wellbeing and a potential for sense of place were collected via mail-out survey of 372 residents of the region, and tested for relationships using multivariate regression and redundancy orientation analyses. Results indicate that place of residence within the region, involvement in community activities, country of birth and the length of time respondents lived in the region are important determinants of the values assigned to factors related to the natural environment. This type of information is readily available from National Census and thus could be incorporated into the planning of community engagement strategies early in the natural resources management planning process. A better understanding of the characteristics that allow sense of place meanings to develop can facilitate a better understanding of people's perceptions towards environmental and biodiversity issues. We suggest that the insights gained from this study can benefit environmental decision making and planning in the Great Barrier Reef region; and that sense of place is a concept worthy of further investigation elsewhere.",Journal of environmental management,2013 Mar 15,England,2013,10
30479300,Contextual factors associated with consistent condom use and condom self-efficacy amongst African asylum seekers and refugees in Hong Kong.,"BACKGROUND: Hong Kong has no systematic domestic policies committed to the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees (ASRs). This study explores the sexual health behaviours and social inequities amongst African ASRs in Hong Kong. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of African ASRs was conducted through three local non-governmental organizations in 2013. A logistic model was used to test the interactions and relationship between the respondents' consistent condom use and contextual antecedents, socio-demographic factors, psychosocial factors and condom self-efficacy (CSE) score. RESULTS: 371 adult African ASRs were recruited. In the previous month, 35% and 38% of participants consistently had used condoms with regular and casual sexual partners respectively. However, less than 50% perceived no risk of HIV/STIs and less than 60% reported not knowing how to access sexual health screening. Consistent condom use was less likely among African ASRs who were married (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.10), used recreational drugs (aOR = 0.11) or were unsure of their sexual orientation (aOR = 0.05) and was positively associated with higher CSE scores (aOR = 1.09) Pre-migration determinants and lifestyle determinants accounted for most of the variance in the model. CONCLUSION: The inconsistent condom use makes African ASRs vulnerable to HIV/STIs. Tailored interventions are needed to address the associated determinants and inequities amongst African ASRs living in Hong Kong.","Infection, disease & health",2018 Mar,Netherlands,2018,10
28558747,Weather and children's physical activity; how and why do relationships vary between countries?,"BACKGROUND: Globally most children do not engage in enough physical activity. Day length and weather conditions have been identified as determinants of physical activity, although how they may be overcome as barriers is not clear. We aim to examine if and how relationships between children's physical activity and weather and day length vary between countries and identify settings in which children were better able to maintain activity levels given the weather conditions they experienced. METHODS: In this repeated measures study, we used data from 23,451 participants in the International Children's Accelerometry Database (ICAD). Daily accelerometer-measured physical activity (counts per minute; cpm) was matched to local weather conditions and the relationships assessed using multilevel regression models. Multilevel models accounted for clustering of days within occasions within children within study-cities, and allowed us to explore if and how the relationships between weather variables and physical activity differ by setting. RESULTS: Increased precipitation and wind speed were associated with decreased cpm while better visibility and more hours of daylight were associated with increased cpm. Models indicated that increases in these variables resulted in average changes in mean cpm of 7.6/h of day length, -13.2/cm precipitation, 10.3/10 km visibility and -10.3/10kph wind speed (all p < 0.01). Temperature showed a cubic relationship with cpm, although between 0 and 20 degrees C the relationship was broadly linear. Age showed interactions with temperature and precipitation, with the associations larger among younger children. In terms of geographic trends, participants from Northern European countries and Melbourne, Australia were the most active, and also better maintained their activity levels given the weather conditions they experienced compared to those in the US and Western Europe. CONCLUSIONS: We found variation in the relationship between weather conditions and physical activity between ICAD studies and settings. Children in Northern Europe and Melbourne, Australia were not only more active on average, but also more active given the weather conditions they experienced. Future work should consider strategies to mitigate the impacts of weather conditions, especially among young children, and interventions involving changes to the physical environment should consider how they will operate in different weather conditions.",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2017 May 30,England,2017,10
27039759,"Social Determinants of Health and Tobacco Use in Five Low and Middle-Income Countries - Results from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), 2011 - 2012.","BACKGROUND: Tobacco consumption continues to be the leading cause of preventable deaths globally. The objective of this study was to examine the associaton of selected socio-demographic variables with current tobacco use in five countries that participated in the Phase II Global Adult Tobacco Survey in 2011 - 2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed internationally comparable representative household survey data from 33,482 respondents aged >/= 15 years in Indonesia, Malaysia, Romania, Argentina and Nigeria for determinants of tobacco use within each country. Socio-demographic variables analysed included gender, age, residency, education, wealth index and awareness of smoking health consequences. Current tobacco use was defined as smoking or use of smokeless tobacco daily or occasionally. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of tobacco use varied from 5.5% in Nigeria to 35.7% in Indonesia and was significantly higher among males than females in all five countries. Odds ratios for current tobacco use were significantly higher among males for all countries [with the greatest odds among Indonesian men (OR=67.4, 95% CI: 51.2-88.7)] and among urban dwellers in Romania. The odds of current tobacco use decreased as age increased for all countries except Nigeria where. The reverse was true for Argentina and Nigeria. Significant trends for decreasing tobacco use with increasing educational levels and wealth index were seen in Indonesia, Malaysia and Romania. Significant negative associations between current tobacco use and awareness of adverse health consequences of smoking were found in all countries except Argentina. CONCLUSIONS: Males and the socially and economically disadvantaged populations are at the greatest risk of tobacco use. Tobacco control interventions maybe tailored to this segment of population and incorporate educational interventions to increase knowledge of adverse health consequences of smoking.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2016,Thailand,2016,10
29193457,Factors associated with adoption of coping strategies among Chinese patients with heart failure in ethnic minority regions.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the coping strategies in patients with heart failure (HF) in the ethnic minority regions of China and to explore the factors affecting the adoption of coping strategies. BACKGROUND: Effective coping with illness is an important element that influences the adaptation and increases the patient quality of life. Although different factors have been proposed to be determinants of coping strategy, findings are inconclusive, especially when it comes to the cultural background. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed. METHODS: A total of 360 HF patients in four districts of Xinjiang were enrolled. All participants completed the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, the Minnesota Living with HF Questionnaire and self-management Questionnaire. RESULTS: Heart failure patients had lower scores in confrontation and higher scores in avoidance and acceptance resignation than patients in the Chinese norm. The multiple regression analysis revealed several factors that indicate confrontation coping including symptom management, employment status and psychological and social management, whereas religion (R2), disease duration, employment status and payment system (P2) were identified as indicators of avoidance coping. In addition, ethnicity (E1), disease duration and employment status were indicators of acceptance resignation coping. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings from this study suggest that HF patients in the ethnic minority regions may use less confrontation coping and more avoidance and acceptance resignation coping than patients in the Chinese norm. Moreover, the cultural background, duration of disease, quality of life and self-management play important roles in the selection of HF coping strategy. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The disparities of racial/ethnic exist in coping strategy. Healthcare providers are required to better understand the role of religion in the coping process and how it contributes to the selection of coping strategies.",Journal of clinical nursing,2018 Sep,England,2018,10
29217389,Competencies for engaging high-needs patients in primary care.,"BACKGROUND: Patients who heavily utilize hospitals and emergency departments frequently have complex needs requiring services spanning medical, behavioral, and social service sectors. This study identifies essential competencies for caring for high-needs patients and highlights their importance to primary care delivery. METHODS: Transcripts of in-depth interviews with 30 clinical and administrative staff at 23 complex care programs across the United States were analyzed using standard qualitative techniques. Selected programs had several years of experience in serving patients with multiple chronic conditions, serious mental illness, substance use disorders, severe poverty, and homelessness. These programs exemplified diverse models (assertive community treatment, housing first, behavioral health, high utilizer), and all of them shared the common element of integrating primary care into their services. RESULTS: Competencies, including those known and taught in other fields, have distinctive application to informing delivery of high quality primary care to populations with complex needs, including: motivational interviewing for establishing patients' priorities and helping them improve their health on their own terms; trauma-informed care for modifying primary care procedures to mitigate the ill-effects of prior trauma prevalent in this population; and harm reduction for altering medical regimens to accommodate constraints on what patients are able or willing to do. Other capabilities, cultivated by these programs, include empathizing with patients, promoted by exposure to simulations of patient experiences (e.g., hearing voices); as well as withholding judgment and counteracting patient passivity to foster open discussion of treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of deliberate attention to equipping providers with specific competencies for caring for high-needs patients may contribute to lack of patient engagement and sub-optimal outcomes, ultimately undermining the success of programs serving these populations.","Healthcare (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2018 Jun,Netherlands,2018,10
25133786,Potential determinants of drink driving in young adults.,"OBJECTIVE: The main purposes of this study were to examine the usefulness of the variables of the theory of planned behavior (viz. attitudes, social norms, and self-efficacy) and to explore the relationship between optimism bias and drink driving in young adults. In addition, we explored gender differences in drink driving with provision for the effect of variables such as driving frequency and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Data were collected via a questionnaire administered to 274 drivers (59.9% females) aged 18-30 years (24.36 +/- 2.96). RESULTS: The results obtained with provision for driving frequency revealed substantial differences in driving behaviors between genders. Thus, males were more prone to drink driving, perceived less disapproval by their significant others (parents and peers), and felt less able to avoid drinking-and-driving situations. In addition, they self-reported more frequent alcohol consumption and driving under the influence. The results also confirm the significance of peers' subjective norms and attitudes to drink driving in males. Overconfidence in their own driving skills for driving drunk and perceived behavioral control were found to be significant predictors for drink driving in females. Optimism bias also played a slightly significant role in predicting drink driving but only in females. CONCLUSIONS: The important practical implications of these results with a view to designing effective interventions to prevent the risks associated with drink driving in the young population are discussed. Interventions should focus on young people's perceptions of group norms and promoting cautionary driving choices and alternatives to drink driving.",Traffic injury prevention,2015,England,2015,10
31325290,Social Cognitive Theories and Electronic Health Design: Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: There are several social cognitive theories (SCTs) and models that support platform design in electronic health (eHealth) promotion trials. The rationale for this scoping review was to determine how social design features (informational aid, expressive support, gaming, and tailored content) are used to promote self-efficacy, engagement, knowledge, and behavior change. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review a broad spectrum of digital health interventions in the literature seeking trials that use SCTs for the design of eHealth applications. METHODS: The author conducted a systematic scoping review of 161 Web-based health interventions from published randomized clinical trials using 1 or more tools to address the social cognitive determinants in their website design from January 2006 to April 2016. An iterative approach was used in the selection of studies and data extraction. The studies were analyzed for quality and coded for type of social design features employed. RESULTS: Expressive interaction tools were found in 48.6% (54/111) of studies categorized as a strong recommendation by the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Overall, less than half of the studies addressed participant social support and motivational needs (43.8%). The vast majority of studies (100%) relied on the use of the Web for delivery of informational aid and tailored content for the individual participant (75.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This review fills a research gap by linking social theory to Web strategy to improve the impact and sustainability of eHealth interventions. A Digital Health Intervention Model was developed to provide a framework to enhance future Web-based health intervention design and execution.",JMIR human factors,2019 Jul 19,Canada,2019,10
29971779,Pre-diagnostic circulating insulin-like growth factor-I and bladder cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.,"Previous in vitro and case-control studies have found an association between the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-axis and bladder cancer risk. Circulating concentrations of IGF-I have also been found to be associated with an increased risk of several cancer types; however, the relationship between pre-diagnostic circulating IGF-I concentrations and bladder cancer has never been studied prospectively. We investigated the association of pre-diagnostic plasma concentrations of IGF-I with risk of overall bladder cancer and urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) in a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. A total of 843 men and women diagnosed with bladder cancer between 1992 and 2005 were matched with 843 controls by recruitment centre, sex, age at recruitment, date of blood collection, duration of follow-up, time of day and fasting status at blood collection using an incidence density sampling protocol. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for smoking status. No association was found between pre-diagnostic circulating IGF-I concentration and overall bladder cancer risk (adjusted OR for highest versus lowest fourth: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.66-1.24, ptrend = 0.40) or UCC (n of cases = 776; 0.91, 0.65-1.26, ptrend = 0.40). There was no significant evidence of heterogeneity in the association of IGF-I with bladder cancer risk by tumour aggressiveness, sex, smoking status, or by time between blood collection and diagnosis (pheterogeneity > 0.05 for all). This first prospective study indicates no evidence of an association between plasma IGF-I concentrations and bladder cancer risk.",International journal of cancer,2018 Nov 15,United States,2018,10
30962817,"Perceived impact of contextual determinants on depression, anxiety and stress: a survey with university students.","Background: Young adults starting college or university education encounter multiple stressors related to transitional life-stage and novel environments. Current studies reveal high rates of symptoms related to common mental health problems like depression, anxiety and stress. However, limited knowledge exists on the determinants on these problems among Canadian students. The primary aim of the study was to investigate the impact of contextual determinants, as perceived by students, on self-reported mental health, and how these impacts varied by depression, anxiety and stress. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with students attending a large university in Toronto, Canada. Participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire as part of a larger project. The questions asked about contextual determinants related to personal, interpersonal, family, social, socio-economic and political factors along with levels of depression, anxiety and stress as measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Perceived Stress Scale. Results: A total of 148 students completed the questionnaire (37 males and 111 females) with an age range of 19-54 years (median 22, IQR 21-24.8). English was reported as first language by 62.8% while 34.5% self-identified as white and 58.1% reported being born in Canada. Overall, 39.5% reported symptoms of moderate to severe depression, 23.8% reported moderate-severe anxiety and 80.3% reported moderate-severe levels of perceived stress, with no significant differences between males and females. In the final multivariate analysis, variables significantly associated with depression were grade-point-average (aOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.017-5.97), family factors (aOR 3.46, 95% CI 1.50-7.94), social factors (aOR 3.24, 1.30-8.1), self-rated health (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.82) and political factors (aOR 0.40, 95% CI 0.16-0.97). Anxiety was significantly associated with family factors (aOR 2.79, 1.09-7.18), socioeconomic factors (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.05-6.42) and age (aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11-0.98). The significant factors for stress were grade-point-average (aOR 2.41, 1.01-5.75) and social factors (aOR 3.87, 95% CI 1.59-9.43). Conclusion: The study found strong to moderate impact of several determinants on depression, anxiety and stress.

24848660,Medicalization of global health 2: The medicalization of global mental health.,"Once an orphan field, 'global mental health' now has wide acknowledgement and prominence on the global health agenda. Increased recognition draws needed attention to individual suffering and the population impacts, but medicalizing global mental health produces a narrow view of the problems and solutions. Early framing by advocates of the global mental health problem emphasised biological disease, linked psychiatry with neurology, and reinforced categories of mental health disorders. Universality of biomedical concepts across culture is assumed in the globalisation of mental health but is strongly disputed by transcultural psychiatrists and anthropologists. Global mental health movement priorities take an individualised view, emphasising treatment and scale-up and neglecting social and structural determinants of health. To meet international targets and address the problem's broad social and cultural dimensions, the global mental health movement and advocates must develop more comprehensive strategies and include more diverse perspectives.",Global health action,2014,United States,2014,10
22974432,Social and ethical determinants of sexuality: 4. Sexuality and families.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the evolving relationship between sexuality and family formation. New family units exist today whose impact on society needs to be explored. METHODS: For each main area researched (anthropology, biology, sociology, sexology, ethics) we identified articles dealing with family formation, sexuality and reproduction using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google, religious websites and texts. RESULTS: The three monotheistic religions and the cultures derived from these have considered sexuality as focused on reproduction. Presently, sexuality has acquired new dimensions, independent from reproduction, as contraception and IVF have separated procreation and sexuality. Thus, the very concept of family has been expanded and so-called 'unusual families' have proved not to be a danger per se for children born and raised within them. CONCLUSIONS: Human sexuality has moved away from having a purely reproductive function, but remains a powerful bond keeping families together, irrespective of the gender identity and the biological links of their members. Even among traditional societies, different types of families exist and the situation has become more complex as technical developments have made parenthood possible for people who in the past were excluded from it.",The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,2012 Oct,England,2012,10
22196986,Diabetes self-management in patients with low health literacy: ordering findings from literature in a health literacy framework.,"OBJECTIVE: To review studies on the association between health literacy (HL), diabetes self-management and possible mediating variables. METHODS: We systematically searched for empirical studies in PubMed. Findings were ordered by a HL framework that outlines routes between HL, sociocognitive determinants and health actions. RESULTS: Of the 11 relevant studies, three reported a significant positive association between HL and specific diabetes self-management domains. Ten studies investigated the association between HL and knowledge (n=8), beliefs (n=2), self-efficacy (n=3) and/or social support (n=1). Significant associations were found between HL and knowledge (n=6), self-efficacy (n=1) and social support (n=1). Of the three studies evaluating the effect of these sociocognitive variables on diabetes self-management, only one found proof for a mediating variable (social support) in the pathway between HL and self-management. CONCLUSION: There is only limited evidence for a significant association between HL and diabetes self-management, and for the mediating role of sociocognitive variables in this pathway. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Longitudinal studies, including HL, diabetes self-management and potential mediators, are needed to substantiate possible associations between these variables. Such research is essential to enable evidence-based development of interventions to increase adequate and sustainable self-management in diabetic patients with low HL.",Patient education and counseling,2012 Jul,Ireland,2012,10
27670854,Individual and Contextual Determinants of Social Homecare Usage in Slovenia.,"THEORY: Social homecare is important for older people, as it enables them to remain in their own homes during worsening health, thus relieving the burden on institutional facilities such as homes for the elderly or nursing homes and hospitals. METHOD: A representative survey of social homecare users was employed to assess determinants of the scope of social homecare in Slovenia. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate determinants defined by Andersen's behavioral model that affect the scope of social homecare. RESULTS: As expected, need (Functional impairment B = .378, P = 0.000) was the most important explanatory component, followed by availability of informal care network (Lives alone B = -.136, P = 0.000; Has children B = - .142; P = 0.000) and other contextual factors such as total costs of the services (B = -.075; P = 0.003) and temporal availability of services (B=-.075, P=0.012). The model explained 18% of variability in the scope of social homecare. CONCLUSION: This study showed that data on the individual level, as opposed to data on an aggregated level, show different determinants of social homecare utilization. Moreover, the results showed that social homecare is especially important in two circumstances: when older people have a high level of need and when they do not have access to informal care networks. Contextual factors had a moderate effect on the scope of social homecare, which shows universal access to the latter at the individual level.",Zdravstveno varstvo,2014 Dec,Poland,2014,10
29016987,Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and incidence of brain tumor: the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE).,"Background: Epidemiological evidence on the association between ambient air pollution and brain tumor risk is sparse and inconsistent. Methods: In 12 cohorts from 6 European countries, individual estimates of annual mean air pollution levels at the baseline residence were estimated by standardized land-use regression models developed within the ESCAPE and TRANSPHORM projects: particulate matter (PM) </=2.5, </=10, and 2.5-10 mum in diameter (PM2.5, PM10, and PMcoarse), PM2.5 absorbance, nitrogen oxides (NO2 and NOx) and elemental composition of PM. We estimated cohort-specific associations of air pollutant concentrations and traffic intensity with total, malignant, and nonmalignant brain tumor, in separate Cox regression models, adjusting for risk factors, and pooled cohort-specific estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. Results: Of 282194 subjects from 12 cohorts, 466 developed malignant brain tumors during 12 years of follow-up. Six of the cohorts also had data on nonmalignant brain tumor, where among 106786 subjects, 366 developed brain tumor: 176 nonmalignant and 190 malignant. We found a positive, statistically nonsignificant association between malignant brain tumor and PM2.5 absorbance (hazard ratio and 95% CI: 1.67; 0.89-3.14 per 10-5/m3), and weak positive or null associations with the other pollutants. Hazard ratio for PM2.5 absorbance (1.01; 0.38-2.71 per 10-5/m3) and all other pollutants were lower for nonmalignant than for malignant brain tumors. Conclusion: We found suggestive evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 absorbance indicating traffic-related air pollution and malignant brain tumors, and no association with overall or nonmalignant brain tumors.",Neuro-oncology,2018 Feb 19,England,2018,10
31700992,Integrating Social Determinants of Health and Laboratory Data: A Pilot Study To Evaluate Co-Use of Opioids and Benzodiazepines.,"As the opioid crisis continues to have devastating consequences for our communities, families, and patients, innovative approaches are necessary to augment clinical care and the management of patients with opioid use disorders. As stewards of health analytic data, laboratories are uniquely poised to approach the opioid crisis differently. With this pilot study, we aimed to bridge laboratory data with social determinants of health data, which are known to influence morbidity and mortality of patients with substance use disorders. For the purpose of this pilot study, we focused on the co-use of opioids and benzodiazepines, which can lead to an increased risk of fatal opioid-related overdoses and increased utilization of acute care. Using the laboratory finding of the copresence of benzodiazepines and opioids as the primary outcome measure, we examined social determinants of health attributes that predict co-use. We found that the provider practice that ordered the laboratory result is the primary predictor of co-use. Increasing age was also predictive of co-use. Further, co-use is highly prevalent in specific geographic areas or ""hotspots."" The prominent geographic distribution of co-use suggests that targeted educational initiatives may benefit the communities in which co-use is prevalent. This study exemplifies the Clinical Lab 2.0 approach by leveraging laboratory data to gain insights into the overall health of the patient.",Academic pathology,2019 Jan-Dec,United States,2019,10
22502840,Substance abuse among individuals with intellectual disabilities.,"Individuals with disabilities are a growing population that confronts multiple disadvantages from social and environmental determinants of health. In particular, the 7-8 million people in the U.S. with an intellectual disability (ID) suffer disproportionately from substance use problems, largely because of a lack of empirical evidence to inform prevention and treatment efforts for them. Although available research could inform future research efforts, studies are scattered across disciplines with the last review synthesizing findings written more than five years ago. To consider more recent findings with earlier works, PubMed, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar were searched and produced 37 peer-reviewed texts across multiple disciplines, 15 from 2006 or later. While the prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug use in this population are low, the risk of having a substance-related problem among ID substance users is comparatively high. Gaps in the research and population subgroups that warrant special attention are identified, such as individuals with borderline and mild ID, individuals with co-occurring mental illness, and individuals who are incarcerated. Compared with substance abusers without ID, ID substance abusers are less likely to receive substance abuse treatment or remain in treatment. Research is needed to better gauge the magnitude of substance use problems, identify prevention strategies, and specify treatment components that meet the unique needs of individuals with ID.",Research in developmental disabilities,2012 Jul-Aug,United States,2012,10
22547494,Acute respiratory illness and health-seeking behavior in Egyptian villages: enhancing pandemic preparedness by understanding local realities.,"The emergence of influenza viruses has raised awareness worldwide about influenza pandemic risks. Pandemic preparedness emphasizes development of risk communication and surveillance systems. The objective was to explore community classification of Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) and health-seeking behaviors. Twenty in-depth interviews and 18 focus group discussions were conducted with caretakers in Egypt. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using the thematic analysis. ARI terminology contained few terms, usage of them was complex, and microorganism not part of illness explanation. Severe ARI was associated with social stigma. Homecare included extensive use of medications. In mild and severe ARI, health-seeking determinants varied. Classification of ARI parallels World Health Organization case definitions for ARI, facilitating risk communication. Homecare practices are social norms that can be expanded to include messages on ARI. Risk communication strategies and surveillance systems need to consider socio-cultural understanding of ARI.",International quarterly of community health education,2011-2012,United States,2011,10
29187053,Applying a health literacy lens to youth sport: a focus on doping prevention in Germany.,"There are two camps when it comes to youth in high-performance sports and whether competition is good or destructive. Despite opportunities for positive development, the demands of increasing competitive levels and related situational stressors among young athletes can be a double-edged sword. Doping is becoming increasingly popular and more readily available to the youth sports population. Improving the health of youth in competitive sport requires us to think about health and its determinants in a more sophisticated manner. We share a current initiative in Germany that reflects this broader thinking by integrating 'education for health literacy' as one strategy in youth sport settings with regard to doping prevention. Implications and emerging opportunities to take further action for doping prevention and health improvement applicable for German and global contexts are offered.",Global health promotion,2019 Mar,England,2019,10
26098869,"Common variation at 2p13.3, 3q29, 7p13 and 17q25.1 associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.","Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the developed world. Both inherited high-penetrance mutations in BRCA2 (ref. 2), ATM, PALB2 (ref. 4), BRCA1 (ref. 5), STK11 (ref. 6), CDKN2A and mismatch-repair genes and low-penetrance loci are associated with increased risk. To identify new risk loci, we performed a genome-wide association study on 9,925 pancreatic cancer cases and 11,569 controls, including 4,164 newly genotyped cases and 3,792 controls in 9 studies from North America, Central Europe and Australia. We identified three newly associated regions: 17q25.1 (LINC00673, rs11655237, odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.34, P = 1.42 x 10(-14)), 7p13 (SUGCT, rs17688601, OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.84-0.92, P = 1.41 x 10(-8)) and 3q29 (TP63, rs9854771, OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.85-0.93, P = 2.35 x 10(-8)).

23068317,Prosodic abnormalities in schizotypal personality disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with schizophrenia speak with blunted vocal affect but little is known regarding the prosody of persons with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). This work examined expressive prosody in SPD, its relationship to brain structure, and outlined a framework for measuring elements of prosody in clinical populations. METHODS: Twenty-eight antipsychotic-naive SPD subjects were matched with 27 healthy comparison (HC) subjects. Subjects read aloud short sentences and responded to probes to record both predetermined and self-generated speech samples. Samples were analyzed acoustically (pause proportion, duration, attack, and pitch variability) and subjectively by raters (amount of pauses, degree of emotion portrayed, and how much they wanted to hear more from the subjects) on paragraph, sentence, word, word-fragment, and syllable levels. Alexithymia and ability to self-monitor behavior were compared between groups. The pars opercularis was manually traced on structural MRI data. RESULTS: SPD subjects' speech had significantly more pauses, was slower, had less pitch variability, and expressed less emotion than HC subjects. Pitch variability correlated with socio-economic status achievement. There was no difference between groups in left or right pars opercularis volumes. A statistically significant correlation suggested that smaller left pars opercularis volumes in SPD subjects correlated with more pauses and less emotion. SPD subjects reported more alexithymia and difficulty self-monitoring their behavior compared with controls. In SPD subjects the high alexithymia correlated with raters not wanting to hear more from them and SPD subjects' inability to modulate their social behavior correlated with their having fewer friends. Thus, the SPD subjects exhibited insight. CONCLUSIONS: SPD subjects displayed significant prosodic deficits that were measurable in speech samples as brief as a word-fragment. The determinants of these deficits are not known although these may include a dysfunctional pars opercularis. These data add to the nascent literature describing social cognition deficits in SPD.",Schizophrenia research,2012 Dec,Netherlands,2012,10
26151496,Genetic determinants of antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis by human leukocyte antigen genotyping and genome-wide association study.,"Graves' disease is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism affecting 1.0-1.6% of the population. Antithyroid drugs are the treatment cornerstone, but may cause life-threatening agranulocytosis. Here we conduct a two-stage association study on two separate subject sets (in total 42 agranulocytosis cases and 1,208 Graves' disease controls), using direct human leukocyte antigen genotyping and SNP-based genome-wide association study. We demonstrate HLA-B*38:02 (Armitage trend Pcombined=6.75 x 10(-32)) and HLA-DRB1*08:03 (Pcombined=1.83 x 10(-9)) as independent susceptibility loci. The genome-wide association study identifies the same signals. Estimated odds ratios for these two loci comparing effective allele carriers to non-carriers are 21.48 (95% confidence interval=11.13-41.48) and 6.13 (95% confidence interval=3.28-11.46), respectively. Carrying both HLA-B*38:02 and HLA-DRB1*08:03 increases odds ratio to 48.41 (Pcombined=3.32 x 10(-21), 95% confidence interval=21.66-108.22).

24349720,Determinants of inequity in health care services utilization in markazi province of iran.,"BACKGROUND: National and international statistics from Iran have indicated that progresses and achievements have been made for most health indicators, but there are differences in some indicators in special groups and at the provincial level. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess the main predictors of inequity in seeking Health Care Utilities (HCU) locally. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data gathered from the HCU survey, which was conducted in the Markazi province of Iran during 2008, was used in the present study. A systematic sampling method, based on the Iranian household framework, was applied in order to choose 758 households as well as 2711 individuals. The household wealth index constructed by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and robust login link function in Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) model were used in order to determine the predictors of inequity. RESULTS: 66.4% of those in need sought outpatient health care from which 97.7% received appropriate services. After adjustment for the clustering effect of household as well as confounding effect of the covariates, GEE model showed that there were inequities in HCU for females (OR = 2.44, CI; 1.24- 4.81) and subjects with inpatient need (OR = 2.14, CI: 1.23-3.72). Being in the lowest quintile of household wealth index was associated with the lower use of outpatient health services (OR = 0.45, CI; 0.23- 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In spite of improvements in the national health indicator, different groups of people use health care services differently, but these inequities in HCU are related to social and individual factors. Also, it is clear that health sector facilities and the accessibility to health services are not the only predictors.",Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,2013 May,Iran,2013,10
30312982,Effect of Selenium Supplementation on Lipid Profile: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Selenium is an essential mineral that plays a key role in plenty of major metabolic processes. A growing body of literature has shown that selenium deficiency leads to an increase in plasma TC and TG levels. This study explores the effect of selenium supplementation on serum level of lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)]. We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI/WOS, and Scopus (from their commencements to Jan 2016) to identify the papers investigating the association between the intake of selenium and lipid profile. Data extracted from the relevant studies were screened. The pooled standardized mean difference was estimated using the random or fixed effects model. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using Q-test. Of the potentially relevant articles screened, 11 articles including 1221 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Results of meta-analysis showed that intake of selenium resulted in a statistically significant improvement in TC, [(SMD): -0.13, 95% CI: (-0.24, -0.02)], TG [(SMD): -0.19, 95% CI: (-0.38, -0.01)] and VLDL [(SMD): -0.34, 95% CI: (-0.63, -0.05)]. The selenium supplementation did not significantly improve lipid profile such as LDL [(SMD): -0.08, 95% CI: (-0.036, 0.19)], HDL [(SMD): 0.01, 95% CI: (-0.164, 0.18)], HDL/TC ratio [(SMD): 0.025, 95% CI: (-0.11, 0.16)], non-HDL-C [(SMD): 0.018, 95% CI: (-0.13, 0.16)]. This meta-analysis suggests that the effect of selenium supplementation on the serum levels of TG and VLDL is marginally significant. However, the supplementation has no effect on other serum lipids. Moreover, the study shows that the effect of selenium supplementation on lipid profile is negative.",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2018 Oct,Germany,2018,10
26042370,Prototype early warning systems for vector-borne diseases in Europe.,"Globalization and environmental change, social and demographic determinants and health system capacity are significant drivers of infectious diseases which can also act as epidemic precursors. Thus, monitoring changes in these drivers can help anticipate, or even forecast, an upsurge of infectious diseases. The European Environment and Epidemiology (E3) Network has been built for this purpose and applied to three early warning case studies: (1) The environmental suitability of malaria transmission in Greece was mapped in order to target epidemiological and entomological surveillance and vector control activities. Malaria transmission in these areas was interrupted in 2013 through such integrated preparedness and response activities. (2) Since 2010, recurrent West Nile fever outbreaks have ensued in South/eastern Europe. Temperature deviations from a thirty year average proved to be associated with the 2010 outbreak. Drivers of subsequent outbreaks were computed through multivariate logistic regression models and included monthly temperature anomalies for July and a normalized water index. (3) Dengue is a tropical disease but sustained transmission has recently emerged in Madeira. Autochthonous transmission has also occurred repeatedly in France and in Croatia mainly due to travel importation. The risk of dengue importation into Europe in 2010 was computed with the volume of international travelers from dengue affected areas worldwide.These prototype early warning systems indicate that monitoring drivers of infectious diseases can help predict vector-borne disease threats.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2015 Jun 2,Switzerland,2015,10
