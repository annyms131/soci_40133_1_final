18462561,A comparison of the socio-economic determinants of growth retardation in South African and Filipino infants.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between household socio-economic status (SES) at birth and poor infant growth such as small for gestational age (SGA) and stunting across two different socio-cultural settings: South Africa and the Philippines. DESIGN: Data were from two longitudinal birth cohorts, the Birth to Twenty (Bt20) study in South Africa and the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) in the Philippines. SUBJECTS: Bt20 infants (n 2293 total; reduced to 758 (SGA), 450 (stunting 1 year) and 401 (stunting 2 years)) and CLHNS infants (n 2513 total; reduced to 2161 (SGA), 1820 (stunting 1 year) and 1710 (stunting 2 years)). RESULTS: CLHNS infants were significantly more likely to be born SGA (20.9 v. 11.7 %) and be stunted at 1 year (32.6 v. 8.7 %) and 2 years (48.9 v. 21.1 %) compared with Bt20 infants. Logistic regression analyses showed that SES (index) was a significant predictor of stunting at 1 and 2 years of age in the CLHNS cohort. SES (index or individual variables) was not a significant predictor of SGA in either cohort, or of stunting in the Bt20 cohort. Maternal education, ownership of a television and toilet facilities were all independent predictors of stunting in the CLHNS cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The social and economic milieu within the Philippines appears to place CLHNS infants at greater risk of being born SGA and being stunted compared with Bt20 infants. The present research highlights the importance of investigating the individual SES variables that predict infantile growth faltering, to identify the key areas for context-specific policy development and intervention.",Public health nutrition,2008 Dec,England,2008,00

25035522,Do Moral Communities Play a Role in Criminal Sentencing? Evidence From Pennsylvania.,"Religion and social control have been a sociological concern since Durkheim and Weber, and the relationship between religion and punishment has long been the subject of speculation. However, surprisingly little empirical research exists on the role of religion or religious context in criminal justice, and almost no research on the role of religious context on actual sentencing practices. We conceptualize the potential relationships between religious context and sentencing severity by drawing from the focal concerns and court community perspectives in the sentencing literature and moral communities theory developed by Rodney Stark. We suspect that Christian moral communities might shape notions of perceived blameworthiness for court community actors. Such moral communities might also affect notions of community protection - affecting perceptions of dangerousness, or perhaps rehabilitation, and might influence practical constraints/consequences (e.g., local political ramifications of harsh or lenient sentences). We examine these questions using a set of hierarchical models using sentencing data from Pennsylvania county courts and data on the religious composition of Pennsylvania counties from the Associated Religion Data Archives. We find that county Christian religious homogeneity increases the likelihood of incarceration. In addition, Christian homogeneity as well as the prevalence of civically engaged denominations in a county condition the effects of important legally relevant determinants of incarceration. Furthermore, we find evidence that Christian homogeneity activates the effect of local Republican electoral dominance on incarceration. We argue that Christian homogeneity effects sentencing practices primarily through local political processes that shape the election of judges and prosecutors.",The Sociological quarterly,2008,United States,2008,00
12864889,End-stage renal disease in sub-Saharan and South Africa.,"The major health problems in Africa are AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, gastroenteritis and hypertension; hypertension affects about 20% of the adult population. Renal disease, especially glomerular disease, is more prevalent in Africa and seems to be of a more severe form than that found in Western countries. The most common mode of presentation is the nephrotic syndrome, with the age of onset at five to eight years. It is estimated that 2 to 3% of medical admissions in tropical countries are due to renal-related complaints, the majority being the glomerulonephritides. There are no reliable statistics for ESRD in all African countries. Statistics of the South African Dialysis and Transplant Registry (SADTR) reflect the patients selected for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and do not accurately reflect the etiology of chronic renal failure (CRF), where public sector state facilities will offer RRT only to patients who are eligible for a transplant. In 1994, glomerulonephritis was recorded as the cause of ESRD in 1771 (52.1%) and hypertension in 1549 (45.6%) of patients by the SADTR. In a six-year study of 3632 patients with ESRD, based on SADTR statistics, hypertension was reported to be the cause of ESRD in 4.3% of whites, 34.6% of blacks, 20.9% mixed race group and 13.8% of Indians. Malignant hypertension is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among urban black South Africans, with hypertension accounting for 16% of all hospital admissions. In a ten-year study of 368 patients with chronic renal failure in Nigeria, the etiology of renal failure was undetermined in 62%. Of the remaining patients whose etiology was ascertained, hypertension accounted for 61%, diabetes mellitus for 11% and chronic glomerulonephritis for 5.9%. Patients with CRF constituted 10% of all medical admissions in this center. Chronic glomerulonephritis and hypertension are principal causes of CRF in tropical Africa and East Africa, together with diabetes mellitus and obstructive uropathy. The availability of dialysis and transplantation is quite variable in Africa: treatment rates in North Africa are 30 to 186.5 per million population (pmp) in countries with more established programs: Algeria 78.5; Egypt 129.3; Libya 30; Morocco 55.6; Tunisia 186.5 pmp. In South Africa, treatment rates of 99 pmp were reported; Dialysis and transplant programs in the rest of Africa are dependent on the availability of funding and donors. Services are still predominantly urban and therefore generally inaccessible to the poorer, less educated rural patient. There is not enough money for healthcare in the developing world, particularly for expensive and chronic treatment such as RRT. The goal should be to have a circumscribed chronic dialysis program, with as short a time on dialysis as possible, and to increase the availability of transplantation (both living donor and cadaver). Efforts should be made to optimize therapy of renal disease and renal failure globally and particularly in developing countries. Strategies should be developed to screen for and manage conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus at the primary healthcare level in an effort to decrease the incidence of chronic renal failure. Increasingly, health is influenced by social and economic circumstances. Any improvements in health thus demand integrated, comprehensive action against all the determinants of ill health.",Kidney international. Supplement,2003 Feb,United States,2003,00
15249522,Adjusting for case mix and social class in examining variation in home visits between practices.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adjusting for clinical case mix and social class explains more of the variation in home visits between general practices than adjusting for age and sex alone. METHODS: The setting was 60 general practices in England and Wales taking part in the 1 year Fourth National Morbidity Survey. The participants comprised 349 505 patients who were registered with one of the participating general practices for at least 180 days, and who had at least one consultation during the period. The outcome measure is whether or not a patient received a home visit in that year. A clinical case mix category (morbidity class) based on 1 year's diagnostic information was assigned to each patient using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) Case Mix System. The social class measure was derived from occupation and employment status and is similar to that of the 1991 UK census. Variations in home visits between practices were examined using multilevel logistic regression models. The variability between practices before and after adjusting for clinical case mix and social class was estimated using the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: The overall percentage of patients receiving a home visit over the 1 year study period was 17%, and this varied from 7 to 31% across the 60 practices. The percentage of the total variation in home visits attributable to differences between practices was 2.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-3.2%] after adjusting for age and sex. This reduced to 1.6% (95% CI 1.1-2.4%) after taking into account morbidity class. The results were similar when social class was included instead of morbidity class. Morbidity and social class together reduced variation in home visits between practices to 1.5% (95% CI 1.1-2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Age, sex, social class and clinical case mix are strong determinants of home visits in the UK. Adjusting for morbidity and social class results in a small improvement in explaining the variability in home visits between practices compared with adjusting for age and sex alone. There is far more variation between patients within practices; however, it is not straightforward to examine the factors influencing this variation. In addition to morbidity and social class, there could also be other unmeasured factors such as varying patient demand for home visits, disability or differences in GP home visiting practice style that could influence the large within-practice variability observed in this study.",Family practice,2004 Aug,England,2004,00
11165693,Psychometric properties of the World Health Organisation quality of life questionnaire (WHOQOL-100) in diabetic patients in Croatia.,"UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to analyse psychometric properties of the WHOQOL-100, a multidimensionally conceptualised, generic, 100-item quality of life (QoL) instrument in a pilot sample of 63 type 2 diabetic patients (age 60.4 (10.1) years), 55% women, disease duration 10.2 (6.2) years, education 10 (5.2) years, 78% married. While covering the subjective perception and evaluation of the overall QoL and general health, as well as four broad domains (physical health, psychological state, social relationships and environment), the instrument may be useful in integrating the individual perception of the QoL. The properties tested referred to reliability, validity in discriminating patients with different disease characteristics, and responsiveness to change. METHODS: Reliability was determined by Cronbach's alpha coefficients of internal consistency. Discriminant validity was determined by comparing the groups of patients with poor and satisfactory glycaemic control, the first group being switched to insulin therapy (intervention group) and the second (comparison group) remaining on oral therapy (35 and 28 patients respectively). Responsiveness to change was determined by comparing the two groups after a 2-month follow-up period. RESULTS: The obtained alpha coefficients were 0.95 for the physical domain, 0.89 for the psychological domain, 0.76 for the social relationships domain, and 0.92 for the domain referring to environment. The interventional and comparison groups rated their QoL differently, primarily in the physical and psychological domains (P<0.01; P<0.05). After a 2-month follow-up period, the intervention group was improved in some QoL determinants (psychological domain), while no differences were found in the control group. CONCLUSION: Relying on the data obtained from the groups of diabetic patients in Croatia, the WHOQOL-100 can be considered as acceptably reliable and valid instrument for the QoL assessment in this particular population of health care users.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2001 Feb,Ireland,2001,00
12772438,The psychosocial determinants of hypertension.,"AIM: To present currently available evidence on the role that adverse psychosocial factors play in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The specific objectives of the review were to (1) provide a picture of what is known about the relationship between psychosocial factors and hypertension, (2) summarize the major methodological and conceptual pitfalls, and (3) identify gaps in the literature and suggest areas for future research. DATA SYNTHESIS: The scope of the literature review was adults and the literature published since 1990 (acknowledging that some articles published earlier would need to be taken into account). A number of journal searches were carried out. They included Medline, PsychInfo, and SocioFile, with keywords, such as hypertension, blood pressure, psychosocial, psychological, social, acculturation, occupation, socio-economic status, social class, education, depression, anger, and anxiety. The search included articles related to hypertension in developed countries and was limited to studies in the English language. CONCLUSION: A growing body of evidence supports the thesis that psychosocial factors play a role in the pathogenesis for hypertension.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2003 Feb,Netherlands,2003,00
11389564,Living with support in the community: predictors of satisfaction with life.,"Ensuring that people with an intellectual disability have normative levels of life satisfaction is increasingly considered a worthy goal for service providers. This review concerns the determinants of such satisfaction and embeds this literature within the Homeostatic Theory of Subjective Well-Being. This posits that life satisfaction is under considerable endogenous control and, as a consequence, does not normally vary in sympathy with changes in the external environment. This situation changes, however, if the environment is sufficiently aversive to defeat such homeostatic control. Under these conditions the circumstances of living correlate with life satisfaction as they wrest control away from the homeostatic system. One important implication is that the measure of life satisfaction may or may not be a sensitive indicator for changes in service provision, depending on the functional status of the homeostatic system.

10682943,Determinants of exercise tolerance after acute myocardial infarction in older persons.,"OBJECTIVES: Exercise tolerance is reduced with advancing age. Identification of potentially reversible determinants of the age-related decrement in exercise tolerance, which remain largely unexplored in older subjects and in patients recovering from a recent myocardial infarction (MI), may have useful therapeutic implications. The objective of this study was to identify the independent determinants of exercise tolerance in older patients with a recent MI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data is from baseline assessment of 265 post-MI patients (age range 45-85 years) enrolled in the Cardiac Rehabilitation in Advanced Age randomized, controlled trial. Patients with major comorbidities or severe MI complications were excluded from the trial. Exercise tolerance was determined from symptom-limited exercise testing and expressed as total work capacity (TWC, kg.m) or peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak, mL/kg/min). The associations between both TWC and VO2peak and baseline demographic, social, clinical, and neuropsychological variables and an index of health-related quality of life were determined with univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: With univariate analysis, TWC decreased by 1285 kg.m per decade of increasing age between 45 and 85 years of age. With multivariate analysis, TWC decreased by 922 kg.m per decade. Increasing age (P < .001), female gender (P < .001), a small body surface area (P < .001), a low level of usual physical exercise before MI (P < .002), and the presence of post-MI depressive symptoms (P < .024) were independently associated with a lower TWC. The same factors, in addition to a small arm muscle area (P < .002), were also independently associated with a lower VO2peak. CONCLUSIONS: Age per se accounts for approximately 70% of the age-related decay in TWC or VO2peak. However, the inclusion of modifiable factors such as physical exercise and depression in the prediction model reinforces the importance of a multidimensional approach to the evaluation and treatment of older patients with a recent MI.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,2000 Feb,United States,2000,00
16765763,Health of Indigenous people in Africa.,"Our paper is part of a series focusing on Indigenous peoples' health in different world regions. Indigenous peoples worldwide are subject to marginalisation and discrimination, systematically experiencing poorer health than do majority groups. In Africa, poor health in the general population is widely recognised, but the consistently lower health position and social status of Indigenous peoples are rarely noted. Disputed conceptual understandings of indigeneity, a history of discriminatory colonial and post-colonial policies, and non-recognition of Indigenous groups by some governments complicate the situation. We discuss two case studies, of the central African Pygmy peoples and the San of southern Africa, to illustrate recurring issues in Indigenous health in the continent. We make recommendations for the recognition of Indigenous peoples in Africa and improvements needed in the collection of health data and the provision of services. Finally, we argue that wider changes are needed to address the social determinants of Indigenous peoples' health.","Lancet (London, England)",2006 Jun 10,England,2006,00
11271636,The political context of social inequalities and health.,"This analysis reflects on the importance of political parties, and the policies they implement when in government, in determining the level of equalities/inequalities in a society, the extent of the welfare state (including the level of health care coverage by the state), the employment/unemployment rate, and the level of population health. The study looks at the impact of the major political traditions in the advanced OECD countries during the golden years of capitalism (1945-1980)--social democratic, Christian democratic, liberal, and ex-fascist--in four areas: (1) the main determinants of income inequalities; (2) levels of public expenditures and health care benefits coverage; (3) public support of services to families; and (4) the level of population health as measured by infant mortality. The results indicate that political traditions more committed to redistributive policies (both economic and social) and full-employment policies, such as the social democratic parties, were generally more successful in improving the health of populations. The erroneous assumption of a conflict between social equity and economic efficiency is also discussed. The study aims at filling a void in the growing health and social inequalities literature, which rarely touches on the importance of political forces in influencing inequalities.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2001,United States,2001,00
17760962,"A decade of inequality in maternity care: antenatal care, professional attendance at delivery, and caesarean section in Bangladesh (1991-2004).","BACKGROUND: Bangladesh is committed to the fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG-5) target of reducing its maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015. Since the early 1990s, Bangladesh has followed a strategy of improving access to facilities equipped and staffed to provide emergency obstetric care (EmOC). METHODS: We used data from four Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1993 and 2004 to examine trends in the proportions of live births preceded by antenatal consultation, attended by a health professional, and delivered by caesarean section, according to key socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Utilization of antenatal care increased substantially, from 24% in 1991 to 60% in 2004. Despite a relatively greater increase in rural than urban areas, utilization remained much lower among the poorest rural women without formal education (18%) compared with the richest urban women with secondary or higher education (99%). Professional attendance at delivery increased by 50% (from 9% to 14%, more rapidly in rural than urban areas), and caesarean sections trebled (from 2% to 6%), but these indicators remained low even by developing country standards. Within these trends there were huge inequalities; 86% of live births among the richest urban women with secondary or higher education were attended by a health professional, and 35% were delivered by caesarean section, compared with 2% and 0.1% respectively of live births among the poorest rural women without formal education. The trend in professional attendance was entirely confounded by socioeconomic and demographic changes, but education of the woman and her husband remained important determinants of utilization of obstetric services. CONCLUSION: Despite commendable progress in improving uptake of antenatal care, and in equipping health facilities to provide emergency obstetric care, the very low utilization of these facilities, especially by poor women, is a major impediment to meeting MDG-5 in Bangladesh.",International journal for equity in health,2007 Aug 30,England,2007,00
19709105,Models for individual oral health promotion and their effectiveness: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: There is a recognized need to deliver oral health information to people during clinical encounters to enable them to develop personal skills in managing their own oral health. Traditional approaches to individual oral health education have been shown to be largely ineffective and new approaches are required to address personal motivations for preventive behaviour. This systematic review aims to identify and assess the effectiveness of behaviour models as a basis for individual oral health promotion. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for articles evaluating the effectiveness of health behaviour models in oral and general health between 2000 and 2007. Eighty-nine studies were retrieved and data were extracted from the 32 studies that met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were identified in the fields of clinical prevention and health education, motivational interviewing (MI), counselling, and models based interventions. MI interventions were found to be the most effective method for altering health behaviours in a clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to develop an effective model for chairside oral health promotion that incorporates this evidence and allows oral health professionals to focus more on the underlying social determinants of oral disease during the clinical encounter. There is potential to further develop the MI approach within the oral health field.",Australian dental journal,2009 Sep,Australia,2009,00
19237388,Equity in community health insurance schemes: evidence and lessons from Armenia.,"INTRODUCTION: Community health insurance (CHI) schemes are growing in importance in low-income settings, where health systems based on user fees have resulted in significant barriers to care for the poorest members of communities. They increase revenue, access and financial protection, but concerns have been expressed about the equity of such schemes and their ability to reach the poorest. Few programmes routinely evaluate equity impacts, even though this is usually a key objective. This lack of evidence is related to the difficulties in collecting reliable data on utilization and socio-economic status. This paper describes the findings of an evaluation of the equity of Oxfam's CHI schemes in rural Armenia. METHODS: Members of a random sample of 506 households in villages operating insurance schemes in rural Armenia were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Household wealth scores based on ownership of assets were generated using principal components analysis. Logistic and Poisson regression analyses were performed to identify the determinants of health facility utilization, and equity of access across socio-economic strata. RESULTS: The schemes have achieved a high level of equity, according to socio-economic status, age and gender. However, although levels of participation compare favourably with international experience, they remain relatively low due to a lack of affordability and a package of primary care that does not include coverage for chronic disease. CONCLUSION: This paper demonstrates that the distribution of benefits among members of this community-financing scheme is equitable, and that such a degree of equity in community insurance can be achieved in such settings, possibly through an emphasis on accountability and local management. Such a scheme presents a workable model for investing in primary health care in resource-poor settings.",Health policy and planning,2009 May,England,2009,00

(GHQ-12). PARTICIPANTS: The study includes a total of 676 patients received in the periods from June to September 1999 and from January to February 2000 in out-patient treatment by 13 general practitioners during a 2 week sampling in the consulting room of each doctor. METHODS: Every patient filled in a tool set composed of socio-demographic form, GHQ-12, Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS). To evaluate the diagnostic reliability of GHQ-12, a subgroup of 158 patients underwent The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). RESULTS: Among the 676 patients contacted the estimated prevalence (Probable Prevalence) of common mental disorders was of 43.6%. The factors connected to the GHQ-12 high-scorers are gender, number of consultations and life events evaluated through the SRRS. The school level results as protective factor.

14751330,Social determinants of tuberculosis case rates in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: Social capital has been related to a number of important public health variables such as overall mortality, health status, and sexually transmitted infections (including AIDS case rates). However, the relationship of social capital to tuberculosis has received little attention. Because social capital may be related to the constructs of poverty and income inequality, any exploration of the correlation between social capital and tuberculosis should include examination of the interrelationships with poverty and income inequality as well. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the state-level relationship between social capital, poverty, income inequality, and tuberculosis case rates. METHODS: The design was state-level, correlational analysis (including bivariate linear correlational analysis, and multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis). Main outcome measures were 1999 state-level case rates of tuberculosis. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, poverty, income inequality, and social capital were all significantly correlated with tuberculosis case rates. In stepwise multiple regression analyses predicting tuberculosis case rates from this set of three predictor variables, social capital and income inequality entered the regression equation (with social capital being the strongest predictor variable). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that social capital is highly predictive of tuberculosis at the state level. The results indicate the need for further research into this potentially causal relationship, including the examination of structural interventions designed to increase social capital.",American journal of preventive medicine,2004 Feb,Netherlands,2004,00

16251618,Season and ethnicity are determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in New Zealand children aged 5-14 y.,"New Zealand children, particularly those of Maori and Pacific ethnicity, may be at risk for low vitamin D status because of low vitamin D intakes, the country's latitude (35-46 degrees S), and skin color. The aim of this study was to determine 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and their determinants in a national sample of New Zealand children aged 5-14 y. The 2002 National Children's Nutrition Survey was designed to survey New Zealand children, including oversampling of Maori and Pacific children to allow ethnic-specific analyses. A 2-stage recruitment process occurred using a random selection of schools, and children within each school. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration [mean (99% CI) nmol/L] in Maori children (n = 456) was 43 (38,49), in Pacific (n = 646) 36 (31,42), and in New Zealand European and Others (NZEO) (n = 483) 53 (47,59). Among Maori, Pacific, and NZEO, the prevalence (%, 99% CI) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (<17.5 nmol/L) was 5 (2,12), 8 (5,14), and 3 (1,7), respectively. The prevalence of insufficiency (<37.5 nmol/L) was 41 (29,53), 59 (42,75), and 25 (15,35), respectively. Multiple regression analysis found that 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower in winter than summer [adjusted mean difference (99% CI) nmol/L; 15 (8,22)], lower in girls than boys [5 (1,10)], and lower in obese children than in those of ""normal"" weight [6 (1,11)]. Relative to NZEO, 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower in Maori [9 (3,15)] and Pacific children [16 (10,22)]. Ethnicity and season are major determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in New Zealand children, which may or may not contribute to increased risk of osteoporosis and other chronic disease. There is a pressing need for more convincing evidence concerning the health risks associated with the low vitamin D status in New Zealand children.",The Journal of nutrition,2005 Nov,United States,2005,00
11919734,Acute health-related quality of life in children undergoing stem cell transplant: II. Medical and demographic determinants.,"Medical and demographic variables were examined as predictors of acute health-related quality of life (HRQL), specifically, somatic distress, mood disturbance and activity levels, during the period of bone marrow transplant (BMT) hospitalization, and the transition phase in the months following hospital discharge. The responses of 153 children undergoing BMT were assessed by both parent report and patient self-report in a prospective longitudinal design. Type of transplant, diagnosis, age, gender, and socio-economic status (SES) were examined as predictor variables of patient outcome. Type of transplant, patient age, and SES emerged as significant determinants of patient response. Children undergoing unrelated donor (MUD) transplants experiencing the highest levels of distress, followed by those undergoing matched-sibling BMT, while those undergoing autologous transplant experienced the lowest levels of distress. Younger patients experienced lower levels of distress and better HRQL than older children and adolescents. Although patients from different SES backgrounds appeared very similar at the time of hospital admission, those from lower SES backgrounds demonstrated greater distress and disturbance in HRQL subsequently, and throughout the first 6 months post BMT. These findings help to target specific subgroups of patients that may be in greater need of preventive interventions or more aggressive supportive care.",Bone marrow transplantation,2002 Mar,England,2002,00

Multi-level linear regression was applied to investigate the effect of socioeconomic and demographic factors, physical and social environment, and health conditions on children s height, measured by the height-for-age z-scores of the National Center for Health Statistics standards. Area of residence (census tract) was classified as good versus poor in terms of housing and sanitation standards. On average, children s height was -0.18 z-score. Average height increased with maternal and paternal schooling, parents work skills, per capita family income, improved housing, maternal age, birth intervals, and birth weight. Height decreased with hospitalization in the first two years of life, number of under-five children in the household, and preterm birth. In the poor residential areas, the effect of maternal schooling was twice as great as in the better-off areas. The effect of parental work skills was only evident in the more deprived areas. Area of residence modified the effects of socioeconomic conditions on children s growth.

METHODS: Pupils in the 8th and 10th grades (n = 1182, ages 13-16 years) in 11 Jerusalem secular and religious schools anonymously completed the World Health Organization questionnaire from the Health Behavior in School Children study. The unit of analysis was defined as the number of times the student was involved in physical fighting during the past year. The independent variables studied were sociodemographic characteristics, personal, and school-related factors including teachers, peers, and family. RESULTS: Fighting at least once was reported by 76% of boys and 26% of girls; 6% of boys who were involved in fights at least once and 16% more than once required medical treatment. For boys, bullying others, poor health and mental health score, and perception of teachers that the pupil was a below-average student significantly increased the odds ratio (OR) for fighting more than once in the past year. Among girls, poor mental health, poor parental support on school matters, bullying, and being bullied by others increased the OR for fighting. CONCLUSIONS: Fighting is a highly prevalent behavior among adolescents irrespective of their socioeconomic background. Determinants differ by gender, and intervention programs should focus on the gender-specific determinants.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,2000 Sep,United States,2000,00
16643346,Psychiatric nurses' ethical stance on cigarette smoking by patients: determinants and dilemmas in their role in supporting cessation.,"It has been argued that psychiatric nurses are ideally placed to provide smoking cessation interventions to patients with mental illness. This assumes that psychiatric nurses actively support smoking cessation. The current paper articulates some of the reasons why this has not occurred, in particular, some of the ethical beliefs held by nurses that may prevent such activity. Such an assumption also discounts the evidence that confirms psychiatric nurses to have among the highest smoking rates in nursing and in the health professions in general. The role and impact of the institution are also considered. In-depth interviews with seven community and inpatient psychiatric nurses were thematically analysed. Extensive individual and group discussions were also held with inpatient nurses from open and locked psychiatric settings during participant observation of the settings. The findings suggest that psychiatric nurses can be more effective in the primary care role of supporting patients' smoking cessation if they receive adequate institutional support to do so.",International journal of mental health nursing,2006 Jun,Australia,2006,00
19674467,Psychosocial correlates of eating behavior in children and adolescents: a review.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the correlates of dietary intake is necessary in order to effectively promote healthy dietary behavior among children and adolescents. A literature review was conducted on the correlates of the following categories of dietary intake in children and adolescents: Fruit, Juice and Vegetable Consumption, Fat in Diet, Total Energy Intake, Sugar Snacking, Sweetened Beverage Consumption, Dietary Fiber, Other Healthy Dietary Consumption, and Other Less Healthy Dietary Consumption in children and adolescents. METHODS: Cross-sectional and prospective studies were identified from PubMed, PsycINFO and PsycArticles by using a combination of search terms. Quantitative research examining determinants of dietary intake among children and adolescents aged 3-18 years were included. The selection and review process yielded information on country, study design, population, instrument used for measuring intake, and quality of research study. RESULTS: Seventy-seven articles were included. Many potential correlates have been studied among children and adolescents. However, for many hypothesized correlates substantial evidence is lacking due to a dearth of research. The correlates best supported by the literature are: perceived modeling, dietary intentions, norms, liking and preferences. Perceived modeling and dietary intentions have the most consistent and positive associations with eating behavior. Norms, liking, and preferences were also consistently and positively related to eating behavior in children and adolescents. Availability, knowledge, outcome expectations, self-efficacy and social support did not show consistent relationships across dietary outcomes. CONCLUSION: This review examined the correlates of various dietary intake; Fruit, Juice and Vegetable Consumption, Fat in Diet, Total Energy Intake, Sugar Snacking, Sweetened Beverage Consumption, Dietary Fiber, Other Healthy Dietary Consumption, and Other Less Healthy Dietary Consumption in cross-sectional and prospective studies for children and adolescents. The correlates most consistently supported by evidence were perceived modeling, dietary intentions, norms, liking and preferences. More prospective studies on the psychosocial determinants of eating behavior using broader theoretical perspectives should be examined in future research.",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2009 Aug 12,England,2009,00
10938450,"Genetic factors, perceived chronic stress, and the free cortisol response to awakening.","Recent studies have demonstrated that the free cortisol response to awakening can serve as a useful index of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activity. This endocrine marker is rather consistent, shows good intraindividual stability across time and appears to be able to uncover subtle changes in HPA regulation. The present twin study investigated genetic factors as sources of the interindividual variation of the cortisol awakening response. Furthermore, the relationship between psychological variables and morning cortisol levels was studied. On two consecutive days saliva samples were collected 0, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after awakening in 52 monozygotic and 52 dizygotic twin pairs. Moreover, samples were obtained at 0800, 1100, 1500 and 2000 h. ('short day-time profile'). Additionally, the participants filled out questionnaires assessing chronic stress load, self-esteem and self-efficacy.Heritability estimates of h(2)=0.40 for the mean increase and of h(2)=0.48 for the area under the response curve indicate a significant impact of genetic factors on cortisol levels after awakening. However, no genetic influence on the short day-time profile could be observed. Furthermore, several aspects of perceived chronic stress, namely 'worries', 'social stress' and 'lack of social recognition' were significantly associated with the awakening cortisol response. The evidence for a medium-sized, yet distinct genetic influence on cortisol levels after awakening is discussed with regard to a potential clinical relevance of genetic determinants of HPA (re)activity. In line with several recent studies, the present findings further support the view that the cortisol awakening responses is consistently enhanced under chronic stress conditions.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2000 Oct,England,2000,00
15171840,[Intimate partner violence: social and health determinants and responses].,"The present study aims to review the problem of intimate partner violence, as well as its causes and consequences. It will also specifically analyze the role of health professionals. In opposition to the classical epidemiological view of risk factors, Heise proposes an ecological framework to study violence against women. This framework analyzes the interplay among the personal, situational and sociocultural factors that combine to cause abuse. Regarding the frequency of intimate partner violence in Spain, in January 2003 there were 2.519 formal complaints and 69 women died between January and November 2003. No geographical patterns in mortality or the incidence of formal complaints of intimate partner violence or among the provinces with the highest incidence of formal complains and those with highest mortality were observed. The only national survey published in Spain was performed by the Women's Institute in 1999, which reported a prevalence of domestic violence of 9.2%. A frequency of 22.8% was found in a primary health care center in Granada. Health services can play a key role in helping victims of domestic violence, since most women contact the health services at some time in their lives. Professionals in administrative or managerial positions can contribute to raising awareness of this health problem, which is one of the main causes of poor health and disability. Evidently, beyond consciousness-raising and early detection campaigns, public health strategies should be designed to prevent this serious health problem the causes of which can be changed.",Gaceta sanitaria,2004,Spain,2004,00
12818312,Integrated perinatal health framework. A multiple determinants model with a life span approach.,"BACKGROUND: Despite great strides in improving prenatal care utilization among American women, key perinatal indicators have remained stagnant or worsened in the past decade, and the United States continues to rank near the bottom compared to other developed countries. A new approach is needed if we are to achieve improvements in perinatal health. METHODS: To propose a new framework that integrates a ""life span"" approach with a multiple determinants model. RESULTS: We recognize that (1) powerful influences on outcome occur long before pregnancy begins; (2) pregnancy outcome is shaped by social, psychological, behavioral, environmental, and biological forces; and (3) the demography of pregnancy has changed dramatically in the last few decades with more women delaying their first birth. Approaches that simultaneously consider the entire life span as well as multiple determinants may need to be adopted. We propose a framework that integrates these approaches and is supported by the research literature. The life span perspective focuses attention toward the preconceptional and interconceptional periods as targets for intervention in improving perinatal health. The multiple determinants model distinguishes among concepts of disease, health and functioning, and well-being for both women and their offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Our intent is to influence how policymakers, public health professionals, clinicians, and researchers approach perinatal health.",American journal of preventive medicine,2003 Jul,Netherlands,2003,00
17681608,Determinants of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in patients with chronic lung diseases.,"UNLABELLED: Despite strong recommendations, immunization rates for influenza and pneumococci are low. We aimed to analyse the vaccination status and its determinants in patients with chronic lung diseases. METHODS: Information about actual influenza (IV) and pneumococcal (PV) vaccination status was obtained by a standardised questionnaire from 2491 patients presenting to a specialised centre of respiratory medicine in Rotenburg/Wuemme (Germany). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify potential determinants of IV and PV. RESULTS: Of 2131 patients with asthma and/or COPD, included into detailed analyses (52.0% male, mean age 56.6 years), 46.5% had received an IV and 14.6% a PV. Main reason for not being vaccinated was the lack of information, reaching 87.6% for PV (53.5% for IV); 37.0% saw no reason for an IV (PV 21.3%). Vaccination rates differed depending on the patients' age and education level. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a marked information deficit on immunization which is explicitly higher for PV. Target-group-specific strategies should increase the knowledge on vaccinations in order to avoid the development or aggravation of acute and chronic lung diseases.",The Journal of infection,2007 Oct,England,2007,00
15452448,Breast self-examination: longitudinal predictors of intention and subsequent behaviour.,"This study analysed in a longitudinal design the relationship between past breast self-examination (BSE) behaviour, determinants, intention and future BSE behaviour in a population of adult Dutch women. Past behaviour and psychosocial determinants were assessed at T1, followed 6 weeks later (T2) with the assessment of the intention to perform BSE monthly. Half a year after the first measurement the current BSE behaviour was assessed by means of a telephone survey (T3) (total end response 78%, n=364). The questionnaires included BSE behaviour, intention, attitude (pros and cons of BSE, anticipated regret, moral obligation), social influence (support, modelling) and self-efficacy. Other background variables assessed were past BSE behaviour, and demographics. Although 81% of the women stated that they performed BSE, only 41% of the women performed BSE correctly. Women who performed BSE correctly differed from women who did not on all psychosocial determinants assessed a half year earlier, with the exception of anticipated regret. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that the psychosocial determinants explained 51% of the variance in intention to perform BSE, assessed 6 weeks later; past behaviour accounted for 2% of extra explained variance. Logistic regression analyses showed that past behaviour, the psychosocial determinants and intention were significant predictors of correct BSE behaviour a half year later (Nagelkerke's total explained variance was 47%). It was concluded that misperceptions of correct BSE behaviour was highly prevalent. Both the psychosocial determinants as well as past behaviour were important predictors of intention to perform BSE and subsequent BSE behaviour.",European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),2004 Oct,England,2004,00
17450427,Urban environmental health hazards and health equity.,"This paper outlines briefly how the living environment can affect health. It explains the links between social and environmental determinants of health in urban settings. Interventions to improve health equity through the environment include actions and policies that deal with proximal risk factors in deprived urban areas, such as safe drinking water supply, reduced air pollution from household cooking and heating as well as from vehicles and industry, reduced traffic injury hazards and noise, improved working environment, and reduced heat stress because of global climate change. The urban environment involves health hazards with an inequitable distribution of exposures and vulnerabilities, but it also involves opportunities for implementing interventions for health equity. The high population density in many poor urban areas means that interventions at a small scale level can assist many people, and existing infrastructure can sometimes be upgraded to meet health demands. Interventions at higher policy levels that will create more sustainable and equitable living conditions and environments include improved city planning and policies that take health aspects into account in every sector. Health equity also implies policies and actions that improve the global living environment, for instance, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. In a global equity perspective, improving the living environment and health of the poor in developing country cities requires actions to be taken in the most affluent urban areas of the world. This includes making financial and technical resources available from high-income countries to be applied in low-income countries for urgent interventions for health equity. This is an abbreviated version of a paper on ""Improving the living environment"" prepared for the World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health, Knowledge Network on Urban Settings.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2007 May,United States,2007,00
15641899,"Profiles in coping: responses to sexual harassment across persons, organizations, and cultures.","This study explicates the complexity of sexual harassment coping behavior among 4 diverse samples of working women: (a) working-class Hispanic Americans, (b) working-class Anglo Americans, (c) professional Turks, and (d) professional Anglo Americans. K-means cluster analysis revealed 3 common harassment coping profiles: (a) detached, (b) avoidant negotiating, and (c) support seeking. The authors then tested an integrated framework of coping profile determinants, involving social power, stressor severity, social support, and culture. Analysis of variance, chi-square, and discriminant function results identified significant determinants at each of the 4 levels of this ecological model. These findings underscore the importance of focusing on whole patterns of experience--and considering influences at the level of the individual employee and multiple levels of the surrounding context--when studying how women cope with workplace sexual harassment.",The Journal of applied psychology,2005 Jan,United States,2005,00
16076585,'Cultural fraud': the role of culture in drug abuse.,"The research literature on the social determinants of health focuses on socio-economic inequalities and disadvantage. 'Culture' is usually seen as part of this picture of difference--associated with minority status, ethnicity or race; but we also need to address the role of dominant or mainstream cultures in health and well-being. Cultures provide the underlying assumptions of an entire way of life, allowing us to make sense of the world and our lives. This paper argues that aspects of modern western culture are a potent and under-estimated social factor behind drug use and abuse. It draws on a wide range of evidence from different disciplines to suggest that Western culture's emphasis on the material and the individual, in particular, amounts to 'cultural fraud': the promotion of images and ideals of life that do not meet human needs or reflect social realities. This failure is conducive to diminished well-being, including addiction to drug use or other behaviours.",Drug and alcohol review,2005 Mar,Australia,2005,00
16132453,Determinants of a quality wild turkey hunting season.,"According to the National Wild Turkey Federation, there has been a 450% increase in the number of licensed wild turkey hunters since 1973. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research articles focusing specifically on turkey hunting. Most human dimensions of wildlife research have focused on either deer or waterfowl hunting. In this study, dimensions of hunting quality, days a field, and harvest were examined among a sample of 739 Virginia fall turkey hunters. Quality of a hunting season, rather than a specific hunt, was examined. Principal components analysis (PCA) revealed five domains of attributes of a high-quality turkey-hunting season: wildlife interaction, education, being away, social interaction, and hunting skills. The domains of hunting quality revealed by the PCA are similar to domains found previously for spring turkey hunters as well as other types of hunters. Also examined were hunter perceptions of overall hunting quality, the number of days spent hunting turkeys during the fall season, and harvest success. For comparative purposes and agency needs, hunters were segmented into three categories based on days spent hunting: low frequency (1 to 2 days), medium frequency (3 to 4 days), and high frequency (> or =5 days). The influence of these variables to respondents' perceptions of overall quality was examined using a series of regression models. Variables found to be significant predictors of quality were wildlife interaction and harvest success. Hunters who killed a turkey reported a significantly higher quality season than those who did not kill a turkey.",Environmental management,2005 Jul,United States,2005,00
18253624,[Work as a social determinant of health for mental health services consumers.].,"Deinstitutionalization policies of psychiatric services have led to a massive return of former psychiatric patients in society. In accordance with social determinants of health and well-being, the authors sustain that actions led outside the hospital environment are the most favorable to mental health services consumers. On the list of the social determinants, work must be placed on top and constitutes a major factor of social integration. Yet, only 15 % of former psychiatric patients succeed in integrating the regular labour market. There is still very little research explaining this reality.

19116807,Restrictions in social participation of young adults with spina bifida.,"PURPOSE: To determine participation restrictions of young adults with spina bifida (SB) in relation to health condition and activity limitations. METHOD: A total of 179 persons aged 16-25 years and born with SB participated in a cross-sectional study. The main outcome on four domains of participation (independent living, employment, education and partner relationships) was assessed using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: At the mean age of 21 years only 16% were living independently, more than one-third of the participants went to special secondary education, 53% of those who finished education did not have a regular job and 71% did not have a partner. Health condition variables (type of SB, hydrocephalus and level of lesion) and to a lesser extent activity limitations (wheelchair dependence and incontinence) were significant determinants for having participation restrictions. Perceived hindrances in participation included long-distance transportation (19-36%), accessibility (10-42%), physical impairments (22-40%), emotional barriers (20-32%) and financial limits (3-17%). More severe SB, defined as hydrocephalus, high level of lesion and wheelchair dependence, was related with more experienced hindrances due to long-distance transportation accessibility of buildings. CONCLUSIONS: Many young adults with spina bifida experience participation restrictions. Severity of SB was negatively related to participation. Social integration should be a major focus in the professional guidance of youngsters with physical disabilities.",Disability and rehabilitation,2009,England,2009,00
11485869,The sex difference in tumor incidence is related to the female condition: models for Europe and Italy.,"A remarkable aspect of cancer distribution in Europe is the large spatial variability of the male-female incidence ratio, from no difference up to 50%. Given the evidence of the predominantly environmental origin of cancer, we studied the ability of a set of socioeconomic indicators of the female condition to model the spatial variability of the sex difference in tumor incidence at two different scales: between countries (Europe) and between provinces (Italy). The sex difference in tumor incidence correlated with female socioeconomic condition indicators at the same extent (r = 0.73) in both situations, but in opposite directions. In the European study the higher the sexual social equality the lower the differential tumor incidence, whereas the opposite result was shown by the between-provinces Italian study. We also investigated the relation of the female condition indicator with other social and cultural descriptors of the same populations, and we suggest explanatory models linking female condition and pathology at the continental and local scales. Overall, our analysis supports the predominantly environmental origin of cancer and stresses the importance of relating cancer patterns to societal determinants. Our analysis also suggests that the sex difference in tumor incidence is a very useful probe for exploring the social-economic cultural correlates of cancer in human populations. We emphasize the need for a thorough analysis of the empirical correlations highlighted in ecologic studies.",Environmental health perspectives,2001 Jul,United States,2001,00
19540385,"The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study: examining the impact of societal influences on chronic noncommunicable diseases in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.","BACKGROUND: Marked changes in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have occurred in developed and developing countries in recent decades. The overarching aim of the study is to examine the relationship of societal influences on human lifestyle behaviors, cardiovascular risk factors, and incidence of chronic noncommunicable diseases. METHODS: The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study is a large-scale epidemiological study that plans to recruit approximately 140,000 individuals residing in >600 communities in 17 low-, middle-, and high-income countries around the world. Individual data collection includes medical history, lifestyle behaviors (physical activity and dietary profile), blood collection and storage for biochemistry and future genetic analysis, electrocardiogram, and anthropometric measures. In addition, detailed information is being collected with respect to 4 environmental domains of interest-the built environment, nutrition and associated food policy, psychosocial/socioeconomic factors, and tobacco environment. A minimum follow-up of 10 years is currently planned. RESULTS: This report describes the design, justification, and methodology of the PURE study. The PURE study has been recruiting since 2002 and has enrolled 139,506 individuals by March 31, 2009.

18358670,"A census-based analysis of racial disparities in lower extremity amputation rates in Northern Illinois, 1987-2004.","BACKGROUND: Given improvements in care for peripheral vascular disease and diabetes over the last two decades, it was of interest whether racial disparities in lower extremity amputation rates had changed. METHODS: Hospital data for 18 years (1987-2004) were used to compute above, below, and through foot amputation rates for over eight million people living in the Chicago metropolitan area. Three areas were created from zip code level census data. Differences in amputation rates were compared between residents of zip code areas that were >50% African American, 10% to 50% African American, or <10% African American. RESULTS: The largely African American area of the South and West sides of Chicago, with less than 15% of the area population, accounted for 27% of all amputation discharges (n = 33,775) over the 18 years. For all residents of northern Illinois, major (above and below knee) amputation rates declined to 17 per 100,000 residents over the last decade, and both inpatient mortality and length of stay fell throughout the period. However, residents of largely African American zip codes had over five times higher per capita amputation rates than residents of primarily white zip codes. CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities have remained remarkably constant, despite progress in reducing the overall major amputation rate in northern Illinois. Addressing these disparities will require that low income, medically complex patients at risk of limb loss receive timelier, high performance care, combined with community-based public health and preventive medicine interventions that address the social determinants of health.",Journal of vascular surgery,2008 May,United States,2008,00
17761003,"Empowerment of women and mental health promotion: a qualitative study in rural Maharashtra, India.","BACKGROUND: The global burden of mental illness is high and opportunities for promoting mental health are neglected in most parts of the world. Many people affected by mental illness live in developing countries, where treatment and care options are limited. In this context, primary health care (PHC) programs can indirectly promote mental health by addressing its determinants i.e. by enhancing social unity, minimising discrimination and generating income opportunities. The objectives of this study were to: 1. Describe concepts of mental health and beliefs about determinants of mental health and illness among women involved with a PHC project in rural Maharashtra, India; 2. Identify perceived mental health problems in this community, specifically depression, suicide and violence, their perceived causes, and existing and potential community strategies to respond to them and; 3. Investigate the impact of the PHC program on individual and community factors associated with mental health METHOD: We undertook qualitative in-depth interviews with 32 women associated with the PHC project regarding: their concepts of mental health and its determinants; suicide, depression and violence; and the perceived impact of the PHC project on the determinants of mental health. The interviews were taped, transcribed, translated and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Mental health and illness were understood by these women to be the product of cultural and socio-economic factors. Mental health was commonly conceptualised as an absence of stress and the commonest stressors were conflict with husbands and mother-in-laws, domestic violence and poverty. Links between empowerment of women through income generation and education, reduction of discrimination based on caste and sex, and promotion of individual and community mental health were recognised. However, mental health problems such as suicide and violence were well-described by participants. CONCLUSION: While it is essential that affordable, accessible, appropriate treatments and systems of referral and care are available for people with mental illness in developing country settings, the promotion of mental health by addressing its determinants is another potential strategy for reducing the burden of mental illness for individuals and communities in these settings.",BMC public health,2007 Aug 31,England,2007,00

The Lifescripts resources complement this strategy by focusing on health promotion and lifestyle change. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the role of the recently developed indigenous Lifescripts resources as a tool for health checks and chronic disease prevention and management. DISCUSSION: Effective indigenous health promotion requires appropriate tools for behavioural modification and community engagement. This involves a greater emphasis on the social determinants of health to reduce the barriers to healthy behaviours. The indigenous Lifescripts provide a flexible tool for health care providers in the indigenous health sector to deliver lifestyle related brief interventions that accommodate local community resources and support structures.

19208012,Activities related to the occurrence of traumatic dental injuries in 15- to 18-year-olds.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the activities related to the occurrence of traumatic dental injuries (TDI) in order to establish the relationship between gender, socio-economic status (SES) and major TDI related events, using classification and examination procedures suitable for epidemiological purposes, in a sample of 15- to 18-year-old students in Taiwan. METHODS: A random sample of 6312 15- to 18-year-old senior high school students in southern Taiwan was selected. Each was examined with standard clinical procedures and a questionnaire. RESULTS: The prevalence of TDI was 19.9%. The major TDI related events included sports and leisure activities (30.8%), eating (20.5%), falls (19.4%), traffic accidents (10.2%) and collisions (7.1%). Within TDI victims, sports and leisure related TDI were more prevalent among males (P = 0.001, OR = 1.640, 95% CI = 1.225, 2.195) and high SES adolescents (P = 0.014, OR = 1.991, 95% CI = 1.149, 3.449). The occurrence of non-accidental TDI was not related to age, gender and SES (P > or = 0.643). CONCLUSION: Traumatic dental injuries have become an important issue in public health and dentistry. Prevention and treatment of TDI should be emphasised to the public, the health professional and the policy maker.

17934683,"Influence of psychiatric morbidity and sociodemographic determinants on use of service in a catchment area in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil.","BACKGROUND: Recent population-based studies in Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) countries brought evidence of the growing burden of mental illness in this region. The objective of this study is to examine determinants of health service utilization by individuals with psychiatric disorders in a defined area in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHOD: Data were derived from Sao Paulo Catchment Area Study (SP-ECA), a cross-sectional household prevalence survey, based on a representative adult sample (N=1,464) living in two defined boroughs. The psychiatric diagnosis was assessed through the CIDI 1.1 interview, yielding ICD-10 diagnoses. The past-month use of health services--for general medical (GM) care and mental health (MH) care sectors--was investigated in their relationship with sociodemographic features, insurance coverage, GM conditions, and psychiatric morbidity. RESULTS: Nearly one-third (32.2%) of the total sample used health services in the last month: 29.0% attended GM care and 7.8% used MH care. Logistic regression models showed that being female, older than 60 years, having private insurance coverage, and presence of psychiatric morbidity increased the level GM care seeking in the total sample. For those with 12-month psychiatric disorders, the determinants for GM sector use were female gender, age 45-59 years old, and private insurance coverage, whereas separated, divorced, or widowed women had the highest odds (OR 9.9; 95% CI: 2.7-36.5) for using MH service. Low-income people were less likely to seek MH services. CONCLUSION: The major contribution of this article is to underscore the impact of MH on health care systems, in a LAC country where service use information is scarce. The main finding is that inequalities in the access to MH care occurred, with low-income people having less likelihood of receiving treatment for their mental disorder. Access to health service in this catchment area reflected the great degree of deregulation and lack of integration. Additional efforts should address the barriers to the utilization of MH services in Brazil, including social inequities in the access to care.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2008 Jan,Germany,2008,00
25696662,Quality of life of patients on the waiting list for coronary angiography.,"BACKGROUND: Providing adequate medical information and ensuring that patients do not identify with fellow-sufferers who are doing worse are significant contributors to a better quality of life (QOL) in cardiac patients. In addition, in these patients gender and the level of psychic tension are significant predictors of QOL. We do not know (1) whether we can improve QOL by increasing patients' ability to cope with the unpleasant aspects of the underlying condition, (2) whether gender and level of psychic tension interact or act independently. OBJECTIVE: To assess both questions. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients on the waiting list for coronary angiography were assessed with validated test batteries. To increase the patients' ability to cope, they were randomly assigned to read either (1) the comments of a patient who had previously been treated successfully or (2) general information. The former information, unlike the latter, was assumed to improve coping ability and, thus, provide better QOL. Homogeneity of the patient group was estimated by Cronbach's alphas. For analysis, linear regression and general factorial analyses of variance were applied. RESULTS: The group was psychologically homogeneous as indicated by Cronbach's alphas which were generally over 75%. There was a significant or close to significant association between the use of coping information and a better mobility and social performance QOL (p<0.05 and p<0.06). High levels of psychic tension were associated with low self-perceived QOL and low psychological scores (both p<0.02). Female gender was associated with lower mobility, lower psychological scores and lower overall QOL (p<0.05, p<0.02 and p<0.05). A significant or close to significant interaction was observed between gender and psychic tension as combined determinants of self-perceived QOL, mobility index, and overall QOL index (p<0.03, p<0.09, and p<0.05). Separate assessments of these determinants showed that female gender was the strongest determinant of a low QOL. CONCLUSION: In patients on the waiting list for coronary angiography, an increased ability to cope with the unpleasant aspects of a possible underlying heart condition improves QOL. Female gender and a high level of psychic tension place patients at risk for a low QOL. It is to be hoped that this paper will raise physicians' awareness of these psychological mechanisms and that they will be given adequate attention in the future, particularly in female patients.",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2006 Sep,Netherlands,2006,00

In most mammals, social chemosignals are predominantly detected by sensory neurons of a specialized olfactory subsystem, the vomeronasal organ (VNO). The behavioral relevance of social chemosignaling puts high demands on the accuracy and dynamic range of the underlying transduction mechanisms. However, the physiological concepts implemented to ensure faithful transmission of social information remain widely unknown. Here, we show that sensory neurons in the basal layer of the mouse VNO dynamically control their input-output relationship by activity-dependent regulation of K(+) channel gene expression. Using large-scale expression profiling, immunochemistry, and electrophysiology, we provide molecular and functional evidence for a role of ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) K(+) channels as key determinants of cellular excitability. Our findings indicate that an increase in ERG channel expression extends the dynamic range of the stimulus-response function in basal vomeronasal sensory neurons. This novel mechanism of homeostatic plasticity in the periphery of the accessory olfactory system is ideally suited to adjust VNO neurons to a target output range in a layer-specific and use-dependent manner.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2009 Jan 7,United States,2009,00
11271636,The political context of social inequalities and health.,"This analysis reflects on the importance of political parties, and the policies they implement when in government, in determining the level of equalities/inequalities in a society, the extent of the welfare state (including the level of health care coverage by the state), the employment/unemployment rate, and the level of population health. The study looks at the impact of the major political traditions in the advanced OECD countries during the golden years of capitalism (1945-1980)--social democratic, Christian democratic, liberal, and ex-fascist--in four areas: (1) the main determinants of income inequalities; (2) levels of public expenditures and health care benefits coverage; (3) public support of services to families; and (4) the level of population health as measured by infant mortality. The results indicate that political traditions more committed to redistributive policies (both economic and social) and full-employment policies, such as the social democratic parties, were generally more successful in improving the health of populations. The erroneous assumption of a conflict between social equity and economic efficiency is also discussed. The study aims at filling a void in the growing health and social inequalities literature, which rarely touches on the importance of political forces in influencing inequalities.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2001,United States,2001,00
12780494,Abnormal Pap test results and the rurality factor.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the published socio-cultural determinants that put women in rural areas at greater risk of having an abnormal Pap test result. DESIGN: Literature review. CONCLUSION: An Australian woman is at increased risk of developing cervical dysplasia if she lives in a rural area, identifies as an Indigenous Australian or is from a non-English speaking country. Being aged over 50 years, increases the risk of cervical cancer but not cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, which peaks in the 20-24 year age group. Other connections with cervical dysplasia relate to a woman or her partner's sexual history, her nutritional status and possibly even her personality type. Smoking, social isolation, high negative life change events and having lived a 'troubled' life are all identified in the literature as increasing a woman's risk of having an abnormal Pap test result. Receiving an abnormal Pap test result often leads to feelings of fear, anxiety, guilt, shock, vulnerability, powerlessness, depression, shame and feeling dirty for the woman concerned. Compounding these negative feelings are social, practical and financial difficulties that have to be addressed. It is argued that social and medical models of health must complement each other to improve the well being of rural women experiencing an abnormal Pap result.",The Australian journal of rural health,2003 Apr,Australia,2003,00
19175285,Explaining adherence success in sub-Saharan Africa: an ethnographic study.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa generally take more than 90% of prescribed doses of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This number exceeds the levels of adherence observed in North America and dispels early scale-up concerns that adherence would be inadequate in settings of extreme poverty. This paper offers an explanation and theoretical model of ART adherence success based on the results of an ethnographic study in three sub-Saharan African countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Determinants of ART adherence for HIV-infected persons in sub-Saharan Africa were examined with ethnographic research methods. 414 in-person interviews were carried out with 252 persons taking ART, their treatment partners, and health care professionals at HIV treatment sites in Jos, Nigeria; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and Mbarara, Uganda. 136 field observations of clinic activities were also conducted. Data were examined using category construction and interpretive approaches to analysis. Findings indicate that individuals taking ART routinely overcome economic obstacles to ART adherence through a number of deliberate strategies aimed at prioritizing adherence: borrowing and ""begging"" transport funds, making ""impossible choices"" to allocate resources in favor of treatment, and ""doing without."" Prioritization of adherence is accomplished through resources and help made available by treatment partners, other family members and friends, and health care providers. Helpers expect adherence and make their expectations known, creating a responsibility on the part of patients to adhere. Patients adhere to promote good will on the part of helpers, thereby ensuring help will be available when future needs arise. CONCLUSION: Adherence success in sub-Saharan Africa can be explained as a means of fulfilling social responsibilities and thus preserving social capital in essential relationships.",PLoS medicine,2009 Jan 27,United States,2009,00
18318001,Developing a self-rating measure of patient competence in the context of oncology: a multi-center study.,"OBJECTIVE: Concepts of patient competence (PC) are being increasingly used, but seldom clearly defined in the context of shared medical treatment decision making and coping with cancer. The meaning of such concepts should therefore be clarified, and measures developed that permit the assessment of different facets of this patient characteristic. Consequently, this study attempted to contribute to the definition and measurement of PC. METHODS: Employing literature reviews and qualitative interviews, we developed a working definition of PC in the context of cancer from which we designed a self-rating measure of this patient characteristic that was then tested for validity and reliability in a sample of N=536 patients with cancer. RESULTS: Using factor analyses, we developed five problem- and three emotion-focused subscales that measure distinct facets of PC with satisfactory reliability. Additional analyses provide preliminary evidence of the instruments' validity. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents an essential first step in developing a reliable self-rating measure of PC in the context of cancer. Although further refinement of this measure is clearly required, it provides a preliminary methodological basis for empirically investigating the determinants and potential health effects of PC.",Psycho-oncology,2008 Nov,England,2008,00

This study's sample consists of 353 nurses from two general hospitals in the cities of Seoul and Taegu, Korea. Data were collected from self-administered questionnaires and analyzed with LISREL. The results showed that four structural variables (workload, supervisory support, routinization, and pay), two psychological variables (positive and negative affectivity), and one environmental variable (job opportunity) had a significant net effect on hospital nurses' job satisfaction. The explained variance for job satisfaction is 53.0%.

17111215,The effects of years lived in the United States on the general health status of California's foreign-born populations.,The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of immigrant status and years lived in the United States on the general health status of California's foreign-born populations. Two models were constructed using California's aggregate adult population and the adult foreign-born population. A binary logistic regression was conducted using data from the 2003 California Health Interview Survey. California's immigrant populations were found to enjoy a self-assessed health advantage compared to California's US-born population. The results present evidence of a downward trend in self-assessed health amongst California's foreign-born population associated with increased years lived in country. The initial health advantage found among California's foreign-born appears to function mainly through socio-economic factors. These results suggest that the deterioration in health associated with increased years lived in the US may be an effect of immigrants' exposure to California's environmental determinants of human health rather that the loss of culture-specific protective factors.,Journal of immigrant and minority health,2007 Apr,United States,2007,00
15222847,Toward an understanding of the determinants of anger.,"Research bearing on several popular conceptions of the major determinants of anger arousal indicates that the particular appraisals often identified as causes of anger frequently only serve to affect the intensity of the anger that is generated. Research into effects of physical pain or other physically unpleasant conditions or involving social stresses suggests that decidedly aversive conditions are a major spur to anger. Experiments are also reviewed showing that anger-related muscular movements can also lead to anger-related feelings, memories, cognitions, and autonomic responses. Alternative explanations for the findings are discussed. The authors urge emotion theorists to widen their methodology and analyses so that they give careful, detailed attention to the many different factors that can influence anger.","Emotion (Washington, D.C.)",2004 Jun,United States,2004,00
11807917,Determinants of physical activity among Taiwanese adolescents: an application of the health promotion model.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among interpersonal influences (i.e., social support, norms, modeling), behavior-specific cognitions (i.e., self-efficacy, perceived benefits/barriers), competing demands, and physical activity among Taiwanese adolescents (N = 832). The results from structural equation modeling indicated that perceived self-efficacy was the most important predictor of physical activity. Interpersonal influences, when considered in total, had a weak and nonsignificant direct effect on physical activity but had indirect effects on physical activity thorough perceived benefits and perceived self-efficacy. When sources of interpersonal influences were considered separately, parental influences did not have direct effects on physical activity. In contrast, peers did have a significant direct effect on physical activity and also indirect influences on physical activity through perceived self-efficacy. All variables accounted for 30% of the variance in physical activity. Results of this study identify important influences useful to health professionals for promoting physical activity in this population.",Research in nursing & health,2002 Feb,United States,2002,00
21483327,Cuban health professionals: will publishing perish?,"Cuba is a small country with one of the highest physician-percapita ratios in the world (1:155 in 2007). Since the 1980s, all new MDs are required to complete a family medicine residency, and many go on to pursue a second medical specialty or an advanced degree in public health, medical education or medical sciences. The numbers of other university-level health professionals are impressive. Cuba is also home to globally-respected biotechnology and medical research institutions, such as the Finlay Institute and the Pedro Kour Institute of Tropical Medicine. Yet, the number and frequency of articles by Cuban authors published in national and international journals does not reflect the breadth and depth of Cuban medical research and practice. The most frequently cited articles in international journals of impact are in the fields of genetics, neurosciences, immunology, pharmacology and oncology, and almost 80% of these are co-authored by non-Cubans. While it is certain that many of these articles reflect public health applications, you will find scant citations of articles on other important topics at the forefront of Cuban public health-such as primary health care, infectious disease control, human resource development, sexual and reproductive health, and social determinants of health and wellness.",MEDICC review,2009 Jan,United States,2009,00
11523635,Women workers confront one-eyed science: building alliances to improve women's occupational health.,"Women suffer many health problems related to their work, but attempts to improve their situation face obstacles at two levels: recognition of their problems and ability to organize to prevent them. Recognition by occupational health specialists has been delayed due in part to: A perception that women's issues have been included in research focussed on male workers; pressure to deal with more visible issues of mortality and well-established illness; ignorance of women's working conditions; methodological biases and inadequacies. Recognition by unions is slowed when women and their concerns are absent from union membership and/or governing structures. Feminist health advocates have not often participated in these struggles, due to social class differences and difficulties in linking with some male-dominated unions. Also, due to the wide variety of hazardous working conditions, they do not emerge from population-based analyses of health determinants in the same way as do domestic violence, tobacco or poverty. The authors describe three alliances necessary for successful research, policy and practice in women's occupational health: between feminist and working-class organizations; between feminists and occupational health scientists; between researchers and women workers.",Women & health,2001,United States,2001,00

Observation of a future debate partner (i.e., vigilance) evoked larger increases in blood pressure than did observation of a less relevant person, apparently through the combination of increases in cardiac output and vascular resistance. Preparation and enactment of efforts to exert social influence (i.e., active coping) evoked heightened blood pressure and heart rate responses through increased cardiac contractility and output. Thus, both vigilance and active coping in social contexts increased cardiovascular reactivity, but apparently through different psychophysiological processes.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2000 Jul,United States,2000,00
17610150,Key topics in the study of older adult health in developing countries that are experiencing population aging.,"Rapid population aging is occurring in many parts of the developing world. Age structures are shifting from a relative concentration of younger to older individuals. Formal and informal health care needs across the developing world are changing concurrently. Therefore, population aging has enormous implications for health and social policy. This essay, which serves as an introduction to a special issue of Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology, highlights several critical research topics that require attention due to their implications for the health of individuals living in developing countries that are experiencing population aging. These include: population health levels, trends, and individual health transitions; influences of socioeconomic status on health and the consequences of rapidly changing socioeconomic structures for population health; and comparative studies on health and aging. Comparative research, in particular, has been underdeveloped and underutilized, but has great potential for providing insights into health determinants as well as the uniformity versus variation of the aging experience across societies. The remaining four papers that make up this special issue deal with these research topics and together highlight the complexity that exists in assessing individual and population health trends in developing countries that are undergoing population aging.",Journal of cross-cultural gerontology,2007 Sep,Netherlands,2007,00
11428197,"[Secular trends in birth weight in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil (1976-1998)].","OBJECTIVE: Data from two household surveys on infant and child health status undertaken in the mid-80s and mid-90s, complemented with previous data collected from maternity hospitals records and more recent data provided by the state system on birth registries, allowed to characterize and analyse secular trends in birth weight in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The household surveys included random samples of children under 5 years old (n = 1,016 children in 1984-85 and n = 1,280 children in 1995-96). A random sample of births that took place in the city's hospitals in the year of 1976 (n = 5,734) was drawn from the hospital records. Birth registries refer to children born in the city between 1993 and 1998 (around 200,000 per year). The study of the social distribution of birth weight took into account the per capita family income and maternal schooling. For the analysis of the determinants of secular trends, hierarchical causal models, multivariate regression analyses and calculations analogous to the ones used to assess population attributable risks were applied. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Birth weight distribution in S. Paulo city (an average of 3,160 g and 8.9% of the values < 2,500 g) is below the expected for optimum fetal growth conditions (average 3,400-3,500 g and 4-5% of the values < 2,500 g). The birth weight distribution did not change substantially along the study period (1976-1998). However, there are evidences of changes when different socioeconomic strata are considered separately. Among the lower strata trends have been positive and this seems to be due to increases in intrauterine growth as a result of an improvement in family's purchasing power, women's weight and height, prenatal care and, possibly, the reduction in smoking. Among the higher socioeconomic strata, birth weight trends have been negative apparently due to an increase in premature births of unknown origin.",Revista de saude publica,2000 Dec,Brazil,2000,00
12579290,Determinants of the interval between diagnosis and treatment in patients with digestive tract cancer.,"The main objective was to analyze the influence of social factors on the interval from diagnosis to treatment in a cohort of 217 patients with digestive tract cancer. From the clinical charts data were obtained for: date of the beginning of illness, dates of medical attendance, type and date of diagnostic tests, characteristics of the disease (symptoms, stage), and date of treatment. From the personal interview we gathered information lacking in the clinical charts such as socio-demographic factors, other underlying diseases, and variables related to life style. The information on hospital admission, diagnosis, and treatment was prospectively gathered, whereas data before hospitalization were retrospectively assessed. In statistical analysis the Kruskal-Wallis test and Cox regression were used. The predictors associated with a shorter diagnosis-treatment period were: low social class, lymphatic involvement at diagnosis, first visit at secondary/tertiary level of health care, no car availability, two or more symptoms at the beginning of disease, sex (male), age (less than 74 years), and diagnosis out of vacation periods. In conclusion, several socio-demographic variables (age, gender, social class, and car availability) influence the interval diagnosis-treatment.",Oncology reports,2003 Mar-Apr,Greece,2003,00

However, some commentators question the agenda: the endless pursuit of individual risk factors and the cursory attention to social determinants of disease. We attempt to illustrate some limitations of US public health by focusing on type-2 diabetes (adult-onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes)--an increasingly prevalent but still poorly understood medical condition with devastating complications and implications for quality of life. A more theoretically based multilevel approach to diabetes, outlined for the 21st century, has an almost exclusive downstream curative focus, that ranges from midstream preventive programmes to upstream healthy public policy.","Lancet (London, England)",2000 Aug 26,England,2000,00
12557648,"Women's health, changes and challenges in health policy development in Lithuania.","Health is a sensitive mirror of social circumstances. This paper looks at the situation of women's health in Lithuania in the context of the social, political and economic transition in the country following independence in 1990, and reforms to the health system. Data since 1990 show that considerable social and demographic inequalities in the health of women exist in Lithuania, with low-educated women and those living in rural areas in the most unfavourable situation, including in relation to reproductive health. Reproductive health issues have received some recognition in recent years, with the main attention and resources directed to the development of a Maternal and Child Health Programme, especially perinatal care and the organisation of neonatology services, which has resulted in a notable decrease in maternal, perinatal and infant mortality. Services for family planning, abortion, infertility, cervical and breast cancer, and violence against women are under-developed. Non-governmental organizations are beginning to be formed to advocate for increased resources and services for reproductive health. Improvements in the health status of Lithuanian women can be expected if attention is paid to social determinants of health.",Reproductive health matters,2002 Nov,Netherlands,2002,00
17187219,Sexual practices and sexual satisfaction: a population based study of Chinese urban adults.,"This study examined sexual satisfaction and its social and behavioral correlates among urbanites aged 20-64 in China, using data from a nationally representative sample of 1,194 women and 1,217 men with a spouse or other long-term sexual partner with whom they had sex during the last year. The results from structural equation models suggest a multiplex set of determinants of sexual satisfaction, including relationship characteristics, sexual knowledge and personal values, physical vitality, and environmental impediments. A large proportion of the effect of these background characteristics was mediated by frequent orgasms, varied sexual practices, and perceived partner affection. In particular, much of the effect of knowledge and beliefs was mediated through variety in sexual practices. While many of the observed patterns were shared among women and men, much of the effect of relationship characteristics was mediated through perceived partner affection for women. Men, in contrast, paid greater attention to his partner's physical attractiveness and to her extramarital sex. A sexual transition is well underway in urban China, even if more rapidly for men than for women. While knowledge and values are arguably more important in this transitional period, many antecedents of sexual well-being drawn from the literature on sexual behavior in developed Western countries are also applicable to urban China.",Archives of sexual behavior,2007 Feb,United States,2007,00
19625368,Global health: where are our priorities?,"UNLABELLED: The subject of 'global health' can be considered from multiple points of view. While epidemiologists might describe global health problems in categories of pathology groups, social scientists might consider the problem from the stand point of institutional and infrastructural strengths and failings. An over-arching theme, however, is that the distribution of the burden of ill health is disproportionately carried by the poor. This paper aims to defend the idea that inequality should be considered the main priority in global ill health. SOURCES OF DATA: Review of the literature, personal communications and the WHO commission on the Social Determinants of Health. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The extent and urgency of global health problems. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The cause of ill health and the appropriate intervention. GROWING POINTS: We all need a deeper appreciation of the plight of the poor and the extent to which suffering can be mitigated by striving for a more equitable future.

19594926,A structured review of reasons for ecstasy use and related behaviours: pointers for future research.,"BACKGROUND: While the health risks of using ecstasy warrant intervention development, a recent meta-analysis of determinants of ecstasy use identified a number of lacunae in the literature. Specifically, no studies were included that address behaviours other than 'using ecstasy' (e.g. 'trying out ecstasy' or 'ceasing ecstasy use'). However, because meta-analyses aim to integrate study results quantitatively, the resulting rigid exclusion criteria cause many studies to be discarded on the basis of their qualitative methodology. Such qualitative studies may nonetheless provide valuable insights to guide future research. To provide an overview of these insights regarding ecstasy use, the current study summarizes and combines what is known from qualitative and exploratory quantitative literature on ecstasy use. METHODS: The databases PsycINFO and MedLine were searched for publications reporting reasons for ecstasy use and related behaviour, and the results were structured and discussed per behaviour and compared over behaviours. RESULTS: Two main categories of reasons were found. The first category comprised reasons to start using ecstasy, use ecstasy, use ecstasy more often, and refrain from ceasing ecstasy use. The second category comprised reasons to refrain from starting to use ecstasy, use less ecstasy, and cease using ecstasy. Reasons for related behaviours within each of these two categories appear to differ, but not as substantially as between the two categories. A large number of reasons that were not yet explored in quantitative research emerged. CONCLUSION: The current summary and combination of exploratory studies yields useful lists of reasons for each behaviour. Before these lists can inform interventions, however, they beg quantitative verification. Also, similarity of determinant configurations of different behaviours can be assessed by addressing determinants of several behaviours in one study. Another important finding is that meta-analytical integration of the literature may overlook important findings and implications. Thus, qualitative reviews remain useful instruments in setting the research agenda.",BMC public health,2009 Jul 13,England,2009,00
19655628,On the value of environmental stewardship and sustainability in health administration education.,"Global warming, the depletion of the world'snatural resources, and excessive consumer consumption in developed countries are determinants reshaping the way we live our everyday lives. These factors are rapidly giving rise to new ecological paradigms of environmental stewardship and in healthcare environments that express sustainable theories and practices. This has given rise to a systematic system for promoting and assessing the energy performance and efficiency of healthcare facilities known as Leadership in Energy Efficient Environmental Design (LEED), and a parallel certification program, the Green Guide for Heath Care. These developments are examined in direct relation to the functions of managerial ethics. A series of ten sustainability-based ethical dilemmas are presented. Each is examined in relation to the need to inculcate in future healthcare administrators a critical understanding and appreciation of the need to reposition contemporary healthcare organizations at the center--as leading civic participants and role models in relation to the emerging movement towards carbon neutrality in the healthcare industry.",The Journal of health administration education,2008 Summer,United States,2008,00
11094921,Characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis patients: who participates in long-term research and who drops out?,"OBJECTIVE: A 10-year study of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients was conducted to identify characteristics associated with continued participation in a long-term research project. METHODS: Nine hundred eighty-eight RA patients were recruited from 56 private rheumatology practices. Over the course of the study, 45 patients died and were eliminated from the analysis. Patients were interviewed by phone each year for 10 years, and their physicians provided clinical data. Variables measured included demographic characteristics, perceived health status, employment status, family responsibilities, social support, and clinical health status. RESULTS: Forty-six percent of patients remained in the study after 10 years. Survival analysis using Cox regression techniques assessed baseline factors that significantly predicted characteristics of patients who remained in the study. The multivariate analysis found that more educated patients, female patients, those with moderate to high levels of social support, patients having fewer joint groups with flares, and employed patients were more likely to remain in the study. Disease characteristics of stage of disease, level of pain, self-reported level of physical disability, and duration of RA were not significantly associated with continued study participation. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that psychosocial and socioeconomic factors are more important determinants of continued participation in long-term research studies than are most clinical disease characteristics. Among clinical variables, only the active disease characteristic of joint flares predicted continued study participation. Overall disease characteristics such as disease stage or duration did not predict subject attrition.",Arthritis care and research : the official journal of the Arthritis Health Professions Association,2000 Feb,United States,2000,00
19232810,Understanding gendered influences on women's reproductive health in Pakistan: moving beyond the autonomy paradigm.,"Recent research and policy discourse commonly view the limited autonomy of women in developing countries as a key barrier to improvements in their reproductive health. Rarely, however, is the notion of women's autonomy interrogated for its conceptual adequacy or usefulness for understanding the determinants of women's reproductive health, effective policy formulation or program design. Using ethnographic data from 2001, including social mapping exercises, observation of daily life, interviews, case studies and focus group discussions, this paper draws attention to the incongruities between the concept of women's autonomy and the gendered social, cultural, economic and political realities of women's lives in rural Punjab, Pakistan. These inadequacies include: the concept's undue emphasis on women's independent, autonomous action; a lack of attention to men and masculinities; a disregard for the multi-sited constitution of gender relations and gender inequality; an erroneous assumption that uptake of reproductive health services is an indicator of autonomy; and a failure to explore the interplay of other axes of disadvantage such as caste, class or socio-economic position. This paper calls for alternative, more nuanced, theoretical approaches for conceptualizing gender inequalities in order to enhance our understanding of women's reproductive wellbeing in Pakistan. The extent to which our arguments may be relevant to the wider South Asian context, and women's lives in other parts of the world, is also discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),2009 Apr,England,2009,00
14722343,The impact of structural and functional characteristics of social relations as determinants of functional decline.,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines whether aspects of social relations at baseline are related to functional decline at 5-year follow-up among nondisabled old men and women. METHODS: The investigation is based on baseline and follow-up data on 651 nondisabled 75-year-old persons in Jyvaskyla (Finland) and Glostrup (Denmark). The analyses are performed separately for men and women. Possible selection problems were considered by using three outcome measures: first, functional decline among the survivors (n = 425); second, functional decline, including death, assuming that death is part of a general decline pattern (n = 565); and third, mortality (n = 651). Social relations were measured at baseline by several items focusing on the structure and function of the social network. RESULTS: In men, no weekly telephone contact was related to functional decline and mortality. Among women, less than weekly telephone contact, no membership in a retirement club, and not sewing for others were significantly related to functional decline and mortality. The associations were stronger when the dead were included in the outcome measure. DISCUSSION: The results point to the importance of social relations in the prevention of functional decline in older adults.","The journals of gerontology.

Data from a prospective intervention study of psychosocial support and from a computerized patient administration system were used. A total of 393 newly diagnosed patients were included. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to determine whether the addition of information regarding age, comorbidity, functional status, symptoms, and socioeconomic variables improved the prediction of utilization of specialist inpatient care beyond that afforded by cancer-related factors. In addition to cancer diagnosis and treatment, comorbidity, physical function, and pain determined use of inpatient care. Patients living in rural areas and those with a low income utilized hospital care more often. The results suggest that thorough assessment can identify patients at diagnosis with an increased need for follow-up, e.g. intensified home care services.","Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",2004,England,2004,00

The family environment may play a key role in shaping children's eating behaviors. The purpose of this study was to estimate the degree of familial resemblance in eating behavioral traits (cognitive dietary restraint, disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger). RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Eating behavioral traits were assessed with the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire in 282 men and 402 women (202 families) from the Quebec Family Study. Familial resemblance for each trait (adjusted for age, sex, and BMI) was investigated using a familial correlation model. RESULTS: The pattern of familial correlation showed significant spouse correlation for the three eating behavior phenotypes, as well as significant parent-offspring and sibling correlations for disinhibition and susceptibility to hunger. According to the most parsimonious model, generalized heritability estimates (including genetic and shared familial environmental effects) reached 6%, 18%, and 28% for cognitive dietary restraint, disinhibition, and susceptibility to hunger, respectively. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that there is a significant familial component to eating behavioral traits but that the additive genetic component appears to be small, with generalized heritability estimates ranging from 6% to 28%. Thus, non-familial environmental factors and gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions seem to be the major determinants of the eating/behavioral traits.",Obesity research,2005 Sep,United States,2005,00
17299122,Ethnic differences in lifestyle and overweight in the Netherlands.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of lifestyle variables and socioeconomic status on overweight among native Dutch and immigrants in The Netherlands. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Data were used from a survey sample (N = 2551) of native Dutch and immigrant respondents (Surinamese/Antilleans, Turks, and Moroccans). BMI was calculated using self-reported weight and height. Lifestyle variables such as modern food habits (take-out food and eating out) and participating in sports were included, as well as socioeconomic and demographic background variables. Bivariate and ordinary least squares analyses were performed to study BMI and the determinants of overweight among the different groups. RESULTS: All immigrant groups had a higher prevalence of overweight than the Dutch, except Moroccans. Men were overweight more frequently than women. Take-out food, eating out, and fresh vegetables were related to a decrease in BMI, whereas convenience foods were related to an increase in BMI. For ready-to-eat meals, the results were mixed. In all groups, age was associated with a higher BMI, and a higher level of education was associated with a lower BMI. Immigrants participated in sports less frequently than native Dutch people. DISCUSSION: One percent to 5% of the total public health costs can be attributed to costs for overweight-related diseases. Public health policies should aim at stimulating healthy lifestyles and discouraging bad food habits through higher taxes on high-calorie foods. In particular, Dutch immigrants should be encouraged to lose weight, because they have a higher risk for overweight-related diseases.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2007 Feb,United States,2007,00
17115323,High prevalence of smoking among urban-dwelling Canadian men who have sex with men.,"A small but consistent literature from the United States suggests increased risk for smoking among lesbians and men who have sex with men (MSM). Few studies have investigated smoking among MSM in other countries where different social norms and restrictions on smoking in public apply. We measured smoking behaviours in a convenience sample of urban-dwelling young Canadian MSM (median age 28 years). We compared the prevalence of smoking among MSM with that among other men in British Columbia (BC) using National Population Health Survey data to compute an age-adjusted standardized prevalence ratio (SPR). Independent predictors of smoking among MSM were identified using adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Smoking during the previous year was reported by twice as many MSM (54.5% of 354) as other men in BC (25.9%) (SPR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.48-2.59), with largest differentials observed among men under 25 years of age. In multivariable analyses, smoking among MSM was significantly associated with younger age (OR 0.94, CI 0.88-1.00 per year), greater number of depressive symptoms (OR 1.12, CI 1.06-1.19 per symptom) and Canadian Aboriginal ethnicity (OR 2.64, CI 1.05-6.60). In summary, MSM in our study were twice as likely to smoke as other men in BC; the greatest differences were observed among the youngest men. The design of effective prevention and cessation programs for MSM will require identification of the age-dependent determinants of smoking initiation, persistence, and attempts to quit.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2006 Nov,United States,2006,00
12227960,Tackling social inequality through the development of health policy in Lithuania.,"AIMS: The major aim of this study was to assess existing inequalities in health of Lithuanian population and to present the process of health policy development as a major tool for reducing inequalities. The objectives were: to present life expectancy and mortality trend analysis in comparison with other European countries; to demonstrate risk profile of Lithuanian population to major noncommunicable diseases related to social inequalities and inequities in health; and to present the process of National health policy development as potential for effective reduction of inequalities in health of Lithuanian population. METHODS: Information about demographic, general health situation and inequalities in health was obtained from Lithuanian Department of Statistics, National Health Information Centre and research studies performed at Kaunas University of Medicine. RESULTS: Considerable demographic, social and territorial inequalities in health were disclosed in Lithuania. Large proportion of them might be related to social inequalities in the society. Substantial improvements in health status of Lithuanian population could be expected if due attention was paid to social determinants of health. CONCLUSION: Implementation of balanced national health policy involving all sectors of the society is the solution.",Scandinavian journal of public health. Supplement,2002,England,2002,00
12841426,Biological and environmental determinants of childhood obesity.,"Childhood obesity reflects the confluence of three factors that minimize attention to internal physiologic satiety signals: the release of central opioids through ingestion of sweets and fats, which induces a preference for such foods; the phylogenetic quality of extending meals in response to environmental demands, as in work schedules, or through finding patches of agreeable food that are safe to consume (this is exacerbated in impoverished children, whose activity is limited); the determination of food preference through social interactions renders feeding systems open to external influences such as mass marketing and television advertising. Alternative feeding modes are presented based on studies of childhood food preferences and how children may be influenced to choose more balanced and healthier diets.",Nutrition in clinical care : an official publication of Tufts University,2003 Jan-Apr,United States,2003,00
11114693,An epidemiological study of hypertension and its determinants in a population in transition: the THUSA study.,"BACKGROUND: Many black persons in South Africa have been subjected to urbanisation and urbanisation has led to a significant increase in diseases of lifestyle. The determinants of hypertension in a population in transition have not been well-defined and there is a pressing need for observational epidemiological studies as well as randomised-controlled trials in populations from Africa. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between blood pressure and factors known to contribute to hypertension. METHODS: The study sample consisted mainly of Setswana speaking people, divided into different levels (strata) of urbanisation, namely stratum 1 (rural) to stratum 5 (urbanized). A total of 1821 black subjects, which included 1040 woman, were recruited and randomly selected from 37 sites from the four geographical quarters of the North West Province of South Africa. The following questionnaires were used: demographic, anthropometric, quantitative food frequency, physical activity and scales to measure psychosocial variables. Biochemical analysis (standardised methods) were done on the serum and plasma of the subjects and the blood pressure was measured with a sphygmomanometer. RESULTS: Of the total sample, 22.8% of the subjects had systolic and 20.7% diastolic blood pressures above 140/90 mm Hg. Males and females from stratum 3 showed the highest rate of hypertension (32.9% systolic and 25.1% diastolic) and stratum 5 the lowest. Blood pressure correlated positively with age, level of urbanisation, WHR (waist:hip ratio) and smoking. In the woman the diastolic blood pressure correlated the best with body mass index (BMI), serum triglycerides, total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and s-GGT. Coping strategies, experience of social support, cultural aspects and affect balance are related to blood pressure, especially in the case of women. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that factors associated with urbanisation are related to the manifestation of hypertension in black people of the North West Province, given the highest mean blood pressure in people living in informal settlements, where most newcomers to the urban areas live.

19089374,Screening of virulence traits in Legionella pneumophila and analysis of the host susceptibility to infection by using the Dictyostelium host model system.,"The social soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has been established as a host model for several human pathogens including Legionella pneumophila. The complete genome sequence, the genetic tractability, and the phagocytic characteristics of Dictyostelium generate many opportunities for the study of host-pathogen interactions. Important applications of this haploid model organism are (i) the use of Dictyostelium cells as a screening system for bacterial virulence, (ii) the use of Dictyostelium mutant cells to identify genetic host determinants of susceptibility and resistance to infection, and (iii) experiments that allow the dissection of the complex cross-talk with infectious agents. Accordingly, this chapter describes a plaque assay to identify attenuated pathogens, an infection assay for the analysis of host cell mutants and pathogens, and a screening method for the isolation of Legionella mutants that are defective in the reprogramming of the phagolysosomal maturation of the host.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2009,United States,2009,00
17486209,Foreign policy matters: a normative view of the G8 and population health.,"The Group of Eight (G8) countries occupy a dominant position in the international economic and political order. Given what is known about influences on the social determinants of health in an interconnected world, the G8 are a logical starting point for any enquiry into the relations between foreign policy and health. We first make five arguments for adopting an explicitly normative, equity-oriented perspective on the performance of G8 policy in areas related to population health. We then examine G8 performance with respect to the crucial policy triad of development assistance, debt relief and trade, finding that neither rhetoric nor promising institutional innovation has been matched by resources commensurate with demonstrated levels of need. We conclude that it is necessary to pursue advocacy efforts based on the normative perspective we have put forward and that doing so effectively requires further investigation of why some policies are more receptive than others to policies of redistribution both within and outside their borders.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,2007 Mar,Switzerland,2007,00
12002897,Physical health correlates of overprediction of physical discomfort during exercise.,"This study sought to determine if overprediction of physical discomfort prior to and following exercise was related to a number of self-report and objective measures of physical health status in a general population sample. Cross-sectional findings indicated a significant and specific relation between patterns of discomfort overprediction (vs under- or accurate prediction) and negative self-reported health status and attitudes to exercise, lower levels of physical activity, as well as poorer scores for resting heart rate, cardiorespiratory fitness and body mass index (but not waist:hip ratio). Females were more likely to overpredict discomfort, were less active and had poorer physical health than males. The potential usefulness of the prediction match-mismatch paradigm for studying exercise-related appraisal processes as proximal determinants of physical activity are discussed. Information obtained from such studies could prove useful in public health education campaigns aimed at increasing levels of physical activity in the general population, particularly among the less active.",Behaviour research and therapy,2002 Apr,England,2002,00
12909417,How do we make health impact assessment fit for purpose?,"Progress has been made in recent years in the process of health impact assessment (HIA), including community involvement. The technical side is less well developed. A minimum requirement is that there should be some consistency or robustness, so that the outcome of an HIA does not depend just on who happens to carry it out, that it is not easily swayed by the vested interests that typically surround any project, and that it can withstand legal challenge. Validity is an important criterion, as well as repeatability, as the latter can be achieved merely by propagating errors. All types of evidence should be considered legitimate, including qualitative and quantitative methods. The quality of evidence, and its generalisability, need to be carefully assessed; we should leave behind the divisive discourse around ""positivism"". Typically there is less information on the links from interventions (policies or projects) to changes in determinants of health than there is on the immediate precursors of health and ill-health. A practical question is, how the best existing knowledge can be made available to HIA practitioners. Other issues are more tractable than is often thought, e.g. that an HIA has to be able to trade off positive and negative impacts to different groups of people, and that the complexity of social causation prevents clear analysis of cause and effect.",Public health,2003 Sep,Netherlands,2003,00
18173388,The value and challenges of participatory research: strengthening its practice.,"The increasing use of participatory research (PR) approaches to address pressing public health issues reflects PR's potential for bridging gaps between research and practice, addressing social and environmental justice and enabling people to gain control over determinants of their health. Our critical review of the PR literature culminates in the development of an integrative practice framework that features five essential domains and provides a structured process for developing and maintaining PR partnerships, designing and implementing PR efforts, and evaluating the intermediate and long-term outcomes of descriptive, etiological, and intervention PR studies. We review the empirical and nonempirical literature in the context of this practice framework to distill the key challenges and added value of PR. Advances to the practice of PR over the next decade will require establishing the effectiveness of PR in achieving health outcomes and linking PR practices, processes, and core elements to health outcomes.",Annual review of public health,2008,United States,2008,00
16585469,Gender disadvantage and reproductive health risk factors for common mental disorders in women: a community survey in India.,"BACKGROUND: Gender disadvantage and reproductive health are major determinants of women's health in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of factors indicative of gender disadvantage and reproductive health with the risk of common mental disorders (CMDs) in women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey from November 1, 2001, to June 15, 2003. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3000 women randomly selected from a sampling frame of women aged 18 to 45 years in Goa; 2494 women participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the presence of a CMD, as defined by the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule. An interview and blood and vaginal/urine specimens were collected to ascertain risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of CMD was 6.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7%-7.6%). Mixed anxiety-depressive disorder was the most common diagnosis (64.8%). Factors independently associated with the risk for CMD were factors indicative of gender disadvantage, particularly sexual violence by the husband (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.6), being widowed or separated (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.0-30.0), having low autonomy in decision making (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), and having low levels of support from one's family (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3); reproductive health factors, particularly gynecological complaints such as vaginal discharge (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.2-4.8) and dyspareunia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.6); and factors indicative of severe economic difficulties, such as hunger (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.6). There was no association between biological indicators (anemia and reproductive tract infections) and CMD. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical assessment of CMD in women must include exploration of violence and gender disadvantage. Gynecological symptoms may be somatic equivalents of CMD in women in Asian cultures.",Archives of general psychiatry,2006 Apr,United States,2006,00
17651491,Self-rated health and its determinants among adults in Syria: a model from the Middle East.,"BACKGROUND: Self-rated health (SRH) has been widely used to research health inequalities in developed western societies, but few such studies are available in developing countries. Similar to many Arab societies, little research has been conducted in Syria on the health status of its citizens, particularly in regards to SRH. This Study aims to investigate and compare determinants of SRH in adult men and women in Aleppo, Syria. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of adults 18 to 65 years old residing in Aleppo (2,500,000 inhabitants), Syria was carried out in 2004, involving 2038 household representatives (45.2% men, age range 18-65 years, response rate 86%). SRH was categorized as excellent, normal, and poor. Odds ratios for poor and normal SRH, compared to excellent, were calculated separately for men and women using logistic regression. RESULTS: Women were more likely than men to describe their health as poor. Men and women were more likely to report poor SRH if they were older, reported two or more chronic health problems, or had high self perceived functional disability. Important gender-specific determinants of poor SRH included being married, low socioeconomic status, and not having social support for women, and smoking, low physical activity for men. CONCLUSION: Women were more likely than men to describe their health as poor. The link with age and pre-existing chronic conditions seems universal and likely reflects natural aging process. Determinants of SRH differed between men and women, possibly highlighting underlying cultural norms and gender roles in the society. Understanding the local context of SRH and its determinants within the prevailing culture will be important to tailor intervention programs aimed at improving health of the Syrian and similar Arab societies.",BMC public health,2007 Jul 25,England,2007,00
17437317,Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene concentrations in umbilical cord of newborns and determinant maternal factors.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to identify exposure levels to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and to assess maternal factors as determinants of the serum dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) concentration in umbilical cord in newborns from the Mexican Pacific coastal area of Oaxaca State. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 86 paired mothers and newborns from the Oaxaca community of Pochutla. Blood and umbilical cord blood samples were collected to determine DDT and DDE by GC. Information concerning possible determinant factors with regard to pesticide concentration was obtained by means of a questionnaire. RESULTS: A positive correlation between maternal and umbilical cord serum DDE concentration was observed (geometric mean of 7.69 microg g(-1) and 7.29, respectively). Multiple analyses showed that significant maternal factors related to umbilical cord serum DDE concentrations were: always having lived in the same community; low to high socioeconomic strata; accumulated breast-feeding time. CONCLUSIONS: The determinant factors observed in this study must be considered in future studies for the quantification of organochlorine concentration. In addition, these factors must be taken into account when preventive actions to minimize in utero exposure to these pesticides are carried out.",Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,2008 Jan,England,2008,00

Stress activates the sympato-adrenal system with possible dangerous consequences on the cardiovascular apparatus. In field studies the relation between stress and coronary diseases is controversial. However, from a clinical and experimental perspective the relation between breakdown in adaptation and cardiovascular disorder is a fact. More consistent results on the psychosocial determinants of an increased cardiovascular risk are obtained when stress is studied in relation to the socio-economic condition of groups and individuals. To better embrace and describe such factors, a new theoretical contribution has been introduced: social capital. This is a more sophisticated version of social cohesion, social integration and social support.

19145723,Feeding habits as determinants of early childhood caries in a population where prolonged breastfeeding is the norm.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of feeding habits and daytime sugar intake on the prevalence of early childhood caries in a population where prolonged breastfeeding is a norm. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at 18 of 102 public health centers in Tehran. During a 4-day period at each center, between 20 and 35 children aged 1-3 years were enrolled, resulting in a sample of 504 children. In structured interviews, mothers were asked to give information about their child's feeding habits, daytime sugar intake, and their family's background. Sugar intake during the night was operationalized as separately calculated burdens of nighttime breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. Clinical dental examinations followed the World Health Organization criteria. Data analysis included chi-square test, t-test, ANOVA, and logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Of the children, 56% were solely breastfed (mean duration 16.6 months; 95% CI 16.0-17.2), 42% were both breastfed and bottle-fed, and 2% were solely bottle-fed. Mean duration of breastfeeding for the solely breastfed 24- to 36-month olds was 22.8 months (95% CI 21.8-23.9). At bedtime, 69% were breastfed, 11% bottle-fed, and 20% were not fed at all. With respect to feeding during the night, 72% of children were breastfed, 12% were bottle-fed with milk, 1% received a bottle with water, while 15% were not fed. Early childhood caries (ECC) occurred in 3-26% of the children, depending on age group (P < 0.001). The burden of milk-bottle feeding at night was a clear determinant for ECC (OR = 5.5) whereas breastfeeding per se, its duration, the burden of breastfeeding at night, and daytime sugar intake were not. CONCLUSION: On account of its association with ECC, milk-bottle feeding at night should be limited, whereas prolonged breastfeeding appears to have no such negative dental consequences.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,2008 Aug,Denmark,2008,00
11048582,"[Risk factors for growth retardation in children of low economic and social level in Sao Paulo, Brazil].","Aiming to analyze the mild to moderate growth retardation associate factors in children at school age, a case control study was conducted with 153 pairs of seven and eight years old children from public schools of the outskirts of the city. The cases were defined as children with a height for age(H/A) between -1 and -2 Z score, according to NCHS/WHO standards, and matched with a H/A +/- 0.5 Z-score children of same age, gender, school, classroom and class time, as controls. The height was measured at school according to WHO rules by trained professionals, and household visits were carried out to obtain environmental and socio-economic data. Initially the data was analyzed by the univariate conditional method and then, the statistically significant variables were included in a model of multivariate logistic regression analysis. As a result, the risk factors remaining at the end of the multivariate analyses, by Odds Ratio and it's 95% Confidence Interval were respectively:--mother's height: for each decrease of one standard deviation the OR increased 1.84(CI: 1.35 to 2.49); inadequate feeding pattern: OR = 2.12; CI: 1.17 to 3.83, very low socio-economic level: OR = 9.2; CI: 3.35 to 25.13, low birth weight: OR = 2.59; CI: 1.44 to 4.63 and smoking during pregnancy: OR = 1.75; CI: 0.98 to 3.12. These results highlight the environment as a determinant factor for growth performance during the first years of the child's life. Despite this, the significant OR for Mother's height allows the assumption that besides the environment, the parent's height has to be considered as one of the determinants of height deficit, even for the low socioeconomic level.",Archivos latinoamericanos de nutricion,2000 Jun,Venezuela,2000,00

The recent rapid advances in technology impacted, skewed, and changed pre-existing pillars of individual and collective identities. The paper focuses on the changes in roles and relationships between generations. Acceptance and ability to absorb the benefits of globalization demands adjustment, including some tolerance of the pitfalls of globalization. Special concern is voiced about the developing trend, demand, and interest in speed of communication that leads to a decrease in depth of evaluation. There is an increased focus on talking rather than on thinking, and a decrease in human relationship, while technology and finance are enthroned as the overriding determinants of human interaction. These profound changes demand psychosocial flexibility. In order to benefit from the overwhelming benefits of new technology, personal, social, professional, and cultural views need to undergo profound re-examination and re-evaluation.",Medicine and law,2000,United States,2000,00
19642956,A focus on health promotion and prevention through the development of the national men's health policy.,"ISSUES ADDRESSED: The Australian Government announced its intention to develop a national men's health policy in June 2008. A focus on prevention was identified as a foundation principle that would underpin the development of this policy. This brief report provides a descriptive account of the key discussion points relating to health promotion and prevention during a National Men's Health Roundtable held in Canberra in March 2009. METHODS: Invitations to the Roundtable were extended to peak professional organisations and national health bodies with an interest in men's health. Presentations from the National Preventative Health Taskforce, the National Primary Health Care External Reference Group and National Men's Health Ambassadors were used to provoke discussion relating to men's health. RESULTS: The most salient issues that were raised at the Roundtable and that were specific to health promotion and prevention contexts included the need to clearly define key terms that relate to health promotion and prevention (to support a joined-up and health-in-all-policies approach); acknowledge that gender intersects with other social determinants of health; recognise that men's engagement though health promotion and primary healthcare services can be improved by using settings-based approaches more widely; a greater focus on men's health literacy; a universal funding system to support men's health promotion; clarity about the roles and responsibilities that various health professionals play in improving the status of men's health; and the need to build health equity between and within specific populations of men through action on the social determinants of health. CONCLUSION: Recognising the place of health promotion and illness prevention in a national men's health policy will provide the necessary platform to build critical health literacy among men, promote equitable access to primary healthcare services and better support men's engagement within the health system.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2009 Aug,Australia,2009,00
19222049,Coping strategies of retinoblastoma survivors in relation to behavioural problems.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess coping strategies of long-term retinoblastoma (RB) survivors and explore determinants of behavioural functioning, including medical, socio-demographic and coping variables. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 117 RB survivors (12-35 years), registered in the Dutch national RB register. Survivors were asked to fill in coping, social support and behavioural questionnaires, and situational characteristics were obtained from medical archives and from an interview. Prevalence rates of coping strategies were computed based on self-reports. One-sample t-tests were applied to analyse differences in the use of coping strategies compared with healthy reference samples. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify various determinants for behavioural problems within the RB sample. RESULTS: RB survivors differed from their healthy reference group in one coping style, i.e. they showed significantly less emotion-oriented coping behaviour. Adolescents who came from a single-parent family and/or experienced lower social support and used more emotion-oriented coping reported more total problem behaviour. More internalizing problems were reported for adolescents who experienced less social support and less acceptance of the disease. For adults, more life events, emotion-oriented coping and lower social support explained more total problem behaviour, especially internalizing problems. CONCLUSION: RB survivors showed less emotion-oriented coping behaviour compared with the reference group. Behavioural problems are best determined by emotion-oriented coping, social support, life events other than RB and acceptance of the disease, and not by medical variables. Therefore, these variables should be taken into consideration during interventions for this group.",Psycho-oncology,2009 Dec,England,2009,00
15562348,"[""Loss of perspective is my disease"" -- subjective feelings of long-term unemployed].","BACKGROUND: Nowadays job loss implies the risk of long-term unemployment particularly in former East Germany. Many physical, psychological and social problems are associated with unemployment. However, health of long-term unemployed may not decrease continually, but may be subject to fluctuations according to different phases of unemployment and short-term work. METHODS: This expectation was examined by structured interviews with long-term unemployed (10 men and women) working in temporary job-creating-schemes (ABM). We asked for determinants of health and subjectively perceived associations between health and employment as well as for conditions of life and work. RESULTS: The employees were on average 55 years old and more than 7 years without work before joining the ABM. Psychosocial complaints such as depression, sleep disorders or nervousness appeared after approximately three months of unemployment. Subjective health improved during job-creating-schemes, depending on specific work conditions, but deteriorate at its end again. Most of the ABM-employees don't have any perspective of future employment. CONCLUSIONS: The well-known association between unemployment and health was confirmed. Furthermore, the study gave new insights into psychological strains of long-term unemployed and subjective work loads during ABM. Future prospects were proved to be an important determinant of health ('lack of perspective is my illness'). From this measures of health promotion for long-term unemployed within ABM companies and other institutions can be derived.",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),2004 Nov,Germany,2004,00

The effects of demographic factors, family characteristics and socioeconomic status on self-reported health are estimated with OLS regression using data from the 1994 American and Polish General Social Surveys. The results show lower self-reported health and more rapid declines in health for people over 60 in Poland than in the United States. Also, in Poland, women report worse health than do men while the opposite is found for the United States. The relationships between education, income and health were stronger in the United States than in Poland. Age, gender and SES may operate differently in the two countries because of a gap in social development (e.g. varying living standards and styles, health care systems and cultural attitudes) between the West and the former Eastern Europe.","Health (London, England : 1997)",2004 Jan,England,2004,00
18591912,Dictyostelium discoideum as a model host for meningococcal pathogenesis.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of studying meningococcal virulence in a new model organism, Dictyostelium discoideum, a haploid social soil amoeba that is an established host model for several human pathogens, leading to the discovery of novel virulence mechanisms. MATERIAL/METHODS: A number of virulent and hyper-virulent N. meningitidis strains, including isogenic encapsulated, unencapsulated, and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) outer core-defective derivatives, were used to test the ability of D. discoideum to internalize and grow in the presence of bacteria. Intracellular survival of the internalized bacteria was also monitored. RESULTS: Meningococci were internalized and killed by D. discoideum cells. The presence of a capsule did not affect the internalization, but, as in human cells, it increased the resistance of the internalized bacteria. Although both encapsulated and unencapsulated meningococci supported the growth and development of D. discoideum on an agar surface, in liquid medium the encapsulated strains were toxic to the slime mould cells. Toxicity inversely correlated with meningococcal survival in the assay medium that was not favorable to bacterial replication, suggesting that it may be due to some toxic compound released after bacterial autolysis. Intriguingly, unencapsulated isogenic strains efficiently supported Dictyostelium growth in suspension, opening the possibility that the toxicity may be associated with the capsular polysaccharide. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that several meningococcal virulence determinants, such as the capsular polysaccharide, may be remarkably effective also in Dictyostelium cells, stimulating the use of this model host to search for novel meningococcal virulence determinants.",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2008 Jul,United States,2008,00

The present hospital based, pair matched, case control study was carried out at immunoprophylactic centre of Government Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur, to identify risk factors associated with delayed immunisation among children. This study included 139 children with a delay of more than 90 days for scheduled primary immunisation and equal number of matched control (for dose) receiving immunisation at appropriate time. The study identified significant association of family size [Odd's ratio (OR) = 7.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-35.6], number of children < 5 years (OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.1-9.9), sex (OR = 3, 95% CI = 1.2-7.4), paternal education (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.6-8.5), maternal education (OR = 4, 95% CI = 1.5-10.9), socio-economic status (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1-13.2) and distance from health centre (OR = 4.7, 95% CI = 1.2-17.6) with delayed immunisation. Negligence (56%) and unawareness (22.7%) of parents were main reasons for delayed immunisation. Hence more stress on identified risk factors in the study will indirectly help in reducing the frequency of delayed immunisation.",Journal of the Indian Medical Association,2000 Jan,India,2000,00
11132365,Methods for identifying and assessing groups in health behavioral research.,"Methods to study groups developed in other fields have much to contribute to the study of health behavior, including alcohol and substance use. This paper surveys group methods in order to demonstrate how attention to group levels of analysis can provide new insights about the context and causes of health behavior. The first major section of this paper focuses on the influences on health behavior associated with ""naturally occurring groups"" such as peer networks, families, workplaces, neighborhoods, churches, treatment groups and residential settings. Different aspects of group influence are discussed in terms of seven different features of social groups: history, structure, function, resources, process, norms and climate. The second major part of this paper is concerned with methods to identify meaningful subgroups in heterogeneous samples. Following an overview of taxonomic methods to identify and assign cases to groups, we highlight the potential for these methods to help address a number of fundamental theoretical problems in health behavioral research, including: describing cultural diversity, distinguishing response sets in survey research, controlling error in outcomes scores related to baseline differences, tracking trajectories of change, and revealing interactions among determinants of health behavior. The third and final section of the paper highlights specific applications of taxonomic and group-influence methodologies in intervention research, including design and analysis of randomized trials, studies of existing treatment settings and group-level variables involved in translational research.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2000 Nov,England,2000,00
15762394,Self-regulation and recovery: approaching an understanding of the process of recovery from stress.,"Stress has been studied extensively in psychology. Only recently, however, has research started to address the question of how individuals manage to recover from stress. Recovery from stress is analyzed as a process of self-regulation. Several individual difference variables which affect the efficiency of self-regulation have been integrated into a structured model of the recovery process. Such variables are action versus state orientation (a tendency to ruminate, e.g., about a past experience) and volitional components, such as self-determination, self-motivation, emotion control, rumination, and self-discipline. Some of these components are assumed to promote recovery from stress, whereas others are assumed to further the perseverance of stress. The model was supported by the empirical findings of three independent studies (Study 1, N=58; Study 2, N=221; Study 3, N= 105). Kuhl's Action Control Scale measured action versus state orientation. Volitional components were assessed with Kuhl and Fuhrmann's Volitional Components Questionnaire. The amounts of experienced stress and recovery from stress was assessed with Kellmann and Kallus's Recovery-Stress Questionnaire. As hypothesized in the model, the disposition towards action versus state orientation was a more distant determinant of the recovery from stress and perseverance of stress. The volitional components are more proximal determinants in the recovery process. Action orientation promotes recovery from stress via adequate volitional skills, e.g., self-determination, self-motivation, emotion control, whereas state orientation furthers a perseverance of stress through rumination and self-discipline.",Psychological reports,2004 Dec,United States,2004,00
20069168,"[Health, work and environment at the Brazilian rural].","This manuscript discusses the implications of the productive paradigm changes in health and environment of rural area of Brazil. It analyzes production, economy and demography data, facing social and structural determinants with health and environmental reflexes, revealing a serious panorama that includes: a) environmental impacts associated to large productive chains, such as corn, soy-bean, cotton and sugar cane; b) chemical contamination of diverse environment compartments due to pesticides and fertilizers used in agriculture; c) the use of natural land in the expansion of agriculture and cattle farming activities; and d) the reflexes of these actions on individuals, workers or not, that are more and more forced to deal with extreme vulnerability situations because of the risk of rural work processes.

18793414,"""We're not short of people telling us what the problems are. We're short of people telling us what to do"": an appraisal of public policy and mental health.","BACKGROUND: There is sustained interest in public health circles in assessing the effects of policies on health and health inequalities. We report on the theory, methods and findings of a project which involved an appraisal of current Scottish policy with respect to its potential impacts on mental health and wellbeing. METHODS: We developed a method of assessing the degree of alignment between Government policies and the 'evidence base', involving: reviewing theoretical frameworks; analysis of policy documents, and nineteen in-depth interviews with policymakers which explored influences on, and barriers to cross-cutting policymaking and the use of research evidence in decisionmaking. RESULTS: Most policy documents did not refer to mental health; however most referred indirectly to the determinants of mental health and well-being. Unsurprisingly research evidence was rarely cited; this was more common in health policy documents. The interviews highlighted the barriers to intersectoral policy making, and pointed to the relative value of qualitative and quantitative research, as well as to the imbalance of evidence between ""what is known"" and ""what is to be done"". CONCLUSION: Healthy public policy depends on effective intersectoral working between government departments, along with better use of research evidence to identify policy impacts. This study identified barriers to both these. We also demonstrated an approach to rapidly appraising the mental health effects of mainly non-health sector policies, drawing on theoretical understandings of mental health and its determinants, research evidence and policy documents. In the case of the social determinants of health, we conclude that an evidence-based approach to policymaking and to policy appraisal requires drawing strongly upon existing theoretical frameworks, as well as upon research evidence, but that there are significant practical barriers and disincentives.",BMC public health,2008 Sep 15,England,2008,00
19309020,Radiation from mobile phone systems: Is it perceived as a threat to people's health?,"The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence, nature and determinants of concerns about mobile phone radiation. We used data from a 2006 telephone survey of 1004 people aged 15+ years in Denmark. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents were concerned about exposure to mobile phone radiation; radiation from masts was of concern to about 15%. In contrast, 82% were concerned about pollution. Nearly half of the respondents considered the mortality risk of 3G phones and masts to be of the same order of magnitude as being struck by lightning (0.1 fatalities per million people per year) while 7% thought it was equivalent to tobacco-induced lung cancer (approximately 500 fatalities per million per year). Among women, concerns about mobile phone radiation were positively associated with educational attainment, perceived mobile phone mortality risk and concerns about unknown consequences of new technologies. More than two thirds of the respondents felt that they had received inadequate public information about the 3G system. The results of the study indicate that the majority of the population has little concern about mobile phone radiation while a small minority is very concerned.",Bioelectromagnetics,2009 Jul,United States,2009,00
10995048,Prognosis of functional recovery 1 year after hip fracture: typical patient profiles through cluster analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Many investigators have identified distinct medical, demographic and psychosocial prefracture conditions that influence the functional outcome of patients surgically treated for a fracture of the hip. However, to design efficient intervention care programs addressing the needs of these patients, at optimal economic and social costs, more information is required on the typical combinations of prognostic determinants actually encountered. METHODS: Data on specific descriptors of the prefracture status and on mobility and functioning 1 year after surgical intervention were collected by interview from 253 consecutive patients hospitalized for a fracture of the proximal femur. Cluster analysis was used to form homogeneous groups of patients with similar profiles in terms of the 13 predictive variables and the 7 outcome variables significantly interrelated. The modeling procedure generated four clusters of patients with a typical profile sharply contrasted by their structure. RESULTS: Subjects of two clusters could walk without difficulty and were functionally independent prior to their hip fracture. One year later, however, mobility and functioning were only fully recovered by the members of one cluster. The majority of predictors were of less favorable prognostic value for the members of the second cluster. The other two clusters regrouped patients with impaired prefracture mobility that were either unaltered or even aggravated 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS. Cluster analysis identified typical profiles of elderly hip fracture patients. Close scrutiny of their respective global structure, in terms of combined prognostic determinants and outcomes, may help to develop specific management strategies that are more efficiently adapted to these different groups of patients.","The journals of gerontology.

17400353,"Distancing the mad: Jarvis's Law and the spatial distribution of admissions to the Hamilton Lunatic Asylum in Canada, 1876-1902.","The institutional confinement of the 'insane' in the nineteenth century constitutes one of the most controversial events in the social history of medicine. Within this scholarship there has emerged an important debate over the spatial determinants of institutionalization. Some studies uphold an historical postulate--Jarvis's Law--that contends there was a 'distance decay' effect in mental hospital utilization--that is, an inverse correlation between the distance from a medical institution and the likelihood of people to use its resources. Other scholars have challenged or modified this thesis, arguing that factors such as the local politics, urban living, or socio-economic status were more important determinants of institutional confinement. This article contributes to this ongoing debate by analysing over 4000 admissions to the Ontario Provincial Asylum in the city of Hamilton, Canada, between 1876 and 1902. The results confirm Jarvis' Law was applicable to the Hamilton context: there was an inverse statistical relationship between physical distance from the asylum and the likelihood of admission. However, this paper yields three additional dimensions to the literature: (1) it demonstrates that jails were much more likely to be utilized as temporary places of confinement for communities far from provincial mental hospitals; (2) the length of stay in the asylum was positively correlated with the distance travelled to the institution; and (3) an inverse relationship was found when correlating distance from the asylum and the likelihood of being readmitted to the same institution. These findings suggest an impact of 'distance' beyond the dimension of hospital utilization and imply that the broader asylum experience could be affected by the previous location of patients.",Social science & medicine (1982),2007 Jun,England,2007,00
16943174,Interpersonal psychotherapy for elderly patients in primary care.,"OBJECTIVE: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is recommended in most depression treatment guidelines, but little is known about its effectiveness in real-life practice. This study investigates whether IPT, delivered by mental health workers to elderly patients with major depressive disorder, is more effective than usual general practitioners' care (CAU). METHODS: A pragmatic randomized, controlled trial was conducted in which 143 patients were allocated to IPT (10 sessions) or to CAU. PRIMary care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) assessments were used as primary outcomes. RESULTS: IPT was significantly more effective in reducing the percentage of patients with a diagnosis of depression (PRIME-MD), but not in inducing remission (MADRS <10). Among treatment completers, IPT was superior in improving social and overall mental functioning. A post hoc analysis revealed that IPT was superior to CAU in moderately to severely depressed patients, but not significantly so in mildly depressed patients. CONCLUSIONS: IPT was more effective than CAU for elderly patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder in general practice. Future research should focus on determinants of treatment outcome.",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,2006 Sep,England,2006,00
14715384,Development of sensitivity to facial expression of pain.,"The ability to perceive pain in others is an important human capacity. Its development has not been studied. The present study examined the development of sensitivity to evidence of pain from childhood to early adulthood. One hundred and thirty-four males and females from four age groups (5-6, 8-9, 11-12 years and young adult) took part. They judged the amount of pain displayed on videotaped excerpts of the facial expressions of pain patients. Excerpts were selected to display no pain, some pain and strong pain, based on facial measurements, and were displayed to participants in a signal-detection paradigm. All participant groups were more sensitive to evidence of strong than some pain. The ability to detect pain expressions increased across the young, middle and older groups of children, but older children did not differ from adults. Increasing age was generally associated with increasing sensitivity to more subtle facial signs of pain. The results indicate that the ability to perceive pain in others is already significantly developed by the ages of five to six, but refinements in the ability continue through to early adulthood. These findings represent the first description of the development of the ability to perceive pain in others. Important areas for future research into the neurobiological, personal and social determinants of this ability are highlighted.",Pain,2004 Jan,United States,2004,00
15018090,The role of chronobiology in sleep disorders medicine.,"This review is concerned with circadian (approximately 24 h) aspects of chronobiology, and how they relate to sleep disorders medicine. We begin with an introduction to the key concepts and paradigms of circadian rhythms research in general, including a description of homeostatic and circadian determinants of sleep timing. This is followed by a brief history of chronobiology in relation to sleep disorders medicine. Both animal and human circadian rhythm studies are considered. We trace historical changes in the relative emphasis placed on social contacts, light, and melatonin in human circadian rhythms research. Special attention is given to free-running, forced desynchrony, and ultra-short sleep/wake cycle findings of particular relevance to sleep disorders medicine. The latter part of the review comprises a description of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders, highlighting insights derived from basic circadian rhythms research, including recent advances in molecular genetics. We conclude that the role of chronobiology in sleep disorders medicine is profound and pervasive, and that the two disciplines will move ever closer as a natural function of important new insights into sleep and sleep disorders provided by basic circadian rhythms research.",Sleep medicine reviews,2003 Dec,England,2003,00
19047546,Determinants of health insurance status for children of Latino immigrant and other US farm workers: findings from the National Agricultural Workers Survey.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the health insurance status of farm workers' children, an understudied topic. DESIGN: A population-based multistage survey. SETTING: Employer-based study conducted in the continental United States from 2000 to 2002. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3136 parents with children younger than 18 years and no children residing outside of the United States who participated in the US Department of Labor's National Agricultural Workers Survey, which is administered to a national probability sample of US farm workers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Children's parent-reported health insurance status. RESULTS: Of the farm workers who were parents, 87% were Latino, 81% were foreign born, 15% were migrant workers, 55% had less than a sixth-grade education, and 68% reported little to no English language proficiency. Thirty-two percent of all farm-worker parents, including 45% of migrant-worker parents, reported that their children were uninsured. In multivariate analyses, older parental age (odds ratio [OR] for parents aged 30-39 years, 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.50; OR for parents aged >/=40 years, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.99-4.74), less parental education (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09-2.10), less time in the United States (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91 per 10 years in the United States), being a migrant worker (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.31-2.93), and living in the Southeast (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.00-5.02) or Southwest (OR, 3.91; 95% CI, 2.32-6.57) were significantly associated with having uninsured children. CONCLUSIONS: Farm workers' children were uninsured at roughly 3 times the rate of all other children and almost twice the rate of those at or near the federal poverty level. Programs aimed at extending insurance coverage for children should consider the unique social barriers that characterize this vulnerable population of US children. Moreover, there is significant regional variation that may reflect varying levels of insurance resources and eligibility from state to state.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00
11192271,"Births, gestation and birthweights in South Tees 1990-1996.","BACKGROUND: The UK government has specified that all health authorities are to develop local health improvement programmes. Birthweight and gestational age are important health determinants, and therefore indicators of the health status of children in a community. They also have important resource implications for health and social services. Data regarding birthweight and its relationship to gestational age are not routinely available. This paper describes the results of the measurement of the birthweights and gestational ages of children born to residents in a UK health district, and their relationship with deprivation. METHODS: Routinely collected birthweight and gestational age data for children born to parents resident in the South Tees district during the period 1990-1996 inclusive were downloaded from the community child health department mainframe computer. The data were analysed and compared with national standards. RESULTS: The analysis showed that, despite the high levels of deprivation, birthweights were close to or slightly above average for most gestational ages. However, when compared with the average district in England and Wales, 8 per cent more low-birthweight children, of which 42 per cent were less than 28 weeks gestation, were born in the area. Materially deprived mothers were more likely to give birth to pre-term and light for gestational age infants. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that it is now possible to use routine sources of information to monitor local trends in birthweight and gestation, and their relationship with deprivation.",Journal of public health medicine,2000 Dec,England,2000,00

16246515,HIV treatment-related knowledge and self-efficacy among caregivers of HIV-infected children.,"OBJECTIVE: Improvements in treatment-related knowledge and self-efficacy may improve clinical outcomes in HIV-infected populations. We examined whether caregivers' knowledge and self-efficacy was associated with better clinical outcomes and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence among HIV-infected children. METHODS: Caregivers of 77 perinatally HIV-infected children were administered a semi-structured interview which included scales of HIV treatment-related knowledge, adherence self-efficacy and caregiver reports of child medication adherence. RESULTS: While caregivers correctly answered 74% of the knowledge questions, specific misconceptions were noted. Caregivers rated themselves as having high adherence self-efficacy, but were least confident in their ability to adhere to ART if it caused side effects or might result in social disclosure. Higher caregiver treatment-related knowledge and self-efficacy were associated with better clinical outcomes, as measured by viral load and CD4+ count, but not with caregiver reports of ART adherence. CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION: While additional factors may be important determinants of adherence to ART in this population, improving the HIV treatment-related knowledge and self-efficacy of caregivers may help to improve the clinical outcomes of HIV-infected children. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Care providers should address both misconceptions that might serve to undermine adherence as well as factors that limit patients' self-efficacy in adhering to treatment, prior to the initiation of ART and throughout the course of treatment.",Patient education and counseling,2006 Jun,Ireland,2006,00
15469413,Rationale and study design of the CardioGene Study: genomics of in-stent restenosis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: in-stent restenosis is a major limitation of stent therapy for atherosclerosis coronary artery disease. The CardioGene Study is an ongoing study of restenosis in bare mental stents (BMS) for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The overall goal is to understand the genetic determinants of the responses to vascular injury that result in the development of restenosis in some patients but not in others. Gene expression profiling at transcriptional and translational levels provides global assessment of gene activity after vascular injury and mechanistic insight. Furthermore, the delineation of genetic biomarkers would be of value in the clinical setting of risk-stratify patients prior to stent therapy. Prospective risk stratification would allow for the rational selection of specialized treatments against the development of in-stent restenosis (ISR), such as drug-eluting stents. SETTING: Patients are enrolled at two sites in the US with high-volume cardiac catheterization facilities: the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, MI, USA, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, USA. STUDY DESIGN: Two complementary study designs are used to understand the molecular mechanisms of restenosis and the genetic biomarkers predictive of restenosis. First, 350 patients are enrolled prospectively at the time of stent implantation. Blood is sampled prior to stent placement and afterwards at 2 weeks and 6 months. The clinical outcome of restenosis is determined 6 and 12 months after stent placement. The primary outcome is clinical restenosis at 6 months. The major secondary outcome is clinical restenosis at 12 months. Second, a corollary case-control analysis will be carried out with the enrollment of an additional 250 cases with a history of recurrent restenosis after treatment with BMS. Controls for this analysis are derived from the prospective cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting to the cardiac catheterization laboratory are screened, informed about the study and enrolled after signing the consent form. Enrollment has been completed for the prospective cohort, and enrollment of the additional group is ongoing. A standardized questionnaire is used to collect clinical data primarily through direct patient interview to assess medical history, medication use, functional status, family history, environmental factors, and social history. Further data are abstracted from the medical charts and catheterization reports. A total of 276 clinical variables are collected per individual at baseline, and 49 variables are collected at each of the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. A Clinical Events Committee adjudicates clinical outcomes. Blood samples are processed at each clinical enrollment site using standardized operating procedures. From each blood sample, several aliquots are prepared and stored of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, granulocytes, platelets, serum, and plasma. Additionally, a portion of each patient's leukocytes is cryopreserved for future cell-line creation. Samples are frozen and shipped to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Additional materials generated in the analysis of the samples at the NHLBI are frozen and stored, including isolated genomic DNA, total RNA, reverse transcribed cDNA libraries and labeled RNA hybridization mixtures used in microarray analysis. Per individual in the prospective cohort, high-quality transcript profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at each time of blood sampling are obtained using Affymetrix U133A microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Per chip, this yields 495,930 features per individual per time of sampling. This represents expression levels for 22,283 genes per patients oer time of blood sampling, including 14,500 well-characterized human genes. Proteomics of plasma is performed with multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Protein expression is examined similarly to mRNA expression as a measure of gene expression. Genotyping is performed in two manners. First, those genes showing differential expression at the levels of mRNA and protein are investigated using a candidate gene approach. Specific variants in known gene regulatory regions, such as promoters, are sought initially, as those variants may explain differences in expression level. Second, a genome-wide scan is used to identify genetic loci that are associated with ISR. Those regions identified are further examined for genes that show differential expression in the mRNA microarray profiling or proteomics investigations. These genes are finely investigated for candidate SNPs and other gene variants. Complementary genomic and proteomic approaches are expected to be robust. Integration of data sets is accomplished using a variety of informatics tools, organization of gene expression into functional pathways, and investigation of physical maps of up- and downregulated sets of genes. CONCLUSIONS: The CardioGene Study is designed to understand ISR. Global gene and protein expression profiling define molecular phenotypes of patients. Well-defined clinical phenotypes will be paired with genomic data to define analyses aimed to achieve several goals. These include determining blood gene and protein expression in patients with ISR, investigating the genetic basis of ISR, developing predictive gene and protein biomarkers, and the identification of new targets for treatment.",Pharmacogenomics,2004 Oct,England,2004,00

The data was collected from the participants of a simulated society game (SIMINSOC; Hirose, 1997). The global society in the game includes rich and poor regions, and the poor regions need to obtain support from rich regions for survival. One hundred and thirty-two participants were randomly assigned to either rich or poor regions and were engaged in various activities in the game. The level of ingroup identity was manipulated by facilitating group activities in some groups but no in others. Then they answered questions regarding the identification, attributions of responsibility, and attitude toward support provision. The results indicated that the identification toward the ingroup increased attribution bias. Furthermore, the identification toward the global society increased the intent to provide support among those from the rich regions. The discussion considered the importance of including intergroup variables in the attributional approach to support provision.",Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology,2002 Apr,Japan,2002,00
15808930,Psychological determinants of the cortisol stress response: the role of anticipatory cognitive appraisal.,"Psychosocial stress is a potent activator of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. While the physiological mechanisms of HPA axis responses to stress as well as its short and long-term consequences have been extensively examined, less is known why someone elicits an acute neuroendocrine stress response, i.e. what are the psychological processes involved and how are they related to the acute neuroendocrine stress response. To examine this question, a questionnaire to assess anticipatory cognitive appraisal processes was developed and administered to 81 male healthy subjects in a standardized psychosocial stress situation (Trier social stress test). Cortisol stress responses were assessed with repeated measurement of salivary free cortisol. Hierarchical regression analyses show that anticipatory cognitive appraisal, in contrast to general personality factors and retrospective stress appraisal is an important determinant of the cortisol stress response, explaining up to 35% of the variance of the salivary cortisol response. The reported results emphasize the importance of psychological stress processing for the understanding of psychobiological stress responses. Since stress and its biological consequences have been shown to be associated with the onset and the maintenance of somatic illnesses and psychiatric disorders, psychological processes are prime targets for prevention and intervention.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2005 Jul,England,2005,00
19332501,Changing trends in indigenous inequalities in mortality: lessons from New Zealand.,"BACKGROUND: We describe trends from 1951 to 2006 in inequalities in mortality between the indigenous (Maori) and non-indigenous (non-Maori, mainly European-descended) populations of New Zealand. We relate these trends to the historical context in which they occurred, including major structural adjustment of the economy from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, followed by a retreat from neoliberal social and economic policies from the late 1990s onwards. This was accompanied by economic recovery and the introduction of health reforms, including a reorientation of the health system towards primary health care. METHODS: Abridged period lifetables for Maori and non-Maori from 1951 to 2006 were constructed using standard demographic methods. Absolute [standardized rate difference (SRD)] and relative [standardized rate ratio (SRR)] mortality inequalities for Maori compared with European/Other ethnic groups (aged 1-74 years) were measured using the New Zealand Census-Mortality Study (an ongoing data linkage study that links mortality to census records) from 1981-84 to 2001-04. The SRDs were decomposed into their contributions from major causes of death. Poisson regression modelling was used to estimate the extent of socio-economic mediation of the ethnic mortality inequality over time. RESULTS: Life expectancy gaps and relative inequalities in mortality rates (aged 1-74 years) widened and then narrowed again, in tandem with the trends in social inequalities (allowing for a short lag). Among females, the contribution of cardiovascular disease to absolute mortality inequalities steadily decreased, but was partly offset by an increasing contribution from cancer. Among males, the contribution of CVD increased from the early 1980s to the 1990s, then decreased again. The extent of socio-economic mediation of the ethnic mortality inequality peaked in 1991-94, again more notably among males. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with a causal association between changing economic inequalities and changing health inequalities between ethnic groups. However, causality cannot be established from a historical analysis alone. Three lessons nevertheless emerge from the New Zealand experience: the lag between changes in ethnic social inequality and ethnic health inequality may be short (<5 years); both changes in the distribution of the social determinants of health and an appropriate health system response may be required to address ethnic health inequalities; and timely monitoring of ethnic health inequalities, based on high-quality ethnicity data, may help to sustain political commitment to pro-equity health and social policies.",International journal of epidemiology,2009 Dec,England,2009,00
15627401,The Latin American Social Medicine database.,"BACKGROUND: Public health practitioners and researchers for many years have been attempting to understand more clearly the links between social conditions and the health of populations. Until recently, most public health professionals in English-speaking countries were unaware that their colleagues in Latin America had developed an entire field of inquiry and practice devoted to making these links more clearly understood. The Latin American Social Medicine (LASM) database finally bridges this previous gap. DESCRIPTION: This public health informatics case study describes the key features of a unique information resource intended to improve access to LASM literature and to augment understanding about the social determinants of health. This case study includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluation data. Currently the LASM database at The University of New Mexico http://hsc.unm.edu/lasm brings important information, originally known mostly within professional networks located in Latin American countries to public health professionals worldwide via the Internet. The LASM database uses Spanish, Portuguese, and English language trilingual, structured abstracts to summarize classic and contemporary works. CONCLUSION: This database provides helpful information for public health professionals on the social determinants of health and expands access to LASM.",BMC public health,2004 Dec 31,England,2004,00

This work aimed to review available data on epilepsy and the impact of surgical and pharmaceutical treatments on the quality of life in adults and children. Research on quality of life in epilepsy is characterised by a wide and fragmentary range of methodology, both in terms of study design and instruments used. Quality of life is worse in patients with epilepsy than in the general population; it is comparable or worse in patients with epilepsy than that in patients with other chronic conditions; and it is similar to that of healthy persons when patients with epilepsy are well-controlled. Frequency of seizures seems to be one of the most relevant determinants of poor quality-of-life (QOL) scores, and quality of life is worsened by the co-existence of depression. The impact of surgical treatment on quality of life is positive, in all ages, in correlation with seizure control. There is no exhaustive or even contradictory results available concerning the impact of drug treatment. Role activities, emotional status and cognition have been the most investigated domains of quality of life in epilepsy research. There is a substantial lack of information regarding the functional status domain. At present, quality of life and psychosocial functioning in people with epilepsy have been investigated in many studies. Nevertheless, the lack of a standardised approach makes it extremely difficult to summarise and indicate what measures should be used, in which patients, and in which sub-populations. In the pursuit of developing valid, reliable and sensitive measures of quality of life, it seems no longer appropriate to consider seizure frequency alone.",PharmacoEconomics,2002,New Zealand,2002,00
11996020,"Social capital and health (plus wealth, income inequality and regional health governance).","This article describes an empirical exploration of relationships among aspects of thirty health districts in Saskatchewan, Canada. These aspects include social capital, income inequality, wealth, governance by regional health authorities and population health, the primary dependent variable. The social capital index incorporated associational and civic participation, average and median household incomes served as proxies for wealth, the degree of skew in the distribution of household incomes assessed income inequality while the model for effective governance by District Health Boards (DHBs) focused on reflection of health needs, policy making and implementation, fiscal responsibility and the integration and co-ordination of services. I found no evidence of a relationship between social capital in health districts and the performance of DHBs. Among the determinants of health, wealth appeared unrelated to age-standardised mortality rates while income inequality was positively and social capital was negatively related to mortality. Income inequality was not as strongly related to age-standardised mortality after controlling for social capital. and vice versa, suggesting the two may be comingled somehow when it comes to population health, although they were not significantly related to one another. Of the predictors of social capital the distribution of age in districts appeared to be the most salient; of the predictors of age-standardised mortality rates the gender composition of a district was most salient.",Social science & medicine (1982),2002 Mar,England,2002,00
17434862,Is work in education child's play? Understanding risks to educators arising from work organization and design of work spaces.,"The educational sector exposes its primarily female work force to numerous psychosocial risk factors. At the request of the education workers', ergonomists developed a participatory research project in order to understand the determinants of the difficulties experienced by special education technicians. These technicians work with students presenting behavioral and learning difficulties as well as developmental and mental health problems. Eighteen technicians were interviewed and the work of seven technicians and two teachers was observed. Technicians prevent and manage crisis situations and help students acquire social skills. Coordination with teachers is made difficult by the fact that most technicians work part time, part year, and many technicians' work areas and classrooms are physically distant one from another. Most technicians change schools each year and must continually reconstruct work teams. Management strategies and poorly adapted working spaces can have important repercussions on coordination among educators and on technicians' capacity to help students and prevent aggressive behavior.",New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,2007,United States,2007,00
12864889,End-stage renal disease in sub-Saharan and South Africa.,"The major health problems in Africa are AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, gastroenteritis and hypertension; hypertension affects about 20% of the adult population. Renal disease, especially glomerular disease, is more prevalent in Africa and seems to be of a more severe form than that found in Western countries. The most common mode of presentation is the nephrotic syndrome, with the age of onset at five to eight years. It is estimated that 2 to 3% of medical admissions in tropical countries are due to renal-related complaints, the majority being the glomerulonephritides. There are no reliable statistics for ESRD in all African countries. Statistics of the South African Dialysis and Transplant Registry (SADTR) reflect the patients selected for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and do not accurately reflect the etiology of chronic renal failure (CRF), where public sector state facilities will offer RRT only to patients who are eligible for a transplant. In 1994, glomerulonephritis was recorded as the cause of ESRD in 1771 (52.1%) and hypertension in 1549 (45.6%) of patients by the SADTR. In a six-year study of 3632 patients with ESRD, based on SADTR statistics, hypertension was reported to be the cause of ESRD in 4.3% of whites, 34.6% of blacks, 20.9% mixed race group and 13.8% of Indians. Malignant hypertension is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among urban black South Africans, with hypertension accounting for 16% of all hospital admissions. In a ten-year study of 368 patients with chronic renal failure in Nigeria, the etiology of renal failure was undetermined in 62%. Of the remaining patients whose etiology was ascertained, hypertension accounted for 61%, diabetes mellitus for 11% and chronic glomerulonephritis for 5.9%. Patients with CRF constituted 10% of all medical admissions in this center. Chronic glomerulonephritis and hypertension are principal causes of CRF in tropical Africa and East Africa, together with diabetes mellitus and obstructive uropathy. The availability of dialysis and transplantation is quite variable in Africa: treatment rates in North Africa are 30 to 186.5 per million population (pmp) in countries with more established programs: Algeria 78.5; Egypt 129.3; Libya 30; Morocco 55.6; Tunisia 186.5 pmp. In South Africa, treatment rates of 99 pmp were reported; Dialysis and transplant programs in the rest of Africa are dependent on the availability of funding and donors. Services are still predominantly urban and therefore generally inaccessible to the poorer, less educated rural patient. There is not enough money for healthcare in the developing world, particularly for expensive and chronic treatment such as RRT. The goal should be to have a circumscribed chronic dialysis program, with as short a time on dialysis as possible, and to increase the availability of transplantation (both living donor and cadaver). Efforts should be made to optimize therapy of renal disease and renal failure globally and particularly in developing countries. Strategies should be developed to screen for and manage conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus at the primary healthcare level in an effort to decrease the incidence of chronic renal failure. Increasingly, health is influenced by social and economic circumstances. Any improvements in health thus demand integrated, comprehensive action against all the determinants of ill health.",Kidney international. Supplement,2003 Feb,United States,2003,00
16707005,Non-specific low back pain in primary care in the Spanish National Health Service: a prospective study on clinical outcomes and determinants of management.,"BACKGROUND: The Spanish National Health Service is a universal and free health care system. Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent disorder, generating large health and social costs. The objectives of this study were to describe its management in primary care, to assess patient characteristics that influence physicians' decisions, and to describe clinical outcome at 2 months. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 648 patients with non-specific low back pain was recruited by 75 physicians (out of 361-20.8%) working in 40 primary care centers in 10 of the 17 administrative regions in Spain, covering 693,026 out of the 40,499,792 inhabitants. Patients were assessed on the day they were recruited, and prospectively followed-up 14 and 60 days later. The principal patient characteristics that were analyzed were: sex, duration of the episode, history of LBP, working status, severity of LBP, leg pain and disability, and results of straight leg raising test. Descriptors of management were: performance of the straight leg raising test, ordering of diagnostic procedures, prescription of drug treatment, referral to physical therapy, rehabilitation or surgery, and granting of sick leave. Regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between patients' baseline characteristics and physicians' management decisions. Only workers were included in the models on sick leave. RESULTS: Mean age (SD) of included patients was 46.5 (15.5) years, 367 (56.6%) were workers, and 338 (52.5%) were females. Median (25th-75th interquartile range) duration of pain when entering the study was 4 (2-10) days and only 28 patients (4.3%) had chronic low back pain. Diagnostic studies included plain radiographs in 43.1% of patients and CT or MRI scans in 18.8%. Drug medication was prescribed to 91.7% of patients, 19.1% were sent to physical therapy or rehabilitation, and 9.6% were referred to surgery. The main determinants of the clinical management were duration of the episode and, to a lesser extent, the intensity of the pain (especially leg pain), a positive straight leg raising test, and degree of disability. The main determinant of sick leave was the degree of disability, followed by the characteristics of the labor contract and the intensity of leg pain (but not low back pain). After at least 2 months of treatment, 37% of patients were still in pain and approximately 10% of patients had not improved or had worsened. CONCLUSION: Although the use of X-Rays is high, determinants of physicians' management of LBP in primary care made clinical sense and were consistent with patterns suggested by evidence-based recommendations. However, after 2 months of treatment more than one third of patients continued to have back pain and about 10% had worsened.",BMC health services research,2006 May 17,England,2006,00
15362474,Individual and regional determinants of mammography uptake.,"BACKGROUND: Analysis of mammography utilization has traditionally been performed from an individual-level perspective. The purpose of this study was to explore the combined influence of individual- and regional-level determinants of mammography utilization. METHODS: Logistic hierarchical multilevel modelling was used to investigate the influences of region of residence and individual characteristics on mammography utilization. Socioeconomic status information about health planning regions was derived from the 1996 Canadian Census. Individual-level information was extracted from the 1996 National Population Health Survey. RESULTS: After controlling for individual-level education, regions with fewer high school graduates had lower levels of mammography utilization. A cross-level interaction between regional-level education and individual-level social involvement was found. Other individual-level variables associated with screening confirmed previous literature findings. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that higher levels of participation in social activities modify the detrimental influence on mammography utilization of living in a less educated region. This challenges the current focus of mammography screening research on individual-level determinants of uptake. Multilevel, synergistic strategies to possibly achieve higher levels of screening should be considered by health promotion program planners.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2004 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,2004,00

16297230,Feeling at risk matters: water managers and the decision to use forecasts.,"Experts contend that weather and climate forecasts could have an important role in risk management strategies for community water systems. Yet, most water managers make minimal use of these forecasts. This research explores the determinants of the use of weather and climate forecasts by surveying managers of community water systems in two eastern American states (South Carolina and the Susquehanna River Basin of Pennsylvania). Assessments of the reliability of weather and climate forecasts are not driving their use as water managers who find forecasts reliable are no more likely to use them than are managers who find them unreliable. Although larger systems and those depending on surface water are more likely to use forecasts for some (but not all) purposes, the strongest determinant of forecast use is risk perceptions. Water managers who expect to face problems from weather events in the next decade are much more likely to use forecasts than are water managers who expect few problems. Their expectations of future problems are closely linked with past experience: water managers who have had problems with specific types of weather events (e.g., flood emergencies) in the last 5 years are likely to expect to experience problems in the next decade. Feeling at risk, regardless of the specific source of that weather-related risk, stimulates a decision to use weather and climate forecasts.",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2005 Oct,United States,2005,00
18392357,Cultural significance of primary teeth for caregivers in Northeast Brazil.,"This anthropological study critically evaluates Brazilian caregivers' symbolic production and significance of their malnourished offspring's primary teeth, as well as their own, and describes popular dental practices. From January to June 2004, ethnographic interviews of 27 poor, low-literacy mothers were conducted at a public Malnutrition Treatment Center in Fortaleza, Ceara State. Participant observation of clinical pathways and home environments supplemented the data. Content analysis was performed. Results confirm that primary teeth are imbued with cultural significance in Northeast Brazil. Mothers examine mouths, perceive signs of decay, associate primary with permanent tooth healthiness, identify ethnodental illnesses, seek assistance, and perform rituals with exfoliated teeth. The mother's motivation to care for primary teeth is sparked by her memories of past toothache and attempts to avoid stigma and discrimination. Social determinants, not mothers' beliefs or behaviors, are the most critical obstacles to effective dental care. Legitimizing lay knowledge and empowering caregivers and children can improve oral health in Northeast Brazil.",Cadernos de saude publica,2008 Apr,Brazil,2008,00
22029661,Self- and other-estimates of multiple abilities in Britain and Turkey: a cross-cultural comparison of subjective ratings of intelligence.,"This study is part of a programmatic research effort into the determinants of self-assessed abilities. It examined cross-cultural differences in beliefs about intelligence and self- and other-estimated intelligence in two countries at extreme ends of the European continent. In all, 172 British and 272 Turkish students completed a three-part questionnaire where they estimated their parents', partners' and own multiple intelligences (Gardner (10) and Sternberg (3)). They also completed a measure of the 'big five' personality scales and rated six questions about intelligence. The British sample had more experience with IQ tests than the Turks. The majority of participants in both groups did not believe in sex differences in intelligence but did think there were race differences. They also believed that intelligence was primarily inherited. Participants rated their social and emotional intelligence highly (around one standard deviation above the norm). Results suggested that there were more cultural than sex differences in all the ratings, with various interactions mainly due to the British sample differentiating more between the sexes than the Turks. Males rated their overall, verbal, logical, spatial, creative and practical intelligence higher than females. Turks rated their musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence as well as existential, naturalistic, emotional, creative, and practical intelligence higher than the British. There was evidence of participants rating their fathers' intelligence on most factors higher than their mothers'. Factor analysis of the ten Gardner intelligences yield two clear factors: cognitive and social intelligence. The first factor was impacted by sex but not culture; it was the other way round for the second factor. Regressions showed that five factors predicted overall estimates: sex (male), age (older), test experience (has done tests), extraversion (strong) and openness (strong). Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the field.",International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,2009 Dec,England,2009,00
11833984,Social support for spouse caregivers of persons with dementia.,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyzes the value of simultaneously taking helper and caregiver characteristics into account when examining social support received by spouse caregivers of persons with dementia. This study questions whether sources and types of received support vary by the gender and relationship of the helper and/or by the caregiver's race and gender. METHODS: Drawing on a sample of 210 spouse caregivers of persons with dementia, the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) method was used to estimate a population-average logistic regression model to address cross-level helper and caregiver interactions. RESULTS: Results indicate that helper and caregiver characteristics interact in complex ways. White male caregivers are more likely to receive emotional support from adult children and to receive practical assistance from formal sources compared with other types of support and to other race-gender caregiver groups. DISCUSSION: Description of social status characteristics of caregivers as determinants of their social network may be less fruitful in understanding the benefits of social support than a focus on which helpers assist with what kinds of task for which groups of caregivers.","The journals of gerontology.

15336983,Functional role of TRPC proteins in vivo: lessons from TRPC-deficient mouse models.,"In order to elucidate the functional role of TRPC genes, in vivo, the targeted inactivation of these genes in mice is an invaluable technique. In this review, we summarize the currently available results on the phenotype of TRPC-deficient mouse lines. The analysis of mice with targeted deletion in three TRPC genes demonstrates that these proteins represent essential constituents of agonist-activated and phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ entry channels in primary cells. Furthermore, from the deficits observed in these TRPC-deficient mouse lines a striking number of biological functions could already be ascribed to TRPC2, TRPC4, and TRPC6, not only on the cellular level but also for complex organ functions and integrative physiology. Accordingly, TRPC2 proteins are critically involved in pheromone sensing by neurones of the vomeronasal organ and, thereby, in the regulation of sexual and social behavior of mice, TRPC4 proteins are essential determinants of endothelial-dependent regulation of vascular tone, endothelial permeability, and neurotransmitter release from thalamic interneurones, and TRPC6 proteins are supposed to have a fundamental role in the regulation of smooth muscle tone in blood vessels and lung.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2004 Oct 1,United States,2004,00
19648131,"Distinguishing risk factors for the onset of cravings, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance in novice adolescent smokers.","AIM: While many studies report determinants of adolescent cigarette smoking, few identify risk factors for nicotine dependence (ND). This study distinguished between risk factors for three hallmarks of ND including cravings, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance. METHODS: A total of 319 novice smokers were followed every 3 months from first puff on a cigarette until the end of secondary school. Outcomes included time to first report of cravings, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance. RESULTS: Female sex, inhalation, smoking a whole cigarette, weekly smoking, daily smoking and alcohol use each independently increased the incidence of the onset of cravings. Inhalation, weekly smoking, daily smoking and alcohol use predicted the onset of withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms, smoking a whole cigarette, monthly smoking, daily smoking and friends and siblings smoking increased the incidence of the onset of tolerance. None of parental education, impulsivity, novelty seeking, self-esteem, depression, stress, parental smoking, physical activity, or participation in sports teams was associated with the outcomes. CONCLUSION: The hallmarks of early ND are related to intensity and frequency of cigarette use. Avoidance of daily smoking may be particularly important in preventing the onset of ND symptoms and sustained smoking.",Tobacco control,2009 Oct,England,2009,00
11041010,Pattern of disconfirming information and processing instructions as determinants of stereotype change.,"This experiment examined the effects of pattern of disconfirming information (concentrated vs. dispersed) and processing instructions (focus on similarities vs. differences vs. control) on stereotype change. If subtyping and perceived typicality are central to the stereotype change process, then processing instructions designed to affect these processes should affect stereotyping. There was lower stereotyping when perceivers focused on similarities between group members, and after exposure to a dispersed pattern of disconfirming information. Only the main effect of pattern was mediated by the perceived typicality of disconfirmers, but not by an index of subtyping based on clustering of information from disconfirmers in recall. Results support a model of stereotype change in terms of the impact of disconfirming group members who are also seen as typical of the group; subtyping of extreme disconfirmers may work in parallel, or later, and contribute to the long-term maintenance of a stereotype.",The British journal of social psychology,2000 Sep,England,2000,00
16076786,An experimental study of determinants of the extent of disagreement within clinical guideline development groups.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of design features and clinical and social cues on the extent of disagreement among participants in a formal consensus development process. METHODS: Factorial design involving 16 groups consisting of 135 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 mental health professionals from England. The groups rated the appropriateness of four mental health interventions for three conditions (chronic back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome) in the context of various clinical and social cues. The groups differed in three design features: provision of a systematic literature review (versus not provided), group composition (mixed versus GP only), and assumptions about the healthcare resources available (realistic versus idealistic). Disagreement was measured using the mean absolute deviation from a group's median rating for a scenario. RESULTS: None of the design features significantly affected the extent of disagreement within groups (all p>0.3). Disagreement did differ between treatments (closer consensus for cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural therapy than for brief psychodynamic intervention therapy and antidepressants) and cues (closer consensus for depressed patients and patients willing to try any treatment). CONCLUSION: In terms of the extent of disagreement in the groups in this study, formal consensus development was a robust technique in that the results were not dependent on the way it was conducted.",Quality & safety in health care,2005 Aug,England,2005,00
16415258,Do urban regeneration programmes improve public health and reduce health inequalities? A synthesis of the evidence from UK policy and practice (1980-2004).,"OBJECTIVES: To synthesise data on the impact on health and key socioeconomic determinants of health and health inequalities reported in evaluations of national UK regeneration programmes. DATA SOURCES: Eight electronic databases were searched from 1980 to 2004 (IBSS, COPAC, HMIC, IDOX, INSIDE, Medline, Urbadisc/Accompline, Web of Knowledge). Bibliographies of located documents and relevant web sites were searched. Experts and government departmental libraries were also contacted. REVIEW METHODS: Evaluations that reported achievements drawing on data from at least two target areas of a national urban regeneration programme in the UK were included. Process evaluations and evaluations reporting only business outcomes were excluded. All methods of evaluation were included. Impact data on direct health outcomes and direct measures of socioeconomic determinants of health were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 19 evaluations reported impacts on health or socioeconomic determinants of health; data from 10 evaluations were synthesised. Three evaluations reported health impacts; in one evaluation three of four measures of self reported health deteriorated, typically by around 4%. Two other evaluations reported overall reductions in mortality rates. Most socioeconomic outcomes assessed showed an overall improvement after regeneration investment; however, the effect size was often similar to national trends. In addition, some evaluations reported adverse impacts. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence of the impact of national urban regeneration investment on socioeconomic or health outcomes. Where impacts have been assessed, these are often small and positive but adverse impacts have also occurred. Impact data from future evaluations are required to inform healthy public policy; in the meantime work to exploit and synthesise ""best available"" data is required.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2006 Feb,England,2006,00

METHODS: Data were used from the general population of German and French Switzerland with 2.8 million individuals aged 45-74 years, contributing 176 782 deaths between 1990 and 2000. Adjusted mortality risks were calculated from the Swiss National Cohort, a longitudinal census-based record linkage study. Results were contrasted with cross-sectional analyses of SRH and risk factors (Swiss Health Survey 1992/3) and with cross-sectional national and international mortality rates for 1980, 1990 and 2000. RESULTS: Despite similar all-cause mortality, there were substantial differences in cause-specific mortality between Swiss regions. Deaths from circulatory disease were more common in German Switzerland, while causes related to alcohol consumption were more prevalent in French Switzerland. Many but not all of the mortality differences between the two regions could be explained by variations in risk factors. Similar patterns were found between Germany and France. CONCLUSION: Characteristic mortality and behavioural differentials between the German- and the French-speaking parts of Switzerland could also be found between Germany and France. However, some of the international variations in mortality were not in line with the Swiss regional comparison nor with differences in risk factors. These could relate to peculiarities in assignment of cause of death. With its cultural diversity, Switzerland offers the opportunity to examine cultural determinants of mortality without bias due to different statistical systems or national health policies.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2009 Aug,England,2009,00

16372921,"Why do adolescents eat what they eat? Personal and social environmental predictors of fruit, snack and breakfast consumption among 12-14-year-old Dutch students.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the relative importance of personal and social environmental predictors of the consumption of fruit, high-fat snacks and breakfast. DESIGN: A school-based cross-sectional survey. Data were collected through written questionnaires. SETTING: Students from eight schools in the southern part of The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Six hundred and one students from preparatory secondary vocational education schools. RESULTS: About a quarter of the variation in actual behaviours and intentions to change the behaviours could be explained. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that, for all three behaviours, higher intention to change was especially associated with a more positive attitude and subjective norm, and higher intentions to increase fruit intake with more positive self-efficacy expectations. With regard to actual consumption, a more positive attitude towards eating fruit was the only significant correlate of a higher consumption of fruit. A more positive attitude towards eating high-fat snacks, perceived lower intake of the mother, and higher food availability and accessibility were associated with consumption of high-fat snacks, and a more positive attitude to breakfast more frequently was associated with more frequent breakfast consumption. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that adolescents' attitudes are the most important determinants of different health-related eating behaviours and intentions to change. Interventions promoting a healthy diet for adolescents should include creative strategies to achieve positive associations with healthy dietary changes.",Public health nutrition,2005 Dec,England,2005,00
12215241,Smoking cessation during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood.,"The psychosocial and behavioral determinants of smoking cessation from late adolescence to early adulthood were investigated in a sample of 711 individuals followed from 1990 (grade 12) to 1995. Analyses stratified by sex indicated that female smokers were more likely to quit 5 years later if they had fewer friends who smoked, less parental approval of their smoking, weaker intentions to continue smoking, higher smoking resistance self-efficacy and better grades at grade 12. Several of these associations could be accounted for by smoking quantity. Similar analyses for male smokers indicated that those who eventually quit were more likely to have fewer cigarette offers, weaker intentions to smoke, better grades and an intact nuclear family at grade 12. The associations for males could not be explained by smoking quantity. Interaction analyses showed few significant sex differences in the predictors of smoking cessation. Results suggest that cessation programs should continue to target parental and peer influences, as well as skills at resisting social influences to smoke, through late adolescence, but do not indicate that such programs need to be adapted to the special needs of male and female smokers.",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,2002 Aug,England,2002,00
18265961,Autoantibodies against opioid or glutamate receptors are associated with changes in morphine reward and physical dependence in mice.,"BACKGROUND: Possible interactions between nervous and immune systems during opioid addiction remain elusive. Recombinant mu-delta opioid receptors (MDOR) and the glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) subunit of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid glutamate receptors are involved in acute and chronic effects of morphine. Elevated levels of autoantibodies (aAbs) to these receptors were demonstrated in heroin human addicts and in animal models. This study characterized the role of aAbs to these receptors in behavioral modulations recruited during opioid tolerance and sensitization. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Male CD-1 mice, immunized with either MDOR or GluR1 peptide fragments (80 microg intraperitoneal (i.p.)), were examined for spontaneous behavior and response to morphine (5 mg/kg i.p.). Spontaneous home-cage activity, novelty-induced self-grooming and morphine-induced hyperactivity were higher in GluR1 mice compared to Vehicle subjects, whereas MDOR immunization was associated with an increased morphine-induced conditioned place preference. In response to escalating doses of morphine (from 10 to 60 mg/kg i.p., twice daily) and naloxone-precipitated withdrawal (1 mg/kg subcutaneous), GluR1 mice exhibited a more marked stereotyped sniffing behavior and less body tremors compared to Vehicle subjects, whereas less sniffing and teeth chattering were found in MDOR mice. The expected downregulation of mu receptor binding sites, induced by chronic morphine in vehicle subjects, was completely absent following MDOR immunization. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate an altered response to morphine-related reinforcing and aversive effects in MDOR mice and altered coping with the environment in GluR1 mice. Circulating aAbs to specific neuroreceptors may alter the response to opiates and play a role as determinants of vulnerability to opiate addiction.",Psychopharmacology,2008 May,Germany,2008,00

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Secondary analysis was performed on the data of adults who were 60 or more years of age, living in the metropolitan area of Mexico city, and had participated in the multi-city study on Health, Wellbeing, and Aging in 1999 and 2000. Information on 820 participants was analyzed (mean age 69.7 +/- 7.6 years; 62.9% female). In addition to the MR (dependent variable) that was established through a basic nutrition evaluation, the following variables were analyzed: sociodemographics, body mass index, comorbidity, symptoms of depression, oral health, mental function, functional capability, among others. Independent associations from among the variables and the MR were calculated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were determined. RESULTS: MR was present in 261 (31.8%) participants. The univariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for possible confounding variables showed that the following variables demonstrated significant and independent associations with MR among the study sample population: not having a pension (adjusted OR = 1.45; 95%CI: 1.01 - 2.38); feeling that one did not have enough money to live on (adjusted OR = 2.52; 95%CI: 1.69 - 3.74); having osteoarthritis (adjusted OR = 2.34; 95%CI: 1.42 - 3.85); having a low body mass index (adjusted OR = 0.89; 95%CI: 0.85 - 0.93); having symptoms of depression (adjusted OR = 5.41; 95%CI: 1.90 - 15.34); eating only once daily (adjusted OR = 12.95; 95%CI: 5.19 - 32.28) or twice daily (adjusted OR = 3.27; 95%CI: 2.18 - 4.9); and having physical difficulty with getting to bed (adjusted OR = 3.25; CI 95%: 1.58 - 6.68), going out alone (adjusted OR = 2.70; CI 95%: 1.54 - 4.73), and using the telephone (adjusted OR = 1.95; CI 95%: 1.10 - 3.43).

The Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 20 (SF-20) assessment consisted of patient self-ratings on 20 items measuring six distinct health dimensions. Additional data were collected on age, ethnicity, education, employment status, length of time since HIV diagnosis, CDC stage of disease, total CD4 count, number of symptoms, Karnofsky Performance Scores, social support and discrimination. Multiple regression analyses were performed using each of the six health dimension scores as dependent variables and a combination of ten demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as independent variables. All of the six multiple regression equations were statistically significant, with R(2) values ranging from 0.35 to 0.44. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score and social support were statistically significantly related to several scale scores (p < 0.05). These results provide baseline data on clinical, demographic and psychosocial determinants of quality of life in a female patient population. Quality of life information can assist programme planners in developing social and medical service delivery for women in the community thus facilitating the development of treatments, programmes and interventions aimed at increasing quality of life for this population.",AIDS care,2002 Apr,England,2002,00
15377557,Determinants of surgery related anxiety in cataract patients.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Not much is known about the relative importance of different determinants of anxiety in cataract patients. This study analysed the predictive value of factors related to surgery induced anxiety. METHODS: In 128 cataract patients, recruited from two hospitals (Medical Centre Maastricht Annadal (MCMA) and Rotterdam Eye Hospital (REH)), state anxiety was assessed at four different time points using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The following predictive factors of anxiety were measured: trait anxiety, outcome expectancies, doctor-patient relationship, coping strategy, social support, information supply, sociodemographic variables, and previous cataract surgery. Repeated measures ANOVA, t tests, multiple regression analysis, and correlations were used to analyse data. RESULTS: In general patients reported little anxiety. The level of anxiety (scale 1-4) was the highest before surgery, decreased immediately after surgery, and increased again after the postoperative visit. Patients with higher trait anxiety levels (r = 0.41; p<0.01), and women (r = 0.30; p<0.01) reported more anxiety. The REH patients showed lower anxiety scores than the MCMA patients. CONCLUSION: Women and patients with higher trait anxiety were more likely to experience higher levels of state anxiety. Positive outcome expectancies and social support may decrease anxiety.",The British journal of ophthalmology,2004 Oct,England,2004,00
16891574,Social context and the psychobiology of posttraumatic stress.,"A growing body of research is identifying the molecular and genetic correlates of psychopathology and holds tremendous promise in suggesting the biologic mechanisms that may explain emergent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) phenotypes. Another body of research has begun to consider how elements of the social context may influence the risk of PTSD. It is likely that the social context and molecular/genetic factors jointly determine the risk of PTSD and as such scientific inquiry that considers the interrelationship of these factors stands to advance the field. However, there are particular conceptual and methodologic challenges to conducting and designing studies that adequately assess both the social context and the biologic determinants of PTSD. Much of the current research exploring the biology of PTSD is conducted with highly selective samples that were recruited on the basis of strict phenotypic or medical history criteria. In contrast, population-based sampling represents an opportunity to obtain heterogeneous samples that better represent the population distribution of relevant molecular, genotypic, and phenotypic parameters of interest. These sampling strategies also allow researchers to consider the role of the social context and in turn, how the social context influences the molecular determinants of PTSD. An example of our own work illustrates the feasibility of the population-based sampling approach.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2006 Jul,United States,2006,00
15193889,Short- and long-term effects of tailored information versus general information on determinants and intentions related to early detection of cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Since it is widely accepted that the earlier cancer is detected, the better the chances of treatment and survival, people should be encouraged to create positive intentions toward early detection of several types of cancer, for instance, skin cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer. This can be done by being alert to the warning signs of cancer and seeking help once a cancer symptom is detected. METHODS: A randomized controlled study (n = 1,500) assessed the effects of computer-tailored information and general information on determinants and intentions to engage in early detection behaviors (i.e., passive detection and help seeking) compared with those in a control group. Possible negative side effects, like increased chronic fear of cancer and more fatalistic attitudes toward cancer, were studied as well. RESULTS: Shortly after the intervention, differences between the study groups were found in intention, several social psychological determinants, and knowledge. Six months after the intervention, there were still differences between the tailored information group and the control group in intentions toward help seeking. Neither of the interventions resulted in increased chronic fear nor more fatalistic attitudes toward cancer. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that there were positive effects of the tailored intervention on determinants, passive detection, and help-seeking intentions in the short-term, but additional research is needed to assess ways of maintaining these effects in the long-term.",Preventive medicine,2004 Jun,United States,2004,00
18183608,"Population-based controlled study of social support, self-perceived stress, activity and work issues, and access to health care in inflammatory bowel disease.","BACKGROUND: The Manitoba IBD Cohort Study is a longitudinal, population-based study of multiple determinants of health outcomes in persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosed within 7 years at enrollment. In this cross-sectional substudy we compared IBD participants' levels of social support, self-perceived stress, disability, and access to healthcare with those of a matched community sample. METHODS: IBD participants (n = 388) were interviewed using the Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) 1.1 and 1.2 to assess psychosocial variables. The national CCHS data were accessed to extract a community comparison group, matched on age, sex, and geographic residence. RESULTS: Compared to the community sample, IBD participants received more tangible, affective, or emotional support in the past year and were more likely to have experienced a positive social interaction. Those with IBD were as likely to be employed as those in the community sample, although they reported greater rates of reduced activity and days missed. Work was not identified as a significant source of stress, but physical health was more likely to be identified as a main stressor by those with active IBD compared to the non-IBD sample. Individuals with IBD were twice as likely to report unmet healthcare needs than the community sample; however, there was agreement across both groups regarding common barriers, including long waits and availability. CONCLUSIONS: While the disease may contribute to greater interference with work quality and daily activities, IBD patients have similar levels of stress and appear to have enhanced social supports relative to those in the community without IBD.",Inflammatory bowel diseases,2008 Apr,England,2008,00
11338747,"Global health challenges: trends in public health training, research and advocacy.","As we begin the 21st century, public health is at the crossroads in trying to understand the relative importance of health determinants in risk exposures, and the collective susceptibility of our societies. Classically conditioned attitudes of investigation, instruction, and exposition in the management of acute disease breaks down, when disease surveillance becomes virtually useless as in the prevention of chronic conditions. Older populations, new lifestyle changes, environmental hazards and urbanization have converged to make social class and poverty predominant factors in the expression of morbidity and mortality. In the process, the comfort of specific disease eradication is replaced by continuous challenges in dealing with the dynamics of social change--behaviors in diet and exercise--as well as the globalization of poverty, addiction, injury and violence. The consequent dilemma to develop a base for public health intervention, a strategy for training and a platform for advocacy for health improvement shows an eclectic pattern. The traditional clinically oriented perspective has moved towards a comprehensive population-based disease management model. A second trend with a somewhat narrowed vision for public health is the one focused on cost containment limiting preventive care. As technological advances in genetics and medicine and health informatics brings more rational, evidence based management in health care, two major gaps in public health training continues to persist. One is the lack of adequate attention to social class and poverty as a major pervasive factor. The other relates to the inability to address effectively, injury, violence, and mini wars diluting the value perspectives and advocacy in public health.",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,2000,China,2000,00
12150236,Coping in context: sociocultural determinants of responses to sexual harassment.,"The authors investigated coping responses to sexual harassment across 4 samples of working women from 3 cultures and 2 occupational classes. Complete-link cluster analyses provide preliminary support for D. E. Knapp, R. H. Faley, S. E. Ekeberg, and C. L. Z. Dubois's (1997) coping framework, suggesting that avoidance, denial, negotiation, advocacy seeking, and social coping are universal responses to sexual harassment. Further, L. F. Fitzgerald's (1990) internal-external dichotomy appears to capture higher order relationships among coping responses. In addition, regression analyses suggest that Turkish and Hispanic American women engage in more avoidance than Anglo American women, and Hispanic women also use more denial but less advocacy seeking. No differences emerged in social coping. The authors discuss these results in the context of coping theory, individualism-collectivism, power distance, and patriarchal gender norms.",Journal of personality and social psychology,2002 Aug,United States,2002,00
11085401,Assessing the impact of classical risk factors on myocardial infarction by rate advancement periods.,"The risk or rate advancement period (RAP) proposed by Brenner et al. (Epidemiology 1993;4:229-36) conveys information on the impact of a risk factor on the age dimension of chronic disease occurrence and may thus facilitate communication of epidemiologic findings. The RAP expresses how much sooner a given risk or rate of disease occurrence is reached among exposed than among unexposed individuals. The purpose of the present analysis was to derive estimates of RAPs for cardiovascular risk factors in relation to incident nonfatal and fatal myocardial infarction in middle-aged men of the Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Diseases (MONICA) Augsburg cohort, Germany, between 1984 and 1995. RAPs were estimated based on Cox proportional hazards models. After multivariate adjustment, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia were associated with RAPs of 8, 11, and 11 years, respectively, conditional on infarction-free survival to baseline and absence of competing risks. The RAP may be interpreted as that, on average, smokers are expected to advance their risk of myocardial infarction approximately 11 years compared with never/former smokers; for example, 50-year-old smokers are expected to carry the same risk of infarction as 61-year-old nonsmokers. The authors encourage the use and evaluation of the RAP as an effective risk communication tool in actual counseling situations.",American journal of epidemiology,2000 Nov 1,United States,2000,00
11259795,The contribution of perceptions of stigmatisation to disability in patients with psoriasis.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the significance of general and psoriasis specific psychological variables in patients with psoriasis and to examine the relative importance of disease status and these psychological variables in predicting psoriasis-related disability. METHOD: A total of 115 patients with psoriasis underwent clinical assessment and completed a number of psychological and psoriasis specific questionnaires. RESULTS: High levels of self-reported distress were identified with 43% and 10% of patients scoring as probable cases on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) subscales of anxiety (mean 9.3+/-4.9) and depression (mean 4.8+/-3.7), respectively. Multiple regression analysis indicated that clinical severity of psoriasis and anatomical area of involvement had no impact on psychological distress and disability. Perceptions of stigmatisation were significantly related to both psychological distress and degree of disability (P's<.001) and accounted for a significant amount of the variance in disability over and above general psychological distress (F change=11.03; P<.001). CONCLUSION: Psychological factors were much stronger determinants of disability in patients with psoriasis than disease severity, location or duration. This has important implications in relation to the clinical management of psoriasis.",Journal of psychosomatic research,2001 Jan,England,2001,00
16497451,"Relations between body composition, functional and hormonal parameters and quality of life in healthy postmenopausal women.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether body composition, functional status and serum hormone levels are associated with quality of life in healthy postmenopausal women. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study among 402 women aged 56-73 years, 8-30 years postmenopausal. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the questionnaire on life satisfaction (QLS), with two modules directed at general factors (QLS-general) and health factors (QLS-health). Muscle strength was measured using dynamometry. Functional ability was estimated by physical performance (PPS), physical activity during the preceding year, and impairment in activities of daily living (ADL). Bone mineral density, lean mass and fat mass were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fasting levels of serum oestradiol, oestrone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone, cortisol, androstenedione, DHEA and DHEAS, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), its binding proteins (IGFBP-1 and -3) and insulin, were determined. RESULTS: Both QLS modules did not decrease with age. The major positive predictor of QLS-general module was the presence of a partner. Higher physical performance and higher educational level of participants' partners were significantly related to higher QLS-general, while smoking and presence of co-morbidities were significantly associated with a lower QLS-general. The determinants studied were mostly related to the QLS-health module, the major negative predictor of QLS-health being the presence of co-morbidities, followed by physical activity, physical performance and grip strength. Higher educational level of participants was related with higher QLS-health module, while higher BMI, fat mass and presence of disability were associated with significantly lower QLS-health. No consistent relation was found between serum levels of hormones measured and both QLS modules. CONCLUSIONS: The most important and specific determinant for psychological well-being was having a partner. Physical and psychological well-being are further strongly associated in this population of healthy postmenopausal women below 75 years of age, while increasing fat mass was related to decreased well-being. Our results suggest that in elderly and late postmenopausal women hormonal factors do not predict quality of life.",Maturitas,2006 Aug 20,Ireland,2006,00
16818583,Children at risk for special health care needs.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the widespread use of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau definition of children with special health care needs, no published studies have considered the ""at-risk"" component of the definition. The purpose of this article is to present a conceptual model of risk for special health care needs. METHODOLOGY: The conceptual model presented here was developed based on a comprehensive review of the literature on the determinants of population health and the etiologic literature for selected representative childhood chronic conditions. RESULTS: Our conceptual model is built on 5 key pillars derived from the literature. First, determinants of health have been demonstrated to include genetic endowment, the physical and social environment, health-related behaviors, and the health care system. Second, the model recognizes that the relative importance of each of these domains in contributing to the presence of a special health care need is likely to vary across the major chronic conditions experienced by children. Third, these domains can be conceptualized as acting at the child, family, community, or societal level. Fourth, the model recognizes the presence of a complex interplay of causal factors influencing the development of chronic conditions and associated special health care needs. Fifth, the model incorporates a temporal aspect to the development of special health care needs. CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual model presented here represents a starting point for thinking about the risk factors that influence the occurrence and severity of a special health care need. The model incorporates many of the important breakthroughs by social epidemiologists over the past 25 years by including a broad range of genetic, social, and environmental risk factors; multiple pathways by which they operate; a time dimension; the notion of differential susceptibility and resilience; and a multilevel approach to considering risk. Nevertheless, we recognize that the conceptual model represents an oversimplification of reality. The study of risk factors for special health care needs remains largely in its infancy and is ripe for additional development.",Pediatrics,2006 Jul,United States,2006,00
19286838,Age and closeness of death as determinants of health and social care utilization: a case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: We used case-control design to compare utilization of health and social services between older decedents and survivors, and to identify the respective impact of age and closeness of death on the utilization of services. METHODS: Data were derived from multiple national registers. The sample consisted of 56,001 persons, who died during years 1998-2000 at the age of > or = 70, and their pairs matched on age, gender and municipality of residence, who were alive at least 2 years after their counterpart's death. Data include use of hospitals, long-term care and home care. Decedents' utilization within 2 years before death and survivors' utilization in the same period of time was assessed in three age groups (70-79, 80-89 and > or = 90 years) and by gender. RESULTS: Decedents used hospital and long-term care more than their surviving counterparts, but the time patterns were different. In hospital care the differences between decedents and survivors rose in the last months of the study period, whereas in long-term care there were clear differences during the whole 2-year period. The differences were smaller in the oldest age group than in younger age groups. CONCLUSION: Closeness of death is an important predictor of health and social service use in old age, but its influence varies between age groups. Not only the changing age structure, but also the higher average age at death affects the future need for services.",European journal of public health,2009 Jun,England,2009,00
11580075,"Maternal height, childhood growth and risk of hip fracture in later life: a longitudinal study.","Although measures to enhance bone mineralization during childhood and adolescence are widely incorporated into preventive programmes against osteoporotic fracture, there are no published data directly linking growth rates in childhood with the risk of later hip fracture. We addressed this issue in a unique Finnish cohort in whom birth and childhood growth data were linked to later hospital discharge records. This permitted follow-up of 3639 men and 3447 women who were born in Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1924 and 1933, who went to school in Helsinki and still lived in Finland in 1971. Body size at birth was recorded and an average of 10 measurements were obtained of height and weight throughout childhood. We identified 112 subjects (55 men and 57 women) who sustained a hip fracture during 165 404 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age and sex in a proportional hazards model, we identified two major determinants of hip fracture risk: tall maternal height (p < 0.001) and a low rate of childhood growth (height, p = 0.006; weight, p = 0.01). The hazard ratio for hip fracture was 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.5) among men and women born to mothers taller than 1.61 m, when compared with those whose mothers were shorter than 1.54 m. The ratio was 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.2) among those whose rate of childhood height gain was below the lowest quartile for the cohort, compared with those whose growth rate was above the highest quartile. The effects of maternal height and childhood growth rate were statistically independent of each other, and remained after adjusting for socioeconomic status. The patterns of childhood growth that predicted future hip fracture differed between boys and girls. In boys, there was a constant deficit in height and weight between ages 7 and 15 years among those later sustaining fractures; in girls, there was a progressively increasing deficit in weight but a delayed height gain among those later sustaining fractures. This epidemiologic study provides the first direct evidence that a low rate of childhood growth is a risk factor for later hip fracture. Whether reduced growth rate is a consequence of childhood lifestyle, genetic background or intrauterine hormonal programming, the data support measures to optimize childhood growth as part of preventive strategies against osteoporotic fracture in future generations.",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2001,England,2001,00
18702572,Responding to health impacts of climate change in the Australian desert.,"Climate change is likely to have a significant effect on the health of those living in the 70% of Australia that is desert. The direct impacts on health, such as increased temperature, are important. But so too are the secondary impacts that will occur as a result of the impact of climate change on an uncertain and highly variable natural environment and on the interlinking social and economic systems. The consequence of these secondary impacts will appear as changes in the incidence of disease and infections, and on the psychosocial determinants of health. Responding to the impacts of climate change on health in desert Australia will involve the active participation of a variety of interest groups ranging from local to state and federal governments and a range of public and private agencies, including those not traditionally defined as within the health sector. The modes of engagement required for this process need to be innovative, and will differ among regions on different trajectories. To this end, a first classification of these trajectories is proposed.",Rural and remote health,2008 Jul-Sep,Australia,2008,00
18472374,[Internet and health: lessons learned from the French national survey on households living conditions in 2005].,"BACKGROUND: The Internet is a major source of information for the general public in the field of health. However despite ever-increasing connection rates, a digital divide persists in the industrialised countries. The objective of this study was to assess the determinants involved in Internet access and then in Internet use for health information seeking. METHODS: This study is based on a cross-sectional survey of a representative random sample of French inhabitants: the Enquete permanente sur les conditions de vie des menages conducted by Insee in 2005, which included a specific investigation on information and communication technology. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of the French adult population had Internet access, and 28.5% of the Internet users had previously searched for medical information during the month before the survey. A first level of socioeconomic divide has been shown in Internet access: poor socioeconomic status, health problems. In terms of health information seeking among Internet users, the divide was not socioeconomic but more related to gender, the health care system utilization, and the diversified use of the Internet. CONCLUSION: In a public health perspective, this study suggests that promoting Internet access and utilization is still necessary in order to make it a widely used tool for prevention and health promotion.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,2008 Apr,France,2008,00
12113445,Social inequalities in health within countries: not only an issue for affluent nations.,"While interest in social disparities in health within affluent nations has been growing, discussion of equity in health with regard to low- and middle-income countries has generally focused on north-south and between-country differences, rather than on gaps between social groups within the countries where most of the world's population lives. This paper aims to articulate a rationale for focusing on within- as well as between-country health disparities in nations of all per capita income levels, and to suggest relevant reference material, particularly for developing country researchers. Routine health information can obscure large inter-group disparities within a country. While appropriately disaggregated routine information is lacking, evidence from special studies reveals significant and in many cases widening disparities in health among more and less privileged social groups within low- and middle- as well as high-income countries: avoidable disparities are observed not only across socioeconomic groups but also by gender, ethnicity, and other markers of underlying social disadvantage. Globally, economic inequalities are widening and, where relevant information is available, generally accompanied by widening or stagnant health inequalities. Related global economic trends, including pressures to cut social spending and compete in global markets, are making it especially difficult for lower-income countries to implement and sustain equitable policies. For all of these reasons, explicit concerns about equity in health and its determinants need to be placed higher on the policy and research agendas of both international and national organizations in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. International agencies can strengthen or undermine national efforts to achieve greater equity. The Primary Health Care strategy is at least as relevant today as it was two decades ago: but equity needs to move from being largely implicit to becoming an explicit component of the strategy, and progress toward greater equity must be carefully monitored in countries of all per capita income levels. Particularly in the context of an increasingly globalized world, improvements in health for privileged groups should suggest what could, with political will, be possible for all.",Social science & medicine (1982),2002 Jun,England,2002,00
15371033,Disqualified for disability pension--a case/referent study.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse medical and other determinants for decisions about rejection or acceptance of applications for disability pension. METHODS: A register-based retrospective case-control study was carried out in the area of a county in mid-Sweden. Cases were all individuals rejected a full disability pension 1999-2000, in all 99 cases. Controls were every tenth person granted a full disability pension during the same period, 198 individuals. Determinants were recorded from the protocols at the Social Insurance Office. RESULTS: Unemployment (OR=7.1, CI=3.1 - 16.4), living in the main municipality, (OR=2.8, CI=1.4 - 5.8) and age below 50 years (OR=0.4, CI=0.2 - 0.8) were determinants for rejection of disability pension. Medical status, as described in the Social Insurance act, had no association with the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: There appear to be variations in praxis of rejection of applicants between Social Insurance boards in different geographical areas due to reasons other than medical. Socio-economic situation of the applicant may have an influence. Established criteria for determining work ability are needed.",Disability and rehabilitation,2004 Sep 16,England,2004,00
15674163,Prevalence and determinants of disabilities and return to work after major trauma.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and determinants of disabilities and return to work after severe injury in a Dutch, Level I trauma center. METHODS: We prospectively included 295 patients with an Injury Severity Score > or = 16 treated between January 1996 and January 1999. All survivors received a mailed questionnaire in 2000, at least 1 year after their initial hospital admission. Health status was measured by the EuroQol-5D instrument, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Additional questions were asked about cognitive functioning and return-to-work rates. Regression analyses was conducted to explore the associations between these functional outcome measures and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 295 patients included, 99 (34%) died in hospital or during follow-up. From the 196 survivors, a response was obtained from 166 (85%). Of the survivors, 33% had to change their work or daily activity as a result of their injuries. Of the 127 patients of working age (18-65 years), 33 (26%) were unable to work and depended on social security. Problems with mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and cognitive ability were found in 34%, 15%, 51%, 58%, 37%, and 57%, respectively. The EuroQol-5D summary score (0.76) was far below that of the general population norms. The number of body areas affected, injury severity (Injury Severity Score > or = 25), and gender (female) were significant independent predictors of worse long-term functional outcome. CONCLUSION: Severe trauma has a substantial impact on long-term functioning. Empiric quantitative data, as presented in this study, enable us to estimate the burden of injury and to evaluate the quality of trauma care programs.",The Journal of trauma,2005 Jan,United States,2005,00
16046371,Cognitive and affective determinants of decisions to attend a group psychosocial support program for women with breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: This prospective study assesses the roles of illness beliefs, emotion regulation factors, and sociodemographic characteristics in decisions to participate in a group support program for women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. METHOD: Women recruited during clinic visits 2 to 4 weeks after diagnosis completed measures of affective and cognitive factors identified by Leventhal's Common-Sense Model of illness self-regulation: cancer-related distress, avoidance tendencies, beliefs that the breast cancer was caused by stress and altered immunity, and personal control beliefs. Measures of general anxiety and depression, social support, and demographic characteristics were also completed; prognostic status information was obtained from medical records. All women were encouraged to participate in a free, 12-week program offering coping skills training and group support. Participation was recorded by program staff. RESULTS: Of the 110 women, 54 (49%) participated in the group support program and 56 (51%) did not. Logistic regression analyses revealed that participation was predicted by stronger beliefs that the cancer was caused by altered immunity, higher cancer-related distress, lower avoidance tendencies, and younger age. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the group psychosocial support program appeared to be guided by cognitive and affective factors identified by the Common-Sense Model. Psychosocial support programs and informational materials promoting their use may attract more participants if they are tailored to focus on resolving cancer-related distress rather than on general anxiety or depression, appeal to those with high avoidance tendencies, address the role of immune function in cancer progression, and meet the needs of older participants.",Psychosomatic medicine,2005 Jul-Aug,United States,2005,00
19041187,Why do we respond so differently? Reviewing determinants of human salivary cortisol responses to challenge.,"Stress and stress-related health impairments are major problems in human life and elucidating the biological pathways linking stress and disease is of substantial importance. However, the identification of mechanisms underlying a dysregulation of major components of the stress response system is, particularly in humans, a very challenging task. Salivary cortisol responses to diverse acute challenge paradigms show large intra- and interindividual variability. In order to uncover mechanisms mediating stress-related disorders and to potentially develop new therapeutic strategies, an extensive phenotyping of HPA axis stress responses is essential. Such a research agenda depends on substantial knowledge of moderating and intervening variables that affect cortisol responses to different stressors and stimuli. The aim of this report is, therefore, to provide a comprehensive summary of important determinants of, in particular, human salivary cortisol responses to different kinds of laboratory stimuli including acute psychosocial stress as well as pharmacological provocation procedures. This overview demonstrates the role of age and gender, endogenous and exogenous sex steroid levels, pregnancy, lactation and breast-feeding, smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption as well as dietary energy supply in salivary cortisol responses to acute stress. Furthermore, it briefly summarizes current knowledge of the role of genetic factors and methodological issues in terms of habituation to repeated psychosocial stress exposures and time of testing as well as psychological factors, that have been shown to be associated with salivary cortisol responses like early life experiences, social factors, psychological interventions, personality as well as acute subjective-psychological stress responses and finally states of chronic stress and psychopathology.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2009 Jan,England,2009,00
18423775,"Changes in out-of-pocket payments for healthcare in Vietnam and its impact on equity in payments, 1992-2002.","BACKGROUND: Economic reforms in Vietnam initiated in the late 1980s included deregulation of the health system resulting in extensive changes in health care delivery, access, and financing. One aspect of the health sector reform was the introduction of user fees at both public and private health facilities, which was in stark contrast to the former socialized system of free medical care. Subsequently, health insurance and free health care cards for the poor were introduced to mitigate the barriers to seeking care and financial burden imposed by out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments as a result of the user fees. OBJECTIVE: To examine the determinants of seeking care and OOP payments as well as the relationship between individual out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures and household ability to pay (ATP) during 1992-2002. DATA: The data are drawn from 1992-93 and 1997-98 Vietnam Living Standard Surveys (VLSS) and 2002 Vietnam Household and Living Standards Survey (VHLSS). METHODS: We use a two-part model where the first part is a probit model that estimates the probability that an individual will seek treatment. The second part is a truncated non-linear regression model that uses ordinary least-squares and fixed effects methods to estimate the determinants of OOP payments that are measured both as absolute as well as relative expenditures. Based on the analysis, we examine the relationship between the predicted shares of individual OOP health payments and household's ATP as well as selected socioeconomic characteristics. RESULTS: Our results indicate that payments increased with increasing ATP, but the consequent financial burden (payment share) decreased with increasing ATP, indicating a regressive system during the first two periods. However, share of payments increased with ATP, indicating a progressive system by 2002. When comparing across years, we find horizontal inequities in all the years that worsened between 1992 and 1998 but improved by 2002. CONCLUSION: The regressivity in payments noted during 1992 and 1998 might be because the rich could avail of health insurance more than those at lower incomes and as a consequence, were able to use the healthcare system more effectively without paying a high OOP payment. In contrast, the poor either incurred higher OOP payments or were discouraged from seeking treatments until their ailment became serious. This inequality becomes exacerbated in 1998 when insurance take-up rates were not high, but the impact of privatization and deregulation was already occurring. By 2002, insurance take-up rates were much higher, and poverty alleviation policies (e.g., free health insurance and health fund membership targeted for the poor) were instituted, which may have resulted in a less regressive system.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2008 Oct,Ireland,2008,00
15456977,[Importance of the modern health management for the success of health reform in Lithuania].,"Reform of the Lithuanian health system is a challenging process. The aim of this article is to assess the role of health managers in the process of health reform, evaluating the perception of health management and their training needs, as the possible determinants for the success of the reform. The results of several questionnaire surveys of Lithuanian health managers, particularly the one carried out in 2002 are used. The studies demonstrate great diversity in the conceptual understanding of health management, with prevailing rational and technical understanding. This might be associated with the rapid structural and organizational changes in the early stages of health reform and insufficient involvement of health managers in the planning and management of changes. General management, health policy, economic and law are considered as the most important study areas for health managers. The major lacking knowledge is in the subjects of law, economics and health financing. Health managers should act as mediators between politicians and health professionals. Enlargement of the area of competences, increasing autonomy in solving problems and meeting of the training needs of health managers is essential.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2004,Switzerland,2004,00
19761083,Can social inclusion policies reduce health inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa?--A rapid policy appraisal.,"The global resurgence of interest in the social determinants of health provides an opportunity for determined action on unacceptable and unjust health inequalities that exist within and between countries. This paper reviews three categories of social inclusion policies: cash-transfers; free social services; and specific institutional arrangements for programme integration in six selected countries--Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe. The policies were appraised as part of the Social Exclusion Knowledge Network (SEKN) set up under the auspices of the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health. The paper highlights the development landscape in sub-Saharan Africa and presents available indicators of the scale of inequity in the six countries. A summary of the policies appraised is presented, including whether or what the impact of these policies has been on health inequalities. Cross-cutting benefits include poverty alleviation, notably among vulnerable children and youths, improved economic opportunities for disadvantaged households, reduction in access barriers to social services, and improved nutrition intake. The impact of these benefits, and hence the policies, on health status can only be inferred. Among the policies reviewed, weaknesses or constraints were in design and implementation. The policy design weaknesses include targeting criteria, their enforcement and latent costs, inadequate participation of the community and failure to take the cultural context into account. A major weakness of most policies was the lack of a monitoring and evaluation system, with clear indicators that incorporate system responsiveness. The policy implementation weaknesses include uneven regional implementation with rural areas worst affected; inadequate or poor administrative and implementation capacity; insufficient resources; problems of fraud and corruption; and lack of involvement of civil servants, exacerbating implementation capacity problems. The key messages to sub-Saharan African governments include: health inequalities must be measured; social policies must be carefully designed and effectively implemented addressing the constraints identified; monitoring and evaluation systems need improvement; and participation of the community needs to be encouraged through conducive and enabling environments. There is a need for a strong movement by civil society to address health inequalities and to hold governments accountable for improved health and reduced health inequalities.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",2009 Aug,Bangladesh,2009,00
11008088,Psychosocial determinants of the onset and escalation of smoking: cross-sectional and prospective findings in multiethnic middle school samples.,"PURPOSE: To investigate a broad range of social influence-related and global determinants of smoking to aid in the design of comprehensive multiethnic interventions by testing the most important factors of initiation and escalation of smoking across various subgroups. METHODS: Cross-sectional (N = 2546) and cohort (N = 736) samples of multiethnic middle school students near a large Southwestern metropolis were surveyed through self-report questionnaires. The confidential questionnaires included information on demographics, risk factors, and smoking behavior and were administered in class by trained data collectors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the statistical significance and strength of the factors. RESULTS: Those lower in self-esteem and higher in social assertiveness appeared to be most at risk for the onset of smoking, whereas those low in optimism appeared to be the most at risk for the escalation of smoking. Attitudes, friends' norms, parents' norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived prevalence were consistent predictors of all smoking status outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral-specific determinants of smoking appear to be important predictors of smoking status outcomes in all demographic subgroups. The relationships of the global determinants were more dependent on the smoking outcome variable and subgroup examined. The findings may serve to help facilitate the targeting of comprehensive interventions aimed at reducing adolescent smoking in multiethnic and ethnic group-specific populations.",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,2000 Oct,United States,2000,00
17980931,Who is willing to pay for long-term care insurance in Catalonia?,"Both public and private insurance for long-term care (LTC) in European countries employed is underdeveloped. However, limited evidence is gathered on the behavioural demand responses to the introduction of insurance schemes expanding insurance coverage. This paper aims at empirically examining the determinants of the ex ante demand for LTC coverage drawing upon an insurance-based WTP referendum approach format. Data is collected from a representative population sample of Catalonia (Spain), before a countrywide funding system was developed. Our findings suggest that (based on our questionnaire format) only one-fifth of the population is willing to pay for LTC coverage though it is a highly elastic product. Ex ante demand for LTC coverage is driven by individual's perceptions of old age disability risk (private information asymmetry) and housing tenure (giving rise to self-insurance), the latter reduces the probability of insurance coverage demand.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2008 Apr,Ireland,2008,00
12038745,Using a participatory approach to provide assistance to community-based organizations: the Seattle Partners Community Research Center.,"Community-based organizations (CBOs), including grassroots, voluntary organizations, are an important part of any strategy for addressing social determinants of health. Because of the challenges faced by CBOs, ""enabling systems"" may be neededto help them survive and fulfill theirmissions, andresearchers have a variety of skills that allow them to play a role in such systems. The potential for researchers to play a role in supporting CBOs led the Seattle Urban Research Center (known as Seattle Partners) to establish a community research center (CRC) as one of its core projects. This article describes the operation of the Seattle Partners CRC and gives examples of how it has worked collaboratively with CBOs in providing technical assistance. The Discussion section draws from the CRC experience to examine the benefits and challenges of collaboration and the trade-off between capacity building and providing direct technical assistance in promoting long-term CBO viability.",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,2002 Jun,United States,2002,00
19370783,Incidence and survival of stomach cancer in a high-risk population of Chile.,"AIM: To study the incidence and survival rate of stomach cancer (SC) and its associated factors in a high risk population in Chile. METHODS: The population-based cancer registry of Valdivia, included in the International Agency for Research on Cancer system, covers 356 396 residents of Valdivia Province, Southern Chile. We studied all SC cases entered in this Registry during 1998-2002 (529 cases). Population data came from the Chilean census (2002). Standardized incidence rates per 100 000 inhabitants (SIR) using the world population, cumulative risk of developing cancer before age 75, and rate ratios by sex, age, ethnicity and social factors were estimated. Relative survival (Ederer II method) and age-standardized estimates (Brenner method) were calculated. Specific survival rates (Kaplan-Meier) were measured at 3 and 5 years and survival curves were analyzed with the Logrank and Breslow tests. Survival was studied in relation to demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory results and medical management of the cases. Those variables significantly associated with survival were later included in a Cox multivariate model. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2002, 529 primary gastric cancers occurred in Valdivia (crude incidence rate 29.2 per 100 000 inhabitants). Most cases were male (69.0%), residents of urban areas (57.5%) and Hispanic (83.2%), with a low education level (84.5% < 8 school years). SC SIR was higher in men than women (40.8 and 14.8 respectively, P < 0.001), risk factors were low education RR 4.4 (95% CI: 2.9-6.8) and 1.6, (95% CI: 1.1-2.1) for women and men respectively and Mapuche ethnicity only significant for women (RR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-3.7). Of all cases, 76.4% were histologically confirmed, 11.5% had a death certificate only (DCO), 56.1% were TNM stage IV; 445 cases (84.1%) were eligible for survival analysis, all completed five years follow-up; 42 remained alive, 392 died of SC and 11 died from other causes. Specific 5-year survival, excluding cases with DCO, was 10.6% (95% CI: 7.7-13.5); 5-year relative survival rate was 12.3% (95% CI: 9.1-16.1), men 10.9% (95% CI: 7.4-15.2) and women 16.1% (95% CI: 9.5-24.5). Five-year specific survival was higher for patients aged < 55 years (17.3%), with intestinal type of cancer (14.6%), without metastasis (22.2%), tumor size < 4 cm (60.0%), without lymphatic invasion (77.1%), only involvement of the mucous membrane (100%). Statistically significant independent prognostic factors were: TNM staging, diffuse type, metastasis, supraclavicular adenopathy, palpable tumor, and hepatitis or ascites. CONCLUSION: Social determinants are the main risk factors for SC, but not for survival. An advanced clinical stage at consultation is the main cause of poor SC survival.",World journal of gastroenterology,2009 Apr 21,United States,2009,00
17029939,Social determinants of access to reference care centres for patients with colorectal cancer--a multilevel analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Although social disparities in survival for patients with cancer are documented in an increasing number of papers, knowledge on the underlying mechanisms concerning screening, diagnosis, treatment or follow-up, is relatively poor. Our study was aimed at investigating the social determinants of access to reference cancer care centres for surgery for colorectal cancer in France. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on population-based data from a specialised cancer registry (County of Calvados, France). The population consisted of 5156 patients with surgical treatment for colorectal cancer recorded between January 1st 1981 and December 31st 2000. RESULTS: The probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was 1.3-fold lower for people living in a deprived district (mean income < 15000 euros) and 3-fold lower for people living in a district where more than 7% of houses were devoid of bath and shower in comparison with districts where this rate was under 2%. After adjustment for distance from reference care centre, the probability of being cared for in a reference care centre was still over one third lower for people living in a district with more than 7% of houses devoid of bath and shower. Social disparities in management of patients with colorectal cancer have increased in the last decade. The reduction of access to reference care with distance was stronger in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a social and geographical determination of type of treatment centre for care management of colorectal cancer in France. Special attention needs to be paid to the high quality of care management in non-specialised care centres in order to avoid an increased social gradient in cancer mortality in France.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2006 Nov,England,2006,00
17008825,"Recent advances in the understanding and treatment of anxiety disorders. Resilience: determinants, measurement, and treatment responsiveness.","In human terms, resilience is an ability to cope with stress and varies with context, time, age, gender, and cultural origin. Resilience shifts the focus of psychological investigation onto increasing the positive rather than reducing the negative. Inquiry into resilience has evolved from descriptions of resilient qualities, to discovery of the process to attain resilience, to uncovering the motivation to reintegrate in a resilient manner. Much of the research on resilience has focused on children in settings such as family violence, extreme poverty, war, and natural disasters. A coherent pattern of characteristics associated with successful adaptation has emerged. Salient characteristics include commitment, dynamism, humor in the face of adversity, patience, optimism, faith, and altruism. As such, resilience may represent an important target of treatment in anxiety, depression, and stress reactions. Resilience can be quantified, but available measures need to be validated transculturally. There exist many possible determinants of resilience, including neurobiologic, genetic, temperament, and environmental influences. Resilience is modifiable on individual and cultural levels. Posttraumatic stress disorder is an example of a serious disorder associated with impaired stress coping that can improve with treatment.",CNS spectrums,2006 Oct,United States,2006,00
15224958,A framework for evaluating safety-net and other community-level factors on access for low-income populations.,"The framework presented in this article extends the Andersen behavioral model of health services utilization research to examine the effects of contextual determinants of access. A conceptual framework is suggested for selecting and constructing contextual (or community-level) variables representing the social, economic, structural, and public policy environment that influence low-income people's use of medical care. Contextual variables capture the characteristics of the population that disproportionately relies on the health care safety net, the public policy support for low-income and safety-net populations, and the structure of the health care market and safety-net services within that market. Until recently, the literature in this area has been largely qualitative and descriptive and few multivariate studies comprehensively investigated the contextual determinants of access. The comprehensive and systematic approach suggested by the framework will enable researchers to strengthen the external validity of results by accounting for the influence of a consistent set of contextual factors across locations and populations. A subsequent article in this issue of Inquiry applies the framework to examine access to ambulatory care for low-income adults, both insured and uninsured.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2004 Spring,United States,2004,00
10916909,A framework for assessing the performance of health systems.,"Health systems vary widely in performance, and countries with similar levels of income, education and health expenditure differ in their ability to attain key health goals. This paper proposes a framework to advance the understanding of health system performance. A first step is to define the boundaries of the health system, based on the concept of health action. Health action is defined as any set of activities whose primary intent is to improve or maintain health. Within these boundaries, the concept of performance is centred around three fundamental goals: improving health, enhancing responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and assuring fairness of financial contribution. Improving health means both increasing the average health status and reducing health inequalities. Responsiveness includes two major components: (a) respect for persons (including dignity, confidentiality and autonomy of individuals and families to decide about their own health); and (b) client orientation (including prompt attention, access to social support networks during care, quality of basic amenities and choice of provider). Fairness of financial contribution means that every household pays a fair share of the total health bill for a country (which may mean that very poor households pay nothing at all). This implies that everyone is protected from financial risks due to health care. The measurement of performance relates goal attainment to the resources available. Variation in performance is a function of the way in which the health system organizes four key functions: stewardship (a broader concept than regulation); financing (including revenue collection, fund pooling and purchasing); service provision (for personal and non-personal health services); and resource generation (including personnel, facilities and knowledge). By investigating these four functions and how they combine, it is possible not only to understand the proximate determinants of health system performance, but also to contemplate major policy challenges.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,2000,Switzerland,2000,00
17181904,Motivation for eating behaviour in adolescent girls: the body beautiful.,"Body dissatisfaction is commonplace for teenage girls and is associated with dieting and unhealthy weight-control behaviours. The idealisation and pursuit of thinness are seen as the main drivers of body dissatisfaction, with the media prominent in setting thin body ideals. Television and consumer magazine production in the UK are extensive, annually releasing 1x10(6) h programming and >3000 magazine titles. Their engagement by adolescent girls is high, and in surveys girls identify thin and revealing body images as influential to the appeal of thinness and their pursuit of dieting. Experimental studies show a short-term impact of these images on body dissatisfaction, especially in teenagers who are already concerned about body image. Magazine images appear more influential than television viewing. For many adolescents selecting thin-image media is purposive, permitting comparison of themselves with the models or celebrities featured. Indeed, the impact of the media needs to be understood within a social context, as engagement is often a highly-social process. Media influence is uneven because of differences in its content and manner of communication, and individual differences in vulnerability to its content. Greater social responsibility on the part of the media and better media literacy by children would be beneficial. For those working in adolescent nutrition it is a reminder that adolescent food choice and intake are subject to many competing, contradictory and non-health-related determinants.",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2006 Nov,England,2006,00

Suicide and transport are the leading causes of injury mortality, and assault, transport and falls the primary causes of injury morbidity. Addressing the complex range of injury problems in disadvantaged Indigenous communities requires considerable work in building or enhancing existing capacity of communities to address local safety issues. Poor data, lack of funding and absence of targeted programs are some of the issues that impede injury prevention activities. Traditional approaches to injury prevention can be used to highlight key areas of need, however adaptations are needed in keeping with Indigenous peoples' holistic approach to health, linked to land and linked to community in order to address the complex spiritual, emotional and social determinants of Indigenous injury.",Injury,2008 Dec,Netherlands,2008,00
17192151,Systematic development of a self-help and motivational enhancement intervention to promote sexual health in HIV-positive men who have sex with men.,"The objective of this study was to describe the application of a systematic process-Intervention Mapping-to developing a theory- and evidence-based intervention to promote sexual health in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Intervention Mapping provides a framework that gives program planners a systematic method for decision-making in each phase of intervention development. In Step 1, we focused on the improvement of two health-promoting behaviors: satisfactory sexual functioning and safer sexual behavior. These behaviors were then linked with selected personal and external determinants, such as attitudes and social support, to produce a set of proximal program objectives. In Step 2, theoretical methods were identified to influence the proximal program objectives and were translated into practical strategies. Although theoretical methods were derived from various theories, self-regulation theory and a cognitive model of behavior change provided the main framework for selecting the intervention methods. The main strategies chosen were bibliotherapy (i.e., the use of written material to help people solve problems or change behavior) and motivational interviewing. In Step 3, the theoretical methods and practical strategies were applied in a program that comprised a self-help guide, a motivational interviewing session and a motivational interviewing telephone call, both delivered by specialist nurses in HIV treatment centers. In Step 4, implementation was anticipated by developing a linkage group to ensure involvement of program users in the planning process and conducting additional research to understand how to implement our program better. In Step 5, program evaluation was anticipated based on the planning process from the previous Intervention Mapping steps.",AIDS patient care and STDs,2006 Dec,United States,2006,00

Using cross-national data and multivariate linear regression analysis, we investigate the determinants of HIV prevalence in low- and middle-income countries. We begin with social and economic variables used in other cross-national studies and then incorporate data on parasitic and infectious diseases endemic in poor populations, which are found to be strongly and significantly correlated with--and are potent predictors of--HIV prevalence. The paper concludes by arguing that treating tropical diseases may be a cost-effective add-on to HIV-prevention and -treatment programs, thus slowing the spread of HIV in disease-burdened populations.",AIDS care,2008 Apr,England,2008,00
11395186,"Weight, physical activity, and smoking as determinants of insulinemia in adolescents.","BACKGROUND: It is known that insulinemia is the result of the interaction among several factors, such as weight, body fat pattern distribution, and physical activity as well as ethnicity. There is little information regarding this question among Mexican adolescents. The association among fasting insulin levels, weight, fat distribution, physical activity, and cigarette smoking was studied in Mexican adolescents. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from 352 Mexican adolescents aged 14-19 years (response rate 41.5%). Fasting insulin levels were measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay; body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist circumference (WC) were determined using standardized techniques, while physical activity was determined by 7-day Stanford physical activity inventory. Cigarette smoking was defined as number of cigarettes/year. RESULTS: Increased BMI and waist circumference, low physical activity, younger age, and non-smoking were associated with high insulin levels. Non-smokers had higher fasting insulin levels compared to smokers (57.8 pmol +/- 1.84 vs. 49.7 pmol/L +/- 2.8; p = 0.034). However, adjusted odds ratio (OR) between insulin and smoking status was not significant. Multivariate analysis showed the following: insulin increased 1.06 pmol/L for each unit of change in BMI; increased 1.02 pmol/L for each unit of change in waist circumference; increased 1.16 pmol/L for non-smoking, and decreased 1.07 pmol/L for each 250 kcal/day of energy expenditure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that Mexican adolescents who are overweight have abdominal fat distribution and physical inactivity, and significant hyperinsulinemia. The relationship between smoking and lower insulinemia found in this research warrants further study.",Archives of medical research,2001 May-Jun,United States,2001,00
19248717,Young women's perceived ability to refuse sex in urban Cameroon.,"In many sub-Saharan African countries, young women face decreasing educational opportunities, age asymmetries between sexual partners, and high prevalence of HIV infection. This study draws upon data from the 2002 Cameroon Adolescent Reproductive Health Survey to analyze the determinants of young women's perceived ability to refuse sex in urban Cameroon. Our findings are consistent with predictions of social exchange theory: young women's status characteristics predict their vulnerability differently under different circumstances, and, overall, young women report having a lower ability to refuse sex in their relationships with men who offer to pay their school fees than in their relationships with men in positions of power over them. The costs and benefits of sexual exchanges made in order to continue one's education increase simultaneously in a context of declining enrollments and spreading HIV infection. When educational aspirations exceed opportunities, policy supporting access to education could reduce young women's need to employ their sexual resources in order to invest in their future.",Studies in family planning,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00

This paper reports the results of a comparative study between in-patients and pathological subjects from the general population. The aim of this work is to evidence the psycho-social determinants of hospitalisation in a psychiatric department for neurotic disorders. METHODS: This study was conducted on a socially fairly privileged population which was, therefore, also fairly homogeneous. The subjects from the two groups were assessed clinically using standardised instruments both for diagnosis (SCAN) and for psycho-social variables (Stressful Life Events: LEDS; Social Support and Self-esteem: Pearlin checklist; care itinerary). RESULTS: Following the analysis of frequency and a multivariate logistic regression analysis, four risk factors for hospitalisation for neurotic disorders were evidenced, including: severity of neurotic disorders, taking a long time to consult a specialist after first onset of anxiety disorders, poor social support, and having experienced one or more provoking agents (Brown and Harris methodology) in the year previous to hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: The severity of the mental pathology is largely responsible for hospitalisation in neurotic patients as it is in psychotic patients, but it is not the only determinant for hospitalisation.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2003 Jun,Germany,2003,00
11971047,What are the determinants of quality of life in people with cervical dystonia?,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the quality of life in patients with cervical dystonia, although pain and depression are relatively common. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that an individual's ability to cope with the disease will modify the association of intrinsic, extrinsic, and disease related factors with quality of life. METHODS: Patients with cervical dystonia diagnosed by a movement disorder specialist were recruited from seven European countries. Data on quality of life (SF-36), measures of coping, and intrinsic, extrinsic, and disease related factors were collected by a self completed postal questionnaire. RESULTS: 289 patients (101 men and 188 women), mean age 55 years, completed the questionnaire. Both physical and mental quality of life scores were predicted by self esteem and self deprecation, educational level, employment status, social support, response to botulinum toxin, disease severity, social participation, stigma, acceptance of illness, anxiety, and depression. In multivariable analyses, the strongest predictors were anxiety and depression. Severe depression was associated with a 19.1 point decrement in the physical summary score (95% confidence interval, -31.7 to -6.6; p = 0.003); however, disease duration and severity remained predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Care for patients with cervical dystonia must not only focus on reducing the severity of the dystonia but also on the psychological wellbeing of the patient. Interventions aimed at treating depression or anxiety, especially of a cognitive nature, may have a large impact on improving quality of life.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2002 May,England,2002,00

26151956,Social Neuroscience: Progress and Implications for Mental Health.,"Social neuroscience is a new, interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding how biological systems implement social processes and behavior. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs and data to inform and refine theories of neural organization and function. We focus here on the progress and potential of social neuroscience in the area of mental health. Research in social neuroscience has grown dramatically in recent years. Among the most active areas of research we found are brain-imaging studies in normal children and adults; animal models of social behavior; studies of stroke patients; imaging studies of psychiatric patients; and research on social determinants of peripheral neural, neuroendocrine, and immunological processes. We also found that these areas of research are proceeding along largely independent trajectories. Our goals in this article are to review the development of this field, examine some currently promising approaches, identify obstacles and opportunities for future advances and integration, and consider how this research can inform work on the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.",Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science,2007 Jun,United States,2007,00
12617359,Aggregate Health Status: a benchmark index for community health.,"A qualitative review of population health assessment models used throughout the United States and Canada indicate both individual and community-level domains of health. Individual-level domains of health include health habits, education, public safety, environment, social, government, culture, and mobility. Community-level domains include the same general health domains but aggregated to the community level Aggregate Health Status (AHS). In the development of the AHS portion of our model, the dependent variable was the general health question from the Medical Outcomes Study. The remainder of the survey was partitioned into mutually exclusive individual measure subsets. A linear combination of these global variables then produces a single estimate relating the multiple domains of the broader determinants of health to health status. This global variable uniquely discriminates between the five categories of general health. This model serves as a framework and benchmark indicator that (1) provides a summary indicator of the overall health status of the population, (2) is broadly representative of populations rather than individuals, (3) is a population perspective rather than a provider perspective, and (4) emphasizes outcomes versus inputs and processes.",Journal of medical systems,2003 Apr,United States,2003,00
19288983,"Communication inequalities, social determinants, and intermittent smoking in the 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey.","INTRODUCTION: Intermittent smokers account for a large proportion of all smokers, and this trend is increasing. Social and communication inequalities may account for disparities in intermittent smoking status. METHODS: Data for this study came from 2,641 ever-smokers from a 2003 nationally representative cross-sectional survey. Independent variables of interest included race/ethnicity, sex, household income, education, health media attention, and cancer-related beliefs. The outcome of interest was smoking status categorized as daily smoker, intermittent smoker, or former smoker. Analyses used 2 sets of multivariable logistic regressions to investigate the associations of covariates with intermittent smokers compared with former smokers and with daily smokers. RESULTS: People with high education and high income, Spanish-speaking Hispanics, and women were the most likely to be intermittent rather than daily smokers. Women and Spanish-speaking Hispanics were the most likely to be intermittent rather than former smokers. Attention to health media sources increased the likelihood that a person would be an intermittent smoker instead of a former or daily smoker. Believing that damage from smoking is avoidable and irreversible was associated with lower odds of being an intermittent smoker rather than a former smoker but did not differentiate intermittent smoking from daily smoking. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that tailoring smoking-cessation campaigns toward intermittent smokers from specific demographic groups by using health media may improve the effect of these campaigns and reduce social health disparities.",Preventing chronic disease,2009 Apr,United States,2009,00

19436534,Social paediatrics and early child development: Part 1.,"Diseases of modernism, rather than infectious diseases and chronic medical conditions, increasingly cause childhood morbidity and mortality. Thus, the goal of enhancing life outcomes for all children has become imperative. Paediatricans may begin with a renewed interest in social paediatrics - the care of the disadvantaged child in Canada, requiring a focus on all the complex factors that impact families and the community. New paediatricians need the tools to impact both social determinants of health and political policies to support health for all. Such interest is as old as the field of paediatrics (social medicine began with the great pathologist, Virchow, in the 1800s). The new neuroscience of experience-based brain and biological development has caught up with the social epidemiology literature. It is now known from both domains that a child's poor developmental and health outcomes are a product of early and ongoing socioeconomic and psychological experiences. In the era of epigenetics, it is now understood that both nature and nurture control the genome. Future paediatricians need to understand the science of experience-based brain development, and the interventions demonstrated to improve life trajectories.

11767823,Individualism-collectivism and personality.,"This paper provides a review of the main findings concerning the relationship between the cultural syndromes of individualism and collectivism and personality. People in collectivist cultures, compared to people in individualist cultures, are likely to define themselves as aspects of groups, to give priority to in-group goals, to focus on context more than the content in making attributions and in communicating, to pay less attention to internal than to external processes as determinants of social behavior, to define most relationships with ingroup members as communal, to make more situational attributions, and tend to be self-effacing.",Journal of personality,2001 Dec,United States,2001,00
17612422,Determinants of mild-to-moderate malnutrition in preschoolers in an urban area of Northeastern Brazil: a hierarchical approach.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of mild-to-moderate malnutrition in preschoolers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study conducted in October and November 1996, with a representative sample of 1740 children less than 5 years old from the city of Salvador, situated in the Brazilian Northeastern region. Socio-economic and dietary data were collected through a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measures were performed in duplicate and data analysis was based upon the hierarchical model approach. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the prevalence ratio and to identify the determinants of mild-to-moderate deficits in weight-for-age and height-for-age Z-scores. RESULTS: Family monthly income under US$67.00 per capita and family headed by a woman were the main basic determinants of mild-to-moderate weight-for-age and height-for-age deficits in the studied children. Household agglomeration, an underlying determinant, was associated with weight-for-age and height-for-age deficits. Among the immediate determinants, age above 6 months and dietary caloric availability in the lowest tertile (<930 kcal day-1) were also associated with weight-for-age deficits. In addition to these, hospitalisation in the 12 months preceding the interview was shown to be a predictor of mild-to-moderate weight-for-age and height-for-age deficits. CONCLUSION: Adverse social and economic factors interact with family environmental factors to define food consumption and morbidity patterns that culminate in a high prevalence of mild-to-moderate malnutrition. The strengthening and restructuring of nutrition and healthcare actions, the definition of public policies that improve family income, and the adequate insertion of women in the labour market are possible strategies to reduce mild-to-moderate malnutrition and to sustain the decline already observed in severe malnutrition.",Public health nutrition,2008 Apr,England,2008,00

As a considerable amount of research has demonstrated that collective actions may be established with a greater degree of ease in communities with well-accumulated social factors, we can promote collective actions of Health Promotion activities through the concept of Social Capital and thereby establish more effective intervention. It is to be expected that theoretical research and operational experience using Social Capital may contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of Health Promotion activities, improving various health determinants through collective action.",[Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health,2006 Jul,Japan,2006,00
18693373,Social determinants and polio 'endgame': a qualitative study in high risk districts of India.,"OBJECTIVES: To understand the perceptions and likely determinants that facilitate or act as barriers in implementing additional strategies for polio eradication: (a) accelerated delivery of mOPV1 (monovalent polio vaccine type 1); (b) use of IPV (inactivated polio vaccine); and (c) provision of incentives. DESIGN: QUALITATIVE. Rapid appraisal procedures (RAP) were adopted to derive the reality by synthesizing multiple sources of information; search for opinions, motivations, behaviors and attitudes of key stakeholders within their organizational and socio-cultural matrix. SETTING: Two districts of Uttar Pradesh - Moradabad and J P Nagar. SUBJECTS: Total 244 interactions were conducted; 33 interviews and 4 focussed group discussions (FGD) conducted with providers; 33 mothers (<5 years) and 10 leaders were interviewed; 8 FGD were conducted with mothers of under-fives. Informal interactions (156) were also conducted with village pradhans, religious leaders, parents, businessmen, journalists (Hindi and Urdu media), mobilizers, vaccinators and supervisors. RESULTS: Providers expressed reservation regarding accelerated rounds of OPV; scientific rationale of accelerated rounds is not clear to parents and leaders. Although technical advantages of introducing IPV exist, issues of logistical difficulties and injection safety emerged strongly. Providers and communities indicated a clear 'no' to the cash incentives but argued for developmental issues. Resistance to the program has declined over time but still the program is perceived as the ""government's need, not ours"". CONCLUSION: The polio eradication program is critically poised, an opportunity to intensify efforts for reducing inequities in health services and improve access of all children to the PHC services. Ongoing dialogue with local communities and strong political commitment would be essential to translate the technological innovations into a sustainable program.",Indian pediatrics,2008 May,India,2008,00
19684945,"Determinant factors of toothache in 8- and 9-year-old schoolchildren, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.","A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence, severity and impact of toothache among schoolchildren associated with socio-demographic variables (gender, degree of maternal schooling, economic group, and oral health status). Six hundred and one 8- and 9-year-old children were randomly selected from schools in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. After formal authorization was obtained from their parents, the children were interviewed and clinically examined by a single examiner. The Chi squared test was applied and the odds ratio obtained. The prevalence of toothache was 45.9% (276/601), of which 15.6% (94/601) had occurred during the previous month. Among the children who had experienced pain, 39.4% (109/276) classified its severity as intense or very intense. Nearly 35% (96/276) were awoken by the pain, and 63.8% (176/276) were unable to carry out daily tasks as a result. The prevalence of pain was greater among children from less privileged economic groups, in which the mothers' level of schooling was lower (0-7 years of formal study) and who showed poorer conditions of oral health, determined by the presence of dental and periodontal pathology (p <or= 0.05). Gender did not influence either the experience of toothache or its severity and impact. The prevalence of toothache found in the age group between 8 and 9 years is very high and associated to social determinants and poorer conditions of oral health.",Brazilian oral research,2009 Apr-Jun,Brazil,2009,00
16682869,Socio-cultural and cognitive predictors of eating disorder symptoms in young girls.,"There is some evidence for a relationship between socio-cultural variables and the development of disordered eating or concerns. However, the role of individual cognition in adding to this relationship has not yet been investigated. The current study therefore had two main questions. Firstly, which of the socio-cultural factors investigated (parental, peers and the media) predict girls' eating disorder related symptoms? Secondly, do individuals' cognitions add to this prediction? Thirty-eight girls participated in the study. They completed the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), Eating Disorder Belief Questionnaire (EDBQ), measures of parental, peer and media influence, and a measure of their awareness and internalisation of societal standards of attractiveness. The results indicated that several of the socio-cultural factors were related to girls' EAT score. The belief that being thinner would make boys like them more was the most significant predictor in the whole sample (and in younger girls). Individual cognitions added significantly to this prediction in the whole sample but not in the younger girls. For older girls, the importance of magazines as a source of information about beauty and ideals was the strongest predictor of EAT score, and their cognitions added significantly to this prediction. It is concluded that peer and media influences are important determinants of girls' eating disorder related symptoms. However, individual cognitions add to this relationship, particularly in older girls. The implications and limitations of the study are discussed.",Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2005 Dec,Germany,2005,00

14624964,Determinants of alcohol use in pregnant women at risk for alcohol consumption.,"The purpose of this investigation was to identify determinants of alcohol consumption based on a number of demographic and psychosocial variables in a group of pregnant women at risk for alcohol consumption. Data were collected on a sample of 232 pregnant females who agreed to participant in a multistate alcohol prevention intervention. The variables of interest included demographic measures of race, age, education, marital status, health status, employment status and if they had been involved in physical abuse during the past year. Additionally, psychosocial variables were collected on social support, family functioning, mental health and illicit drug use. The dependent variables of interest were any alcohol use during the pregnancy and an abuse measure that was based on a composite score generated from questions related to problems associated with alcohol behavior. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to see if the independent variables (demographic and psychosocial variables) were predictive of any alcohol use. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to ascertain if the independent measures were predictive of alcohol abuse. The results showed that race, age, physical abuse and to a lesser extent health were associated to any alcohol use and alcohol abuse. The findings with the psychosocial variables were not as robust. Nevertheless, problematic psychiatric and drug use composite scores were associated with alcohol abuse.",Neurotoxicology and teratology,2003 Nov-Dec,United States,2003,00
15662576,Junior physicians' workplace experiences in clinical fields in German-speaking Switzerland.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To date, there have been several prospective cohort studies investigating the workplace experiences of junior physicians, but with limited focus on gender issues. The objective of the present study is to explore the workplace experiences of first-year residents according to gender, type of training hospital, and clinical field. METHODS: Data reported are from the second assessment of the longitudinal Swiss physicians' career development study, begun in 2001. In 2003, 497 residents (54.7% females, 45.3% males) assessed their workplace conditions, social support at work, and effort-reward imbalance. RESULTS: There are few, but relevant, gender related differences in workplace experiences, with female physicians experiencing less mentoring and higher over-commitment, yet more positive social relationships at work. In a multivariate model, significant differences in some workplace variables with regard to type of training hospital and/or clinical field are found: workplace conditions are rated worse in type ""A"" hospitals (university and cantonal hospitals) than in type ""B""/""C""/""D"" hospitals (regional hospitals and highly specialised units), and in surgical fields than in internal medicine. In ""A"" hospitals mentoring is assessed as better, but positive social relationships as worse. Both scales are rated worse in surgical fields than in internal medicine. The effort-reward imbalance (ERI) is rated significantly higher (unfavourable) in ""A"" hospitals than in ""B""/""C""/""D"" hospitals, regardless of gender and clinical field. Significantly more subjects with an ERI quotient above 1 (which is unfavourable) work in ""A"" hospitals, and in surgical fields regardless of hospital type. Of the total sample, 81 subjects (16.3%), 41 males and 40 females, show an ERI quotient above 1. The greater the workload, the worse the rating of workplace conditions, effort-reward imbalance, and over-commitment. CONCLUSION: Institutional determinants are crucial factors for the workplace experiences and first career steps of junior physicians. Medical educators, especially those in ""A"" hospitals, should become more involved in structured residency programs and be aware of potential gender inequalities in the career support of female physicians.",Swiss medical weekly,2005 Jan 8,Switzerland,2005,00
16650342,Sex differences in subclinical and DSM-IV pathological gambling: results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.,"BACKGROUND: To examine sex differences in DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling in nationally representative data of the US population. METHOD: Data come from a large (n = 43093) representative sample of the adult US population. RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence rate of DSM-IV pathological gambling was 0.64% (95% CI 0.50-0.78) for men and 0.23% (95% CI 0.17-0.29) for women, whereas the lifetime prevalence of subclinical pathological gambling was 6.79% (95% CI 6.32-7.26) for men and 3.26% (95% CI 2.93-3.59) for women. For subclinical pathological gambling, men were significantly (p < 0.01) more likely than women to have smoked more than two packs of cigarettes a day, to be classified as heavy drinkers and to have lifetime diagnoses of alcohol and drug use disorders. Women with subclinical and pathological gambling were significantly more likely than men to have lifetime mood and anxiety disorders. With respect to pathological gambling, women had later ages of onset of the disorder, and were significantly more likely than men to report gambling to relieve depressed mood and to prefer casino gambling. Rates of treatment-seeking for DSM-IV pathological gambling were low for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: There are important sex differences in the prevalence, symptom pattern, sociodemographic and clinical correlates and course of DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling. Results underscore the need to investigate sex differences in the social determinants, neurobiology and treatment response of DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling.",Psychological medicine,2006 Jul,England,2006,00

This study aimed to examine the relative contributions of both proximal and distal risk factors on child cognitive development, by breaking down the possible causal pathways through which poverty affects cognition. METHODS: This cohort study collected data on family socioeconomic status, household and neighbourhood environmental conditions, child health and nutritional status, psychosocial stimulation and nursery school attendance. The effect of these on Wechsler Pre-School and Primary Scale of Intelligence scores at five years of age was investigated using a multivariable hierarchical analysis, guided by the proposed conceptual framework. RESULTS: Unfavourable socioeconomic conditions, poorly educated mother, absent father, poor sanitary conditions at home and in the neighbourhood and low birth weight were negatively associated with cognitive performance at five years of age, while strong positive associations were found with high levels of domestic stimulation and nursery school attendance. CONCLUSION: Children's cognitive development in urban contexts in developing countries could be substantially increased by interventions promoting early psychosocial stimulation and preschool experience, together with efforts to prevent low birth weight and promote adequate nutritional status.",BMC public health,2008 Jun 6,England,2008,00
10719008,Optimizing economic outcomes in antibiotic therapy of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.,"The social, medical and economic effects of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on individual patients and the resource implications of this disease for the healthcare sector are considerable. Optimizing the selection of patients who should receive antibiotics according to stringent clinical criteria is the first step in promoting good clinical practice and cost-effectiveness. Antibiotic efficacy is then the major driver of cost, especially when it reduces the need for hospitalization. Resistance to first-line antibiotics can be expected to increase the risk of treatment failure. Other drivers of cost include non-compliance, which predisposes to therapeutic failure, and the selection of resistant strains. Treatment regimens of short duration, once-daily dosing and good tolerability are determinants of good compliance and cost savings. The expenses of first-line antibiotics typically account for only a small proportion of the overall costs of healthcare and the cheapest antibiotics are not necessarily the most cost-effective. The clinical success rate of first-line therapy is the primary determinant of the overall expenditure on healthcare because of the high costs associated with treatment failure, especially if it leads to hospitalization. Factors such as poor patient compliance and high antibiotic resistance rates, which undermine the clinical efficacies of first-line therapy, will increase the overall costs of treatment.",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2000 Mar,England,2000,00

16212995,Meeting the information needs of the 'Health for all' challenge--lessons from Scotland.,"OBJECTIVE: To create a public health data resource for Scotland that is based on a socio-ecological model of the determinants of health and would, therefore, meets the needs of the emerging public health agenda. DESIGN: Action research, in which the approach moved logically through stages of action (conception, feasibility study, pilot projects, leading to a national set of integrated health and well-being profiles). Each stage built on the results of the previous research. RESULTS: The conceptual stage identified the need for an approach to public health data that kept pace with the increasingly accepted socio-ecological models of the determinants of health. A feasibility study concluded that sufficient data were available to populate the health fields that represented the important determinants of health. At this time strengths and weakness in data were defined. This led to the articulation of a 'vision' for integrated public heath data in Scotland that was the subject of a wide consultation. Pilot studies provided local stakeholders with imaginatively presented data (on population demographics, health and function, behaviour, social environment, economy, physical environment, morbidity and mortality) for their local communities. The response to these was so positive that a demand was created for a comprehensive set of 'community profiles'. These, in addition to parliamentary constituency profiles, have now been created and widely disseminated. CONCLUSIONS: It has been possible, despite many difficulties, to develop approaches to public health information that are informed by the socio-ecological model of health and create outputs that represent a significant advance on previous approaches to public health data. This is a work in progress and many issues remain unresolved. Interaction with others engaged in parallel tasks will facilitate the next steps.",Public health,2005 Dec,Netherlands,2005,00

From intervention of quality of life].,"Effectiveness of outputs of a qualified intervention can be valued by several positive criteria corresponding to the ""quality of life"" conception, which is based on the feeling of the health and contentment. The finding that great differences in the income among different social groups in conditions of the liberal market society correlate with several health and social problems brought about to the hypothesis that the decrease of the differences in the income, accompanied by strengthening of various forms of the social cohesion, civic solidarity, legitimate equality, and ethical justice may substantially improve the health status of the population. The hypothesis has been verified in many epidemiological studies and found to be valid enough for the health policy and far-seeing economy. Analytics of the World Bank recommend to governments primary invest into the health of socially week groups in order to decrease their poverty and to keep social conciliation. World Health Organization (WHO) sets in its new program for Europe called ""21 Goals for the 21st Century"" that differences in the health status among the European states should diminish till 2020 by one third and within the countries by one quarter at least.

The inquiry relied on Gadamerian hermeneutic and feminist philosophical thought and was situated in women's health. In a feminist understanding of women's health, experiences of health are inseparable from the everyday experiences of an embodied life and are constituted within each woman's social, material, and discursive realities.The study was informed by conversations with 15 women who self-identified as lesbian for the purpose of the inquiry, accounts of women in the media, and the researcher's reflective journals.

A more theoretically based multilevel approach to diabetes, outlined for the 21st century, has an almost exclusive downstream curative focus, that ranges from midstream preventive programmes to upstream healthy public policy.","Lancet (London, England)",2000 Aug 26,England,2000,00
16352513,No man's land: gender bias and social constructivism in the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.,"The literature on borderline personality disorder (BPD), including its epidemiology, biology, phenomenology, causes, correlates, consequences, costs, treatments, and outcomes is vast. Thousands of articles and books have been published. Because the true prevalence of BPD by sex (gender) in the general population is still unknown, the important question of why women, rather than men, are more frequently diagnosed with BPD remains largely unanswered-despite current evidence for the origin of personality disorder in genetics and neurobiology, and despite recent suggestions that biased sampling is the most likely explanation for gender bias in the diagnosis of BPD. This paper reviews selected literature on (a) the epidemiology of BPD, (b) gender bias in the diagnosis of BPD, and (c) the social construction of diagnosis, particularly the diagnostic entity labeled ""Borderline Personality Disorder."" It attempts a synthesis of diverse, multidisciplinary literature to address the question of why women outnumber men by a ratio of 3:1 in the diagnosis of BPD. It rests on assumptions that (a) to varying degrees sociocultural factors inevitably play a role in the expression of disease conditions, and that (b) personality disorders, including BPD, have cultural histories. It also rests on the belief, for which there is considerable scholarly support, that the phenomenon called BPD has multiple, complex, interactive, biological, psychological, and constructed sociocultural determinants. Nurses must understand the phenomenon at this level of complexity to provide appropriate care.",Issues in mental health nursing,2006 Jan,England,2006,00

18186918,"Can microcredit help improve the health of poor women? Some findings from a cross-sectional study in Kerala, India.","BACKGROUND: This study examines associations between female participation in a microcredit program in India, known as self help groups (SHGs), and women's health in the south Indian state of Kerala. Because SHGs do not have a formal health program, this provides a unique opportunity to assess whether SHG participation influences women's health via the social determinants of health. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used special survey data collected in 2003 from one Panchayat (territorial decentralized unit). Information was collected on women's characteristics, health determinants (exclusion to health care, exposure to health risks, decision-making agency), and health achievements (self assessed health, markers of mental health). The study sample included 928 non elderly poor women. RESULTS: The primary finding is that compared to non-participants living in a household without a SHG member, the odds of facing exclusion is significantly lower among early joiners, women who were members for more than 2 years (OR = 0.58, CI = 0.41-0.80), late joiners, members for 2 years and less (OR = 0.60, CI = 0.39-0.94), and non-participants who live in a household with a SHG member (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.32-0.90). We also found that after controlling for key women's characteristics, early joiners of a SHG are less likely to report emotional stress and poor life satisfaction compared to non-members (OR = 0.52, CI = 0.30-0.93; OR = 0.32, CI = 0.14-0.71). No associations were found between SHG participation and self assessed health or exposure to health risks. The relationship between SHG participation and decision-making agency is unclear. CONCLUSION: Microcredit is not a panacea, but could help to improve the health of poor women by addressing certain issues relevant to the context. In Kerala, SHG participation can help protect poor women against exclusion to health care and possibly aid in promoting their mental health.",International journal for equity in health,2008 Jan 10,England,2008,00

This study examined the frequency and socio-demographic and clinical correlates of BZD prescription in Hong Kong (HK) and Beijing (BJ), China. METHODS: Five hundred and five clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly selected and interviewed in HK and BJ using standardized assessment instruments. Basic socio-demographic and clinical data and psychotropic drug prescriptions were collected at the time of a diagnostic interview. RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty one (29.9%) patients were prescribed BZDs in the whole sample; 25.1% and 34.8% of the HK and BJ samples, respectively. Use of BZDs was associated with sex, employment status, history of suicide, less use of clozapine, more frequent use of typical antipsychotics (APs), higher doses of APs, severity of positive symptoms, extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and insomnia. In multiple logistic regression analysis, severity of depressive symptoms, study site, sex, employment status, less use of clozapine and history of suicide remained significantly associated with BZDs. CONCLUSION: Although the ethnic and clinical characteristics of the two samples were nearly identical, there was a wide variation in the frequency of BZD prescriptions between HK and BJ suggesting that socio-cultural and economic factors as well as traditions of psychiatric training and practice all played a role in determining the use of BZDs. Prescription of BZDs in either site was not in line with current recommendation.",Pharmacopsychiatry,2007 Nov,Germany,2007,00

19782010,Decomposing body mass index gaps between Mediterranean countries: a counterfactual quantile regression analysis.,"Wide cross-country variation in obesity rates has been reported between European Union member states. Although the existing cross-country differences have not been analyzed in depth, they contain important information on health production determinants. In this paper we apply a methodology for conducting standardized cross-country comparisons of body mass index (BMI). We draw on estimations of the marginal density function of BMI for Italy and Spain in 2003, two countries with similar GDP and socio-economic conditions. We produce different counterfactual distribution estimates using covariates (health production inputs) specified in a quantile regression. Our findings suggest that Spain-to-Italy BMI gaps among females are largely explained by cross-country variation in the returns to each covariate, especially for younger women. We find that adverse underlying determinants do not explain the gap observed in particular between younger Spanish females and their Italian counterfactuals; behavioural differences appear to be the key. We tentatively conclude that Spanish policy on obesity should target mainly younger females.",Economics and human biology,2009 Dec,Netherlands,2009,00

The analysis finds that women who work in more collectivized environments have fewer children and are more likely to use modern contraception than women who work in more individualized milieus and those who do not work outside the home. Most of these differences persist in multivariate tests. It is argued that collectivized work environments are most conducive to diffusion and legitimation of reproductive innovations. In contrast, individualized environments tend to isolate women and therefore may retard their acceptance of innovative fertility-related behaviour.",Journal of biosocial science,2000 Jan,England,2000,00

AIMS: To investigate the discharge of patients from public psychiatric hospitals. METHODS: A total of 4492 patients from 22 psychiatric hospitals were described at recruitment and followed during the period 1994-2000. Their characteristics were investigated as determinants of discharge to community residential facilities for psychiatric patients versus other settings. RESULTS: All 22 psychiatric hospitals closed between 1994 and 2000; 678 patients had died, and the remainder were discharged. Of these, 39% went to nursing homes, 29% to community residential facilities for psychiatric patients, 2% joined their family, less than 1% were settled in private independent accommodation, and 29% remained in the psychiatric hospital, although defined as discharged. Ten patients were recorded as missing when still in the psychiatric hospitals, none after discharge. Younger, more educated patients and patients from two of the four regions studied were more likely to be discharged to community residential facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients were discharged to highly supervised settings. The potential risk of abandonment due to deinstitutionalization was not observed in this population. The wide use of highly supervised settings can be explained by the patients' old age, but different local policies may have affected the discharge process.",The International journal of social psychiatry,2003 Mar,England,2003,00
17175839,Serious crisis in the practice of international health by the World Health Organization: the Commission on Social Determinants of Health.,"The Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) is the latest effort by the World Health Organization to improve health and narrow health inequalities through action on social determinants. The CSDH does not note that much work has already been done in this direction, does not make a sufficient attempt to analyze why earlier efforts failed to yield the desired results, and does not seem to have devised approaches to ensure that it will be more successful this time. The CSDH intends to complement the work of the earlier WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which has not had the desired impact, and it is unclear how the CSDH can complement work that suffers from such serious infirmities. Inadequacies of both commissions reflect a crisis in the practice of international health at the WHO, stemming from a combination of unsatisfactory administrative practices and lack of technical competence to provide insights into the problems afflicting the most needy countries. Often the WHO has ended up distorting the rudimentary health systems of the poor countries, by pressuring them into accepting health policies, plans, and programs that lack sound scientific bases. The WHO no longer seems to take into account historical and political factors when it sets out to improve the health situation in low-income countries--which is supposed to be the focus of the CSDH. An alternative approach is suggested.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2006,United States,2006,00
11404202,Skin signs of sexually transmitted diseases in adolescents.,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) continue to be a significant and prevalent problem among adolescents. One in four sexually active teenagers are infected with one or more STDs. Certain STDs, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and possibly human papillomavirus infections have the highest prevalence in this age group. The determinants of risk for STDs in adolescence encompass a range of behavioral, biological, and social factors. This review focuses on the skin signs of STDs in adolescents. Recognition of these findings is important since they may represent the most prominent, earliest, or only evidence of an STD. The recognition of the non-AIDs STDs has the added importance of identifying a population at high risk for HIV infection. Although recent data suggest encouraging trends in sexual risk behaviors among high school students in the United States, great challenges remain in the efforts to expand primary and secondary prevention strategies for STDs in adolescents. Expertise in the recognition and treatment of STDs in adolescents remains important for clinicians who care for adolescents.","Adolescent medicine (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2001 Jun,United States,2001,00
12008990,Home and eating environments are associated with saturated fat intake in children in rural West Virginia.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe sociodemographic, environmental, and knowledge factors in relation to self-reported, energy-adjusted saturated fat consumption among children in rural West Virginia. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred twenty-five 5th graders who participated in the Coronary Artery Risk Detection in Appalachian Communities Project conducted in 3 rural counties in West Virginia in 1998-1999. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey based on self-reported information collected using a food frequency questionnaire, a nutrition knowledge questionnaire, and a family composition questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean percentage of energy from total fat was 31.8% +/- 4.9 and from saturated fat was 11.8% +/- 2.3. Energy-adjusted saturated fat intake was significantly higher among children with higher frequencies of breakfast and late-night snacks prepared away from home, and in households with single mothers. Variables associated with higher energy-adjusted saturated fat intake with marginal statistical significance (P=.05-.10) included attendance at schools with a higher percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch, usual breakfast location other than home or school, and less knowledge about low-fat, low-sodium foods. Frequent late-night snacks prepared away from home and living with single mothers remained as significant correlates of energy-adjusted saturated fat intake independent of other hypothesized determinants. CONCLUSION: Efforts to reduce saturated fat intake among children in rural areas should focus on food prepared away from home. Nutrition-related behaviors of single mothers should be explored further.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,2002 May,United States,2002,00
20024726,Social-cognitive determinants of condom use in a cohort of young gay and bisexual men.,"The aim of this prospective study was to identify relevant determinants of young gay and bisexual men's (YGBM) condom use when having anal sex with casual partners. Respondents (185 YGBM in the midst of their coming-out; mean age 18.9 years) completed an online questionnaire on social-cognitive determinants of condoms use derived from the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) at Wave 1. At six months follow-up (Wave 2) sexual behavior with casual partners was assessed. A total of 63 YGBM reported sex with a casual partner in the six months between Waves 1 and 2, of whom 49% (N=31) had anal sex. Of the YGBM who had anal sex, 42% (N=13) had unprotected anal sex. Condom use with casual partners was best predicted by the intention to always use condoms. Furthermore, attitude, descriptive and personal norms, and perceived control significantly predicted intention to always use condoms. Interventions, targeting YGBM, aiming to promote condom use with casual partners should focus on increasing attitudes and strengthening skills to negotiate and use condoms.",AIDS care,2009 Nov,England,2009,00
12965967,Measuring and improving the quality of dying and death.,"Improving end-of-life experience is a major challenge to successful aging. Deaths that are reasonably free of discomfort, in accordance with patients' wishes, and within acceptable professional and ethical standards are high-quality deaths. The authors developed a 31-item measure of the quality of dying and death and applied it in a community sample and a sample of hospice enrollees. Scores on the Quality of Dying and Death Instrument and measures of perceived quality of care were collected from patients' loved ones after death. Higher overall after-death ratings of the quality of care received from all providers and from physicians were associated with higher-quality dying and death. How well patients' symptoms were controlled in the community study and how well wishes were followed and treatments were explained in the hospice study were associated with higher-quality dying. Major challenges to end-of-life research include recruiting representative population samples, given widespread reluctance of patients and loved ones to participate in research at the end of life; important variation in evaluations among different reporters after death; reluctance of loved ones to assign negative evaluations to dying experiences after death; and the highly individual and dynamic nature of dying experiences. Overcoming these challenges is of great importance in the search for the social, organizational, and individual determinants of high-quality dying in the U.S. cultural and health care context.",Annals of internal medicine,2003 Sep 2,United States,2003,00
18700052,Environmental determinants of healthy eating: in need of theory and evidence.,"In order to promote healthful nutrition, insight is needed into the determinants of nutrition behaviours. Behavioural determinant research and behavioural nutrition interventions have focused mostly on individual-level motivational factors. It has been argued that the individual's socio-cultural and physical environments may be the main determinants of nutrition behaviours. However, the theoretical basis and empirical evidence for environmental determinants of nutrition behaviours are not strong. The present paper is a narrative review informed by a series of systematic reviews and recent original studies on associations between environmental factors and nutrition behaviours to provide an overview and discussion of the evidence for environmental correlates and predictors of nutrition behaviour. Although the number of studies on potential environmental determinants of nutrition behaviours has increased steeply over the last decades, they include only a few well-designed studies with validated measures and guided by sound theoretical frameworks. The preliminary evidence from the available systematic reviews indicates that socio-cultural environmental factors defining what is socially acceptable, desirable and appropriate to eat may be more important for healthful eating than physical environments that define the availability and accessibility of foods. It is concluded that there is a lack of well-designed studies on environmental determinants of healthful eating behaviours. Preliminary evidence indicates that social environmental factors may be more important than physical environmental factors for healthful eating. Better-designed studies are needed to further build evidence-based theory on environmental determinants to guide the development of interventions to promote healthful eating.",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2008 Aug,England,2008,00
14960428,The use of Chinese herbal medicines and their correlates in Chinese older adults: the Singapore Chinese Longitudinal Aging Study.,"BACKGROUND: There are very few studies of the use of Chinese herbal medicine and their psychosocial and health-related determinants in older adults. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of use of Chinese herbal medicine in community-living Chinese older adults in Singapore and its associations with socio-economic status, social support, health behaviour, health and functional status. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of baseline data from a longitudinal cohort study of old adults (Singapore Chinese Longitudinal Aging Study). SETTING: Community of Toa Payoh in Singapore (total population 22800 out of 3 million). PARTICIPANTS: community residents comprising 2010 Chinese older adults aged 65 years and above. MEASUREMENTS: participants completed a questionnaire on Chinese herbal medicine use and other information on psychosocial and health-related variables. RESULTS: The use of Chinese herbal medicine over the past year was reported by 25.3% of the subjects, among whom 52% reported concurrent use of Western prescription medications. Significant factors that were strongly and independently associated with Chinese herbal medicine use were limited to extensive social support (OR = 2.66-5.56), current smoking (OR = 1.35), regular taiqi (OR = 1.94), arthritis (OR = 2.36), cancer (OR = 3.15), hypnotic use (OR = 2.08), IADL disability (OR = 1.72) and poor treatment compliance (OR = 2.35). CONCLUSION: Positive and negative psychosocial and health-related factors determine the use of Chinese herbal medicine use in Chinese older adults, consistent with the dual-pattern use of Chinese herbal medicine as health supplement and complementary/alternative medicine.",Age and ageing,2004 Mar,England,2004,00
19539415,Gender asymmetry in healthcare-facility attendance of people living with HIV/AIDS in Burkina Faso.,"Anthropological research in Burkina Faso indicates that more HIV-positive women than HIV-positive men are attending care facilities for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and accessing antiretroviral medicine. This article, situated in the field of study of interactions between gender and AIDS, offers a description of this asymmetry and an anthropological analysis of the socio-cultural determinants, through analysis of data from ethnographic research among PLWH and health actors. Examining social representations of femininity and masculinity in Burkinabe society and the organisation of the healthcare system in connection with gender shed light on the decision-making processes of both sexes around therapeutic choices and the itinerary of care. On the one hand, the social values attached to femininity, maternity and the status of wife create conditions for women that favour their attendance at care facilities for PLWH and encourage a widespread practice where wives take the place of their husbands in healthcare queues. Moreover, health policies and the effects of women's empowerment within the healthcare system strengthen women's access to health services. On the other hand, representations of masculinity are fully implicated in the cultural construction of men's reluctance to attend care facilities for PLWH. The values associated with this masculinity cause men to run great health, economic and social risks, not only for themselves, but also for their wives and children. By better understanding the interaction between gender, the experience of HIV and the institutional organisation of healthcare, we can identify ways to reduce men's reluctance to attend care facilities for PLWH and improve both prevention and treatment-oriented programmes.",Social science & medicine (1982),2009 Sep,England,2009,00
17176238,"Federal, State and Territory government responses to health inequities and the social determinants of health in Australia.","ISSUE ADDRESSED: Planned actions by governments can play an important part in addressing the social determinants of health and health inequities. We assess the extent to which Australian health departments are committed to health equity as a core value, and the extent to which strategic directions and policies show evidence of action and achievement in reducing health inequities and attention to the social determinants of health. METHODS: Key documents guiding each health department since 2000 were sought from a key informant in each jurisdiction (State/Territory/federal). An analysis was made of the content in terms of stated values, strategies, objectives, intended and current initiatives, collaborations, funding, and reporting of achievements in relation to the reduction of health inequities and the attention accorded to the social determinants of health. RESULTS: All jurisdictions are explicitly or implicitly committed to reducing health inequities and to addressing the social determinants of health to at least a limited extent. The extent of commitment varies from those who make a clear statement of the importance of achieving health equity at both whole-of-government and health department level, to others who have extremely limited commitment. There is also variation in the extent to which directions are transformed into planned initiatives to improve health outcomes or access to health services for disadvantaged groups or areas, and variations in the degree of monitoring and evaluation. CONCLUSION: Although substantial health inequities exist in Australia there is explicit or implicit recognition of the underlying value of equity within all jurisdictions and some policies designed to increase health equity in all. However, in most jurisdictions health equity could be more explicitly incorporated into core government and health department strategies and initiatives, and there is room for the development of the capacity to monitor change over time in access to services, quality of care, and improved health outcomes.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2006 Dec,Australia,2006,00
18774868,Wealth status and risky sexual behaviour in Ghana and Kenya.,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence seems to suggest that there is some association between individual socioeconomic status and sexual risk-taking behaviour in sub-Saharan Africa. A number of broad associations have emerged, among them, positive, neutral and negative relationships between wealth status and sexual risk-taking behaviour. Reduction in the number of sex partners as a behavioural change has been advocated as an important tool in HIV prevention, and affecting such a change requires an understanding of some of the factors that can influence social behaviour, interactions and activities of subpopulations. OBJECTIVES: To further explore the determinants of sexual risk-taking behaviour (individuals having multiple sex partners), especially the effects that variations in household wealth status, gender and different subpopulation groups have on this behaviour. METHODS: The relationship between wealth status and sexual risk-taking behaviour in the context of HIV/AIDS infection in Ghana and Kenya was assessed using raw data from the 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys of each country. Wealth quintiles were used as a proxy for economic status, while non-marital and non-cohabiting sexual partnerships were considered indicators for risky sexual behaviour. RESULTS: For females, there appears to be an increasing probability of sexual risk taking by wealth status in Kenya, while, in Ghana, an inverted J-shaped relationship is shown between wealth status and sexual risk taking. When controlled for other variables, the relationship between wealth status and sexual risk-taking behaviour disappears for females in the two countries. For males, there is no clearly discernable pattern between wealth status and sexual risk-taking behaviour in Ghana, while there is a general trend towards increasing sexual risk-taking behaviour by wealth status in Kenya. For Ghana, the highest probabilities are among the highest and the middle wealth quintiles; in Kenya, high probabilities were found for the two highest wealth quintiles. Controlling for the effects of other factors, the pattern for Ghana is further blurred (not statistically significant), but the relationship continues to show in the case of Kenya, and is significant for the highest quintile. In general, for both Ghana and Kenya, men in the highest wealth quintile were found to be more likely to have multiple sexual partners than the other groups. CONCLUSION: The changing phases of HIV infection indicate that it is no longer poverty that drives the epidemic. Rather, it is wealth and a number of other sociodemographic factors that explain sexual risk-taking behaviour that puts people at risk. Understanding local specific factors that predispose individuals towards sexual risk taking could help to expand the range of information and services needed to combat the HIV pandemic.",Applied health economics and health policy,2008,New Zealand,2008,00
14637009,"Analysis of hospital charges for ischemic stroke in Fukuoka, Japan.","OBJECTIVES: Stroke is a heavy economic burden on individuals, society, and health services in Japan, where health expenditures are rising rapidly. The objective of the present study was to examine medical services and demographic factors associated with increased inpatient charges for ischemic stroke in Japan. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study subjects were 316 patients with a principal diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke who were discharged from the National Kyushu Medical Center Hospital from 1 July 1995 through 31 June 1999. Demographic, clinical, and administrative data were retrospectively collected from medical records and the hospital Clinical Financial Information System (CFIS). The influence of social and medical factors on total charges was analyzed using the stepwise multiple regression model. RESULTS: Among the total subjects, the mean (median) length of hospital stay (LOHS) was 33 (30) days (range, 2-155 days). The mean (median) hospital charge per patient was US dollars 9020 (dollars 7974) with a range of dollars 336-54,509. The distribution of charges was 42% for fundamental, 17% for injection therapies, 13% for radiological test, 11% for other laboratory examinations, 3% for drugs, and 3% for operations. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that LOHS was the key determinant of the hospital charge (partial R2=0.5993, P=0.0001). Operations (P=0.0001) and angiography (P=0.03) were also independent but less contributory determinants of the hospital charge. CONCLUSIONS: LOHS was strongly, positively associated with inpatient charges for ischemic stroke in Japan. This implies that significant charge reductions are more likely to rely on shortening LOHS, which probably can be achieved by altering reimbursement policies.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2003 Dec,Ireland,2003,00
16671280,Lesbian disclosure: disrupting the taken for granted.,"The purpose of this interpretive inquiry was to generate understandings about the experience of lesbian disclosure. The inquiry relied on Gadamerian hermeneutic and feminist philosophical thought and was situated in women's health. In a feminist understanding of women's health, experiences of health are inseparable from the everyday experiences of an embodied life and are constituted within each woman's social, material, and discursive realities. The study was informed by conversations with 15 women who self-identified as lesbian for the purpose of the inquiry, accounts of women in the media, and the researcher's reflective journals. The findings move us towards new understandings about the multiple meanings of ""lesbian."" They challenge nurses to consider the binary categories of homosexual and heterosexual as inadequate signifiers for the reality of women's lives, to consider the particular arrangements of each woman's life, and to disrupt assumptions of heterosexism in order to reduce the negative impact of social exclusion, isolation, discrimination, and stigmatization as social determinants of health.",The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres,2006 Mar,United States,2006,00
15009573,Early childhood factors influencing health-related quality of life in adolescents at 13 years.,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the relationship of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) to early life experience. METHODOLOGY: Eight thousand five hundred and fifty-six women enrolled in a prospective study at their first antenatal clinic visit. At 13 years, of 5345 women remaining, a consecutive sample of 901 mother/child pairs provided data on adolescent HR-QOL using the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Report form (CHQ-PF50) and the Dartmouth COOP Functional Assessment Charts for Adolescents. The CHQ-PF50 yielded physical (PHS) and psychosocial (PSS) summary scores. We examined the relationship between health-related QOL and early childhood predictive variables. RESULTS: PHS was related to gestation, maternal health symptoms in pregnancy, maternal anxiety at 6 months, child health and hours of childcare at 5 years (P < 0.05). PSS was related to maternal age at index visit, maternal attitude to pregnancy, maternal satisfaction with care giving and maternal depression at 6 months, and child health and behaviour problems at 5 years (internalizing and social/attentional/thought (SAT) domains) (P < 0.05). Findings from adolescent self-reports were similar. CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a number of early childhood determinants of adolescent HR-QOL. These findings add to evidence of the effects of early adversity on the developmental pathways of children and support the need for effective early intervention.",Journal of paediatrics and child health,2004 Mar,Australia,2004,00
17041020,Young people and physical activity: a systematic review matching their views to effective interventions.,"A systematic review was conducted to examine the barriers to, and facilitators of, physical activity among young people (11-16 years). The review focused on the wider determinants of health, examining community- and society-level interventions. Four trials and 16 studies of young people's views were included. Evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions was limited, with some suggestions of improvements in knowledge and possible differences according to gender. Young women in particular identified barriers to physical activity associated with certain ways of providing physical education in schools. Young people in general identified a need for increased choice and facilities within the community and emphasized physical activity's social side. Some of the barriers and facilitators identified by young people had been addressed by 'soundly evaluated' effective interventions but significant gaps were identified where no evaluated interventions appear to have been published (e.g. initiatives explicitly addressing gender issues or the combination of sport and other leisure activities), or where there were no soundly evaluated interventions. Rigorous evaluation is required particularly to assess initiatives that address the limited practical and material resources that young people identify as barriers to physical activity.",Health education research,2006 Dec,England,2006,00
19362376,Maternal stress during late gestation has moderate but long-lasting effects on the immune system of the piglets.,"Events acting prenatally on developing foetuses are important determinants for disorders later in life. Prenatal stress (PNS) is one of these events. The purpose of this study was to determine the consequences of a repeated social stress applied during late gestation of the pregnant gilt on the immune system and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity of the piglets from birth to two months of age. Pregnant gilts were submitted to repeated social stress which was induced by housing unfamiliar gilts in pairs modified twice a week during 4 weeks between days 77 and 105 of gestation (S group, n=18). Control gilts were housed in stable pairs during the same period (C group, n=18). Blood cortisol, haptoglobin and IgG levels, immune cell counts, mitogen-induced whole-blood proliferation and TNF-alpha production were evaluated in piglets at 4 days of age (D4), before and after weaning (D26 and 28) and before and after relocation to a new building (D60 and 62). We found that PNS did not affect growth rate of the progeny. It decreased the relative weight of adrenal glands on D4 (P<0.05) but plasma cortisol levels were similar in both groups at all ages. IgG levels in colostrum and in the serum of piglets were not affected. PNS decreased the total numbers of white blood cells, lymphocytes and granulocytes from D26 to D60 (P<0.05), the CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio on D4 (P<0.05), and LPS induced-TNF-alpha production on D60 (P<0.05). PNS increased the ConA-induced lymphocyte proliferation on D4 and D60 and the PWM-induced proliferation on D60 (P<0.05). Our results demonstrate that a repeated social stress applied to pregnant sows during late gestation can induce long-lasting effects on several parameters of the immune function of the offspring. These effects are not due to modifications of the HPA axis activity and may impair the abilities of the piglets to efficiently react against infections during the suckling period and around weaning.",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,2009 Sep 15,Netherlands,2009,00
16042763,Level of positive mental health in the European Union: results from the Eurobarometer 2002 survey.,"BACKGROUND: Few epidemiological studies have focused on the occurrence of positive mental health, and those comparing several countries practically non-existent. This study presents comparative findings of positive mental health in 11 EU countries or regions, based on the Eurobarometer 2002 (autumn) survey. METHOD: The sample (n = 10,878) represents the general population, aged 15 or over, of 11 European countries or regions (all old EU Member States except Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Finland and Great Britain which had to be excluded because of poor response rate, less than 45%). The method of opinion survey was applied using face-to-face interviews. The Energy and Vitality Index (EVI) from the SF-36 questionnaire was use as measure of positive mental health. RESULTS: Overall, there were between-country differences in the gender- and age-adjusted EVI mean scores. In general, poorer mental health was found in women, older age groups, those in poor economic position and those experiencing weak social support. CONCLUSION: Methodological biases cannot be fully excluded, and thus, one has to take the presented results with certain caution, especially when comparing the results from the different countries. On the other hand, the results on the determinants of positive mental health are in concordance with most previous studies.",Clinical practice and epidemiology in mental health : CP & EMH,2005 Jul 21,United Arab Emirates,2005,00
15469413,Rationale and study design of the CardioGene Study: genomics of in-stent restenosis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: in-stent restenosis is a major limitation of stent therapy for atherosclerosis coronary artery disease. The CardioGene Study is an ongoing study of restenosis in bare mental stents (BMS) for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The overall goal is to understand the genetic determinants of the responses to vascular injury that result in the development of restenosis in some patients but not in others. Gene expression profiling at transcriptional and translational levels provides global assessment of gene activity after vascular injury and mechanistic insight. Furthermore, the delineation of genetic biomarkers would be of value in the clinical setting of risk-stratify patients prior to stent therapy. Prospective risk stratification would allow for the rational selection of specialized treatments against the development of in-stent restenosis (ISR), such as drug-eluting stents. SETTING: Patients are enrolled at two sites in the US with high-volume cardiac catheterization facilities: the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, MI, USA, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, USA. STUDY DESIGN: Two complementary study designs are used to understand the molecular mechanisms of restenosis and the genetic biomarkers predictive of restenosis. First, 350 patients are enrolled prospectively at the time of stent implantation. Blood is sampled prior to stent placement and afterwards at 2 weeks and 6 months. The clinical outcome of restenosis is determined 6 and 12 months after stent placement. The primary outcome is clinical restenosis at 6 months. The major secondary outcome is clinical restenosis at 12 months. Second, a corollary case-control analysis will be carried out with the enrollment of an additional 250 cases with a history of recurrent restenosis after treatment with BMS. Controls for this analysis are derived from the prospective cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting to the cardiac catheterization laboratory are screened, informed about the study and enrolled after signing the consent form. Enrollment has been completed for the prospective cohort, and enrollment of the additional group is ongoing. A standardized questionnaire is used to collect clinical data primarily through direct patient interview to assess medical history, medication use, functional status, family history, environmental factors, and social history. Further data are abstracted from the medical charts and catheterization reports. A total of 276 clinical variables are collected per individual at baseline, and 49 variables are collected at each of the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. A Clinical Events Committee adjudicates clinical outcomes. Blood samples are processed at each clinical enrollment site using standardized operating procedures. From each blood sample, several aliquots are prepared and stored of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, granulocytes, platelets, serum, and plasma. Additionally, a portion of each patient's leukocytes is cryopreserved for future cell-line creation. Samples are frozen and shipped to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Additional materials generated in the analysis of the samples at the NHLBI are frozen and stored, including isolated genomic DNA, total RNA, reverse transcribed cDNA libraries and labeled RNA hybridization mixtures used in microarray analysis. Per individual in the prospective cohort, high-quality transcript profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at each time of blood sampling are obtained using Affymetrix U133A microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Per chip, this yields 495,930 features per individual per time of sampling. This represents expression levels for 22,283 genes per patients oer time of blood sampling, including 14,500 well-characterized human genes. Proteomics of plasma is performed with multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Protein expression is examined similarly to mRNA expression as a measure of gene expression. Genotyping is performed in two manners. First, those genes showing differential expression at the levels of mRNA and protein are investigated using a candidate gene approach. Specific variants in known gene regulatory regions, such as promoters, are sought initially, as those variants may explain differences in expression level. Second, a genome-wide scan is used to identify genetic loci that are associated with ISR. Those regions identified are further examined for genes that show differential expression in the mRNA microarray profiling or proteomics investigations. These genes are finely investigated for candidate SNPs and other gene variants. Complementary genomic and proteomic approaches are expected to be robust. Integration of data sets is accomplished using a variety of informatics tools, organization of gene expression into functional pathways, and investigation of physical maps of up- and downregulated sets of genes. CONCLUSIONS: The CardioGene Study is designed to understand ISR. Global gene and protein expression profiling define molecular phenotypes of patients. Well-defined clinical phenotypes will be paired with genomic data to define analyses aimed to achieve several goals. These include determining blood gene and protein expression in patients with ISR, investigating the genetic basis of ISR, developing predictive gene and protein biomarkers, and the identification of new targets for treatment.",Pharmacogenomics,2004 Oct,England,2004,00
17926278,Determinants of good adherence to hand hygiene among healthcare workers who have extensive exposure to hand hygiene campaigns.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the different behavioral components of healthcare workers' motivation to comply with hand hygiene in a healthcare institution with a 10-year history of hand hygiene campaigning. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, by use of an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire. SETTING: A 2,200-bed university teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A stratified random sample of 2,961 medical and nursing staff. RESULTS: A total of 1,042 questionnaires (35.2%) were returned. Of the respondents, 271 (26.0%) were physicians, 629 (60.4%) were nurses, and 141 (13.5%) were nursing assistants. Overall, 1,008 respondents provided information about sex; 718 (71.2%) of these were women. Respondents provided demographic information and data about various behavioral, normative, and control beliefs that determined their intentions with respect to performing hand hygiene. Among behavioral beliefs, the perception that healthcare-associated infections are severe for patients was highly ranked as a determinant of behavior by 331 (32.1%) of the respondents, and the perception that hand hygiene is effective at preventing these infections was ranked highly by 891 respondents (86.0%). Among normative beliefs, perceived social pressure from patients to perform hand hygiene was ranked highly by 760 respondents (73.7%), pressure from superiors was ranked highly by 687 (66.8%), pressure from colleagues was ranked highly by 596 (57.9%), and pressure from the person perceived to be most influential was ranked highly by 687 (68.8%). Among control beliefs, the perception that hand hygiene is relatively easy to perform was rated highly by 670 respondents (65.1%). High self-reported rates of adherence to hand hygiene (defined as performance of proper hand hygiene during 80% or more of hand hygiene opportunities) was independently associated with female sex, receipt of training in hand hygiene, participation in a previous hand hygiene campaign, peer pressure from colleagues, perceived good adherence by colleagues, and the perception that hand hygiene is relatively easy to perform. CONCLUSIONS: In a setting with a long tradition of hand hygiene campaigns, behavioral beliefs are strongly in favor of hand hygiene, but adherence is driven by peer pressure and the perception of high self-efficacy, rather than by reasoning about the impact of hand hygiene on patient safety. Female sex, training, and campaign exposure increased the likelihood of compliance with hand hygiene. This additional insight can help to shape future promotional activity.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,2007 Nov,United States,2007,00
15234641,"Adherence to evidence-based therapies after discharge for acute coronary syndromes: an ongoing prospective, observational study.","PURPOSE: To determine the rates of patient adherence to key evidence-based therapies at 6 months after hospital discharge for an acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: In this nonrandomized, prospective, multinational, multicenter study, adherence to aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 6 months after discharge for myocardial infarction or unstable angina was assessed in 21,408 patients aged 18 years or older. Patients were enrolled at 104 tertiary and community hospitals representing a broad range of care facilities and practice settings (e.g., teaching vs. nonteaching). RESULTS: Of 13,830 patients, discontinuation of therapy was observed at 6-month follow-up in 8% of those taking aspirin on discharge, 12% of those taking beta-blockers, 20% of those taking ACE inhibitors, and 13% of those taking statins. In a multivariate analysis, adherence to beta-blocker therapy was higher in patients with a myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.47), hypertension (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.54), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.61), or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.45). Aspirin adherence was higher among patients cared for by cardiologists (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.75; P <0.001) than among those cared for by nonspecialists. Male sex and prior heart failure were associated with improved adherence to ACE inhibitor therapy. Hypertension was associated with poorer adherence to statin therapy (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.99; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Among patients prescribed key evidence-based medications at discharge, 8% to 20% were no longer taking their medication after 6 months. The reasons for noncompliance are complex, and may be elucidated by future studies of medical and social determinants.",The American journal of medicine,2004 Jul 15,United States,2004,00

19142342,"[Prevalence and early determinants of common mental disorders in the 1982 birth cohort, Pelotas, Southern Brazil].","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of common mental disorders and assess its association with risk factors in a cohort of young adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional study nested in a 1982 birth cohort study conducted in Pelotas, Southern Brazil. In 2004-5, 4,297 subjects were interviewed during home visits. Common mental disorders were assessed using the Self-Report Questionnaire. Risk factors included socioeconomic, demographic, perinatal, and environmental variables. The analysis was stratified by gender and crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated by Poisson regression. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of common mental disorders was 28.0%; 32.8% and 23.5% in women and men, respectively. Men and women who were poor in 2004-5, regardless of their poor status in 1982, had nearly 1.5-fold increased risk for common mental disorders (p<0.001) when compared to those who have never been poor. Among women, being poor during childhood (p<0.001) and black/mixed skin color (p=0.002) increased the risk for mental disorders. Low birth weight and duration of breastfeeding were not associated to the risk of these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalence of common mental disorders among low-income groups and race-ethnic minorities suggests that social inequalities present at birth have a major impact on mental health, especially common mental disorders.",Revista de saude publica,2008 Dec,Brazil,2008,00

METHODS: The data for this study were collected by means of a questionnaire addressed to women in Wad-Medani, Sudan. Three hundred women in the reproductive age (15-49) years were chosen randomly for this study. The data were analyzed statistically using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Frequency distributions and a statistical test based on Chi-square for independence was conducted. RESULTS: Infant mortality rate was 77 per 100 and child mortality rate was 67 per 100. The results revealed that immunization, child order, child birth weight, birth interval and contraceptive use had a significant influence on the mortality of children under the age of five. The mother's level of education is highly significant on the mortality of children under five years old. CONCLUSIONS: The Ministry of Health should give greater attention to improving immunization services and concentrate on health education campaigns for mothers and for the community.",Journal of family & community medicine,2007 May,India,2007,00

Determinants of consultation for migraine headache in France.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate determinants of consultation for migraine in a representative sample of the French general adult population. We interviewed 10,032 subjects, of whom 1534 fulfilled the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine. These were categorized into migraine, probable migraine and chronic migraine. Information was collected on consultation experience; 436 subjects (28.4%) had never consulted for headache, 473 (30.8%) were in active consultation and 625 (40.7%) had previously consulted but lapsed. Subjects with chronic migraine showed the highest active consultation rates (51.8%). All subjects completed rating instruments for headache [Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6], psychiatric (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scale) and psychological [Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), Brief COPE Inventory and Coping Strategy Questionnaire] variables. The strongest determinants of active consultation were BIPQ scores, HIT-6 scores and migraine type. Consultation was associated with maladaptive coping strategies (social support, emotional expression and acceptance). Determinants of remaining in consultation were catastrophizing coping scores and previous consultation experience.",Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,2007 Dec,England,2007,00
15098001,Examination of AVPR1a as an autism susceptibility gene.,"Impaired reciprocal social interaction is one of the core features of autism. While its determinants are complex, one biomolecular pathway that clearly influences social behavior is the arginine-vasopressin (AVP) system. The behavioral effects of AVP are mediated through the AVP receptor 1a (AVPR1a), making the AVPR1a gene a reasonable candidate for autism susceptibility. We tested the gene's contribution to autism by screening its exons in 125 independent autistic probands and genotyping two promoter polymorphisms in 65 autism affected sibling pair (ASP) families. While we found no nonconservative coding sequence changes, we did identify evidence of linkage and of linkage disequilibrium. These results were most pronounced in a subset of the ASP families with relatively less severe impairment of language. Thus, though we did not demonstrate a disease-causing variant in the coding sequence, numerous nontraditional disease-causing genetic abnormalities are known to exist that would escape detection by traditional gene screening methods. Given the emerging biological, animal model, and now genetic data, AVPR1a and genes in the AVP system remain strong candidates for involvement in autism susceptibility and deserve continued scrutiny.",Molecular psychiatry,2004 Oct,England,2004,00
10759896,Psychosocial correlates and impact of chronic tension-type headaches.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the psychosocial correlates of chronic tension-type headache and the impact of chronic tension-type headache on work, social functioning, and well-being. METHODS: Two hundred forty-five patients (mean age = 37.0 years) with chronic tension-type headache as a primary presenting problem completed an assessment protocol as part of a larger treatment outcome study. The assessment included a structured diagnostic interview, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form, Disability Days/Impairment Ratings, Recurrent Illness Impact Profile, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form, Primary Care Evaluation for Mental Disorders, and the Hassles Scale Short Form. Comparisons were made with matched controls (N = 89) and, secondarily, with Medical Outcomes Study data for the general population, arthritis, and back problem samples. RESULTS: About two thirds of those with chronic tension-type headache recorded daily or near daily (> or =25 days per month) headaches with few (12%) recording headaches on less than 20 days per month. Despite the fact that patients reported that their headaches had occurred at approximately the present frequency for an average of 7 years, chronic tension-type headache sufferers were largely lapsed consulters (54% of subjects) or current consulters in primary care (81% of consulters). Significant impairments in functioning and well-being were evident in chronic tension-type headache and were captured by each of the assessment devices. Although headache-related disability days were reported by 74% of patients (mean = 7 days in previous 6 months), work or social functioning was severely impaired in only a small minority of patients. Sleep, energy level, and emotional well-being were frequently impaired with about one third of patients recording impairments in these areas on 10 or more days per month. Most patients with chronic tension-type headache continued to carry out daily life responsibilities when in pain, although role performance at times was clearly impaired by headaches and well-being was frequently impaired. Chronic tension-type headache sufferers were 3 to 15 times more likely than matched controls to receive a diagnosis of an anxiety or mood disorder with almost half of the patients exhibiting clinically significant levels of anxiety or depression. Affective distress and severity of headaches (Headache Index) were important determinants of headache impact/impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic tension-type headache has a greater impact on individuals' lives than has generally been realized, with affective distress being an important correlate of impairment. If treatment is to remedy impairment in functioning, affective distress, as well as pain, thus needs to be addressed.",Headache,2000 Jan,United States,2000,00
16277821,Consequences of food energy excess and positive energy balance.,"This paper discusses possible consequences of energy excess throughout the life cycle. Firstly we consider the effects of foods on hunger, satiety and satiation. Also, the changes in food availability and consumption in relation to changes in social and economic determinants of energy excess. The relationship between physical activity and energy intake (EI) is also considered. Secondly we explore the definition of energy excess and the metabolic effects of macronutrients (mainly in relation to fuel partitioning oxidation/storage) on energy balance. The cellular and molecular regulation determined by specific genes involved in lipogenesis, fuel partitioning and/or in energy dissipation are explored. Thirdly, we examine the main consequences induced by energy excess and positive energy balance, starting with the alterations in glucose utilisation (insulin resistance) leading to type 2 diabetes and the linkage of energy excess with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Biological, social and psychological consequences during perinatal, childhood and adolescence periods are specifically analysed. Fourthly, the transition from energy deficit to excess, under the optic of a developing country is analysed with country examples drawn from Latin America. The possible role of supplementary food programmes in determining positive energy balance is discussed especially in relation to pre-school and school feeding programmes. Fifthly, we deal with the economic costs of energy excess and obesity related diseases. Finally, some areas where further research is needed are described; biological and genetic determinants of individual and population energy requirements, foods and food preparations as actually consumed, consumer education and research needs on social determinants of energy imbalances.",Public health nutrition,2005 Oct,England,2005,00
17937563,Seeds of HOPE: a model for addressing social and economic determinants of health in a women's obesity prevention project in two rural communities.,"Socioeconomic status (SES) and income disparity are strong predictors of health, and health promotion interventions that address them are more likely to be meaningful to participants and to sustain positive effects. Seeds of HOPE is an innovative project that is the result of a long-standing collaboration between the University of North Carolina (UNC) Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Prevention Research Center, and communities in rural North Carolina. Initial formative work, including key informant interviews, community surveys, and focus groups, strengthened our understanding of the link between hope and health and the importance of addressing social and economic issues as part of our health promotion interventions. A Seeds of HOPE strategic plan was developed using a community-based participatory process and led to the idea to start Threads of HOPE, an enterprise that will serve as a business laboratory where women will produce and market a unique product and also learn business skills. Threads of HOPE will be a health-enhancing business and will serve as a training program for a new cadre of women entrepreneurs in two rural communities.",Journal of women's health (2002),2007 Oct,United States,2007,00
16026663,Sources of social support as determinants of psychiatric morbidity after severe life events: prospective cohort study of female employees.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study prospectively the associations between sources of social support, life events, and psychiatric morbidity, as explicated in the chronic strain and the stress-buffering hypotheses. METHODS: Psychiatric morbidity and sources of social support were assessed at Time 1 and 3 years later at Time 2 among 4250 female municipal employees. At Time 2, the participants were also asked about their preceding life events during the year. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, low support from one's partner, coworkers, and supervisor at Times 1 and 2 was positively associated with psychiatric morbidity at Time 2 (OR = 1.1-1.6). The support of friends at Time 1 lowered the risk of psychiatric morbidity after death or severe illness in the family and after interpersonal conflict. High postevent network heterogeneity also lowered the risk of psychiatric morbidity after financial difficulty. For the remaining 33 combinations between different sources of social support and life events, no corresponding interactions were found. CONCLUSION: The observed associations support the chronic strain hypothesis, but the support for the stress-buffering hypothesis was limited.",Journal of psychosomatic research,2005 May,England,2005,00

11929730,"Different slopes for different folks: socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in asthma and hay fever among 173,859 U.S. men and women.","Although allergic diseases such as asthma and hay fever are a major cause of morbidity in industrialized countries, most studies have focused on patterns of prevalence among children and adolescents, with relatively few studies on variations in prevalence by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position among adults. Our study examined racial/ethnic and socioeconomic patterns in the prevalence of asthma overall, asthma with hay fever, asthma without hay fever, and hay fever overall, in a population of 173,859 women and men in a large prepaid health plan in northern California. Using education as a measure of socioeconomic position, we found evidence of a positive gradient for asthma with hay fever with increasing level of education but an inverse gradient for asthma without hay fever. Hay fever was also strongly associated with education. Compared with their White counterparts, Black women and men were more likely to report asthma without hay fever, and Black women were less likely to have asthma with hay fever. Asian men were also more likely to report asthma with hay fever, and Asian women and men were much more likely to have hay fever. Racial/ethnic disparities in prevalence of allergic diseases were largely independent of education. We discuss implications for understanding these social inequalities in allergic disease risk in relation to possible differences in exposure to allergens and determinants of immunologic susceptibility and suggest directions for future research.",Environmental health perspectives,2002 Apr,United States,2002,00
17097354,"Influence of fatigue, depression, and demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables on quality of life of patients with epilepsy.","The purpose of this study was to define the influence of fatigue, depression, and clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic factors on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. The study was performed on 103 adult patients who visited Erciyes University Epilepsy Outpatient Clinic between 2004 and 2005. Patients were evaluated with the Form of Negotiation, Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-89), Beck Depression Inventory, and Fatigue Severity Scale. Mean age of the patients was 34.3+/-12.6, and mean duration of disease was 12.6+/-9.3 years. Among these patients, 52.4% were men, 49.5% were married, 15.5% had a university education, 53.4% had low incomes, 45.6% had generalized seizures, and 35.0% had experienced one or more seizures per month during the preceding year. The most significant variables in the domain of Overall quality of life were seizure frequency (P<0.001), depression (P<0.001), and fatigue (P<0.001); the variables in the domain of Mental Health were seizure frequency (P<0.001) and fatigue (P<0.001); the variable in the Cognitive domain was fatigue (P<0.001); the variables in the domain of Physical Health were social insurance coverage (P<0.01), fatigue (P<0.01), and age (P<0.01); the variables in the Epilepsy Targeted domain were depression (P<0.001), seizure frequency (P<0.001), and fatigue (P<0.01). Although quality of life has multiple determinants, seizure frequency, fatigue, and depression are the most important factors affecting quality of life in patients with epilepsy. One or more seizures per month, severe fatigue, and depression are associated with lower quality of life in some but not all domains. Partial correlations demonstrated that fatigue was a significant independent predictor of quality of life. The present study confirms that fatigue can be a powerful predictor of quality of life.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2007 Feb,United States,2007,00

Different individual characteristics were associated with each of these sexual behaviors. Polygamy and being a fisherman who has left home for over a month in the past year for work reasons were both positively associated with having ever paid for sex, whereas those with more household wealth were less likely to have paid for sex. The influence of education, age, age at sexual initiation, Muslim religion, polygamy, occupation, and having ever paid for sex on total number of sexual partners in the past year are all evident. Finally, secondary education, work-related migration, and having ever paid for sex were significantly associated with having used condoms.",African journal of reproductive health,2007 Aug,Nigeria,2007,00
12690026,Distribution and determinants of sedentary lifestyles in the European Union.,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown the health burden of a sedentary lifestyle. The main goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles in the 15 Member States of the European Union (EU) and to identify the main correlates of a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: Nationally representative samples (n approximately 1000 subjects in each country; >15 years) completed a questionnaire concerning attitudes to physical activity, body weight, and health; in total 15 239 subjects. Sedentary people were defined in two ways: (1) those expending less than 10% of their leisure time expenditure in activities involving >/=4 metabolic equivalents (MET). (2) Those who did not practice any leisure-time physical activity and who also were above the median in the number of hours spent sitting down during leisure time. Logistic regression models were fitted to analyse the association between sedentary lifestyles and gender, age, body mass index (BMI), educational level, weight change in the last 6 months, and marital and smoking status. RESULTS: Percentages of sedentary lifestyles across European countries ranged between 43.3% (Sweden) and 87.8% (Portugal) according to the first definition. According to both definitions, a lower prevalence of sedentary lifestyle was found in Northern countries (especially Scandinavian countries) as compared with Mediterranean countries, whereas the prevalence was higher among older, obese, less educated, widowed/divorced individuals, and current smokers. Similar relative differences between countries and socio-demographic groups were found independently of the method used to define a sedentary lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of sedentary lifestyle in the EU is high, especially among inhabitants of some Mediterranean countries, obese subjects, less-educated people, and current smokers. This high prevalence involves important public health burdens and preventive strategies are urgently needed.",International journal of epidemiology,2003 Feb,England,2003,00
14674048,Determinants of the public's preference for social distance from people with schizophrenia.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which the public's desire for social distance from people with schizophrenia is influenced by beliefs about the disorder and stereotypes about those suffering from it. METHODS: In spring 2001, we carried out a representative survey of individuals of German nationality aged 18 years and over (n = 5025). Each subject was given a fully structured interview that began with the presentation of a vignette. RESULTS: Both labelling and beliefs about the disorder's causes and prognosis, as well as the perception that those suffering from it are unpredictable and dangerous, had an impact on the public's desire for social distance. However, the latter proved to be more important. As expected, respondents who identified the disorder depicted in the vignette as mental illness, those who blamed the individual for its development, and those who anticipated a poor prognosis expressed a stronger desire for social distance. Endorsing biological factors as a cause was also associated with increased social distance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have important implications for interventions aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination related to schizophrenia. Targeting the stereotype of unpredictability and dangerousness appears to be particularly important.",Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie,2003 Nov,United States,2003,00
12515921,"[Analysis of an apparent cluster of Crohn's disease cases in Indre-et-Loire, France (1990-1999)].","BACKGROUND: Four cases of Crohn disease (CD) were diagnosed between 1990 and 1997 in children living in the same area in the Indre-et-Loire district (county A). The local population raised the hypothesis that an environmental source could be responsible for these cases. An investigation was carried out to assess the excess of cases and to identify their possible determinants. METHODS: A case was defined as any new case of CD (European definition) that occurred between 1989 and 1998 in county A or in the adjacent county of the Vienne district. Case finding was done by contacting all hospital services, pediatricians and gastro-enterologists in the 2 districts. A Standardized Incidence Rate (SIR) was calculated for sex and age in adults and children using data from the Inflammatory Bowel Registry of northern France. Statistical significance was assessed by a test taking into account small samples. A descriptive study was carried out among pediatric cases. RESULTS: Four pediatric cases and four adults were identified, all from county A. The SIR in adults was 0,45 (95% Confidence Interval [95% CI: 0.12-1.15). In children, the global SIR was 8,51 (95% CI: 2.29-21.79) and 19,05 (95% CI: 5.12-48.70) in county A. The descriptive study did not identify any exposure leading to a possible hypothesis concerning the origin of the cases. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the incidence of CD among children of the area was greater than observed in France and has permitted to establish a close relationship with the affected families, to implement a social approach to the problem and to limit rumors. It illustrates the interest of a systematic stepwise approach, which takes into consideration the anxiety of the local community. Cluster investigation should be integrated as part of the public health agencies activities.

19017239,Factors influencing job satisfaction of front line nurse managers: a systematic review.,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the research literature that examined the determinants of front line nurse managers' job satisfaction. BACKGROUND: Front line managers are the vital link between senior management and clinical nurses. They influence organizational culture and outcomes for patients and staff so their job satisfaction and ultimately retention is of importance. EVALUATIONS: A review of research articles that examined the determinants of front line nurse managers' job satisfaction was conducted. These managers supervise staff nurses and have direct responsibility for the management of a nursing unit or team in any type of healthcare facility. Fourteen studies were included in the final analysis. KEY ISSUES: Evidence of significant positive relationships were found between span of control, organizational support, empowerment and the job satisfaction of front line nurse managers. CONCLUSION: The review suggests that job satisfaction of front line managers may be improved by addressing span of control and workload, increasing organizational support from supervisors and empowering managers to participate in decision-making. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Healthcare organizations may enhance the recruitment, retention and sustainability of future nursing leadership by addressing the factors that influence job satisfaction of front line managers.",Journal of nursing management,2008 Oct,England,2008,00
12220096,Social status determinants of control in individuals' accounts of their mental illness.,"We examine the determinants of patients' accounts of their own mental illness. In particular, we examine the factors that affect the likelihood of attributing one's own mental illness to controllable factors rather than non-controllable factors. Our quantitative measure of attributional control is derived from the coding of in-depth interviews with people with severe mental illness seeking treatment for the first time (N = 144). We find that those who occupy positions of social disadvantage (particularly African-American males and those who receive public assistance) are less likely to attribute their illness to controllable sources, suggesting that personal mental illness attributions are systematically related to a person's social location. We outline the significance of these findings for research on the psychological consequences of mental illness attributions.",Social science & medicine (1982),2002 Sep,England,2002,00
18953777,[Male-female differences in health and healthcare are largely determined by social factors].,"Women are generally considered the 'weaker sex'. In relation to health issues, it is not as simple as that. One might even argue that, in this context, men are the weaker sex. Life expectancy, for example, is lower in men than in women due to the fact that men suffer more from chronic conditions and have higher mortality risks. Part of these differences in health can be attributed to biological factors, but social factors seem to play an even more important role. The health gap between men and women might evolve over time and differ between situations. This is illustrated by the decreasing difference in life expectancy between men and women, and by the relatively adverse cardiovascular risk profile of women in immigrant groups compared with the host populations. Within healthcare, differences between men and women are also partly due to social determinants. Examples include the underrepresentation of women in health research as well as in guidelines committees, thereby affecting the production and implementation of medical evidence.",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,2008 Oct 4,Netherlands,2008,00
15002679,Assessing population need for mental health care: a review of approaches and predictors.,"This review aimed to clarify the concept of need, explore the different approaches used to assess need, and contribute to an improved understanding of predictor and intervening factors in assessing need for mental health services. Two population-based needs assessment approaches have been identified: modeling need for services and surveys of the general population. The most widely used model was that based on the Jarman-8 index of social deprivation. The population-based epidemiological surveys addressed perceived need by seeking direct, self-reported measures of individuals' perceptions of their needs for care. Although many studies have reported correlates of service use, few have attempted to identify correlates of perceived need. The fact that two-thirds to three-quarters of people were identified as meeting criteria for a mental health disorder, but did not report receiving treatment, highlighted a gap between epidemiology and service use. This gap could be explained by a number of intervening factors such as the discordance between diagnosis and disability, the determinants of and barriers to help-seeking behavior, the belief systems concerning appropriate treatments, and choice of health professionals. This review has thus identified the predictor variables which are important for a comprehensive analysis of need for mental health care. Suggestions and challenges have been put forward to address the identified gaps in assessing population need.",Mental health services research,2004 Mar,United States,2004,00

There is a two-step methodology. First, the content of HIV/AIDS posters from 15 sub-Saharan African countries was coded for the six health message frames. Second, relationships between the health message frames and four social determinants (HIV rate, HIV awareness, condom use and uncertainty avoidance (UAI)) were assessed with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Analysis indicates that self-efficacy is the most common frame, but that almost one-quarter of the posters has none of the six health message frames. HLM indicates some favorable findings, including that health message frames are used most often in countries with the most troubling levels of HIV awareness and condom use. Less favorably, health message frames are used least common in countries that have high levels of UAI and high HIV rates. Improvements for related media practices and policy are articulated.",Health promotion international,2007 Sep,England,2007,00
10718168,Determinants of youth tobacco use in West Virginia: a comparison of smoking and smokeless tobacco use.,"PURPOSE: To identify and compare the determinants of different types of tobacco use among rural youths and discuss the implication of these differences for youth tobacco use cessation. METHODS: Ninth grade participants (n = 883) were 95% white, between 13 and 19 years old with a mean age of 14.6 years. Students were classified into four exclusive groups: non-tobacco use, smoking only, smokeless tobacco (ST) use only, and conjoint smoking and ST use. The influences of 14 specific risk factors on tobacco use were investigated for each group using separate multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Among participants, 20% were smokers only, 6% were ST users only, and 10% were conjoint users. Students who had more friends (odds ratio [OR] =] 2.75) and siblings (OR = 1.96) who smoke, family problems (OR = 1.70), and favorable attitudes toward tobacco use (OR = 1.12) were more likely to smoke than were other students. Among students who used only ST, gender was a primary determinant (95% were male). Excluding gender, sibling ST use (OR = 4.28), friends' ST use (OR = 1.71), and favorable attitudes (OR = 1.11) were the most significant risk factors. Male students were also more likely to use both cigarettes and ST (OR = 8.62). In addition, among students who used both tobacco products, siblings' and friends' ST use were significant (OR = 3.09 and 2.13, respectively), as well as family problems (OR = 2.41) and attitude (OR = 1.15). Unlike smokers only or ST users only, lack of knowledge about tobacco was a significant determinant among conjoint users (OR = 1.39). CONCLUSIONS: Findings revealed that 7 of 14 factors were significant predictors of tobacco use. Some factors predicted smoking only, ST only, and conjoint use; however, the pattern of predictors varied for these three categories. Implications for these findings as they relate to tobacco use interventions are discussed.",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,2000 Feb,England,2000,00
12788000,When should we do knee replacements?,"It is not known whether it is better to perform total knee replacements early or late in the course of arthritis. To examine the determinants of patient-related outcomes after knee replacement, we examined 812 patients in the Avon knee registry, in whom pre-operative and 5-year post-operative American Knee Society Scores were available. Ninety percent had a good outcome at 5 years. Women had significantly more severe disease at the time of surgery than men. Older people (>79 years) had the worst disease at the time of surgery, and made the least health gain, although their overall outcomes were still good. Those with the most severe disease at the time of operation made greater gains to those with less disease, but remained in worse health at 5 years, suggesting that earlier surgery may be preferable.",The Knee,2003 Jun,Netherlands,2003,00
11468534,Predictors of organ donation registration among Dutch adolescents.,"BACKGROUND: In 1998, a new organ donor registration scheme was implemented in the Netherlands in order to increase the number of potential donors and to facilitate decisions and procedures concerning organ donation. However, registration rate and registration choices failed to meet the expectations. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among a random sample of 1,731 Dutch adolescents of 18 and 19 years was conducted to study potential determinants of organ donor registration choices. RESULTS: Almost one fifth of the adolescents indicated that they did not return their organ donation registration form. Among subjects who registered, 57% were willing to donate their organs or tissues posthumously. More positive social influences, fewer negative outcome beliefs, and a low level of organ donation anxiety were significant predictors of returning a completed registration form and registration as an organ donor. In addition, religion was a significant predictor of returning a completed registration form, and positive outcome beliefs contributed to the prediction of registration as an organ donor. CONCLUSIONS: The results give clear suggestions for tailoring organ donation registration interventions to specific characteristics, beliefs, and misconceptions of adolescents. The results also suggest that it is important to encourage adolescents to discuss issues related to organ donation with their parents and friends in order to increase donor registration.",Transplantation,2001 Jul 15,United States,2001,00

17018463,Motor and cognitive outcomes in nondisabled low-birth-weight adolescents: early determinants.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe motor and cognitive outcomes in nondisabled low-birth-weight (LBW) adolescents and to determine the relation of specific prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors to these outcomes. DESIGN: A prospective epidemiological study. SETTING: An adolescent follow-up of a regional LBW (<2000 g) cohort born in or admitted to 3 hospitals between September 1, 1984, and June 30, 1987 (n = 1105). Of 862 eligible survivors, 628 (72.9%) underwent assessment at a mean age of 16 years; of these, 33 had severe disability that precluded psychometric evaluation. The 474 nondisabled adolescents undergoing assessment at home had slightly less social risk at birth than did all other nondisabled eligible adolescents. PARTICIPANTS: The 474 nondisabled LBW adolescents assessed at home. Main Exposures Basic birth characteristics (social risk, sex, fetal growth ratio, and gestational age), neonatal cranial ultrasound abnormalities, and other early medical complications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Riley Motor Problems Inventory and Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence. RESULTS: Nondisabled LBW adolescents had an excess of motor problems compared with the normative sample. The IQ scores, although within the normal range, were significantly lower than population norms. Independent predictors of total motor problems included male sex, white matter injury on neonatal ultrasound, and days of ventilation. Independent predictors of lower Full Scale IQ scores included social disadvantage, fetal growth ratio, and white matter injury on neonatal ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: Specific prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors influence motor and cognitive performance in nondisabled LBW survivors well into adolescence, even when controlling for social risk. Advances in maternal-fetal and neonatal care can substantially improve these long-term outcomes.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2006 Oct,United States,2006,00
11564854,Doing community-driven research: a description of Seattle Partners for Healthy Communities.,"Seattle Partners, an Urban Research Center (URC) funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is a partnership of community agency representatives, community activists, public health professionals, academics, and health care providers whose mission is to improve the health of urban Seattle, Washington, communities by conducting community-based participatory research. This article describes the development and characteristics of Seattle Partners. Using primarily qualitative methods, including periodic in-depth interviews, evaluators identified the components necessary for Seattle Partners to maintain a collaborative and establish a research center driven by community interests. Seattle Partners is run by an unrestricted and inclusive board that has spent 5 years developing both an operating structure and various research interventions. Operating under Community Collaboration Principles, the board identified social determinants of health as the priority area in which to work. Collaboration, ""small and concrete"" accomplishments, skilled individuals, and funder support directly influence the success of the center. Decision making, project selection, and board composition have all been challenges to work through.

18005400,The development of an intervention programme to reduce whole-body vibration exposure at work induced by a change in behaviour: a study protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Whole body vibration (WBV) exposure at work is common and studies found evidence that this exposure might cause low back pain (LBP). A recent review concluded there is a lack of evidence of effective strategies to reduce WBV exposure. Most research in this field is focussed on the technical implications, although changing behaviour towards WBV exposure might be promising as well. Therefore, we developed an intervention programme to reduce WBV exposure in a population of drivers with the emphasis on a change in behaviour of driver and employer. The hypothesis is that an effective reduction in WBV exposure, in time, will lead to a reduction in LBP as WBV exposure is a proxy for an increased risk of LBP. METHODS/DESIGN: The intervention programme was developed specifically for the drivers of vibrating vehicles and their employers. The intervention programme will be based on the most important determinants of WBV exposure as track conditions, driving speed, quality of the seat, etc. By increasing knowledge and skills towards changing these determinants, the attitude, social influence and self-efficacy (ASE) of both drivers and employers will be affected having an effect on the level of exposure. We used the well-known ASE model to develop an intervention programme aiming at a change or the intention to change behaviour towards WBV exposure. The developed programme consists of: individual health surveillance, an information brochure, an informative presentation and a report of the performed field measurements. DISCUSSION: The study protocol described is advantageous as the intervention program actively tries to change behaviour towards WBV exposure. The near future will show if this intervention program is effective by showing a decrease in WBV exposure.",BMC public health,2007 Nov 15,England,2007,00
16800402,Determinants of employee participation in physical activity: critical review of the literature.,"The purpose of this article is to provide a review of research literature related to factors that influence employee participation in physical activity. Eleven published studies investigating physical activity in samples of adult employees were included in this review. Across these studies, self-efficacy, or belief in personal ability to perform this health behavior, was the best predictor of physical activity among employees. Perceived benefits of physical activity and perceived health status were also found to influence participation in physical activity. Occupational health nurses could offer self-care classes and intervention programs that assist employees in improving their perceptions of self-efficacy to perform physical activity. Additionally, occupational health nurses should continue to reinforce the benefits of physical activity in all health promotion venues.",AAOHN journal : official journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses,2006 Jun,United States,2006,00

19047546,Determinants of health insurance status for children of Latino immigrant and other US farm workers: findings from the National Agricultural Workers Survey.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the health insurance status of farm workers' children, an understudied topic. DESIGN: A population-based multistage survey. SETTING: Employer-based study conducted in the continental United States from 2000 to 2002. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3136 parents with children younger than 18 years and no children residing outside of the United States who participated in the US Department of Labor's National Agricultural Workers Survey, which is administered to a national probability sample of US farm workers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Children's parent-reported health insurance status. RESULTS: Of the farm workers who were parents, 87% were Latino, 81% were foreign born, 15% were migrant workers, 55% had less than a sixth-grade education, and 68% reported little to no English language proficiency. Thirty-two percent of all farm-worker parents, including 45% of migrant-worker parents, reported that their children were uninsured. In multivariate analyses, older parental age (odds ratio [OR] for parents aged 30-39 years, 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.50; OR for parents aged >/=40 years, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.99-4.74), less parental education (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09-2.10), less time in the United States (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91 per 10 years in the United States), being a migrant worker (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.31-2.93), and living in the Southeast (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.00-5.02) or Southwest (OR, 3.91; 95% CI, 2.32-6.57) were significantly associated with having uninsured children. CONCLUSIONS: Farm workers' children were uninsured at roughly 3 times the rate of all other children and almost twice the rate of those at or near the federal poverty level. Programs aimed at extending insurance coverage for children should consider the unique social barriers that characterize this vulnerable population of US children. Moreover, there is significant regional variation that may reflect varying levels of insurance resources and eligibility from state to state.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00
18471592,Psychosocial predictors of fruit and vegetable consumption in adults a review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Adequate fruit and vegetable intake has been found to promote health and reduce the risk of several cancers and chronic diseases. Understanding the psychological determinants of fruit and vegetable intake is needed to design effective intervention programs. METHODS: Papers published in English from 1994 to 2006 that described the relationship between psychosocial predictors and fruit and vegetable intake in adults were reviewed. Studies and their constructs were independently rated based on the direction of significant effects, quality of execution, design suitability, and frequency. Methodology from the Guide to Community Preventive Services was used to systematically review and synthesize findings. RESULTS: Twenty-five psychosocial constructs spanning 35 studies were reviewed (14 prospective and 21 cross-sectional/descriptive studies). Strong evidence was found for self-efficacy, social support, and knowledge as predictors of adult fruit and vegetable intake. Weaker evidence was found for variables including barriers, intentions, attitudes/beliefs, stages of change, and autonomous motivation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the need to design future behavioral interventions that use strong experimental designs with efficacious constructs and to conduct formal mediation analyses to determine the strength of these potential predictors of fruit and vegetable intake.",American journal of preventive medicine,2008 Jun,Netherlands,2008,00
18441275,The effects of socioeconomic status and health on transitions in living arrangements and mortality: a longitudinal analysis of elderly Finnish men and women from 1997 to 2002.,"OBJECTIVE: . Objectives were to study the effects of socioeconomic factors on transitions in living arrangements and mortality for men and women. METHODS: We used a sample of Finns aged 65 years and older living alone or with a partner at the end of 1997 (N = 250,787) drawn from population registers, and followed them up for transitions in living arrangements (with partner, alone, with others, institutionalized) and death at the end of 2002. RESULTS: Health conditions associated with functional difficulties were major determinants of institutionalization and death and were associated with transitions between private households. Low income among men and in particular not owning a home were independently associated with institutionalization and death among those living alone or with a partner at baseline. Among those living with a partner, the transition to living alone was associated with all socioeconomic factors but most strongly with a low income and not owning a home. Transitions to living with others were associated in particular with low occupational social class and education. DISCUSSION: Variations in the associations of different socioeconomic indicators with living arrangement transitions imply different social pathways. However, material socioeconomic indicators dominated other measures of socioeconomic status in determining such transitions, and their effects were only partly mediated by chronic conditions.","The journals of gerontology.

17479578,Sport commitment among competitive female gymnasts: a developmental perspective.,"The purpose of this study was to examine age and competitive level differences in the relationship between determinants and level of sport commitment. Gymnasts (N = 304) comprised three age groups (8-11, 11-14.5, and 14.5-18 years) and two competitive levels (Levels 5-6 and 8-10). Multiple regression analyses revealed: (a) perceived costs and social constraints from parents and best friends were the strongest predictors of commitment for the youngest gymnasts, (b) perceived costs, personal investments, and parent social constraints predicted commitment for 11-14.5-year-old gymnasts, and (c) perceived competence and costs predicted commitment for the oldest gymnasts. Competitive level differences also emerged; for Level 5-6 gymnasts, personal investments, perceived costs, coach social support, and social constraints by coach, best friend, and teammates were predictors of commitment. Personal investments and teammate social constraints were significant predictors for Level 8-10 gymnasts. Developmental factors and additional determinants are important to consider in further studies of the sport commitment model.",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,2007 Mar,United States,2007,00
17681608,Determinants of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in patients with chronic lung diseases.,"UNLABELLED: Despite strong recommendations, immunization rates for influenza and pneumococci are low. We aimed to analyse the vaccination status and its determinants in patients with chronic lung diseases. METHODS: Information about actual influenza (IV) and pneumococcal (PV) vaccination status was obtained by a standardised questionnaire from 2491 patients presenting to a specialised centre of respiratory medicine in Rotenburg/Wuemme (Germany). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify potential determinants of IV and PV. RESULTS: Of 2131 patients with asthma and/or COPD, included into detailed analyses (52.0% male, mean age 56.6 years), 46.5% had received an IV and 14.6% a PV. Main reason for not being vaccinated was the lack of information, reaching 87.6% for PV (53.5% for IV); 37.0% saw no reason for an IV (PV 21.3%). Vaccination rates differed depending on the patients' age and education level. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a marked information deficit on immunization which is explicitly higher for PV. Target-group-specific strategies should increase the knowledge on vaccinations in order to avoid the development or aggravation of acute and chronic lung diseases.",The Journal of infection,2007 Oct,England,2007,00
19232810,Understanding gendered influences on women's reproductive health in Pakistan: moving beyond the autonomy paradigm.,"Recent research and policy discourse commonly view the limited autonomy of women in developing countries as a key barrier to improvements in their reproductive health. Rarely, however, is the notion of women's autonomy interrogated for its conceptual adequacy or usefulness for understanding the determinants of women's reproductive health, effective policy formulation or program design. Using ethnographic data from 2001, including social mapping exercises, observation of daily life, interviews, case studies and focus group discussions, this paper draws attention to the incongruities between the concept of women's autonomy and the gendered social, cultural, economic and political realities of women's lives in rural Punjab, Pakistan. These inadequacies include: the concept's undue emphasis on women's independent, autonomous action; a lack of attention to men and masculinities; a disregard for the multi-sited constitution of gender relations and gender inequality; an erroneous assumption that uptake of reproductive health services is an indicator of autonomy; and a failure to explore the interplay of other axes of disadvantage such as caste, class or socio-economic position. This paper calls for alternative, more nuanced, theoretical approaches for conceptualizing gender inequalities in order to enhance our understanding of women's reproductive wellbeing in Pakistan. The extent to which our arguments may be relevant to the wider South Asian context, and women's lives in other parts of the world, is also discussed.",Social science & medicine (1982),2009 Apr,England,2009,00
19395132,Malnutrition and epilepsy: a two-way relationship.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: A link between malnutrition and epilepsy has been suspected for many years. METHODS: Different aspects of the question were studied with a review of previous published data. RESULTS: Several studies performed on animal models or humans highlight the possible adverse effects of malnutrition in the onset of seizures. Protein-energy, electrolyte, vitamin or trace element deficiencies may be involved. Conversely, several determinants of epilepsy could lead to malnutrition: food taboos and social exclusion in developing countries as well as some adverse effects of antiepileptic treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Two different hypotheses exist as a vicious circle: malnutrition predisposing to epilepsy or epilepsy predisposing to malnutrition. A better understanding of these interactions is necessary. In the mean time, malnutrition has to be prevented and treated.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2009 Jun,England,2009,00
19038837,Survival after 100 years of age: a multivariate model of exceptional survival in Swedish centenarians.,"BACKGROUND: Most survival studies of the elderly population have set their baselines for first examinations between 60 and 80 years. The rapidly increasing numbers of exceptionally old persons call for knowledge about determinants of exceptional survival. METHODS: The Swedish Centenarian Study followed 100 centenarians from the age of 100 to death of the entire cohort, by age 111 years. A biomedical, psychological, and social multivariate survival analysis was performed based on factors identified as important in earlier studies of older adults. Latent Variable Partial Least Square Estimation (LVPLS) Soft Modeling was used to test the hypothesized predictions of survival in centenarians. RESULTS: Fewer predictors for survival were found in centenarians than were observed in studies of younger elderly persons. Survival after age 100 was dependent mainly on better baseline physical reserve, as measured by body mass index and body weight, and better baseline physical and cognitive function, as measured by activities of daily living and verbal ability/spatial orientation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Individual characteristics such as physiological reserve, present health and functional status, as well as chance appear important for centenarian survival. Hereditary factors, social relationships, marital status, and personality did not contribute to survival prediction in this exceptional age group. From a theoretical point of view, our data suggest that, in very old age, stochastic determinants may dominate over programmed factors (e.g., family longevity) in determining survival. More research is needed to assess survival factors at exceptional ages.","The journals of gerontology. Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences",2008 Nov,United States,2008,00
17176245,Social determinants of health and health inequalities: what role for general practice?,"This paper argues that general practice is potentially an important social determinant of health and health inequalities. The way it is influential is consistent with models of causal pathways in the way social and societal factors influence health. General practice clinical care can be thought of as a material resource. Evidence exists at many levels that this resource is inequitably distributed. But encounters in general practice are profoundly social processes, embedded in wider society. Debating and reflecting on the values underpinning relations between GP and patient may help challenge and illuminate wider inequitable processes in society that sustain inequalities in health.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2006 Dec,Australia,2006,00
19821647,A qualitative study of determinants of PTSD treatment initiation in veterans.,"Although there are effective treatments for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many PTSD sufferers wait years to decades before seeking professional help, if they seek it at all. An understanding of factors affecting treatment initiation for PTSD can inform strategies to promote help-seeking. We conducted a qualitative study to identify determinants of PTSD treatment initiation among 44 U.S. military veterans from the Vietnam and Afghanistan/Iraq wars; half were and half were not receiving treatment. Participants described barriers to and facilitators of treatment initiation within themselves, the post-trauma socio-cultural environment, the health care and disability systems, and their social networks. Lack of knowledge about PTSD was a barrier that occurred at both the societal and individual levels. Another important barrier theme was the enduring effect of experiencing an invalidating socio-cultural environment following trauma exposure. In some cases, system and social network facilitation led to treatment initiation despite individual-level barriers, such as beliefs and values that conflicted with help-seeking. Our findings expand the dominant model of service utilization by explicit incorporation of factors outside the individual into a conceptual framework of PTSD treatment initiation. Finally, we offer suggestions regarding the direction of future research and the development of interventions to promote timely help-seeking for PTSD.",Psychiatry,2009 Fall,United States,2009,00
10682218,Schizophrenia: genes and environment.,"The historical and genetic foundations of our current understanding of schizophrenia are reviewed, as are the present and future directions for research. Genetic epidemiological investigations, including family, twin, and adoption studies have confirmed the contributions of genetic and environmental determinants of schizophrenia. For example, identical twins show average concordance rates of only 50%; rates of 100% would be expected on the basis of genetic equivalence alone. Genetic factors may cause errors in brain development and synaptic connections. A broad range of environmental components may further damage the brain. Biological components may include pregnancy and delivery complications, such as intrauterine fetal hypoxia, infections, and malnutrition. Primarily nonbiological components may include psychosocial stressors, such as residence in an urban area and dysfunctional family communication. It is likely that the environmental factors interact with the genetic liability in a negative manner to produce disorders in the schizophrenic spectrum. Genetic and environmental components of the disorder are examined, as well as their interactions in producing either neurodevelopmental syndromes or schizophrenia itself. The implication of these findings for prevention and treatment are considered.",Biological psychiatry,2000 Feb 1,United States,2000,00
19047539,Determinants of eating disorders symptomatology in Portuguese adolescents.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of psychological, biological, social, and familial characteristics and eating disorders symptomatology in 13-year-old Portuguese adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Schools in Porto, Portugal. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents born in 1990 and attending schools in Porto, Portugal (n = 2036) completed a questionnaire at school containing the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) and Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition. Anthropometrical measurements were also performed. A questionnaire addressing parents' characteristics was sent home with the adolescents. MAIN EXPOSURE: Psychological, biological, social, and familial characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three core EDI subscales. RESULTS: After using multiple regression analyses, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and depressive symptomatology for both sexes were positively associated with eating disorder symptomatology evaluated by the 3 core EDI subscales (drive for thinness, bulimia, body dissatisfaction). Parents' education had a significant positive effect on girls' drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction scores and a significant negative effect in boys' bulimia and body dissatisfaction scores. CONCLUSIONS: Higher body mass index and higher depressive symptomatology were associated with more severe eating disorder symptomatology in both sexes. A sex effect on the association between socioeconomic status and eating disorder symptomatology was found; girls with higher socioeconomic status and boys with lower socioeconomic status presented more eating disorder symptomatology.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00

Being aware of these determinants and systematically identifying them in patients has become crucial for the general practitioner in order to improve the way s/he delivers care and interacts with more vulnerable populations. Because the general practitioner is often in contact with people of different socioeconomic levels, s/he is a key witness of social inequalities in health.

19944934,Building the base: two active living projects that inspired community participation.,"BACKGROUND: Kalihi Valley is a densely populated, low-income community (28,958 residents in approximately 6 square miles) with insufficient sidewalks, bike lanes, and public green space to support regular physical activity for its residents. Kokua Kalihi Valley (KKV), a community health center formed in 1972, sought to improve Kalihi Valley's built environment based on its history of community- and partnership-based preventive health initiatives that have focused on the social determinants of health. INTERVENTION: Kokua Kalihi Valley used a flexible partnership model and a focus on direct community action to develop an unused 100-acre state park (the Kalihi Valley Nature Park) and establish a bicycle repair and recycling program that mobilized thousands of community volunteers, attracted widespread media coverage, and established a number of innovative programs for active living. Kokua Kalihi Valley and its partners also contributed to the successful passage of a city charter amendment to prioritize Honolulu as a bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly city. RESULTS: This initiative was successful in reclaiming a substantial amount of land for active living and in stimulating both public governmental support and widespread private community involvement in programs and activities. LESSONS LEARNED: Projects that engaged community members in activities with tangible accomplishment were shown to be most successful. CONCLUSIONS: This initiative showed that community health centers may be uniquely positioned to provide leadership and assume responsibility for cross-sectoral active-living health projects.",American journal of preventive medicine,2009 Dec,Netherlands,2009,00
11191245,Mental ability age 11 years and health status age 77 years.,"OBJECTIVES: to measure the effects of childhood mental ability on health in old age. DESIGN: longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: community-based. PARTICIPANTS: survivors of the 1932 Scottish Mental Survey cohort randomly selected from the Community Health Index in North East Scotland. MEASUREMENTS: (i) presence of disease by diagnostic category; (ii) cardiovascular, respiratory, anthropomorphic, sensory and locomotor physiological variables; (iii) Barthel index of functional independence; (iv) socio-demographic and socio-economic variables as health status predictors; and (v) score on the Moray House Test in 1932. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in Moray House Test score in 1932 between those with (mean 39.7, S.D. 13.8) and without (mean 40.1, S.D. 12.1) current disease (F = 0.04, P = 0.84). Physiological health status was predicted by demi-span (F = 6.87, P< 0.001), sex (F = 3.69, P = 0.001), deprivation category (F = 1.45, P = 0.05) and the interaction between sex and deprivation category (F = 2.01, P = 0.002). Moray House Test score in 1932 correlated significantly and positively with Barthel score (r = 0.24, P < 0.001). No additional general linear models added any other significant socio-economic variable once Moray House Test Score in 1932 was entered. Moray House Test score in 1932 remained significant (beta = 0.16, P = 0.024) after Mini Mental State Examination score was entered and found to be significant (beta = 0.21, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: socio-economic and socio-environmental factors are important determinants of some aspects of inequalities in health in old age in this cohort.

Now as many people in the world are overweight as underweight. Increasing obesity is a serious public health as well as economic problem. Its associated greater risks of high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, some cancers and other health problems consume considerable proportions of healthcare budgets. Health inequalities often reflect social inequalities, but with overweight there is also a male-female difference in the relationship between overweight and socioeconomic status. Health promotion campaigns are underestimating the social determinants of health, and ""risk fatigue"" is affecting attitudes to complying with healthy lifestyle standards.

15474198,"A multilevel analysis of race, community disadvantage, and body mass index among adults in the US.","This study examined the contributions of both individual socioeconomic status (SES) and community disadvantage in explaining the higher body mass index (BMI) of black adults in the US. Data from a national survey of adults (1986 American's Changing Lives Study) were combined with tract-level community data from the 1980 census. Results of multilevel regression analyses showed that black women had an age-adjusted BMI score three points higher than non-black women. Individual SES (income, education, assets) was negatively associated with BMI in women, but it only reduced the association between race and BMI from 2.99 to 2.50. Adding community socioeconomic disadvantage index further reduced the race coefficient slightly from 2.50 to 2.21. Nevertheless, living in communities with higher socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with higher BMI net of age, race, individual SES, smoking, physical activity, stress, and social support. Community income inequality (Gini) had an independent positive association with BMI, but did not substantially reduce racial differences among women. Community percent black was not associated with BMI. Results for men demonstrated no statistically significant racial differences in BMI, and no association between BMI and either individual SES or community disadvantage. Although individual SES and community socioeconomic disadvantage each partly explained the higher average BMI among black women, clear racial disparities persisted. Moreover, race, individual SES, community socioeconomic disadvantage, and individual health behaviors were each independent predictors of BMI among women. Unexplained within- and between-community variance in BMI remained among both women and men, with most unexplained variation due to within-community variance. Because our evidence for women suggests that the determinants of obesity are multiple and multilevel, attempts to address this growing social problem will similarly require a multi-faceted and multilevel approach.",Social science & medicine (1982),2004 Dec,England,2004,00
17908738,Determinants of child-parent agreement in quality-of-life reports: a European study of children with cerebral palsy.,"OBJECTIVES: The differences between child self-reports and parent proxy reports of quality of life in a large population of children with cerebral palsy were studied. We examined whether child characteristics, severity of impairment, socioeconomic factors, and parental stress were associated with parent proxy reports being respectively higher or lower than child self-reports of quality of life. METHODS: This study was conducted in 2004-2005 and assessed child quality of life (using the Kidscreen questionnaire, 10 domains, each scored 0-100) through self-reports and parent proxy reports of 500 children aged 8 to 12 years who had cerebral palsy and were living in 7 countries in Europe. RESULTS: The mean child-reported scores of quality of life were significantly higher than the parent proxy reports in 8 domains, significantly lower for the finances domain, and similar for the emotions domain. The average frequency of disagreement (child-parent difference greater than half an SD of child scores) over all domains was 64%, with parents rating their child's quality of life lower than the children themselves in 29% to 57% of child-parent pairs. We found that high levels of stress in parenting negatively influenced parents' perception of their child's quality of life, whereas the main factor explaining parents' ratings of children's quality of life higher than the children themselves is self-reported severe child pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the factors associated with disagreement are different according to the direction of disagreement. In particular, parental well-being and child pain should be taken into account in the interpretation of parent proxy reports, especially when no child self-report of quality of life is available. In the latter cases, it may be advisable to obtain additional proxy reports (from caregivers, teachers, or clinicians) to obtain complementary information on the child's quality of life.",Pediatrics,2007 Oct,United States,2007,00
15194516,Does it make sense in a coherent way? Determinants of sense of coherence in Swedish women 40 to 50 years of age.,"The aim of this study was to explore how socioeconomic and psychosocial life experiences in childhood and at adult age influence the level of sense of coherence (SOC) in women. The idea was to seek empirical support for establishing whether SOC is an individual construct being developed in early life and basically resistant toward adverse environmental factors or rather an entity influenced by adult psychosocial factors and as such, sensitive to health promotion activities; that is, if evidence could be found for a causal direction from classic factors involved in health promotion, such as social network and support, to SOC. A questionnaire (Krantz & Ostergren, 1999) was mailed to a random sample of 486 women, equivalent to 50% of the women between the ages of 40 and 50 in a medium-sized municipality (population 13,200) in Sweden. The response rate was 81.7% (397 women). Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate bivariate associations between socioeconomic and psychosocial variables and low SOC. Logistic regression analysis was used to test for confounding and as a method of analyzing the structure of tentative causal chains. It was found that adult factors such as job strain (OR = 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11-5.54), low social support (OR = 4.00, CI = 2.48-6.46), and low social anchorage (OR = 4.14, CI = 2.57-6.67) were independent predictors for low SOC in adult women. Childhood conditions such as family disruption and child abuse proved not to influence SOC to a statistically significant degree. Our study suggests that SOC is an entity partly associated with an individual's position in the social structure and partly by work conditions and social network and support rather than by childhood conditions. We could not claim this study to be a critical test of Antonovsky's (1979) theories in the full refutationistic sense. To approach this goal, it would take a carefully designed prospective study assessing the effect of different factors on SOC in a true life course perspective.",International journal of behavioral medicine,2004,England,2004,00
14960428,The use of Chinese herbal medicines and their correlates in Chinese older adults: the Singapore Chinese Longitudinal Aging Study.,"BACKGROUND: There are very few studies of the use of Chinese herbal medicine and their psychosocial and health-related determinants in older adults. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of use of Chinese herbal medicine in community-living Chinese older adults in Singapore and its associations with socio-economic status, social support, health behaviour, health and functional status. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of baseline data from a longitudinal cohort study of old adults (Singapore Chinese Longitudinal Aging Study). SETTING: Community of Toa Payoh in Singapore (total population 22800 out of 3 million). PARTICIPANTS: community residents comprising 2010 Chinese older adults aged 65 years and above. MEASUREMENTS: participants completed a questionnaire on Chinese herbal medicine use and other information on psychosocial and health-related variables. RESULTS: The use of Chinese herbal medicine over the past year was reported by 25.3% of the subjects, among whom 52% reported concurrent use of Western prescription medications. Significant factors that were strongly and independently associated with Chinese herbal medicine use were limited to extensive social support (OR = 2.66-5.56), current smoking (OR = 1.35), regular taiqi (OR = 1.94), arthritis (OR = 2.36), cancer (OR = 3.15), hypnotic use (OR = 2.08), IADL disability (OR = 1.72) and poor treatment compliance (OR = 2.35). CONCLUSION: Positive and negative psychosocial and health-related factors determine the use of Chinese herbal medicine use in Chinese older adults, consistent with the dual-pattern use of Chinese herbal medicine as health supplement and complementary/alternative medicine.",Age and ageing,2004 Mar,England,2004,00
12508329,Determinants of posttraumatic adjustment in adolescents from Sarajevo who experienced war.,"The purpose of this study was to examine risk and protective factors of postwar adjustment among adolescents from Sarajevo who have been exposed to war traumas during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. More specifically, we wanted to examine differential linkages between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms and depression (as outcomes) and (a) war traumas, (b) individual and socioenvironmental factors, and (c) cognitive appraisals and coping mechanisms. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicate that dimensions of war traumas, individual characteristics, and cognitive appraisals and coping mechanisms play a significant role in determining who will have more serious PTSD symptoms. Although individual and socioenvironmental factors are the strongest predictors of depression, dimensions of war traumas also are significantly correlated with depressive symptoms. Common risk factors for more serious depression and PTSD symptoms in postwar adjustment were female gender and low optimism. While the strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress reactions (PTSR) was trauma experience in the category of loss, the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms was female gender.",Journal of clinical psychology,2003 Jan,United States,2003,00
15639629,Sociomicrobiology: the connections between quorum sensing and biofilms.,"In the past decade, significant debate has surrounded the relative contributions of genetic determinants versus environmental conditions to certain types of human behavior. While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria. Bacteria exhibit many social activities and they represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level. Therefore, we introduce the term 'sociomicrobiology'.",Trends in microbiology,2005 Jan,England,2005,00
10814692,Social support and personal models of diabetes as predictors of self-care and well-being: a longitudinal study of adolescents with diabetes.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether peer support and illness representation mediate the link between family support, self-management and well-being. METHOD: Fifty-two adolescents (12-18 years old) with Type I diabetes were recruited and followed over 6 months, completing assessments of self-management, well-being, and social support. RESULTS: Perceived impact of diabetes and supportive family and friends were prospectively predictive of participants' well-being measures. Although support from family and friends was predictive of better dietary self-care, this relationship was mediated by personal model beliefs. In particular, beliefs about the effectiveness of the diabetes treatment regimen to control diabetes was predictive of better dietary self-care. CONCLUSIONS: Both friends and family are important to support adolescents as they live with and manage their diabetes. Personal models of diabetes are important determinants of both dietary self-care and well-being. In addition, personal models may serve to mediate the relationship between social support and dietary behavior.",Journal of pediatric psychology,2000 Jun,United States,2000,00
19001844,Do socio-economic disparities in dental treatment needs exist in Lithuanian adolescents?,"OBJECTIVE: To explore disparities in needs for dental treatment which arise from individual and area-based socio-economic determinants. RESEARCH DESIGN: A cross-sectional study conducted in 22 randomly selected Lithuanian areas. SETTING: In each of the pre-selected areas, one secondary school was randomly chosen. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 885 15-16-year-olds participated. Outcome measures. Dental treatment need was evaluated following the WHO guidelines and aQuantitative Summative Dental Treatment Needs Index (QSDTNI) was used to calculate the total burden of needs. The information about socio-economical determinants was obtained from a structured questionnaire and national statistics database. Individual socio-economic status (SES) measures were: parents' occupation, family structure, family income and affordability to have holiday used as a proxy measure for income. The area-based SES estimates were: unemployment, average household income, educational attainment, natural increase/decrease of population in an area and net migration rate. Data was analyzed by bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: None of significant bivariate associations between individual socio-economic variables and the QSDTNI were detected. Among area-based variables natural increase/decrease of population in an area and net migration rate were significantly related to the QSDTNI. Two individual and two area-based factors were extracted and introduced into Linear Multiple Regression Analysis (LMR). The LMR model was significant, but only one factor, i.e. area demographics, significantly contributed to this model. CONCLUSION: There are no clear social disparities in dental treatment needs in Lithuanian adolescents.",Stomatologija,2008,Lithuania,2008,00
19477848,IUHPE and social determinants of health: setting an action agenda.,"This commentary introduces the recently created IUHPE Global Working Group (GWG) on Social Determinants of Health, which provides a unique opportunity to bring a global health promotion response to the social inequalities that result from the unequal distribution of the social determinants of health.The two launch meetings of the GWG, which were held in the context of the conference ;Closing the gap in a generation', enabled direct discussion and reaction with respect to the implementation of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health's (CSDH) recommendations. Over the course of these meetings the group identified five main areas of work to specifically focus on over the next 18 months, leading to the 20th IUHPE World Conference on ;Health, equity and sustainable development'.

10972440,The development of international health policies--accountability intact?,"International health governance as it exists today is facing major structural challenges in view of globalization, the increased transfer of international health risks and the mounting challenge of health inequalities worldwide. As a consequence the capacity of nation states to ensure population health and to address major health determinants has been weakened. This paper explores health as an exemplary field to illustrate that we have entered a new era of public policy which is defined by increasing overlaps between domestic and foreign policy, multilateral and bilateral strategies and national and international interest. Cross border spill overs and externalities of national actions need to move into the core of public policy at the national and global level within a new rules based system. A new perspective on global health governance is further necessitated through the increased number of players in the global health arena. The organizational form that is emerging is based on networks and is characterized by shifting alliances and blurred lines of responsibility. The paper explores the emerging paradox of state sovereignty and makes a set of proposals to pool state sovereignty on health and structure the myriad of networks. Particular attention is given to the role of the World Health Organization within this process of change and adjustment. In using a framework from international relations analysis the paper explores how nation states are socialized into accepting new norms, values and perceptions of interest with regard to national and international health and what challenges emerge for the WHO in ""inventing"" global health policy.",Social science & medicine (1982),2000 Sep,England,2000,00
19669070,Socioeconomic inequalities and child mental health.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between sociodemographic determinants and the development of social competence and behavior problems in children. METHODS: Cross-sectional study performed with 479 school children aged between six and 13 years, enrolled in the first grade of public elementary schools of the city of Sao Goncalo, Southeastern Brazil, in 2005. Socioeconomic variables, family structure, parents' level of education, child ethnicity, and social competence and behavior problems were analyzed. Prevalence ratios with respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Data shown were expanded to the population of students of the school network investigated. RESULTS: Children who were below the poverty line, who had black skin color, whose parents had low level of education, and lived with single-parent families or comprised by stepmother/stepfather showed lower social competence and more behavior problems. The higher the risk factors, the higher the prevalence of children with low social competence and behavior problems. CONCLUSIONS: The association between sociodemographic determinants and higher prevalence of behavior problems and lower social competence in children requires that preventive and care actions should be prioritized by public policies, reducing severe social and emotional difficulties in children, which may continue into adulthood.",Revista de saude publica,2009 Aug,Brazil,2009,00
15002679,Assessing population need for mental health care: a review of approaches and predictors.,"This review aimed to clarify the concept of need, explore the different approaches used to assess need, and contribute to an improved understanding of predictor and intervening factors in assessing need for mental health services. Two population-based needs assessment approaches have been identified: modeling need for services and surveys of the general population. The most widely used model was that based on the Jarman-8 index of social deprivation. The population-based epidemiological surveys addressed perceived need by seeking direct, self-reported measures of individuals' perceptions of their needs for care. Although many studies have reported correlates of service use, few have attempted to identify correlates of perceived need. The fact that two-thirds to three-quarters of people were identified as meeting criteria for a mental health disorder, but did not report receiving treatment, highlighted a gap between epidemiology and service use. This gap could be explained by a number of intervening factors such as the discordance between diagnosis and disability, the determinants of and barriers to help-seeking behavior, the belief systems concerning appropriate treatments, and choice of health professionals. This review has thus identified the predictor variables which are important for a comprehensive analysis of need for mental health care. Suggestions and challenges have been put forward to address the identified gaps in assessing population need.",Mental health services research,2004 Mar,United States,2004,00
15840554,"Social, behavioral, and metabolic determinants of plasma viscosity in the Whitehall II Study.","PURPOSE: To examine the social, biological, and metabolic associations of plasma viscosity in a large epidemiological study. METHODS: Plasma viscosity was measured from 4548 men and 1837 women that took part in the fifth phase of the Whitehall II Study (1997-1999). Employment grade was used as a measure of social position. RESULTS: A strong inverse relation between employment grade and plasma viscosity was evident (p < 0.0001). This employment grade gradient was apparent overall, and among non-smokers and when participants with poor health were removed from the analyses. Plasma viscosity was associated with a number of biological factors that are themselves socially determined, including fibrinogen (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p < 0.001), fasting insulin (p < 0.001), and height (p < 0.001). Associations with smoking and alcohol intake were apparent in women. In men a U-shaped curve was apparent such that those drinking between 11 and 24 units/week had the lowest plasma viscosity. Alcohol intake, physical activity, and smoking explained 18% of the grade gradient in men and 40% in women while the biological factors examined accounted for 35% in men and 40% in women. CONCLUSION: There is a grade gradient in plasma viscosity which was not fully explained by health related behaviors or measured risk factors for CHD. These data suggest that additional factors that contribute to the rheological properties of plasma may contribute to the explanation for social inequalities in cardiovascular disease.",Annals of epidemiology,2005 May,United States,2005,00
17850407,Illness perception and health-related quality of life in multiple sclerosis.,"AIMS - A number of physical and psychological factors have been shown to affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Among these, the role of illness perceptions has not been established as an independent factor. This study, the first of its kind in an Australian population, aimed to use a large sample to determine the relative importance of individual factors to each domain of HRQoL, in particular the role of illness perception. MATERIALS AND METHODS - 580 patients with confirmed MS were assessed cross sectionally in a designated research clinic to determine the relative impact of physical factors (illness severity, duration, age, fatigue and pain) and psychological factors (mood, cognition and illness representations) on each domain of the SF-36. RESULTS - Categorical regression analysis showed that a combination of physical and psychological factors predicted 38-71% of variance in HRQoL. Illness perception was shown to have an independent effect on HRQoL in MS. The Extended Disability Status Scale was a significant determinant in all domains except for mental health. Depression was less prevalent than anxiety, but had a greater effect on function. CONCLUSION - Illness perception is an independent factor contributing to HRQoL in people with MS. Individual domains of HRQoL are associated with different patterns of physical and psychological factors. In the domains of role and social function, activities most highly valued by patients with MS, depression, anxiety, fatigue and illness perceptions are key determinants, all of which have the potential to be improved through specific interventions.",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,2007 Nov,Denmark,2007,00

In 2000, a total of 5357 employees were interviewed regarding age, gender, family status, education, health behaviour, employer characteristics and work environment. They were followed in a national register for 18 months in order to identify subjects with 2 weeks or more of sickness absence. They were followed for an additional 12 months in order to establish associations between baseline measurements and time to first return to work. A total of 930 (17.4%) employees experienced sickness absence in the 18 months after baseline. During the 12-month follow-up, 856 (92.0%) returned to work, the mean absence period being 6.6 weeks. Prolonged time to first return to work was associated with female gender, increased age, no post-school education, being employed by a public employer, working at a workplace with 20 or more employees, high emotional demands in work, high job insecurity and sedentary work. There were no associations between health behaviour variables and return to work. The study indicates a potential for promoting return to work through interventions targeting emotional job demands, job insecurity and decreasing the risks associated with sedentary work.",International journal of rehabilitation research.

We present total cholesterol values and their possible aetiological factors of young Swiss conscripts. Particularly, we study varying impact of these factors depending on different levels of individual cholesterol. METHODS: Male conscripts (n = 19,272) of the 2005 census of the conscripts have been examined, reflecting ca. 59% of a total Swiss male birth cohort. Quantile regression allows us to analyse responses of arbitrary quantiles with respect to variables of interest. RESULTS: Eleven percent of all conscripts show clinically important increased total cholesterol levels. There is a major association of high individual cholesterol level with French regional language. The largest socio-economic subsample--agricultural and construction workers--show significantly higher individual cholesterol levels than employees in the industry sector and students, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to find that culture, as indicated by the mother tongue, and socioeconomic status as indicated by profession/vocation, influence individual total cholesterol levels while climate as indicated by altitude does not have an influence on cholesterol levels. Such a broad screening programme offers a unique opportunity to target persons at high-risk for CVD morbidity and mortality already early in life.",Swiss medical weekly,2008 May 3,Switzerland,2008,00
17240065,"The role of avoidance, pacing, and other activity patterns in chronic pain.","The level and pattern of daily activities performed by persons with chronic pain are regarded as central determinants of their overall physical, social and emotional functioning. Within the chronic pain literature, various approaches to activity are typically considered, including activity avoidance, ""pacing"", and particular patterns of high rate activity, sometimes referred to as ""overuse"" or ""activity cycling"". Of these, activity avoidance has been most studied, while the others remain poorly understood. The purpose of this investigation was to examine distinct activity patterns of chronic pain sufferers, and to consider their relations with physical, social, and emotional functioning. Based on data from 276 individuals with chronic pain, four distinct activity patterns were identified with cluster analysis. Correlation and group comparison analyses confirmed that patients who avoid activity suffer greater physical disability and distress. Surprisingly, pacing activity was positively related to avoidance and disability. Patients who reported relatively high activity in conjunction with little avoidance demonstrated distinctly better physical and emotional functioning than other groups. Pain did not distinguish groups to a large extent but acceptance of pain did. Groups with the most avoidance and disability reported the lowest levels of acceptance of pain. These data suggest that activity patterns are complex and multidimensional, and that avoidance appears to be the overriding process with regard to daily functioning. Moreover, avoidance patterns may be subtle, sometimes resembling healthy coping, and sometimes presenting along side patterns of high activity.",Pain,2007 Jul,United States,2007,00

Our aim is to identify factors associated with disclosure to partner in patients taking antiretroviral treatment, with a gender- and sex-based approach. In this study conducted in Mali and Burkina Faso, men (154) and women (164) who reported being in a marital or cohabitating relationship were included. Sex-specific bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify determinants of disclosure. Disclosure to partner was 72.1% in men and 79.9% in women. Results of bivariate and multivariate analyses indicated that cohabiting with partner was strongly associated with disclosure in both men and women. In men only, older age, literacy and having good communication with the treating doctor were significantly associated with disclosure. Among women, disclosure was associated with having children and high self-reported importance of religion. Future research and interventions promoting disclosure should take into account these differences reflecting the social construction of gender roles in these settings.",World health & population,2008,Canada,2008,00
19167058,Trade and social determinants of health.,"The effects of trade and trade liberalisation on the social determinants of health are not well known. Here, we outline a conceptual framework of links between trade liberalisation and health outcomes, and review existing evidence for these by focusing on four key factors: income, inequality, economic insecurity, and unhealthy diets. Even though trade liberalisation seems to have positive effects on economic growth, it is not sufficient to boost growth. In several countries, trade reforms have not translated into enhanced economic expansion because complementary policies are needed. Trade liberalisation and openness are associated with greater wage inequality and raised economic insecurity. Trade liberalisation has facilitated availability of highly processed, calorie-rich, nutrient-poor food in developing countries, but further research is needed to better understand the effects of trade on unhealthy diets. Policymakers and health professionals need to be aware that the global economy affects the health of populations and understand how risks associated with trade liberalisation can be mitigated.","Lancet (London, England)",2009 Feb 7,England,2009,00
19008371,"Ladders, pyramids and champagne: the iconography of health inequities.","Conceptual models are crucial for theorising, depicting and explaining population distributions of health inequities. This is because a visual conceptual model, like a map, can simultaneously organise and spur ideas and observations. Incorporating both imagery and metaphor, visual models not only illustrate key constructs and causal relationships specified by scientific theories but also provide an important tool for integrating and evaluating rapidly emerging findings and for guiding new research. It therefore is instructive to consider and contrast different sets of images appearing in the public health, policy and popular literature pertaining to (1) social stratification, (2) determinants of population health and (3) determinants of health inequities. At issue is how different types of images illuminate, or obscure, the relevant causal processes that need to be altered to improve population health and reduce health inequities. Of particular concern are conceptual confusions created when (a) models inaccurately depict the distribution of population and resources and (b) models of determinants of population health, rather than of determinants of health inequities, are used in discussions about social inequalities in health. Although perhaps a pragmatic argument can be made for use of less politically controversial imagery in policy-oriented documents, I would argue that the public's health will be better served by an iconoclastic iconography, one that clearly and unequivocally delineates the social facts of skewed distributions of power and resources and depicts the societal processes that generate and maintain these distributions and their embodiment in population levels and distributions of health, disease and well-being.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2008 Dec,England,2008,00
15603114,Occupational violence in an Australian healthcare setting: implications for managers.,"Occupational violence is a worldwide, multifaceted problem affecting all industries, including healthcare. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the experiences of 158 allied health professionals, 135 doctors, and 1229 nurses working in a rural area in eastern Australia. Response rates were 72 percent for allied health professionals and 62 percent for general practitioners (GPs) and nurses. Proportionately more nurses experienced occupational violence than did allied health providers and GPs. During the past 12 months (August 2001 to July 2002), 68 percent of nurses, compared with 47 percent of allied health providers and 48 percent of GPs, reported violence. All three professional groups indicated that the most distressing occupational violence was perpetrated by patients, followed by patients' relatives. The most frequent form of occupational violence was verbal abuse, followed by threatening behavior, physical violence, and obscene behavior. No statistically significant difference in the prevalence of violence was found among the different allied health professional disciplines or fields of nursing. Health services management strategies addressing occupational violence need to be comprehensive and multidisciplinary in scope. Strategies to minimize violence need to focus on resource allocation, cultural change, and perseverance. Systems to monitor violence are a priority. Further research into the determinants of this pattern of violence is required.",Journal of healthcare management / American College of Healthcare Executives,2004 Nov-Dec,United States,2004,00
16624798,The health buck stops where? Thematic framing of health discourse to understand the context for CVD prevention.,"Using a constructed week methodology, we analyzed media summaries for the type of health discourse (health care delivery, disease-specific prevention, lifestyle risk factors, public/environmental health disease, social determinants of health) portrayed over a 5-year period as a means of describing the context within which health staff worked to prevent heart disease in one Canadian province. The results reveal that heart disease received very little media coverage, despite provincial health data revealing it to be the leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and health care costs. Coverage of the health care system dominated the media landscape over the 5-year period. The study findings also suggest that the health discourses in the media summaries were represented as primarily thematic, rather than as episodic narratives, relieving any one level of government as entirely responsible for the health of its constituents. Media advocacy strategies may be a means to redress the imbalance of health discourses presented by the media.",Journal of health communication,2006 Apr-May,United States,2006,00
16529167,[A search for psychobiological determinants of anxiety disorders].,"UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to search for measurable, objective, and reproducible biological factors such as gene polymorphisms that increase the risk of an anxiety disorder, distinguishing personality traits predisposing to the anxiety disorder. The material comprised 103 patients fulfilling criteria of an anxiety disorder (panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders, phobic disorders) and a control group of 100 subjects matched for age and free of neuropsychiaric disease. METHODS: The genes studied were: COMT (catechol-oxygen-methyltransferase), MAO-A (monoamine oxidase A), and 5-HTT-LPR (serotonine transporter). Isolation of human genomic DNA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis on agarose gel were part of the study protocol. Anxiety disorders were diagnosed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The following psychometric tests were applied: TCI (R. Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory), R. B. Cattell's Inventory, C. D. Spielberger's questionnaire, and Beck's depression scale. RESULTS: There were no associations of COMT, MAO-A, and 5-HTT-LPR gene polymorphisms with anxiety disorders in the study and control groups. A higher level of anxiety as a ""status"" and as a ""trait"" were revealed in both groups (p < 0.001). TCI scales and subscales, as well as Cattell's personality factors, demonstrated significant differences between patients with anxiety disorders and controls. Depression was more severe in patients with anxiety disorders (p < 0.001). An association of COMT gene polymorphism with simple phobia (p < 0.004) was revealed. Mutation of 5-HTT-LPR carr tended to be more frequent (p < 0.07) among patients with generalized anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Gene mutations that may account for increased risk of generalized anxiety, phobic disorder (simple and social), and agoraphobia were found, as well as gene variants determining temperament traits typical for patients with anxiety disorders. The depression level was higher in patients with anxiety disorders. TCI and Cattell's personality inventory distinguish personality traits typical for such patients.",Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis,2004,Poland,2004,00
18063898,[Introduction of health impact assessment and healthy cities as a tool for tackling health inequality].,"In order to reduce the health inequalities within a society changes need to be made in broad health determinants and their distribution in the population. It has been expected that the Health impact assessment(HIA) and Healthy Cities can provide opportunities and useful means for changing social policy and environment related with the broad health determinants in developed countries. HIA is any combination of procedures or methods by which a proposed 4P(policy, plan, program, project) may be judged as to the effects it may have on the health of a population. Healthy city is one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community resources which enable people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and in developing to their maximum potential. In Korea, social and academic interest regarding the HIA and Healthy Cities has been growing recently but the need of HIA and Healthy Cities in the perspective of reducing health inequality was not introduced adequately. So we reviewed the basic concepts and methods of the HIA and Healthy Cities, and its possible contribution to reducing health inequalities. We concluded that though the concepts and methods of the HIA and Healthy Cities are relatively new and still in need of improvement, they will be useful in approaching the issue of health inequality in Korea.",Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,2007 Nov,Korea (South),2007,00
17068928,Positive identity as a positive youth development construct: conceptual bases and implications for curriculum development.,"According to the theories of Erikson, Marcia, and Higgins, adolescents who can cultivate a clear and positive identity after their developmental struggles in adolescence often advance more smoothly into adulthood. Identity is organized, learned, and dynamic, and subjective evaluation of an individual's identity has emotional consequences for that individual. This paper discusses literature on the nature and importance of identity and presents strategies such as self-esteem enhancement, management of exploration and commitment, as well as reduction of self-discrepancies to help adolescents develop functional identity. Significant determinants of a person's identity development, namely gender and cultural issues, are also addressed as they are important in designing the ""Positive Identity Development"" package of Positive Adolescent Training through Holistic Social Programmes (P.A.T.H.S.), supported by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, to help adolescents develop a positive identity.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2006 Jul-Sep,Germany,2006,00
18404392,"Social determinants, suboptimal health behavior, and morbidity in urban slum population: an Indian perspective.","Improving the health of urban residents, particularly those living in slum areas, requires an integrated approach. Appropriate interventions must be based on a well-grounded understanding of health determinants. Social factors are as important as physical factors in determining health status and suggest alternative interventions. Employment, stress, social exclusion, social support, substance use, nutrition, transport, and conditions during childhood are among the most important social determinants of health status identified by the International Center for Health and Society. This paper uses social determinants of health approach to understand morbidity outcomes for people residing in the slums of Surat City, India. To quantify suboptimal health behavior and identify the determinants of health status for this population survey data on household characteristics, health-seeking behavior, socioeconomic status, food and personal habits, social life, and physical activity has been used. After controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors, logistic regression analysis reveals that social exclusion, stress, and lack of social support are significantly associated with morbidity. Thus, understanding of social determinants of health by policy makers is important as the health sector has a crucial role in addressing disparities in social determinants.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2008 Jul,United States,2008,00

First, I present theory emphasizing the unique position of lesbians/gays in families of origin and the significance of ""families of choice."" Second, I review the quantitative research on social support received by lesbians/gays from family of origin, friends, and other social network sources. Third, I demonstrate how the dominant clinical opinion about coming out to family is based on an unwarranted use of theory developed for heterosexuals and on overgeneralization of findings from studies of white, upper-middle-class, North American lesbians/gays. Fourth, I propose five determinants of lesbian/gay persons' decisions to come out to family-of-origin members. Fifth, I argue that such decisions are constrained by ""realistic"" costs/benefits in various sociocultural niches rather than being a simple function of individuals' levels of differentiation. Lastly, I offer an expanded contextual stance for the family therapist working with lesbian/gay clients.",Family process,2000 Summer,United States,2000,00
11841523,Tensions in antibiotic prescribing: pitting social concerns against the interests of individual patients.,"BACKGROUND: To reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the community, physicians must optimize their use of antibiotics. However, optimal use from the perspective of the community (reserving newer agents for future use) is not always consistent with optimal use from the perspective of the individual patient (prescribing newer, broader agents). OBJECTIVES: To identify preferred patterns of antibiotic prescribing for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), measure explicit attitudes toward antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, and determine the relationship between these prescribing patterns and attitudes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional anonymous mail survey. PARTICIPANTS: National random sample of 400 generalist physicians (general internal medicine and family practice) and 429 infectious diseases specialists. MEASUREMENTS: Rank ordering of antibiotic preferences for a hypothetical outpatient with CAP and reasons for antibiotic selection. Endorsement of attitudes regarding antibiotic prescribing decisions and resistance. RESULTS: Both generalists and infectious diseases specialists were more likely to prefer newer, broader drugs for the treatment of CAP compared to older agents still recommended by national guidelines. Physicians rated the issue of contributing to antibiotic resistance lowest among 7 determinants of their choices. CONCLUSIONS: Despite national guidelines and increasing public awareness, the public health concern of contributing to the problem of antibiotic resistance does not exert a strong impact on physician prescribing decisions for CAP. Future efforts to optimize antibiotic prescribing decisions will need to consider options for increasing the impact of public health issues on the patient-oriented decisions of individual physicians.",Journal of general internal medicine,2002 Feb,United States,2002,00
11264268,Health from the patient's point of view. How does it relate to the physician's judgement?,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of self-rated health to a measure of physical status, based on a professional rating of the individual's health from a strictly physical point of view. METHODS: A random selection of 407 people over the age of 20 from the north-western catchment area of greater Stockholm were invited in 1995 to a physical examination, including a self-report questionnaire with questions about self-rated health, lifestyle, psychosocial factors and quality of life. A measure of physical health on a 5-point graded scale was constructed using the information from the records of the physical examination as a base. RESULTS: Self-rated health and the professional ratings of health coincided in approximately 60% of the cases. There were a relatively large number of cases where the ratings were contradictory. The correlation between the scales was 0.45. Comparison between the two ratings with respect to association with potential determinants showed that physical factors naturally explained most of the variances in physical health, whereas social and mental well-being and somatic conditions (women) were the most important explanatory variables for self-rated health. Irrespective of whether they had ""favourable"" or ""unfavourable"" health, those with ""poor"" self-rated health also had perceived lower social and mental well-being, less appreciation, more somatic conditions (women) and worse coping abilities (men). CONCLUSIONS: With mental, psychosocial and social problems becoming more pronounced in sickness patterns for primary care patients, self-rated health could be a helpful device, especially when time resources for consultations are short. This measure could also give a more global view of the patient's situation when effectivity and rationality can be a threat to a holistic view of the patient.",Family practice,2001 Apr,England,2001,00
15704819,Changing ecological determinants of conduct problems from early adolescence to early adulthood.,"Changes in conduct problems from middle school through early adulthood were examined in a sample of 1191 African American and White males and females. Predictors were selected from a number of ecological contexts to examine the relative contribution of family, peer, school, and neighborhood factors to conduct problems during the 7th, 8th, and 11th grade and across transitions in middle school, into high school, and into young adulthood. Almost all contexts made a unique contribution to conduct problems except for the neighborhood setting. The variables that had the most regular influences during each of these periods were Family Consistent Control, Family Discipline Harshness, and Negative Peers. Positive family and positive peer variables had less consistent relations to outcomes. School variables were more influential in middle school than later. Few gender or race differences were found in the patterning of predictors across time. Studies using only one or two settings as predictors of conduct problems, may provide a misleading picture of their impact by excluding other contextual influences.",Development and psychopathology,2004 Fall,United States,2004,00
12914305,Bridging the equity gap: health promotion for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.,"Health is influenced by political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, behavioral and biological conditions--either positively or negatively. Health promotion aims to make these factors more favorable through health advocacy. Advocating for physical, mental, and social health requires that individuals with I/DD have opportunities to identify and realize their aspirations, develop the capacity to satisfy their needs, and possess the ability to adapt and/or cope with the environment. Because health is both an individual and a social responsibility, effective health promotion strategies must incorporate linkages between health and development, particularly for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups where deprivation in health and economic resources exist simultaneously and reinforce each other [6]. Incorporating health and development at the core of health promotion activities addresses issues of poverty, poor health, and unemployment, while accounting for social, cultural and economic differences. Health promotion enables people with I/DD to achieve their health goals by ensuring equal opportunities and resources. This includes having supportive environments, access to information, and life skills and opportunities to make healthy choices. People cannot achieve their health goals unless they can control health determinants. Health promotion efforts require coordinated action from all interested groups (e.g., government entities, health and other social and economic sectors, nongovernmental and voluntary organizations, local authorities, industry and media), including individuals, families and communities. Community-based health promotion emphasizes community participation, along with empowerment of community members to address inequities and increase control over their health [3]. Individual satisfaction and participation are critical components in community coalitions that are providing health promotion programs. Moreover, community leadership, shared decision-making, linkages with other organizations, and organizational climate can predict satisfaction, participation, and planning. Health becomes a resource for everyday life when individuals with I/DD are empowered and can participate in health promotion activities that are based in their community.",The Nursing clinics of North America,2003 Jun,United States,2003,00
19755191,"Testing a model of patient characteristics, psychologic status, and cognitive function as predictors of self-care in persons with chronic heart failure.","OBJECTIVE: Self-care is a key component in the management of chronic heart failure (CHF). Yet there are many barriers that interfere with a patient's ability to undertake self-care. The primary aim of the study was to test a conceptual model of determinants of CHF self-care. Specifically, we hypothesized that cognitive function and depressive symptoms would predict CHF self-care. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients hospitalized with CHF were assessed for self-care (Self-Care of Heart Failure Index), cognitive function (Mini Mental State Exam), and depressive symptoms (Cardiac Depression Scale) during their index hospital admission. Other factors thought to influence self-care were tested in the model: age, gender, social isolation, self-care confidence, and comorbid illnesses. Multiple regression was used to test the model and to identify significant individual determinants of self-care maintenance and management. RESULTS: The model of 7 variables explained 39% (F [7, 42] 3.80; P = .003) of the variance in self-care maintenance and 38% (F [7, 42] 3.73; P = .003) of the variance in self-care management. Only 2 variables contributed significantly to the variance in self-care maintenance: age (P < .01) and moderate-to-severe comorbidity (P < .05). Four variables contributed significantly to the variance in self-care management: gender (P < .05), moderate-to-severe comorbidity (P < .05), depression (P < .05), and self-care confidence (P < .01). When cognitive function was removed from the models, the model explained less of the variance in self-care maintenance (35%) (F [6, 43] 3.91; P = .003) and management (34%) (F [6, 43] 3.71; P = .005). CONCLUSION: Although cognitive function added to the model in predicting both self-care maintenance and management, it was not a significant predictor of CHF self-care compared with other modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. Depression explained only self-care management.",Heart & lung : the journal of critical care,2009 Sep-Oct,United States,2009,00
16275211,Main determinants of Global Assessment of Functioning score in schizophrenia: a European multicenter study.,"BACKGROUND: The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale is a measure widely used to assess the outcome of patients with schizophrenia. However, little is known about the importance of clinical and psychosocial variables in determining its final score. The aim of this paper is to identify which factors predict GAF scores of patients with schizophrenia and their variability in 5 different European settings. METHOD: A representative sample of 404 patients with schizophrenia was assessed with the GAF. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of the GAF scores. RESULTS: Clinical factors are the main determinants of GAF score. However, the analysis also showed that social and functioning factors were also significantly associated with GAF scores. Finally, the study showed the presence of intercenter differences in the factors, mainly in social functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The GAF is a useful and easy-to-apply measure of global functioning, independent of cross-cultural differences. Clinical factors are the main determinants of its score, although social functioning variables also have a lesser effect.",Comprehensive psychiatry,2005 Nov-Dec,United States,2005,00
18481032,[Quality of life of young patients with haemophilia in Europe].,"Haemophilia, an inherited x-linked bleeding disorder, is a rare disease with comparable prevalence worldwide, which leads to early disability if untreated, and which, if treated via substitution of blood clotting factor, is associated with high treatment costs. Recent research has focused on bio-psychosocial consequences of treatment from the patient's perspective, in order to identify new treatment approaches, to quantify the patient benefit, and to compare haemophilia care across countries. For this, generic and disease-specific instruments have been developed and are currently being used in studies. The present paper describes clinical aspects of haemophilia as well as the assessment of quality of life and proceeds to introduce two recent studies on quality of life of children and adolescents with haemophilia in Europe. The HAEMO-QoL study investigated the quality of life of 339 children with haemophilia age 4 and above from six European countries. A total of 1,424 patients from 21 European countries participated in the ESCHQoL study, among these were 444 children aged 4 and above years. In both studies clinical data, information about health care and psychosocial determinants such as coping, life satisfaction and social support were assessed. Significant differences in quality of life between countries were found. Psychosocial determinants were associated with quality of life. Current analyses suggest that important determinants for quality of life are availability of factor concentrate from the clinical side and social support from the psychosocial side. The difference in quality of life across countries is a future major health-political challenge.","Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz",2008 Jun,Germany,2008,00
19497127,A qualitative study on the acceptability and preference of three types of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets in Solomon Islands: implications for malaria elimination.,"BACKGROUND: In March 2008, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu governments raised the goal of their National Malaria Programmes from control to elimination. Vector control measures, such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (LLINs) are key integral components of this programme. Compliance with these interventions is dependent on their acceptability and on the socio-cultural context of the local population. These factors need to be investigated locally prior to programme implementation. METHOD: Twelve focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out in Malaita and Temotu Provinces, Solomon Islands in 2008. These discussions explored user perceptions of acceptability and preference for three brands of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) and identified a number of barriers to their proper and consistent use. RESULTS: Mosquito nuisance and perceived threat of malaria were the main determinants of bed net use. Knowledge of malaria and the means to prevent it were not sufficient to guarantee compliance with LLIN use. Factors such as climate, work and evening social activities impact on the use of bed nets, particularly in men. LLIN acceptability plays a varying role in compliance with their use in villages involved in this study. Participants in areas of reported high and year round mosquito nuisance and perceived threat of malaria reported LLIN use regardless of any reported unfavourable characteristics. Those in areas of low or seasonal mosquito nuisance were more likely to describe the unfavourable characteristics of LLINs as reasons for their intermittent or non-compliance. The main criterion for LLIN brand acceptability was effectiveness in preventing mosquito bites and malaria. Discussions highlighted considerable confusion around LLIN care and washing which may be impacting on their effectiveness and reducing their acceptability in Solomon Islands. CONCLUSION: Providing LLINs that are acceptable will be more important for improving compliance in areas of low or seasonal mosquito nuisance and malaria transmission. The implications of these findings on malaria elimination in Solomon Islands are discussed.",Malaria journal,2009 Jun 4,England,2009,00
11703553,A relational approach to providing care for a person suffering from dementia.,"AIMS OF THE PAPER: This paper examines the care provision for people suffering from dementia and explores the potential benefits associated with an approach to care that emphasizes the importance of relationships. BACKGROUND: Recent research findings have provided an incentive to re-evaluate the established approaches to care for this client group. Two separate studies identified education and intellectual stimulation as important determinants of the onset of Alzheimer's disease (Ott et al. 1995, Snowdon et al. 1996). These findings have encouraged the hypothesis that potential symptomatic benefits may be achieved by providing a more stimulating environment for people with dementia. METHODS: A case study is outlined which illustrates an approach to caring influenced by the Continental philosopher, Emmanuel Levinas. Primacy is given to the relationships that make up caring, and not to a method that sets out to achieve an identified objective. The issue of mutual responsibility within the provision of care is highlighted in the case study. FINDINGS: The hypothesis presented in this paper is that a person has more of an opportunity to develop to the limits of their potential by establishing the importance of relationships in providing care by means of education and training of the people involved. The beneficiaries might be the caregiver or the person in receipt of care. CONCLUSIONS: An environment that attempts to educate people to recognize the importance of relationships will be more effective in achieving the potential benefits of symptom alleviation identified by the research into Alzheimer's disease outlined in this paper.",Journal of advanced nursing,2001 Nov,England,2001,00
11886719,Frequency and determinants of vitamin A deficiency in children under 5 years of age with pneumonia.,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) has been closely related to acute respiratory infections (ARI), although information is still incomplete; for example, the frequency of VAD in children <5 years of age with pneumonia is not known, and the conditions associated with VAD have not been identified. This study was conducted to gain insight into the status of vitamin A in children with pneumonia. A secondary objective was to identify the sociodemographic, individual, and nutritional factors associated with VAD in these children. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Mexican state of Hidalgo, one of the poorest in the country. Children with community-acquired pneumonia treated at nine public hospitals were included. Information was obtained by interviewing mothers, and ascertainment of vitamin A status was performed with relative-dose-response (RDR) test. RESULTS: A total of 422 cases were included. VAD was identified in 17.8% of children; 50.3% showed normal results, 24.6% had liver reserve depletion, and 7.3% showed results attributable to the infectious process. Variables associated with VAD were as follows: age <2 months (OR 3.44, 95% CI: 1.84-9.24); children >6 months of age fed with formula (OR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.91), and affiliation with the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) health system (OR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.22-0.72). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of VAD in children with community-acquired pneumonia confirms that the problem of deficiency persists in Mexico. The associated factors for VAD found in this study can be taken into account when planning and evaluating vitamin A supplementation activities in populations with high risk for deficiency.",Archives of medical research,2002 Mar-Apr,United States,2002,00

Data come from a two-wave panel survey of 172 older Korean immigrants and 157 non-Hispanic White elders, with a follow-up period of 12 to 15 months. The sample was drawn from a three-stage probability sampling method. Ordinary least square regressions in a hierarchical process and change score method were used to analyze the two-wave panel data. Older Korean immigrants reported higher levels of psychological distress than the non-Hispanic White elderly at both Time 1 and Time 2. Changes in self-assessed health status and functional limitations were significantly associated with change in psychological distress for both ethnic groups. Increased social support significantly decreased psychological distress at Time 2, for older Korean immigrants only. This study discusses practice and policy implications for service and interventions for older immigrants to assist their adjustment to a host society.",Aging & mental health,2005 May,England,2005,00
11590521,Evaluation of the Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire as a tool for self-reported adherence assessment in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral regimens.,"PURPOSE: Adherence to antiretroviral medications is critically important for the success of therapy in patients treated for HIV infection. Patient self-report is a simple method to measure and explore adherence. Even though a variety of surveys have been developed to monitor self-reported adherence, there is no standardized instrument that may be used in routine clinical practice. The usefulness of the Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire (PMAQ) was evaluated in HIV-infected patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimens. METHOD: Data from 149 patients were collected. Study participants completed the PMAQ and provided blood samples to measure plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations and trough plasma levels of PI. Patients were considered adherent if they had a virologic response and/or had an adequate trough plasma level of PI. RESULTS: A close relationship was found between patient reports of adherence during the previous 4 days and objective measures such as HIV RNA level and plasma levels of PI. Motivation with regard to antiretroviral treatment, confidence in personal skills, and an optimistic attitude to life were identified as important determinants of adherence. On the other hand, sociodemographic background, social support, alcohol and illicit drug use, bothersome symptoms, and depression were not associated with a lower medication adherence. CONCLUSION: Patients' psychological and behavioral factors are central in the acceptance and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. To improve the feasibility and the reproducibility of the PMAQ, we propose a revised form of the PMAQ, focusing on the variables identified as strong predictors of adherence.",HIV clinical trials,2001 Mar-Apr,England,2001,00
16162117,Conceptual principles of quality of life: an empirical exploration.,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life is a popular measure of outcomes and its widespread use has led to recent calls for a better understanding of the construct, emphasizing the need to build a substantial body of knowledge around what determines perceptions of life quality. Three widely reported and used conceptual principles are examined in this study. METHODS: Self-ratings of life quality and three likely determinants at an individual level (stress), an interactional level (social support) and a community level (neighbourhood belonging) were used. The study involved two groups of young adults from an urban community, one identified as having an intellectual disability (ID). RESULTS Young adults with ID rated their satisfaction with health significantly higher and intimacy and community involvement lower than the comparison group. Social support emerged as the strongest predictor of life satisfaction across both groups.

12002952,The (un)reasonableness of reporting: antecedents and consequences of reporting sexual harassment.,"This study places the reporting of sexual harassment within an integrated model of the sexual harassment process. Two structural models were developed and tested in a sample (N = 6,417) of male and female military personnel. The 1st model identifies determinants and effects of reporting; reporting did not improve--and at times worsened--job, psychological, and health outcomes. The authors argue that organizational responses to reports (i.e., organizational remedies, organizational minimization, and retaliation) as well as procedural satisfaction can account for these negative effects. The 2nd model examines these mediating mechanisms; results suggest that these mediators, and not reporting itself, are the source of the negative effects of reporting. Organizational and legal implications of these findings are discussed.",The Journal of applied psychology,2002 Apr,United States,2002,00

METHODS: LUMINA patients (meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE) ages >/=16 years of African American, Hispanic (from Texas), Hispanic (from Puerto Rico), or Caucasian ethnicity were studied. In addition to examining the basic features of the cohort, we examined, by univariable and multivariable analyses, the factors associated with disease activity, damage accrual, lupus nephritis, and mortality. An empiric model based on the data presented (and the literature reviewed) was derived to explain the disparities observed. RESULTS: There were substantial differences in the socioeconomic/demographic, clinical, and genetic features among patients from the different ethnic groups, with Texan Hispanic and African American patients exhibiting overall a lower socioeconomic status, different genetic associations, more serious disease at a younger age, and worse intermediate and final outcomes than the Caucasian and Puerto Rican Hispanic patients. A model of disease outcome as a function of the disparities observed was created. CONCLUSION: Ethnic disparities occur in SLE. Environmental, socioeconomic/demographic, psychosocial, genetic, and clinical factors play an important role as determinants of the ethnic differences observed. Measures aimed at eliminating these disparities are suggested while further research is conducted to elucidate the basis of these disparities and their changes at the societal level and to eliminate the gap between the rich and the poor.",Arthritis and rheumatism,2007 May 15,United States,2007,00
18953254,Prevalence and determinants of increased serum lipase levels in a general population.,"OBJECTIVES: There is little information on the prevalence of increased serum lipase levels and its determinants from population-based studies. The present study was performed to provide such information. METHODS: We used data from the 4275 subjects aged 20 to 79 years who were recruited for the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania. Serum lipase levels were determined colorimetrically; levels > or =3.17 micromol/s x l were considered increased. RESULTS: The prevalence of increased serum lipase levels was 3.4%. The prevalence of self-reported chronic pancreatitis in this population was 0.7%. Subjects with and without increased serum lipase levels did not differ with respect to symptoms indicative of pancreatitis including abdominal feeling of fullness, abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of weight. High serum lipase levels correlated with advanced age, increased serum creatinine levels, and use of steroids or enalapril. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum lipase levels are unrelated to pancreatitis-related symptoms. Renal insufficiency and prevalent pancreatitis explain increased serum lipase levels in a minority of subjects. In clinical practice, drugs including steroids and enalapril should be excluded as cause of increased serum lipase levels. The predictive roleof lipase measurements with respect to other pancreatic or extrapancreatic disorders has to be investigated in cohort studies.",Pancreas,2008 Nov,United States,2008,00

11011302,[Psychosocial distress and its moderating factors in patients living in precarious socioeconomic conditions consulting in a preventive health and social work center].,"BACKGROUND: The effects of a precarious socioeconomic condition on mental health have already been widely described. Nevertheless, sociodemographic, biographical, and mainly psychological determinants of psychosocial distress in these populations are still incompletely known. METHODS: 2315 consecutive subjects, aged 16 to 59, consulting for a free work-up in a preventive health center supported by the National French Health Insurance system, were invited to fill out a series of questionnaires, mainly the GHQ-28 (psychosocial distress), the LOT (dispositional optimism) and the WCCL (coping mechanisms). Socioeconomic and administrative criteria were adopted to define populations living in precarious conditions. RESULTS: A total of 78.9% complete records could be analyzed: 55% of the studied population constituted the precarious condition group (44.5% males and 55.5% females; mean age 36.2+/-11). This group was characterized by higher psychosocial distress and higher sub-scores of anxiety, social dysfunction and depression, but not somatisation, as well as by increased emotion focused coping and impaired optimism. Globally, GHQ score was positively correlated with emotion focused coping (r=0.36) and negatively with problem focused coping (r=-0.17) and with optimism (r=-0.39). In a multivariate analysis a set of 9 independent variables explained 38% of GHQ-28 total variance: perceived stress, optimism, emotion focused coping, problem focused coping, age, educational degree, precariousness, money problems and parental quarrels during youth. Introducing precariousness in the model constituted of the set of the remaining variables could explain only 2% of additional variance. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the presence of higher levels of psychosocial distress in subjects living in precarious conditions and underline the moderating role of several psychological variables. They could guide support interventions aimed at helping subjects living in precarious conditions, focused on enhancing their coping resources.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,2000 Aug,France,2000,00
10965375,Nutrition and quality of life in the aged: the Jerusalem 70-year olds longitudinal study.,"Inadequate nutrition is a major problem of elderly people today. Yet, despite the prevalence and significance of the problem, there is little information on the nutritional status of elderly persons in the community, and its impact on their quality of life. During 1990-1991, as part of a first cross-section in a longitudinal medical and social study of 70-year olds in Jerusalem, we surveyed the nutritional status of this population. During the first phase, 605 people were examined in their homes; data were collected regarding socioeconomic status, education, self-perceived health state, use of medications and health services, and ADL. During the second stage, a sub-group of 463 people was examined in a geriatric outpatient clinic; all subjects underwent medical history, physical examination, cognitive assessment, psychiatric questionnaire, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, and pulmonary function tests. In addition, general hospital admissions and morbidity and mortality in the two years following the study were studied. The nutritional status of the participants was determined according to nutritional assessment (NA) scale, based on the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). The majority of the study population lived at home, was without cognitive disturbance (86%), and was independent in ADL (83%). Based on NA > 24, 91% of the study population were in good nutritional state, 8.3% were at risk of undernutrition, and 0.7% were malnourished. There was a significant positive relationship between NA score and ADL as well as cognitive state. In addition, a strong negative relation was found between NA score and visits to the family physician in the previous fortnight, visits to the emergency room in the previous year, and hospital admissions in the following two years. An inverse relation, although not significant, was found between NA score and two-year post-study mortality. These results suggest that the nutritional status of the studied population is inadequate, and that the nutritional state is one of the major determinants of the quality of life in the elderly and therefore, should be part of any geriatric assessment. Elder population surveys are needed to identify and treat at risk elders.","Aging (Milan, Italy)",2000 Jun,Italy,2000,00
16321155,Correlates of health and healthcare performance: applying the Canadian Health Indicators Framework at the provincial-territorial level.,"BACKGROUND: Since, at the health system level, there is little research into the possible interrelationships among the various indicators of health, healthcare performance, non-medical determinants of health, and community and health system characteristics, we conducted this study to explore such interrelationships using the Canadian Health Indicators Framework. METHODS: We conducted univariate correlational analyses with health and healthcare performance as outcomes using recent Canadian data and the ten Canadian provinces and three territories as units of the analyses. For health, 6 indicators were included. Sixteen healthcare performance indicators, 12 non-medical determinants of health and 16 indicators of community and health system characteristics were also included as independent variables for the analysis. A set of decision rules was applied to guide the choice of what was considered actual and preferred performance associations. RESULTS: Health (28%) correlates more frequently with non-medical determinants than healthcare does (12%), in the preferred direction. Better health is only correlated with better healthcare performance in 13% of the cases in the preferred direction. Better health (24%) is also more frequently correlated with community and health system characteristics than healthcare is (13%), in the preferred direction. CONCLUSION: Canadian health performance is a function of multiple factors, the most frequent of which may be the non-medical determinants of health and the community characteristics as against healthcare performance. The contribution of healthcare to health may be limited only to relatively small groups which stand to benefit from effective healthcare, but its overall effect may be diluted in summary measures of population health. Interpreting multidimensional, multi-indicator performance data in their proper context may be more complex than hitherto believed.",BMC health services research,2005 Dec 1,England,2005,00
16461418,Differential strength of association of child injury prevention attitudes and beliefs on practices: a case for audience segmentation.,"OBJECTIVE: Many injuries to children cannot be prevented without some degree of active behavior on the part of parents. A better understanding of social and cognitive determinants of parents' injury prevention behavior and the identification of potential subgroups for targeted message delivery could advance the effectiveness of educational and behavioral interventions. This study assessed the degree to which parents' injury prevention behavior is associated with theoretical determinants and examined whether this relation differs by age or birth order of child. DESIGN: Cross sectional observational study. SETTING: Three Midwestern pediatric clinics. SUBJECTS: 594 parents of children ages 0-4 attending routine well child visits. MEASURES: Injury prevention attitudes, beliefs, and practices. RESULTS: Overall, only modest relations were observed between injury beliefs and attitudes and injury prevention behaviors. However, these relations differed substantially by child age and birth order, with stronger associations observed for parents of older first born children. Outcome expectations and social norms were more strongly related to injury prevention behavior among parents of preschool children than among parents of infants and toddlers, while attitudes were more predictive for parents of first born children than parents of later born children. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the complexity of relations between theorized determinants and behavior, and suggest the potential utility of using audience segmentation strategies in behavioral interventions addressing injury prevention.",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,2006 Feb,England,2006,00
17477777,"Psychosocial stressors, social support and socio-demographic variables as determinants of quality of life of Turkish breast cancer patients.","PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of psychosocial stressors, social support and socio-demographic variables on quality of life of breast cancer patients. TOOLS AND METHODS: The study was conducted between December 2004 and May 2005 and included 101 patients, treated in the Oncology Departments of Ege and Pamukkale University Hospitals and Denizli State Hospital. Patients' demographic data were collected by questionnaire. The methods used in the interviews were the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Psychosocial stressors were classified according to life events using the DSM-IV multi-axial diagnostic system. RESULTS: It was found that increase of cancer stage triggers a decrease in psychological quality of life (p<0,05); overall global life quality (p<0,001), perceived social support and performance status (p<0,05), all of these being negatively affected by family stressors. The patients with increased social support, better psychological and overall quality of life (p<0,01) and younger age had more physical wellness besides overall quality of life (p<0,05); lower incomes negatively affected overall global life quality (p<0,01) and working at a job decreased the psychological stressors (p<0,05). CONCLUSION: From these results, it can be postulated that psychosocial stressors, social support and some socio-demographic variables mostly affected quality of life of the breast cancer patients.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2007 Jan-Mar,Thailand,2007,00
12048950,Education and fertility in sub-Saharan Africa: individual and community effects.,"Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys for 22 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, I show that the average educational level in a village or a community of a similar size has a significant depressing effect on a woman's birth rates, net of urbanization and her own education. According to simulations, average fertility for these countries would be 1.00 lower if education were expanded from the current level in the region to the relatively high level in Kenya. The exclusion of aggregate education from the model leaves a response of only 0.52. A considerable aggregate contribution is estimated even when several potential determinants of education are included. This finding illustrates the need to consider aggregate education in future assessments of the total impact of education.",Demography,2002 May,United States,2002,00
17596544,HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa: a multilevel analysis of message frames and their social determinants.,"In light of the great threat that HIV/AIDS poses in sub-Saharan Africa, the current study assesses HIV/AIDS posters from this region with specific reference to health message frames, including HIV sources, consequences, self-efficacy, preventive means, and barriers and benefits to employing such means of prevention. There is a two-step methodology. First, the content of HIV/AIDS posters from 15 sub-Saharan African countries was coded for the six health message frames. Second, relationships between the health message frames and four social determinants (HIV rate, HIV awareness, condom use and uncertainty avoidance (UAI)) were assessed with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Analysis indicates that self-efficacy is the most common frame, but that almost one-quarter of the posters has none of the six health message frames. HLM indicates some favorable findings, including that health message frames are used most often in countries with the most troubling levels of HIV awareness and condom use. Less favorably, health message frames are used least common in countries that have high levels of UAI and high HIV rates. Improvements for related media practices and policy are articulated.",Health promotion international,2007 Sep,England,2007,00
12703385,A conceptual model of the factors affecting the recreation and leisure participation of children with disabilities.,"Participation in everyday activities is considered to be a vital part of children's development, which is related to their quality of life and future life outcomes. Research studies indicate that children with disabilities are at risk for lower participation in ordinary activities at home and in the community. This article presents a conceptual model of 11 environmental, family, and child factors that are thought to influence children's participation in recreation and leisure activities. The article outlines the existing evidence for the influence of these factors on one another and on children's participation. The review encompasses four bodies of literature: the participation of children or adults with disabilities, the risk and resilience of children facing adversity, the determinants of leisure and recreation activities, and the factors influencing physical activity and exercise. The proposed model is expected to be a useful tool for guiding future research studies and for developing policies and programs for children with disabilities and their families.",Physical & occupational therapy in pediatrics,2003,England,2003,00

During this period. median LOS declined dramatically from 7 months to 3 weeks, whereas admissions increased 4-fold. The diagnostic case mix changed substantially, with a crossover in modal principal diagnosis from personality disorder to affective disorder. Use of medications became almost universal. Diagnosis and medication use became less important determinants of LOS over time. The practical implications of these patterns include higher patient turnover, fewer inpatient clinical contact hours, and heightened importance of continuity with outpatient care. Research should center on the impact of declining LOS on clinical and functional outcomes for children and adolescents.",Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,2001 Jun,United States,2001,00
11016136,Factors responsible for delayed immunisation among children under 5 years of age.,"Although immunisation coverage has increased substantially in recent years, still a sizable proportion of children are not being immunised at appropriate time. The present hospital based, pair matched, case control study was carried out at immunoprophylactic centre of Government Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur, to identify risk factors associated with delayed immunisation among children. This study included 139 children with a delay of more than 90 days for scheduled primary immunisation and equal number of matched control (for dose) receiving immunisation at appropriate time. The study identified significant association of family size [Odd's ratio (OR) = 7.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-35.6], number of children < 5 years (OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.1-9.9), sex (OR = 3, 95% CI = 1.2-7.4), paternal education (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.6-8.5), maternal education (OR = 4, 95% CI = 1.5-10.9), socio-economic status (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1-13.2) and distance from health centre (OR = 4.7, 95% CI = 1.2-17.6) with delayed immunisation. Negligence (56%) and unawareness (22.7%) of parents were main reasons for delayed immunisation. Hence more stress on identified risk factors in the study will indirectly help in reducing the frequency of delayed immunisation.",Journal of the Indian Medical Association,2000 Jan,India,2000,00
18392357,Cultural significance of primary teeth for caregivers in Northeast Brazil.,"This anthropological study critically evaluates Brazilian caregivers' symbolic production and significance of their malnourished offspring's primary teeth, as well as their own, and describes popular dental practices. From January to June 2004, ethnographic interviews of 27 poor, low-literacy mothers were conducted at a public Malnutrition Treatment Center in Fortaleza, Ceara State. Participant observation of clinical pathways and home environments supplemented the data. Content analysis was performed. Results confirm that primary teeth are imbued with cultural significance in Northeast Brazil. Mothers examine mouths, perceive signs of decay, associate primary with permanent tooth healthiness, identify ethnodental illnesses, seek assistance, and perform rituals with exfoliated teeth. The mother's motivation to care for primary teeth is sparked by her memories of past toothache and attempts to avoid stigma and discrimination. Social determinants, not mothers' beliefs or behaviors, are the most critical obstacles to effective dental care. Legitimizing lay knowledge and empowering caregivers and children can improve oral health in Northeast Brazil.",Cadernos de saude publica,2008 Apr,Brazil,2008,00
15893059,Inequities in healthcare seeking in the treatment of communicable endemic diseases in Southeast Nigeria.,"This paper investigates the socio-economic inequities in healthcare seeking in the treatment of common communicable endemic diseases, with an emphasis on the use of primary health care (PHC) centres, where most endemic disease control activities take place. A questionnaire was used to collect information on occurrence of diseases and healthcare seeking from randomly selected households in four local government areas in Southeast Nigeria. Principal components analysis was used to create a socio-economic status (SES) index, which was divided into quartiles. The ratio of the values for the poorest quartile to that of the least poor quartile (bottom/top quartile) together with concentration indices for the variables under consideration was used as the measures of inequity. Logistic analysis was used to examine the determinants of use of PHC centres. The poorest quartile was more likely to use low-level providers (patent medicine dealers, shops, herbalists) and least likely to use the PHC centres. The concentration indices were -0.10, -0.06, -0.37, 0.11 and 0.04 for the use of herbalists, patent medicine dealers, community-health workers, PHC centres and hospitals, respectively. Also, the poorest quartile was more likely to lose person-days when ill. Logistic analysis showed that SES, availability of good services, proximity of the centres to the homes and polite health workers increased the use of the PHC centres. As such, improvement of quality of PHC services and improved geographic access could increase the overall use of PHC centres. Furthermore, in the long-term, a decrease in the amount of user fees, enhanced physical access and improved quality of services could decrease inequity in use of PHC centres and hospitals in the treatment of endemic diseases. The bottom/top quartile ratios and concentration indices produced similar results and hence both methods hence complement each other.",Social science & medicine (1982),2005 Jul,England,2005,00
19296177,British Columbia's fish health regulatory framework's contribution to sustainability goals related to salmon aquaculture.,"Salmon farming is a significant contribution to the global seafood market to which the goal of sustainability is often applied. Diseases related to farms are perhaps the most contentious issues associated with sustainable salmon farming. We reviewed literature and policies in British Columbia, Canada, as well as interviewed key informants to examine how fish health regulations do or could support sustainability goals. We found four main obstacles to the development and application of a sustainability-based health management system. First, salmon farming faced the same challenges as other industries when trying to establish an operational definition of sustainability that captures all stakeholders' interests. Second, there was no program responsible for integrating the various regulations, responsible departments, and monitoring efforts to develop a comprehensive view of sustainability. Third, there was inadequate research base and social consensus on the criteria that should be used to track health outcomes for sustainability purposes. Fourth, the regulatory and management paradigm for salmon farming has been focused on diseases and pathogens as opposed to embracing a more inclusive health promotion model that includes biotic, abiotic, and social determinants of health. A transparent and inclusive participatory process that effectively links expert views with community and industry concerns should serve as the foundation for the next generation of health management regulations for salmon farming.",EcoHealth,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00
10800150,"The influence of gender, social circumstances and smoking on survival: the Renfrew and Paisley study.","The present study aimed to compare survival to age 75 between men and women, by social circumstances and smoking behaviour. A 20 year follow up was carried out of a large representative cohort of Scottish men and women in the Renfrew and Paisley study, and was combined with Scottish mortality statistics. 6831 men and 7993 women aged 45-64 y at time of examination (between 1972 and 1976) were considered. Combining the estimates from the Renfrew and Paisley study with those from Scottish mortality statistics for men and women younger than 45 y of age, it was calculated that 28% of the male smokers and 44% of the male never smokers in disadvantaged social circumstances will have survived to age 75 y, compared with 46% and 56% of the female smokers and never smokers respectively. In more privileged social circumstances, 41% of the male smokers and 62% of the male never smokers will have survived to age 75 y, compared with 56% and 70% of the female smokers and never smokers respectively. The difference between male smokers in low social classes and female never smokers in high social classes is 42% in absolute terms (28% vs 70%), which gives an indication of the combined influence of gender, social circumstances and smoking on survival. These results show that gender, social circumstances and smoking are important determinants of mortality which have led to substantial differences in survival. The influence of additional factors related to mortality could usefully be compared to these to put their effects into perspective.",Public health,2000 Mar,Netherlands,2000,00
18046720,Determinants of alcohol use and abuse: Impact of quantity and frequency patterns on liver disease.,"UNLABELLED: More than 70% of alcohol is consumed by 10% of the population in the United States. Implicit in this statistic is that tremendous variation in the pattern of drinking (quantity, frequency, and duration) exists among alcohol consumers. Individuals who are binge or chronic drinkers will have different health outcomes than social drinkers. Therefore, knowing the pattern of drinking will shed light on how severely individuals are alcohol-dependent and on the extent of liver damage. Thus, these parameters assume particular relevance for the treatment-providing physician. Genetic factors contribute substantially to differences in alcohol metabolism. Variations in the activities of the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, in part determine blood alcohol concentration, thereby contributing to the predisposition to becoming alcohol-dependent and to susceptibility to alcohol-induced liver damage. Chronic alcohol consumption induces cytochrome P450 2E1, a microsomal enzyme that metabolizes alcohol at high concentrations and also metabolizes medications such as acetaminophen and protease inhibitors. Alcohol metabolism changes the redox state of the liver, which leads to alterations in hepatic lipid, carbohydrate, protein, lactate, and uric acid metabolism. The quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption severely impact the liver in the presence of comorbid conditions such as infection with hepatitis B or C and/or human immunodeficiency virus, type 2 diabetes, hemochromatosis, or obesity and thus have implications with respect to the extent of injury and response to medications. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the relationships between the quantity, frequency, and patterns of drinking and alcoholic liver disease is limited. A better understanding of these relationships will guide hepatologists in managing alcoholic liver disease.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2007 Dec,United States,2007,00

19606743,[The effect of smoking on reproductive failures in couples examined in the Genetic Outpatient Clinic at Dr. A. Jurasz University Hospital in Bydgoszcz].,"BACKGROUND: A lack of offspring caused by sterility of one or both partners is an increasing social problem that concerns 10-19% of couples. This percentage is even higher if we take into consideration those couples who cannot have healthy offspring in spite of being able to conceive a baby. The aim of the paper was to analyze the awareness of the effect of smoking on reproductive failures in couples with infertility or habitual abortions, and in couples experiencing miscarriages and having a child or children with congenital defects. The couples underwent cytogenetic, and in some cases, molecular analysis in the Genetic Outpatient Clinic at Dr. A. Jurasz University Hospital in Bydgoszcz. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The studied group consisted of 201 couples. In the medical documentation analysis the following aspects were taken into consideration: the patient's age, family history, genetic determinants, infections, environmental and occupational factors, which might have caused reproductive failures in the examined couples. RESULTS: 26.4% of women admitted cigarette smoking, they most often represented the group of couples having a child born with defects; 46.8% of men admitted smoking and they most often represented the group of couples that experienced habitual abortions. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is obvious that cigarette smoking during gestation period is extremely harmful to the mother and the fetus and may significantly contribute to reproductive failures, public awareness of this problem is still insufficient and smoking habit is unfortunately widespread among pregnant women.",Medycyna pracy,2009,Poland,2009,00
12971112,A public health model of the social determinants of health.,"As we move forward in the new century, epidemiologists and public health practitioners are faced with the challenge of reviewing the current direction of epidemiology and its links with public health. While the history of epidemiology has been a successful and productive one, there is a danger that modern epidemiology is becoming too narrow in its scope, concerned primarily with the analysis of risk factors in individuals, while ignoring sociological and ecological perspectives of health. We argue that a theoretical framework to guide the practice of epidemiology is needed which encompasses a role for social determinants of health while simultaneously also acknowledging the importance of behaviour and biology, and the inter-connectedness of all these factors. This paper presents a public health model of social determinants of health, which provides a framework for testing the causal pathways linking social determinant variables with health care system attributes, disease inducing behaviours and health outcomes. This approach provides an improved opportunity to identify and evaluate evidence-based public health interventions, and facilitates stronger links between modern epidemiology and public health practice.",Sozial- und Praventivmedizin,2003,Switzerland,2003,00
17062544,Racial/ethnic differences in the protective effects of self-management skills on adolescent substance use.,"A variety of cognitive and behavioral self-management skills have been posited as protective in terms of adolescent substance use. This study examined whether these skills measured in the 7th grade served a protective function in 9th grade substance use across ethnically diverse samples of adolescents. Participants consisted of Black (n = 461) and Hispanic (n = 320) urban youth and White suburban youth (n = 757). Structural equation modeling indicated that a second order Self-Management Skills latent factor consisting of first order latent factors of Decision-Making, Self-Regulation, and Self-Reinforcement skills was protective for adolescent substance use across racial/ethnic subgroups. However, Self-Management Skills were more strongly protective for suburban White youth and less protective for urban minority youth. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that predictive power of risk and protective factors derived from psychosocial theories varies widely across racial/ethnic subgroups of youth and is weaker among racial/ethnic minority youth compared to White youth. An important next step is to broaden the focus of etiology research from individual-level determinants to studying adolescent substance use behavior in the context of the cultural background and primary social settings of young people, such as family, school, and community environments.",Substance abuse,2006 Jun,United States,2006,00
16547790,Determinants of changes in perceived quality of life in the course of schizophrenia.,"This study aimed to identify factors that influence changes in satisfaction with quality of life (QOL) of schizophrenia patients. Baseline and follow up data for 148 schizophrenia patients were obtained at hospital admission and 16 months later. Relationships between changes over time in the general QOL index, and various factors were investigated using factor, multiple regression, and partial correlation analyses. Findings indicate that baseline levels of activation symptoms, emotional distress, task oriented coping, self-esteem and friend support together explain 41% of the variability in the general QOL index 16 months later. Changes in the general QOL of schizophrenia patients over time is associated with anergia, and paranoid symptoms, emotional distress, side effects, self-esteem, emotion and avoidance related coping styles, expressed emotion, and other social support. Determinants of change in QOL of patients were different being in hospital or out of hospital in the real world. No significant association of age, education, and follow up duration, with general QOL. Based on obtained data three types of overlapping factors were defined: (1) distressing, and protective; (2) primary and secondary; and (3) factors that remained constant or changed over time. Presented data are discussed within the framework of the Distress/Protection model of QOL. The conceptualization of three types of factors influencing QOL outcomes in this model demonstrates their predictive value, and may assist investigators and mental health workers in the interpretation of QOL data that may be used to improve patients' QOL outcomes.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2006 Apr,Netherlands,2006,00
18782648,Gender-specific responses to social determinants associated with self-perceived health in Taiwan: a multilevel approach.,"There are well-documented gender differences in health. However, few studies have considered that the associations of personal and household characteristics with perceived health may vary between men and women because of their different socialized gender roles. This study investigates gender differences in health and addresses gender-specific responses to individual- and household-level determinants of health. We analyze the data of the 2001 Social Development Survey on Health and Safety, which consists of a representative sample of all registered households in Taiwan. Our findings give limited support to the hypothesis that women and men are differently associated with social determinants of health. We observe a significant gender gap in self-perceived health even after controlling for various health determinants. Notwithstanding, men and women are similar in many important aspects in relation to social determinants of health. Gender-specific responses are found only in the impacts of employment status, stressful life events, own disability, and number of family members with a disability. Men report having poorer health than women when being disabled and facing stressful events. Women's perceived health is at a higher risk when family members require short-term, intensive care. Further consideration of the observed, gender-specific responses to health determinants shed insight on the possible social and cultural relevance behind gender differences in self-perceived health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2008 Nov,England,2008,00
11753256,Age of the emergence of negative attitudes toward strabismus.,"INTRODUCTION: Strabismus impacts a variety of psychosocial variables in both children and adults. Poor self-esteem, lack of confidence, altered interpersonal relationships, and difficulty with employment procurement have been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the age at which children perceive strabismus in dolls and to evaluate their reactions. METHODS: Three identical dolls were altered so that one was orthotropic, one esotropic, and one exotropic. Thirty-four naive children between 3 and 7 years of age were individually placed in a waiting room with the 3 dolls as the only toys with which to play. A one-way mirror allowed a hidden observer to tabulate the number of positive and negative behaviors exhibited toward each doll. After a 10-minute observation period, the children were asked a short series of questions about their preferences and attitudes toward the dolls. Odds ratios were then determined for both the observed behaviors and the expressed responses to the strabismic dolls compared with the orthotropic dolls. RESULTS: Children aged 5(3/4) years and older were 73 times more likely than younger children to express a negative feeling about the strabismic dolls when asked (P =.003). Additionally, when comparing the strabismic dolls with the orthotropic doll, children aged 3 to 4(1/4) years did not notice a difference, children aged 4(1/2) to 5(1/4) years tended to describe the eyes as ""different,"" and children aged 5(3/4) years or older almost uniformly gave a negative description of the strabismic dolls. CONCLUSIONS: A negative attitude toward strabismus appears to emerge at approximately 6 years of age. The biopsychosocial determinants of dislike and hostility toward ocular deviations are apparently acquired, learned responses.",Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,2001 Dec,United States,2001,00
19195423,Reliability and validity of a healthy diet determinants questionnaire for adolescents.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of a short questionnaire including a wide range of personal, social and environmental constructs in relation to a healthy diet in an adolescent population. DESIGN: The questionnaire was developed based on the literature, past experiences and feedback from a small pilot study (n 10). Test and retest (2 weeks later) of the questionnaire was done to investigate test-retest reliability. Data of four non-consecutive 24 h recalls were collected to investigate the predictive validity with food (fruit, vegetables, milk, snacks, soft drinks), nutrient (fibre, ascorbic acid, Ca, percentage energy from fat) and energy intakes. SETTING: At home, in the presence of a student. SUBJECTS: Convenience sample of fifty-five Belgian-Flemish adolescents approached by university students for course credits. RESULTS: Test-retest correlations of the constructs ranged between 0.51 and 0.78. Eleven of the eighteen final constructs were significantly associated with one or more of the five selected food items, all in the expected direction. Most significant associations with the food items were found for taste, perceived peers' behaviour and availability of soft drinks at home. Fresh fruit and soft drinks were correlated with most constructs (seven) followed by snacks (five). Concerning energy and the selected nutrient variables, the findings were less clear. CONCLUSIONS: The results are promising: the test-retest stability was moderate to good; most of the psychosocial constructs were significantly associated with one or more of the selected dietary variables.

Based on careful analysis of the reasons for vaccination barriers/failures in the European population, the two European geriatric and gerontological societies (the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society [EUGMS] and the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics - European Region [IAGG-ER]) propose careful adaptation of current vaccine guidelines to promote preventive aspects, concerning both life threatening-diseases (influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia and tetanus/diphtheria) and diseases which adversely impact patients' quality of life (pertussis and herpes zoster). This consensus statement is designed to support official recommendations and improve the willingness to vaccinate the most rapidly growing segment of the population. The following guidelines are based on the importance of the sustainability of vaccine programs from midlife till extreme old age: - Promote healthy aging by optimizing health determinants of daily functions, active participation in society and individual quality of life; - Provide useful information to contribute toward harmonizing vaccine strategies at European level; - Support the public health, social and economic values of vaccination.

11697274,[Determinants of occurrence of negative priming for novel shapes with matching paradigm].,"We examined the effect of relation between interferences from distractor and inhibitory mechanism on the occurrence of negative priming, by using a matching paradigm. The ease of perceptual target selection was determined by magnitudes of interference. Stereoscopic depth was used to manipulate the relative position of a target, a distractor and a standard figure. When the ease of perceptual target selection was manipulated by separation of the target from the distractor in depth, positive priming occurred. However, the ease of target selection turned out to be unnecessary in the occurrence of priming effects. When the distractor and the standard figure were displayed at the same depth plane, where the distractor was supposed to interfere with the encoding of a standard figure, negative priming occurred consistently regardless of the ease of perceptual target selection. This study suggests that inhibitory mechanism contributes to the suppression of inappropriate processes by distractor, and inhibitory mechanism actively keeps distractors from interfering with standard figures.",Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology,2001 Aug,Japan,2001,00

OBJECTIVES: To describe the socioeconomic and cultural determinants, organisational structure, distinct categories, and spatial patterning of sex work in Tallinn, Estonia, and identify recent temporal changes in sex work patterns. METHODS: In-depth interviews with key informants; naturalistic observations of sex work and drug use venues, geo-mapping of sex work sites, review of media, public policy, and commissioned reports, and analyses of existing data. RESULTS: Sex work takes place in a hierarchy of locations in Tallinn ranging from elite brothels and ""love flats"" to truck stops. These sites vary in terms of their public health importance and social organisation. There are full time, part time, and intermittent male and female sex workers. Among others, the taxi driver, madam and the bartender are central roles in the organisation of sex work in Tallinn.

PARTICIPANTS: In total 622 patients categorized into five diagnostic groups--inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (n=274), chronic liver diseases (n=78), congenital digestive disorders (n=104), food allergy (n=77), celiac disease (n=89)--and a population-based control group (n=248), age 15-24 years. METHODS: Labour participation and burden of disease (i.e. consequences of the disease in daily life) were assessed by a postal questionnaire. Multivariate statistics were computed to investigate the relationship between disease characteristics and labour participation. RESULTS: Patients with IBD or chronic liver diseases were found to have limited job prospects. Patients with chronic liver diseases, IBD and food allergy reported more disease burden regarding several indicators compared with controls. Logistic regression analyses including background characteristics revealed socio-economic status (educational level of parents) and nocturnal toilet use as important determinants of employment. In addition, gender and medication intake were found to be most determinative for a full-time position. CONCLUSIONS: The possible impact of IBD and chronic liver diseases on the labour participation of young adults should be recognized and deserves extra attention from gastroenterologists so that young patients can be supported to increase their job opportunities.",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,2006 Feb,England,2006,00
19561395,Determinants of the utilization of dental services in a community-dwelling elderly Japanese population.,"Oral health care is not only an effective strategy for the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of orofacial disease and disorders, but also an essential component of general health promotion programs. The current study aimed to identify the determinants of the utilization of dental services in an elderly population in Japan. A community-based comprehensive geriatric assessment, including the measurements of physical, mental, and social functioning, was conducted among elderly people aged >or= 70 years residing in a suburban area of Sendai, Japan. Oral health status and functioning, their impact on the quality of life, and dental utilization were also surveyed. Of the 1,170 participants, 418 subjects who had specific treatment needs for dental problems and reported irregular dental attendance were recommended a dental visit, and 1 year later, their compliance with the recommendation was assessed by using questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a higher number of remaining teeth and the use of removable dentures were significant predictors of dental utilization within 1 year. Regular utilization was associated with a higher number of remaining teeth, younger age, presence of systemic disease, absence of depressive symptoms, and higher educational attainment. Conversely, non-compliance with the treatment recommendations was associated with fewer remaining teeth, smoking, and non-utilization of dental services during the previous year. The differences in the determinants of dental attendance behavior, which may be partially associated with the insurance coverage for dental services, suggest the need for specific strategies for oral health promotion for different behavior of dental utilization.",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,2009 Jul,Japan,2009,00
16338102,Determinants of 12-step group affiliation and moderators of the affiliation-abstinence relationship.,"This study examined characteristics of substance use disorder (SUD) outpatients at intake to treatment (N=345) that were associated with more 12-step group attendance and involvement, Steps worked, and acceptance of 12-step philosophy at a 6-month follow-up (N=281, 81.4%). Patient characteristics covered the domains of sociodemographics, SUD severity, personal functioning, and previous help received. Distinguishing baseline characteristics of patients who attended more 12-step group meetings during follow-up were being less-educated, more engaged in religious practices, and more extroverted and interpersonally competent, and having had more previous 12-step group exposure. These patient characteristics were generally similar to those associated with more 12-step meeting involvement and philosophy acceptance. More 12-step meeting attendance and involvement were related to abstinence at 6 months. Associations of attendance with abstinence were stronger among patients who were younger, white, less-educated, unstably employed, less religious, and less interpersonally skilled. These patients may have had fewer available social resources and so benefitted more from the fellowship and support for abstinence that 12-step group members often provide. We suggest methods by which treatment providers may encourage 12-step group affiliation among patients likely to benefit from it on substance use outcomes.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2006 Jun 28,Ireland,2006,00

10814656,Plasma vitamin C and food choice in the third Glasgow MONICA population survey.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of different foods to the estimated intakes of vitamin C among those differing in plasma vitamin C levels, and thereby inform dietary strategies for correcting possible deficiency. DESIGN: Cross sectional random population survey. SETTING: North Glasgow, Scotland, 1992. PARTICIPANTS: 632 men and 635 women, aged 25 to 74 years, not taking vitamin supplements, who participated in the third MONICA study (population survey monitoring trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Dietary and sociodemographic information was collected using a food frequency and lifestyle questionnaire. Plasma vitamin C was measured in non-fasted venous blood samples and subjects categorised by cut points of 11.4 and 22.7 micromol/l as being of low, marginal or optimal vitamin C status. Food sources of dietary vitamin C were identified for subjects in these categories. Plasma vitamin C concentrations were compared among groups classified according to intake of key foods. More men (26%) than women (14%) were in the low category for vitamin C status; as were a higher percentage of smokers and of those in the older age groups. Intake of vitamin C from potatoes and chips (fried potatoes) was uniform across categories; while the determinants of optimal versus low status were the intakes of citrus fruit, non-citrus fruit and fruit juice. Optimal status was achieved by a combined frequency of fruit, vegetables and/or fruit juice of three times a day or more except in older male smokers where a frequency greater than this was required even to reach a marginal plasma vitamin C level. CONCLUSION: Fruit, vegetables and/or fruit juice three or more times a day increases plasma vitamin C concentrations above the threshold for risk of deficiency.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2000 May,England,2000,00
10930065,Witchcraft or mycotoxin? The Salem witch trials.,"BACKGROUND: The Salem witchcraft trials of 1692 have been studied by many historians looking for the complex social, political, and psychological determinants behind the community-wide hysteria that led to a travesty of justice and the deaths of 20 innocent Puritans. Recently, ergot poisoning has been put forth by some as a previously unsuspected cause of the bizarre behaviors of the young adolescent girls who accused the townsfolk of witchcraft. In this essay the circumstances behind the ergot poisoning theory for this historical event are described. When the evidence is weighed carefully both pro and con, it seems unlikely that ergotism explains much of what went on in colonial Salem.",Journal of toxicology.

16650342,Sex differences in subclinical and DSM-IV pathological gambling: results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.,"BACKGROUND: To examine sex differences in DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling in nationally representative data of the US population. METHOD: Data come from a large (n = 43093) representative sample of the adult US population. RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence rate of DSM-IV pathological gambling was 0.64% (95% CI 0.50-0.78) for men and 0.23% (95% CI 0.17-0.29) for women, whereas the lifetime prevalence of subclinical pathological gambling was 6.79% (95% CI 6.32-7.26) for men and 3.26% (95% CI 2.93-3.59) for women. For subclinical pathological gambling, men were significantly (p < 0.01) more likely than women to have smoked more than two packs of cigarettes a day, to be classified as heavy drinkers and to have lifetime diagnoses of alcohol and drug use disorders. Women with subclinical and pathological gambling were significantly more likely than men to have lifetime mood and anxiety disorders. With respect to pathological gambling, women had later ages of onset of the disorder, and were significantly more likely than men to report gambling to relieve depressed mood and to prefer casino gambling. Rates of treatment-seeking for DSM-IV pathological gambling were low for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: There are important sex differences in the prevalence, symptom pattern, sociodemographic and clinical correlates and course of DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling. Results underscore the need to investigate sex differences in the social determinants, neurobiology and treatment response of DSM-IV subclinical and pathological gambling.",Psychological medicine,2006 Jul,England,2006,00
16707005,Non-specific low back pain in primary care in the Spanish National Health Service: a prospective study on clinical outcomes and determinants of management.,"BACKGROUND: The Spanish National Health Service is a universal and free health care system. Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent disorder, generating large health and social costs. The objectives of this study were to describe its management in primary care, to assess patient characteristics that influence physicians' decisions, and to describe clinical outcome at 2 months. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 648 patients with non-specific low back pain was recruited by 75 physicians (out of 361-20.8%) working in 40 primary care centers in 10 of the 17 administrative regions in Spain, covering 693,026 out of the 40,499,792 inhabitants. Patients were assessed on the day they were recruited, and prospectively followed-up 14 and 60 days later. The principal patient characteristics that were analyzed were: sex, duration of the episode, history of LBP, working status, severity of LBP, leg pain and disability, and results of straight leg raising test. Descriptors of management were: performance of the straight leg raising test, ordering of diagnostic procedures, prescription of drug treatment, referral to physical therapy, rehabilitation or surgery, and granting of sick leave. Regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between patients' baseline characteristics and physicians' management decisions. Only workers were included in the models on sick leave. RESULTS: Mean age (SD) of included patients was 46.5 (15.5) years, 367 (56.6%) were workers, and 338 (52.5%) were females. Median (25th-75th interquartile range) duration of pain when entering the study was 4 (2-10) days and only 28 patients (4.3%) had chronic low back pain. Diagnostic studies included plain radiographs in 43.1% of patients and CT or MRI scans in 18.8%. Drug medication was prescribed to 91.7% of patients, 19.1% were sent to physical therapy or rehabilitation, and 9.6% were referred to surgery. The main determinants of the clinical management were duration of the episode and, to a lesser extent, the intensity of the pain (especially leg pain), a positive straight leg raising test, and degree of disability. The main determinant of sick leave was the degree of disability, followed by the characteristics of the labor contract and the intensity of leg pain (but not low back pain). After at least 2 months of treatment, 37% of patients were still in pain and approximately 10% of patients had not improved or had worsened. CONCLUSION: Although the use of X-Rays is high, determinants of physicians' management of LBP in primary care made clinical sense and were consistent with patterns suggested by evidence-based recommendations. However, after 2 months of treatment more than one third of patients continued to have back pain and about 10% had worsened.",BMC health services research,2006 May 17,England,2006,00

This study's sample consists of 353 nurses from two general hospitals in the cities of Seoul and Taegu, Korea. Data were collected from self-administered questionnaires and analyzed with LISREL. The results showed that four structural variables (workload, supervisory support, routinization, and pay), two psychological variables (positive and negative affectivity), and one environmental variable (job opportunity) had a significant net effect on hospital nurses' job satisfaction. The explained variance for job satisfaction is 53.0%.

17343758,Slum health: diseases of neglected populations.,"BACKGROUND: Urban slums, like refugee communities, comprise a social cluster that engenders a distinct set of health problems. With 1 billion people currently estimated to live in such communities, this neglected population has become a major reservoir for a wide spectrum of health conditions that the formal health sector must deal with. DISCUSSION: Unlike what occurs with refugee populations, the formal health sector becomes aware of the health problems of slum populations relatively late in the course of their illnesses. As such, the formal health sector inevitably deals with the severe and end-stage complications of these diseases at a substantially greater cost than what it costs to manage non-slum community populations. Because of the informal nature of slum settlements, and cultural, social, and behavioral factors unique to the slum populations, little is known about the spectrum, burden, and determinants of illnesses in these communities that give rise to these complications, especially of those diseases that are chronic but preventable. In this article, we discuss observations made in one slum community of 58,000 people in Salvador, the third largest city in Brazil, to highlight the existence of a spectrum and burden of chronic illnesses not likely to be detected by the formal sector health services until they result in complications or death. Lack of health-related data from slums could lead to inappropriate and unrealistic allocation of health care resources by the public and private providers. Similar misassumptions and misallocations are likely to exist in other nations with large urban slum populations. SUMMARY: Continued neglect of ever-expanding urban slum populations in the world could inevitably lead to greater expenditure and diversion of health care resources to the management of end-stage complications of diseases that are preventable. A new approach to health assessment and characterization of social-cluster determinants of health in urban slums is urgently needed.",BMC international health and human rights,2007 Mar 7,England,2007,00
19401806,What determines healthcare utilization and related out-of-pocket expenditures in Tajikistan? Lessons from a national survey.,"OBJECTIVES: The government of Tajikistan is currently exploring the ways to test the possible introduction of a Basic Benefit Package which is to provide healthcare for the most vulnerable groups within the population. In this context, the objective of this study is to analyze individual, household, geographical and systemic factors which explain healthcare utilization and out-of-pocket expenditures in Tajikistan. METHODS: Using a nationally-representative survey, the author examines the determinants of healthcare utilization and its related out-of-pocket expenditures. Two empirical multivariate models are employed: binomial logit regression to estimate the determinants of healthcare utilization and Tobit regression to estimate the determinants of out-of-pocket expenditures. RESULTS: An increase in the ability to pay is associated with a higher propensity to utilize healthcare. Likewise, being a woman, being elderly, having higher educational attainment and having chronic illness also increase the propensity to utilize healthcare. Conversely, needing to travel a long distance to health post reduces the likelihood of utilization. An increase in ability to pay, being female and using specialized healthcare facilities increases the amount of out-of-pocket expenditures. In contrast, using ancillary healthcare personnel and outpatient facilities reduced the amount of out-of-pocket expenditures. CONCLUSIONS: Linking receipt of the package with targeted social assistance and development of Community Based social insurance scheme can improve accessibility and affordability of healthcare.",International journal of public health,2009,Switzerland,2009,00
17340204,Predictors of preventive health care use among middle-aged and older adults in Mexico: the role of religion.,"Research has shown that religion is associated with a wide range of health behaviors among adults of all ages. Although there is strong support for religion's influence on behaviors such as drinking and smoking, less is known about the possible relationship between religion and the use of preventive health services. This relationship may be particularly important in Mexico, a country with high levels of religiousness and low levels of preventive service utilization. The current study uses a nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older adults in Mexico (n = 9,890) to test the association between three facets of religion and three preventive services aimed at detecting chronic conditions or underlying risk factors. The findings show that religious salience is significantly related to the use of blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, even after controlling for a variety of social, demographic, and health-related factors. In addition, attending religious services and participating in religious activities are both positively associated with blood pressure and diabetes screening. This type of research adds to our knowledge of the determinants of preventive service utilization, as well as to the burgeoning literature on religion and health. Furthermore, because the vast majority of research in this field takes place in more developed and Westernized countries, such as the US and Western Europe, analyzing this relationship in a sample of older Mexicans is critical for providing the field with a more comparative orientation.",Journal of cross-cultural gerontology,2007 Jun,Netherlands,2007,00

Perinatal exposure to sunlight has been suggested as the principal factor underlying this relationship, although the mechanisms involved remain a matter of debate. The longitudinal design of the present study allowed us to directly test the influence of perinatal sunlight exposure (and other meteorological and behavioural factors) on body size at birth and at regular intervals up to age 26. The findings confirmed that pre-natal sunlight is one of the most significant determinants of height. However, the trimester of greatest influence differs depending on the age at which study members were measured.",Early human development,2000 Nov,Ireland,2000,00
22029661,Self- and other-estimates of multiple abilities in Britain and Turkey: a cross-cultural comparison of subjective ratings of intelligence.,"This study is part of a programmatic research effort into the determinants of self-assessed abilities. It examined cross-cultural differences in beliefs about intelligence and self- and other-estimated intelligence in two countries at extreme ends of the European continent. In all, 172 British and 272 Turkish students completed a three-part questionnaire where they estimated their parents', partners' and own multiple intelligences (Gardner (10) and Sternberg (3)). They also completed a measure of the 'big five' personality scales and rated six questions about intelligence. The British sample had more experience with IQ tests than the Turks. The majority of participants in both groups did not believe in sex differences in intelligence but did think there were race differences. They also believed that intelligence was primarily inherited. Participants rated their social and emotional intelligence highly (around one standard deviation above the norm). Results suggested that there were more cultural than sex differences in all the ratings, with various interactions mainly due to the British sample differentiating more between the sexes than the Turks. Males rated their overall, verbal, logical, spatial, creative and practical intelligence higher than females. Turks rated their musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence as well as existential, naturalistic, emotional, creative, and practical intelligence higher than the British. There was evidence of participants rating their fathers' intelligence on most factors higher than their mothers'. Factor analysis of the ten Gardner intelligences yield two clear factors: cognitive and social intelligence. The first factor was impacted by sex but not culture; it was the other way round for the second factor. Regressions showed that five factors predicted overall estimates: sex (male), age (older), test experience (has done tests), extraversion (strong) and openness (strong). Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the field.",International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,2009 Dec,England,2009,00

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey by means of questionnaires was conducted among the heads of all 121 cardiology wards in Dutch hospitals, of whom 77 (64%) responded. RESULTS: Adopters had a significantly lower level of formalization and more nurses working on the ward. Adopters also had a significantly more positive attitude towards working with the intervention, perceived more positive social influences from their direct environment and had higher self-efficacy. Psychological determinants explained adoption to a greater extent than organizational determinants did. CONCLUSION: It is very important to take psychological factors into account when studying the adoption of preventive innovations and developing diffusion strategies. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Programs for dissemination of preventive innovations in a hospital setting should primarily focus on psychological characteristics like social influence and self-efficacy.",Patient education and counseling,2006 May,Ireland,2006,00

Observation of a future debate partner (i.e., vigilance) evoked larger increases in blood pressure than did observation of a less relevant person, apparently through the combination of increases in cardiac output and vascular resistance. Preparation and enactment of efforts to exert social influence (i.e., active coping) evoked heightened blood pressure and heart rate responses through increased cardiac contractility and output. Thus, both vigilance and active coping in social contexts increased cardiovascular reactivity, but apparently through different psychophysiological processes.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2000 Jul,United States,2000,00
19639412,What do we know about neuropsychological aspects of schizophrenia?,"Application of a neuropsychological perspective to the study of schizophrenia has established a number of important facts about this disorder. Some of the key findings from the existing literature are that, while neurocognitive impairment is present in most, if not all, persons with schizophrenia, there is both substantial interpatient heterogeneity and remarkable within-patient stability of cognitive function over the long-term course of the illness. Such findings have contributed to the firm establishment of neurobiologic models of schizophrenia, and thereby help to reduce the social stigma that was sometimes associated with purely psychogenic models popular during parts of the 20th century. Neuropsychological studies in recent decades have established the primacy of cognitive functions over psychopathologic symptoms as determinants of functional capacity and independence in everyday functioning. Although the cognitive benefits of both conventional and even second generation antipsychotic medications appear marginal at best, recognition of the primacy of cognitive deficits as determinants of functional disability in schizophrenia has catalyzed recent efforts to develop targeted treatments for the cognitive deficits of this disorder. Despite these accomplishments, however, some issues remain to be resolved. Efforts to firmly establish the specific neurocognitive/neuropathologic systems responsible for schizophrenia remain elusive, as do efforts to definitively demonstrate the specific cognitive deficits underlying specific forms of functional impairment. Further progress may be fostered by recent initiatives to integrate neuropsychological studies with experimental neuroscience, perhaps leading to measures of deficits in cognitive processes more clearly associated with specific, identifiable brain systems.",Neuropsychology review,2009 Sep,United States,2009,00
19157764,Preventing obesity: challenges and pitfalls for health promotion.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore challenges to health promotion strategies against obesity, with special attention to the Scandinavian context. METHODS: Analytic induction, a procedure for verifying theories and propositions, based on purposefully selected literature references, with subsequent critical reflection. RESULTS: Health promotion efforts against obesity face challenges related to the unequal distribution of vulnerability to weight gain within the population, and to the complex neuroregulatory determinants that explain why obesity is not just a simple matter of lifestyle. Cultural understandings of identity and morality may create victim blaming and disempowerment, thus obstructing clinical health promotion strategies for weight control. Finally, the conceptual validity of obesity measurements and their predictive power deserves attention. CONCLUSION: Preventing obesity is difficult. Awareness of individual vulnerability and neurobiological mechanisms that lead to weight gain must be taken into account when strategies for health promotion are developed. These strategies must transcend a simplistic energy balance view. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinical health promotion needs to be highly individualized and tailored. Preventing weight gain requires attention to the person's sociodemographic, cultural and genetic characteristics. Cultural trends such as sedentary lifestyles and the nutrition transition should be counteracted without turning body weight control into a question of morality and inferior identity.",Patient education and counseling,2009 Aug,Ireland,2009,00
12133208,Developmental issues in attitudes to food and diet.,"As a rule, children and most adults eat what they like and leave the rest. They like and consume foods high in fat and sugar. Parental behaviour shapes food acceptance, and early exposure to fruit and vegetables or to foods high in energy, sugar and fat is related to children's liking for, and consumption of, these foods. Some parents are imposing child-feeding practices that control what and how much children eat. However, over-control can be counter-productive, teaching children to dislike the very foods we want them to consume, and generally undermining self-regulation abilities. The external environment is also important, with concerns expressed about food advertising to children and girls dieting for an ideal thin body shape. Up to one-quarter of young adolescent girls report dieting to lose weight, their motivation driven by weight and shape dissatisfaction. For some, dieting and vegetarianism are intertwined and both legitimised as healthy eating. For others, striving for nutritional autonomy, the choice of less-healthy foods is not just because of their taste, but an act of parental defiance and peer solidarity. The determinants of what children choose to eat are complex, and the balance changes as children get older. A better understanding is crucial to informing how we might modify nutritional behaviour. Adults occupy a central position in this process, suggesting that children should be neither the only focus of nutritional interventions nor expected to solve the nutritional problems with which adults around them are continuing to fail.",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2002 May,England,2002,00
16415261,Socioeconomic determinants of health related quality of life in childhood and adolescence: results from a European study.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of two different socioeconomic status (SES) measures on child and adolescent self reported health related quality of life (HRQoL). The European KIDSCREEN project aims at simultaneous developing, testing, and implementing a generic HRQoL instrument. DESIGN AND SETTING: The pilot version of the questionnaire was applied in school surveys to students from 8 to 18 years of age, as well as to their parents, together with such determinants of health status as two SES indicators, the parental educational status and the number of material goods in the family (FAS, family affluence scale). PARTICIPANTS: Students from seven European countries: 754 children (39.8%; mean: 9.8 years), and 1142 adolescents (60.2 %; mean: 14.1 years), as well as their respective parents. MAIN RESULTS: In children, a higher parental educational status was found to have a significant positive impact on the KIDSCREEN dimensions: physical wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, moods and emotions, bullying and perceived financial resources. Increased risk of low HRQoL was detected for adolescents in connection with their physical wellbeing. Family wealth plays a part for children's physical wellbeing, parent relations and home life, and perceived financial resources. For adolescents, family wealth furthermore predicts HRQoL on all KIDSCREEN dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that exposure to low parental educational status may result in a decreased HRQoL in childhood, whereas reduced access to material (and thereby social) resources may lead to a lower HRQoL especially in adolescence.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2006 Feb,England,2006,00
18372869,Health promotion in Australia: twenty years on from the Ottawa Charter.,"Australia has a longstanding history of promoting health through programs that reflect the principles of the Ottawa Charter and recognising the importance of social determinants of health. Health promotion programs are delivered by a wide range of organisations, in a wide range of settings and sectors for, or with, multiple groups. Since the mid-1980s aspects of infrastructure and capacity for health promotion, such as human and financial resources, have been put in place including the establishment of health promotion foundations via tobacco hypothecation. Following neo-liberal reforms in the 1990s, however, government policies have increasingly focused more narrowly on specific diseases and risk factors. Chronic disease has become the new banner under which health promotion, social determinants and efforts to address health inequalities fit. While the importance of social determinants is often recognised within and outside the health sector, health promotion practitioners are seldom at the centre of policy development.

15155587,Smoking initiation among Gambian adolescents: social cognitive influences and the effect of cigarette sampling.,"In this study, determinants of tobacco use among Gambian youths were examined. A cross-sectional school-based survey was conducted among 282 students, aged 14-18. The potential determinants were derived from the core constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the ASE model. Moreover, various measures of knowledge and media influence were added to the research model. The results show that free cigarette offers by representatives of tobacco companies were mostly responsible for the difference between smokers and non-smokers. Other variables associated with smoking behavior were greater intention to smoke in the future, lower self-efficacy expectations regarding emotional situations, smoking behavior of the respondent's best friend, the mother having a job and the absence of other family members living in the house. Our study supports current efforts to prohibit tobacco advertising and promotions in The Gambia, especially the distribution of free samples. Additionally, we recommend prevention activities in schools and communities to aim at making children less vulnerable to 'sampling', increasing their self-efficacy expectations regarding emotional situations and making them aware of the influence of their best friend.",Health education research,2004 Oct,England,2004,00
17692292,A longitudinal typology of symptoms of depression and anxiety over the life course.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about long-term profiles of depressive and anxious symptomatology over the life course and about the developmental determinants of different trajectories. The objective of this study was to identify a novel typology of symptoms of depression and anxiety over the life course and examine its neurodevelopmental antecedents in an epidemiological sample. METHODS: A longitudinal latent variable analysis was conducted on measures of anxious and depressive symptoms at ages 13, 15, 36, 43, and 53 years among 4627 members of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health & Development (the British 1946 birth cohort). Early life predictors of class membership were studied with ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: We identified six distinct profiles up to age 53: absence of symptoms (44.8% of sample); repeated moderate symptoms (33.6%); adult-onset moderate symptoms (11.3%); adolescent symptoms with good adult outcome (5.8%); adult-onset severe symptoms (2.9%); and repeated severe symptoms over the life course (1.7%). Heavier babies had lower likelihood of depressive and anxious symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = .92; 95% confidence interval [CI] .85-.99), whereas delay in first standing (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.11-1.28) and walking (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.14-1.31) was associated with subsequent higher likelihood of symptoms, controlling for social circumstances and stressful life events during childhood. CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence of distinct profiles of depressive and anxious symptomatology over the life course and associations with markers of neurodevelopment. This suggests very early factors are associated with long-term experience of symptoms of depression and anxiety.",Biological psychiatry,2007 Dec 1,United States,2007,00
17597236,Environmental and social determinants of aging perception in metropolitan and rural areas of Southern Italy.,"The increasing life expectancy is accompanied by a growing request of social and health care services, and social inequalities may contribute to a poor quality of life (QoL) and an increased risk of cognitive impairment and disability. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of social, environmental, and economic factors in determining subjective perception of aging in older people coming from two different areas (metropolitan and rural) of Southern Italy. We used data from a survey carried out in three metropolitan and three rural communities in Southern Italy. The cross-sectional descriptive study was performed by conducting structured interviews and assessments during home visits. Life conditions and health at older ages were investigated with a questionnaire. Elderly people were divided into two population cohorts, namely 304 subjects (152 from metropolitan and 152 from rural area) controlling demographic, social, environmental, and health characteristics. For this study we used the multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a statistical technique used to highlight the interrelationships between qualitative variables describing a population. More significant environmental and social variable categories linked to negative aging perception were poor education, low income, female gender, widowhood, unsatisfactory health perception, perceived high functional disability, life arrangements, difficulty in reaching services, and environmental problems. Social, ecological, and environmental factors could play a relevant role in determining health status and disability with increasing request of social and health care services.",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2008 May-Jun,Netherlands,2008,00
11407169,"Social capital, disorganized communities, and the third way: understanding the retreat from structural inequalities in epidemiology and public health.","The construct of social capital has recently captured the interest of researchers in social epidemiology and public health. The authors review current hypotheses on the social capital and health link, and examine the empirical evidence and its implications for health policy. The construct of social capital employed in the public health literature lacks depth compared with its uses in social science. It presents itself as an alternative to materialist structural inequalities (class, gender, and race) and invokes a romanticized view of communities without social conflict that favors an idealist psychology over a psychology connected to material resources and social structure. The evidence on social capital as a determinant of better health is scant or ambiguous. Even if confirmed, such hypotheses call for attention to social determinants beyond the proximal realm of individualized sociopsychological infrastructure. Social capital is used in public health as an alternative to both state-centered economic redistribution and party politics, and represents a potential privatization of both economics and politics. Such uses of social capital mirror recent ""third way"" policies in Germany, the United Kingdom, and United States. If third way policies lose support in Europe, the prominence of social capital there might be short lived. In the United States, where the working class is less likely to influence social policy, interest in social capital could be longer lived or could drift into academic limbo like other psychosocial constructs once heralded as the next big idea.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2001,United States,2001,00
17672224,"The implications of public policy related to parks, recreation, and public health: a focus on physical activity.","A collaborative framework that influences the promotion of policy related to physical activity should include parks and recreation as well as public health practitioners and researchers. As governments at all levels become increasingly focused on the impact of public resources, park and recreation agencies are challenged to document and demonstrate the impact of leisure services. Public policy associated with parks and recreation is driven by public interest and is often debated in the absence of relevant research to demonstrate the determinants and correlates of parks and recreation to address prevailing social conditions. This paper describes current policy and funding issues faced by public parks and recreation professionals responding to increasing physically active leisure across the lifespan of Americans. We also discuss how a collaborative framework approach can be used to inform public policy designed to increase the physical activity of the American public.",Journal of physical activity & health,2007,United States,2007,00
17192151,Systematic development of a self-help and motivational enhancement intervention to promote sexual health in HIV-positive men who have sex with men.,"The objective of this study was to describe the application of a systematic process-Intervention Mapping-to developing a theory- and evidence-based intervention to promote sexual health in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Intervention Mapping provides a framework that gives program planners a systematic method for decision-making in each phase of intervention development. In Step 1, we focused on the improvement of two health-promoting behaviors: satisfactory sexual functioning and safer sexual behavior. These behaviors were then linked with selected personal and external determinants, such as attitudes and social support, to produce a set of proximal program objectives. In Step 2, theoretical methods were identified to influence the proximal program objectives and were translated into practical strategies. Although theoretical methods were derived from various theories, self-regulation theory and a cognitive model of behavior change provided the main framework for selecting the intervention methods. The main strategies chosen were bibliotherapy (i.e., the use of written material to help people solve problems or change behavior) and motivational interviewing. In Step 3, the theoretical methods and practical strategies were applied in a program that comprised a self-help guide, a motivational interviewing session and a motivational interviewing telephone call, both delivered by specialist nurses in HIV treatment centers. In Step 4, implementation was anticipated by developing a linkage group to ensure involvement of program users in the planning process and conducting additional research to understand how to implement our program better. In Step 5, program evaluation was anticipated based on the planning process from the previous Intervention Mapping steps.",AIDS patient care and STDs,2006 Dec,United States,2006,00
19162433,Perceived accessibility of cigarettes among youth: a prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: The accessibility of tobacco for youth is difficult to measure, partly because of the varied sources of cigarettes. Perceptions about the accessibility of cigarettes assesses availability from all potential sources and has been found to predict future smoking. This study examines the determinants of perceived accessibility from the perspective of a longitudinal study. METHODS: Data were derived from the second Development and Assessment of Nicotine Dependence in Youth study, a 4-year longitudinal study of 1246 sixth-grade students who underwent up to 11 in-person interviews from 2002 to 2006. Perceived accessibility was assessed prospectively by asking students whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement It would be easy for me to get a cigarette. RESULTS: At baseline, the average age was 12 years; 85% had never before smoked; more than 21% perceived that cigarettes were easy to obtain. Perceived accessibility increased over the 4 years among the cohort. Youth with friends who smoked or whose parents allowed the watching of R-rated movies were more likely to perceive easy accessibility of cigarettes. Among nonsmokers, there was a dose-response relationship between perceived accessibility and exposure to smoking in the family environment. Nonsmokers who knew commercial sources of cigarettes also had higher perceived accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: Several potentially preventable exposures to tobacco in the family and social environment contribute to confidence among some youth that cigarettes are easy to obtain. Further studies are needed to determine if modifying these factors (e.g., through programs to reduce the exposure of youth to tobacco products in the home) might reduce perceived accessibility.",American journal of preventive medicine,2009 Mar,Netherlands,2009,00
16473378,Access to water in the countries of the former Soviet Union.,"BACKGROUND: During the Soviet period, authorities in the USSR invested heavily in collective farming and modernization of living conditions in rural areas. However, many problems remained, including poor access to many basic amenities such as water. Since then, the situation is likely to have changed; economic decline has coincided with migration and widening social inequalities, potentially increasing disparities within and between countries. AIM: To examine access to water and sanitation and its determinants in urban and rural areas of eight former Soviet countries. METHODS: A series of nationally representative surveys in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Ukraine was undertaken in 2001, covering 18,428 individuals (aged 18+ years). RESULTS: The percentage of respondents living in rural areas varied between 27 and 59% among countries. There are wide urban-rural differences in access to amenities. Even in urban areas, only about 90% of respondents had access to cold running water in their home (60% in Kyrgyzstan). In rural areas, less than one-third had cold running water in their homes (44% in Russia, under 10% in Kyrgyzstan and Moldova). Between one-third and one-half of rural respondents in some countries (such as Belarus, Kazakhstan and Moldova) obtained their water from wells and similar sources. Access to hot running water inside the homes was an exception in rural households, reflecting the lack of modern heating methods in villages. Similarly, indoor access to toilets is common in urban areas but rare in rural areas. Access to all amenities was better in Russia compared with elsewhere in the region. Indoor access to cold water was significantly more common among rural residents living in apartments, and in settlements served by asphalt roads rather than dirt roads. People with more assets or income and living with other people were significantly more likely to have water on tap. In addition, people who had moved in more recently were more likely to have an indoor water supply. CONCLUSIONS: This was the largest single study of its kind undertaken in this region, and demonstrates that a significant number of people living in rural parts of the former Soviet Union do not have indoor access to running water and sanitation. There are significant variations among countries, with the worse situation in central Asia and the Caucasus, and the best situation in Russia. Access to water strongly correlates with socio-economic characteristics. These findings suggest a need for sustained investment in rebuilding basic infrastructure in the region, and monitoring the impact of living conditions on health.",Public health,2006 Apr,Netherlands,2006,00
11753256,Age of the emergence of negative attitudes toward strabismus.,"INTRODUCTION: Strabismus impacts a variety of psychosocial variables in both children and adults. Poor self-esteem, lack of confidence, altered interpersonal relationships, and difficulty with employment procurement have been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the age at which children perceive strabismus in dolls and to evaluate their reactions. METHODS: Three identical dolls were altered so that one was orthotropic, one esotropic, and one exotropic. Thirty-four naive children between 3 and 7 years of age were individually placed in a waiting room with the 3 dolls as the only toys with which to play. A one-way mirror allowed a hidden observer to tabulate the number of positive and negative behaviors exhibited toward each doll. After a 10-minute observation period, the children were asked a short series of questions about their preferences and attitudes toward the dolls. Odds ratios were then determined for both the observed behaviors and the expressed responses to the strabismic dolls compared with the orthotropic dolls. RESULTS: Children aged 5(3/4) years and older were 73 times more likely than younger children to express a negative feeling about the strabismic dolls when asked (P =.003). Additionally, when comparing the strabismic dolls with the orthotropic doll, children aged 3 to 4(1/4) years did not notice a difference, children aged 4(1/2) to 5(1/4) years tended to describe the eyes as ""different,"" and children aged 5(3/4) years or older almost uniformly gave a negative description of the strabismic dolls. CONCLUSIONS: A negative attitude toward strabismus appears to emerge at approximately 6 years of age. The biopsychosocial determinants of dislike and hostility toward ocular deviations are apparently acquired, learned responses.",Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,2001 Dec,United States,2001,00
16783115,Understanding the determinants of exercise intentions in multiple myeloma cancer survivors: an application of the theory of planned behavior.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the demographic, medical, and social cognitive determinants of exercise intentions in a population-based sample of multiple myeloma cancer survivors. Using a cross-sectional survey, 70 multiple myeloma cancer survivors completed a questionnaire that assessed their medical and demographic characteristics, past exercise behavior, and social cognitive exercise beliefs using the theory of planned behavior. Seventy participants provided valuable data. Descriptive statistics indicated that participants had quite positive instrumental attitude, intentions, and subjective norms and moderate levels of perceived behavioral control and affective attitudes for exercise. Forced entry multiple regression showed that the theory of planned behavior explained 43% of the variance in exercise intentions. Instrumental attitude and perceived behavioral control were both independent predictors of exercise intentions. No demographic or medical variable moderated the association between the theory of planned behavior constructs and exercise intentions. The results of the present investigation support the growing body of evidence confirming the utility of the theory of planned behavior to understand the salient determinants of exercise in cancer survivors. Knowledge gained from this study provides important information to oncology practitioners who are responsible for delivering supportive care interventions, including exercise, to patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma.",Cancer nursing,2006 May-Jun,United States,2006,00

16921005,Retirement patterns from career employment.,"PURPOSE: This article investigates how older Americans leave their career jobs and estimates the extent of intermediate labor force activity (bridge jobs) between full-time work on a career job and complete labor-force withdrawal. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we explored the work histories and retirement patterns of a cohort of retirees aged 51 to 61 in 1992 during a 10-year period in both cross-sectional and longitudinal contexts. We examined determinants of retirement patterns in a multinomial logistic regression model. RESULTS: We found that a majority of older Americans with career jobs retire gradually, in stages, rather than all at once. We also found that the utilization of bridge jobs was more common among younger respondents, respondents without defined-benefit pension plans, and respondents at both the lower and upper ends of the wage distribution. IMPLICATIONS: Older Americans are now working longer than pre-1980s trends would have predicted. Given concerns about the traditional sources of retirement income (Social Security, employer pensions, and prior savings), older Americans may have to rely more on earnings. This article suggests that many are already doing so by moving to bridge jobs after leaving their career employment.",The Gerontologist,2006 Aug,United States,2006,00
15331863,Assessing competence: the European Survey on Aging Protocol (ESAP).,"OBJECTIVES: The main goal of this research project was to translate and adapt the European Survey on Ageing Protocol (ESAP) to 7 European countries/cultures. This article presents preliminary results from the ESAP, the basic assessment instrument of EXCELSA (European Longitudinal Study of Aging). METHODS: 672 individuals aged 30-85, selected through quota sampling (by age, gender, education and living conditions), participated in this study, with 96 subjects from each of the 7 European countries. The basic research protocol for assessing competence and its determinants was designed to be administered in a 90-min in-home face-to-face interview. It contains a series of questions, instruments, scales and physical tests assessing social relationships and caregiving, mental abilities, well-being, personality, mastery and perceived control, self-reported health, lifestyles, anthropometry, biobehavioral measures and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: 84% of ESAP measures are age-dependent and 75% of them discriminate between education levels. Minor differences were found due to gender, and between people living in rural and urban areas. Exploratory factor analysis yielded 10 factors accounting for 67.85% of total variance, one of which was identified as cognitive and physical 'competence'. This factorial structure was tested across countries through concordance coefficients. Finally, using structural equation modeling, our data were fitted into a model of competence. When the sample was split into younger groups (aged 30-49 years) and older ones (50 and more years), the same model was appropriate for our data. DISCUSSION: The results are discussed in accordance with other findings on psychosocial, biophysical and sociodemographic components of competence, and also in accordance with theories on competence and successful aging.",Gerontology,2004 Sep-Oct,Switzerland,2004,00
11330781,The political context of social inequalities and health.,"This analysis reflects on the importance of political parties, and the policies they implement when in government, in determining the level of equalities/inequalities in a society, the extent of the welfare state (including the level of health care coverage by the state), the employment/unemployment rate, and the level of population health. The study looks at the impact of the major political traditions in the advanced OECD countries during the golden years of capitalism (1945-1980) -- social democratic, Christian democratic, liberal, and ex-fascist -- in four areas: (1) the main determinants of income inequalities, such as the overall distribution of income derived from capital versus labor, wage dispersion in the labor force, the redistributive effect of the welfare state, and the levels and types of employment/ unemployment; (2) levels of public expenditures and health care benefits coverage; (3) public support of services to families, such as child care and domiciliary care; and (4) the level of population health as measured by infant mortality rates. The results indicate that political traditions more committed to redistributive policies (both economic and social) and full-employment policies, such as the social democratic parties, were generally more successful in improving the health of populations, such as reducing infant mortality. The erroneous assumption of a conflict between social equity and economic efficiency, as in the liberal tradition, is also discussed. The study aims at filling a void in the growing health and social inequalities literature, which rarely touches on the importance of political forces in influencing inequalities. The data used in the study are largely from OECD health data for 1997 and 1998; the OECD statistical services; the comparative welfare state data set assembled by Huber, Ragin and Stephens; and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.",Social science & medicine (1982),2001 Feb,England,2001,00
16770704,Symbolic racism and Whites' attitudes towards punitive and preventive crime policies.,"This study analyzes the determinants of Whites' support for punitive and preventive crime policies. It focuses on the predictive power of beliefs about race as described by symbolic racism theory. A dataset with 849 White respondents from three waves of the Los Angeles County Social Survey was used. In order to assess the weight of racial factors in crime policy attitudes, the effects of a range of race-neutral attitude determinants were controlled for, namely individual and structural crime attributions, perceived seriousness of crime, crime victimization, conservatism and news exposure. Results show a strong effect of symbolic racism on both types of crime policies, and in particular on punitive policies. High levels of symbolic racism are associated with support for tough, punitive crime policies and with opposition to preventive policies. Sub-dimensions of symbolic racism qualified these relationships, by showing that internal symbolic racism (assessing perceived individual deficiencies of Blacks) was most strongly predictive of punitiveness, whereas external symbolic racism (denial of institutional discrimination) predicted opposition to structural remedies. On the whole, despite the effects of race-neutral factors, the impact of symbolic racism on policy attitudes was substantial. Thus, White public opinion on both punitive and preventive crime policies is at least partially driven by racial prejudice.",Law and human behavior,2006 Aug,United States,2006,00
15100576,Psychosocial factors associated with cancer behavioural risk in relatives of cancer patients.,"The European Code against Cancer includes some primary cancer prevention behaviours, which can be studied in the framework of psychosocial models of human behaviour as the ASE model (attitude-social influence-efficacy model). The objective of this study was to detect the factors that better explain cancer behavioural risk in relatives of cancer patients. A convenience sample of 3031 people was selected in primary care centres. A three-step multivariate analysis was carried out by means of a multiple linear regression, introducing cancer behavioural risk as the dependent variable and the following covariables: psychosocial factors in the ASE model, sociodemographic variables and the family history of cancer. At least five difficulties and four needs were perceived in following the preventive advice by 25% of patients. The main difficulties were tobacco and alcohol addiction and the demands of a social life. Principal needs were access to cessation programmes, family support, and being controlled and pressured by health workers. The highest risk profile is to be a young man with a low sociocultural level. The ASE determinants were the best predictors of cancer behavioural risk, so programmes that forget these predictors may not achieve any impact and may waste resources.",European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),2004 Apr,England,2004,00
20028669,"Choosing health, constrained choices.","In parallel with the neo-liberal retrenchment of the welfarist state, an increasing emphasis on the responsibility of individuals in managing their own affairs and their well-being has been evident. In the health arena for instance, this was a major theme permeating the UK government's White Paper Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier (2004), which appealed to an ethos of autonomy and self-actualization through activity and consumption which merited esteem. As a counterpoint to this growing trend of informed responsibilization, constrained choices (constrained agency) provides a useful framework for a judicious balance and sense of proportion between an individual behavioural focus and a focus on societal, systemic, and structural determinants of health and well-being. Constrained choices is also a conceptual bridge between responsibilization and population health which could be further developed within an integrative biosocial perspective one might refer to as the social ecology of health and disease.",Global health promotion,2009 Dec,England,2009,00
18301132,Mathematical models for HIV transmission dynamics: tools for social and behavioral science research.,"HIV researchers have long appreciated the need to understand the social and behavioral determinants of HIV-related risk behavior, but the cumulative impact of individual behaviors on population-level HIV outcomes can be subtle and counterintuitive, and the methods for studying this are rarely part of a traditional social science or epidemiology training program. Mathematical models provide a way to examine the potential effects of the proximate biologic and behavioral determinants of HIV transmission dynamics, alone and in combination. The purpose of this article is to show how mathematical modeling studies have contributed to our understanding of the dynamics and disparities in the global spread of HIV. Our aims are to demonstrate the value that these analytic tools have for social and behavioral sciences in HIV prevention research, to identify gaps in the current literature, and to suggest directions for future research.",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2008 Mar 1,United States,2008,00

Bandura, 1997) was tested using structural equation modeling of data from 307 food shoppers recruited from 5 supermarkets in Southwest Virginia. The shoppers were participating in the baseline phase of an ongoing nutrition promotion program. As part of the evaluation, data were collected on the self-efficacy and outcome-expectations components of social-cognitive theory as well as on food purchases and intake. The structural analyses presented here support the social-cognitive model. Self-efficacy, physical outcome expectations, age, socioeconomic status, and number of children were important predictors of nutrition behavior among shoppers. Implications for interventions using social-cognitive variables to improve the nutritional content of food purchases and intake are discussed.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2000 Sep,United States,2000,00
16740677,Identifying determinants of protocol adoption by midwives: a comprehensive approach.,"Adoption of potentially effective preventive interventions often fails. This study aimed to identify factors that determine why midwifery practices decide to use a smoking cessation protocol, using a comprehensive model of both organizational and psychosocial factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among representatives of all 446 Dutch midwifery practices, of whom 251 (56%) responded. The results show that adoption of the protocol was facilitated by the presence of practice assistants and impeded by a large proportion of clients of foreign ethnic origin. The most successful information channel was the midwives' professional association. A consistent positive attitude (perceiving a lot of advantages, few disadvantages and a low level of ambivalence) and positive social norms toward using the protocol, a perceived large proportion of midwives who use the protocol and knowledge about the protocol significantly increased the likelihood of adoption. The decision to use the protocol was better explained by personal awareness and motivation factors than by organizational factors.",Health education research,2007 Feb,England,2007,00
17204532,Psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis.,"Quality of life (QoL) has been recognized as an important outcome of schizophrenia treatment, yet the determinants of QoL for individuals with schizophrenia are not well known. Research has consistently found psychiatric symptoms to be negatively related to QoL, however, findings concerning the strength of these relationships have been mixed, making it difficult to determine the degree to which such symptoms are related to poor QoL. This research presents a systematic meta-analysis of studies examining the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and QoL in schizophrenia, in an effort to elucidate the determinants of QoL for this population. A total of 56 studies were extracted from literature searches of relevant databases for empirical reports published between 1966 and 2005 examining the relationship between positive, negative, and/or general psychiatric symptoms and QoL. Weighted effect size analyses revealed small relationships between psychiatric symptoms and QoL, with general psychopathology showing the strongest negative associations across all QoL indicators. Moderator analyses indicated that variation in effect sizes could be accounted for by differing operationalizations of QoL, study design, sample, and participant treatment setting. In particular, positive and negative symptoms were more strongly related to poor QoL among studies of schizophrenia outpatients, whereas general psychopathology showed a consistent negative relationship with QoL across all study samples and treatment settings. Implications for future research and treatment development are discussed.",Schizophrenia bulletin,2007 Sep,United States,2007,00
17448554,"Mortality, lifestyle and socio-economic status.","This paper uses the British Health and Lifestyle Survey (1984-1985) data and the longitudinal follow-up of May 2003 to investigate the determinants of premature mortality in Great Britain and the contribution of lifestyle choices to socio-economic inequality in mortality. A behavioural model, which relates premature mortality to a set of observable and unobservable factors, is considered. A maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) approach for a multivariate probit (MVP) is used to estimate a recursive system of equations for mortality, morbidity and lifestyles. Health inequality is explored using the Gini coefficient and a decomposition technique. The decomposition analysis for predicted mortality shows that, after allowing for endogeneity, lifestyles contribute strongly to inequality in mortality, reducing the direct role of socio-economic status. This contradicts the view, which is widely held in epidemiology, that lifestyles make a relatively minor contribution to observed socio-economic gradients in health.",Journal of health economics,2008 Jan,Netherlands,2008,00
19142581,Reduced patient demands in hospitals and their determinants.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze the extent to which patients have suppressed their demands during their hospital stay and to examine the factors that determine this reduction in demands. METHODS: The data, which provided the basis for this study, were obtained from a postal survey utilizing the Cologne Patient Questionnaire (CPQ) that was sent to 1,548 patients who had been treated in 1 of 3 hospitals in Germany. The survey itself was conducted within the scope of the research project entitled ""Organizational Governance Using Biopsychosocial Codes"" (U-BIKE-Studie). RESULTS: Eight hundred fifty-five patients completed and returned the questionnaire (55.2% response rate). Descriptive analyses showed that less than one-half of the patients surveyed had suppressed their needs and reduced their demands during their hospital stay. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that ""reduced patient demands"" in hospitals are primarily determined by a general tendency on the part of patients to excuse errors and inconvience arising during the hospital stay, a tendency that is strongly associated with the (traditional) concept of the patient role. These analyses also demonstrated that such a reduction is also determined by hospital services and hospital stay-related aspects. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses of this study revealed that fewer patients than initially expected had indeed reduced their demands during their hospital stay. Apart from the patient's experiences during their most recent hospital stay, this reduction in demands depends primarily on the patient's ""tendency to excuse"" and thus on the concept of the patient's role. Taking the concept of ""reduced patient demands"" in hospitals into consideration can help make the hospital stay more patient-oriented and ensure that the evaluation and interpretation of the hospital stay will be interpreted in light of the concept of the patient role.",International journal of public health,2009,Switzerland,2009,00

14870831,"Determinants of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in 21,588 Italian non-smokers.","BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, ischemic heart disease and respiratory diseases in non-smokers. Exposure is likely to be uneven in the population. Knowledge of its distribution is important for a better planning of preventive activities. METHODS: In the context of the Italian branch of the EPIC prospective investigation, in which we enrolled 47,000 volunteers, we have surveyed exposure to ETS and its determinants (age, social class, occupation). The purpose of the present paper is to contribute to identify the main sources of exposure in Italy. RESULTS: We found, in a sample of 21,588 Italian non-smokers, a prevalence of 0.337 (95% confidence interval, 0.336-0.337) in women and 0.537 (0.529-0.544) in men. Exposure was defined as at least 1 hr/day for at least one year. Exposure at work is by far the commonest source of exposure to ETS, with a strong difference between full-time and part-time jobs. The distribution of exposure by social class was uneven, with statistically significant odds ratios for higher social groups in the order of 0.4-0.5. White-collar workers are the occupational category mostly exposed, suggesting that the implementation of anti-smoking legislation is still incomplete in Italian offices. CONCLUSIONS: The uneven distribution of ETS in the population is a matter of concern, since it contributes to the unequal distribution of health in different social groups.",Tumori,2003 Nov-Dec,United States,2003,00
12909417,How do we make health impact assessment fit for purpose?,"Progress has been made in recent years in the process of health impact assessment (HIA), including community involvement. The technical side is less well developed. A minimum requirement is that there should be some consistency or robustness, so that the outcome of an HIA does not depend just on who happens to carry it out, that it is not easily swayed by the vested interests that typically surround any project, and that it can withstand legal challenge. Validity is an important criterion, as well as repeatability, as the latter can be achieved merely by propagating errors. All types of evidence should be considered legitimate, including qualitative and quantitative methods. The quality of evidence, and its generalisability, need to be carefully assessed; we should leave behind the divisive discourse around ""positivism"". Typically there is less information on the links from interventions (policies or projects) to changes in determinants of health than there is on the immediate precursors of health and ill-health. A practical question is, how the best existing knowledge can be made available to HIA practitioners. Other issues are more tractable than is often thought, e.g. that an HIA has to be able to trade off positive and negative impacts to different groups of people, and that the complexity of social causation prevents clear analysis of cause and effect.",Public health,2003 Sep,Netherlands,2003,00
21119817,"The state of child development in Canada: Are we moving toward, or away from, equity from the start?","Young children have a remarkable capacity for developmental plasticity in response to the environments where they grow up, live and learn. In recognition of this capacity, the World Health Organization International Commission on the Social Determinants of Health recommended in 2008 that ""governments build universal coverage of a comprehensive package of quality early child development programs and services for children, mothers, and other caregivers, regardless of ability to pay"". Yet, in its recent report card on early learning and care, the United Nations Children's Fund revealed that Canada met only one out of 10 benchmarks, tying for last place with Ireland out of 26 wealthy countries. Not surprisingly, in Canada, large socioeconomic disparities emerge early in life in children's physical, social/emotional and language/cognitive development, which are largely attributable to systematic differences in the nature of their early environments. Moreover, there is evidence of decline in the state of early child development in Canada in recent years, concurrent with increasing economic and time pressures on families. To date, Canada has had the weakest public policy response (among the wealthy countries) to the emerging understanding of the importance of the early years. If recent activities and initiatives in Ontario, Quebec, the Canadian Senate and several other provinces are fully realized, Canada will begin to close the gap between what we know and what we do in the early childhood years.",Paediatrics & child health,2009 Dec,England,2009,00
11061638,Multiple levels of analysis and intervention in HIV prevention science: exemplars and directions for new research.,"The need to continue the scientific development of evidence-based HIV-1 prevention strategies is clear. The epidemic continues to rage out of control, and a vaccine against HIV-1 is nowhere in sight. We think that it is important to consider the influence of multiple social units on HIV risk behavior. In this article, we use ecological theory to outline multiple levels of analysis at which preventive interventions can be conceptualized. These levels include the individual, dyadic/small group, organizational, community, and societal/cultural. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of locating HIV risk at each level, and provide exemplars of HIV prevention for each in an effort to encourage HIV prevention scientists to consider the level at which they are locating the determinants of HIV risk behavior when conducting research. We conclude by stating that scientists and research funding has favored the individual level of analysis, but that to be most successful, the field of HIV prevention science should address risk behavior at all levels of analysis.","AIDS (London, England)",2000 Sep,England,2000,00
12225453,The mental health status of Filipinas in Queensland.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and investigate potential predictors of psychological distress in Filipino women living in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: The sample of n = 487 women (88% response rate) was drawn from Filipino organization membership lists and supplemented by snowball sampling. Participants were interviewed in their homes or at a community event in 1996/1997. Follow-up in 1997/1998 involved n = 346 women (71% response rate) who were interviewed either in their homes or by telephone. The two surveys included measurement of demographic, immigration, physical health, satisfaction with life in Australia and life event variables. The GHQ-28 was included in the follow-up survey as a measure of psychological distress. RESULTS: The proportion of women having an above threshold score (using the cut-off of 4/5) on the GHQ-28 was 23%. Women who were single, dissatisfied with life in Australia, had reported a major change in their financial situation, their relationship or their health in the year between surveys were significantly more likely to have an above threshold score. CONCLUSIONS: The level of mental distress among Filipinas in Queensland appears to be slightly higher than the levels reported in the general population but lower than other migrant groups. The determinants of mental distress in this population contrast with those in the general Australian population and other migrant groups. The social context of these determinants in Filipinas needs to be elicited for an understanding of these differences.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,2002 Oct,England,2002,00
17466104,Life-course approaches to inequalities in adult chronic disease risk.,"A life-course approach to chronic-disease epidemiology uses a multidisciplinary framework to understand the importance of time and timing in associations between exposures and outcomes at the individual and population levels. Such an approach to chronic diseases is enriched by specification of the particular manner in which timing in relation to physical growth, reproduction, infection, social mobility, behavioural transitions etc. can influence various adult chronic diseases in different ways, and more ambitiously by how these temporal processes are interconnected and manifested in health inequalities within a population and in population-level disease trends. The paper will discuss some historical background to life-course epidemiology and theoretical models of life-course processes, and will review some of the empirical evidence linking life-course processes to CHD, haemorrhagic stroke, stomach cancer and other chronic diseases in adulthood. It will also underscore that a life-course approach offers a way to conceptualize how underlying socio-environmental determinants of health, experienced at different life-course stages, can differentially influence the development of chronic diseases, as mediated through proximal specific biological processes.",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2007 May,England,2007,00
18477747,Health inequalities among the elderly in western Europe.,"BACKGROUND: This paper analyses gender inequalities in health status and in social determinants of health among the elderly in western Europe. METHODS: Data came from the first wave of the ""Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe"" (2004). For the purposes of this study a subsample of community-residing people aged 65-85 years with no paid work was selected (4218 men and 5007 women). Multiple logistic regression models separated by sex and adjusted for age and country were fitted. RESULTS: Women were more likely to report poor health status, limitations in mobility and poor mental health. Whereas in both sexes educational attainment was associated with the three health indicators, household income was only related to poor self-rated health among women. The relationship between living arrangements and health differed by gender and was primarily associated with poor mental health. In both sexes, not living with their partner but living with other people and being the household head was related to poor mental health status (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.14; 95% CI 1.11 to 4.14 for men and aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.72 for women). In addition, women living with their partner and other(s) and those living alone were more likely to report poor mental health status (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.41 and aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Health inequalities persist among the elderly. Women have poorer health status than men and in both sexes the risk of poor health status increases among those with low educational attainment. Living arrangements are primarily associated with poor mental health status with patterns that differ by gender.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2008 Jun,England,2008,00

15933558,Role of sexual behavior in the acquisition of asymptomatic Epstein-Barr virus infection: a longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND: The natural history of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is poorly defined. We report the prevalence and subsequent incidence of EBV infection in a cohort of sexually active young women and explore the social and sexual determinants of incident infections. METHODS: The study population was drawn from a cohort of young women, who were recruited for a longitudinal study of risk factors for early cervical neoplasia. A case-control analysis, nested within the cohort of 45 women for whom the first EBV sample tested was EBV-negative and who had further follow-up, was undertaken. EBV serostatus was determined in serum with a synthetic peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EBV DNA was measured in cervical smears with the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 1023 women 15-19 years of age included in this analysis, 978 (95.6%) tested positive for antibodies to EBV in their first serum sample. Of 45 women who tested negative, 22 subsequently acquired an asymptomatic EBV infection; the median time to seroconversion was 25 months (range, 1-60 months), and the median age at seroconversion was 18 years (range, 16-21 years). The risk of seroconversion increased with increasing number of sexual partners [compared with 1 partner, odds ratio (OR) was 1.28 for 2 partners and 2.23 for 3 or more; chiTREND 5.02; df 1; P < 0.05] and was greatest when a new sexual partner had been acquired in the 2 years before seroconversion (OR 4.78; chi 4.62; df 1; P < 0.05). EBV DNA was detected in 9 of 14 women who seroconverted and who also provided cervical samples. CONCLUSIONS: In susceptible young women, the acquisition of EBV infection is associated with their sexual behavior.",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,2005 Jun,United States,2005,00
18212132,Optimizing the efficacy of smoking cessation contests: an exploration of determinants of successful quitting.,"The present study describes the short- and long-term efficacy and program evaluation of a Quit and Win smoking cessation campaign, organized in The Netherlands. To be able to fine-tune smoking cessation contests to the needs of the target population, utilization, appreciation and efficacy of various contest elements were investigated. Data from 1,551 Quit and Win participants and 244 control respondents were collected by web-based surveys at baseline (pre-contest) and 1 and 12 months after the contest. Demographic and contest predictors of successful quitting were determined by logistic regression analyses. Quit and Win proved to be an effective as well as highly appreciated program among participants. Conservative 1-month (35%) and continuous 12-month abstinence (12%) rates were significantly higher in Quit and Win participants than in the control group (1 month: 11%; continuous: 3%). Use of a supportive e-mail message service predicted short- and long-term abstinence. A buddy support system was the most used and highly appreciated cessation aid, and its use significantly predicted short-term abstinence. Radio commercials and Internet advertisements were the most effective recruitment channels. Although non-exhaustive, implementation of the results and recommendations discussed in this study could lead to an increased use, appreciation and efficacy of future smoking cessation campaigns.",Health education research,2009 Feb,England,2009,00
16338102,Determinants of 12-step group affiliation and moderators of the affiliation-abstinence relationship.,"This study examined characteristics of substance use disorder (SUD) outpatients at intake to treatment (N=345) that were associated with more 12-step group attendance and involvement, Steps worked, and acceptance of 12-step philosophy at a 6-month follow-up (N=281, 81.4%). Patient characteristics covered the domains of sociodemographics, SUD severity, personal functioning, and previous help received. Distinguishing baseline characteristics of patients who attended more 12-step group meetings during follow-up were being less-educated, more engaged in religious practices, and more extroverted and interpersonally competent, and having had more previous 12-step group exposure. These patient characteristics were generally similar to those associated with more 12-step meeting involvement and philosophy acceptance. More 12-step meeting attendance and involvement were related to abstinence at 6 months. Associations of attendance with abstinence were stronger among patients who were younger, white, less-educated, unstably employed, less religious, and less interpersonally skilled. These patients may have had fewer available social resources and so benefitted more from the fellowship and support for abstinence that 12-step group members often provide. We suggest methods by which treatment providers may encourage 12-step group affiliation among patients likely to benefit from it on substance use outcomes.",Drug and alcohol dependence,2006 Jun 28,Ireland,2006,00

Individual behavior and health promotion was critically examined within the context of (HIV) Human Immunodeficiency Virus and AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome) among young African-American men who have sex with men. Examples from the literature provided empirical illustrations of how these concepts have been defined conceptually and measured with respect to HIV/AIDS; particularly among this population from a public health perspective. Additionally, a conceptual model depicting the interplay of these concepts was reviewed and is provided and discussed to shed further light on the conceptual link between these concepts and healthy behaviors among sexually active African-American young men who have sex with men. The concepts are discussed in an integrative format throughout the paper within the backdrop of the proposed model for understanding the wave of HIV/AIDS within this subculture from a public health nursing perspective.",Journal of National Black Nurses' Association : JNBNA,2003 Dec,United States,2003,00
16288659,Response of religious groups to HIV/AIDS as a sexually transmitted infection in Trinidad.,"BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination are significant determinants of HIV transmission in the Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T), where the adult HIV/AIDS prevalence is 2.5%. T&T is a spiritually-aware society and over 104 religious groups are represented. This religious diversity creates a complex social environment for the transmission of a sexually transmitted infection like HIV/AIDS. Religious leaders are esteemed in T&T's society and may use their position and frequent interactions with the public to promote HIV/AIDS awareness, fight stigma and discrimination, and exercise compassion for people living with HIV/AIDS (PWHA). Some religious groups have initiated HIV/AIDS education programs within their membership, but previous studies suggest that HIV/AIDS remains a stigmatized infection in many religious organizations. The present study investigates how the perception of HIV/AIDS as a sexually transmitted infection impacts religious representatives' incentives to respond to HIV/AIDS in their congregations and communities. In correlation, the study explores how the experiences of PWHA in religious gatherings impact healing and coping with HIV/AIDS. METHODS: Between November 2002 and April 2003, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 religious representatives from 10 Christian, Hindu and Muslim denominations. The majority of respondents were leaders of religious services, while two were active congregation members. Religious groups were selected based upon the methods of Brathwaite. Briefly, 26 religious groups with the largest followings according to 2000 census data were identified in Trinidad and Tobago. From this original list, 10 religious groups in Northwest Trinidad were selected to comprise a representative sample of the island's main denominations. In-depth interviews with PWHA were conducted during the same study period, 2002-2003. Four individuals were selected from a care and support group located in Port of Spain based upon their perceived willingness to discuss religious affiliation and describe how living with a terminal infection has affected their spiritual lives. The interviewer, a United States Fulbright Scholar, explained the nature and purpose of the study to all participants. Relevant ethical procedures associated with the collection of interview data were adopted: interviews were conducted in a non-coercive manner and confidentiality was assured. All participants provided verbal consent, and agreed to be interviewed without financial or other incentive. Ethics approval was granted on behalf of the Caribbean Conference of Churches Ethics Committee. Interview questions followed a guideline, and employed an open-ended format to facilitate discussion. All interviews were recorded and transcribed by the interviewer. RESULTS: Religious representatives' opinions were grouped into the following categories: rationale for the spread of HIV/AIDS, abstinence, condom use, sexuality and homosexuality, compassion, experiences with PWHA, recommendations and current approach to addressing HIV/AIDS in congregations. Religious representatives expressed a measure of acceptance of HIV/AIDS and overwhelmingly upheld compassion for PWHA. Some statements, however, suggested that HIV/AIDS stigma pervades Trinidad's religious organizations. For many representatives, HIV/AIDS was associated with a promiscuous lifestyle and/or homosexuality. Representatives had varying levels of interaction with PWHA, but personal experiences were positively associated with current involvement in HIV/AIDS initiatives. All 4 PWHA interviewed identified themselves as belonging to Christian denominations. Three out of the 4 PWHA described discriminatory experiences with pastors or congregation members during gatherings for religious services. Nonetheless, PWHA expressed an important role for faith and religion in coping with HIV. CONCLUSION: Religious groups in Trinidad are being challenged to promote a clear and consistent response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; a response that may reflect personal experiences and respect religious doctrine in the context of sex and sexuality. The study suggests that (1) religious leaders could improve their role in the fight against HIV/AIDS with education and sensitization-specifically aimed at dismantling the myths about HIV transmission, and the stereotyping of susceptible sub-populations, and (2) a consultative dialogue between PWHAs and religious leaders is pivotal to a successful faith-based HIV intervention in Trinidad.",BMC public health,2005 Nov 16,England,2005,00
11310223,Social relations and filial maturity in middle-aged adults: contextual conditions and psychological determinants.,"The aim of this paper is to highlight the contextual and psychological preconditions of parent help and helpfulness in a sample of 260 middle-aged persons belonging to two age groups, 40-45 years and 50-55 years. In a first step we want to focus on the description of the contextual situation of the persons of this ""hinge generation"": What are their available social networks; what are their commitments towards children and parents in terms of perceived obligation and investment; how is their perceived balance of giving and receiving; how do they anticipate and experience dependency of their parents? In a second step we will highlight the readiness of middle-aged women and men to help their parents as well as the effectively reported help. Here we are interested in the psychological determinants of such attitude and behaviour. Structural equation models are performed to estimate the predictory power of personality variables, control beliefs and reported stress (family and job) on filial helpfulness and help. Results suggest that differential aspects such as gender and age group explain a large amount of variance of the variables intergenerational commitment and satisfaction with social networks and have--along with personality variables--a strong impact on filial help and helpfulness of middle-aged adults.",Zeitschrift fur Gerontologie und Geriatrie,2001 Feb,Germany,2001,00

The aim of this study was to examine the distribution and determinants of C. burnetii past infection in Northern Ireland (NI). Coxiella burnetii phase II specific IgG antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in stored serum from 2,394 randomly selected subjects, aged 12-64, who had participated in population-based surveys of cardiovascular risk factors performed in 1986 and 1987. The overall prevalence of C. burnetii antibody positivity was 12.8%. The prevalence of sero-positivity was slightly higher in males than that in females (14.3% versus 11.2%, P = 0.02). Sero-positivity was low in children (<10%), increasing to 19.5% and 16.4% in males and females, respectively, in the 25-34 age group and subsequently remaining fairly steady with increasing age. Sero-positivity among farmers, at 48.8%, was significantly higher than the general population. More sero-positive than sero-negative women had a history of a miscarriage or still-birth (19.5% versus 9.8%, P < 0.001). In conclusion, this study demonstrated a high prevalence of evidence of past C. burnetii infection in NI. Associations between past C. burnetii infection and age, sex, social class, occupation and reproductive history were seen. We estimate that 20% of Q fever infections in NI occur in farmers.",Zoonoses and public health,2008 May,Germany,2008,00
12600275,Determinants of the clinical course of musculoskeletal complaints in general practice: design of a cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal complaints are frequent and have large consequences for public health. Information about the prognosis after presentation in general practice is far from complete. Knowledge about determinants of the clinical course of musculoskeletal complaints is essential for management decisions and to inform patients about their prognosis. The purpose of this study is to provide information about the prognosis of musculoskeletal complaints other than low back pain by studying the course of these complaints in general practice and to identify determinants of this course. METHODS: Patients of 18 years and older, who present in general practice with a new episode of a musculoskeletal complaint of the neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, arm, hip, knee, ankle or foot, are recruited by their general practitioner (GP). Participants will receive complaint-specific questionnaires by mail at baseline and after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. The following putative determinants of the course of the complaints will be investigated: sociodemographic characteristics, characteristics of the complaint, psychosocial job characteristics, physical workload, physical activity during leisure time, pain coping, mood, kinesiophobia, social support, optimism. The primary outcomes are perceived recovery, pain, functional status, sick leave and overall quality of life.",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,2003 Feb 24,England,2003,00
18781489,Prevalence and determinants of fecal incontinence in premenopausal women in an Arabian community.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, awareness and determinants of fecal incontinence among Qatari women. METHOD: In the cross-sectional community-based study in primary health-care centers, using a multistage sampling design, a representative sample of randomly selected 776 Qatari women aged from 40 to 48 years were approached from January to August 2007; only 596 women, with a response rate of 76.8%, gave consent and were included in the analysis. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing fecal incontinence in the previous 12 months and health care-seeking behavior for fecal symptoms. Fecal incontinence, determined by self-report, was categorized by frequency. Females reported the level of bother of fecal incontinence and their general quality of life. Potential risk factors were assessed by self-report, interview, physical examination, and record review. RESULTS: Of the studied Qatari women, 62 (10.4%) were found to have fecal incontinence. There was a significant difference between fecal incontinent and continent groups with regard to menopause (p < 0.0001), surgical repair of genital prolapse (p < 0.0001) and constipation (p < 0.0001). Only 31 incontinent patients (50%) had sought medical advice. Of the fecal incontinent women, 77.4% felt embarrassment in consulting a doctor and 77.4% believed their condition was worth reporting to a doctor. Aging (51.6%) was the major cause of fecal incontinence in women, followed by childbirth (40.3%), then menopause (25.8%) and lastly paralysis (14.5%). Most of the sufferers were troubled by their inability to pray (64.5%). Their relationship with their husband (41.9%) was the significant consequence for fecal incontinent Qatari women (p = 0.02); 37.1% isolated themselves from social activities and going out to shop. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings revealed that fecal incontinence is a common symptom among women in the community. There was a correlation between fecal incontinence and menopause. Overall, most of the fecal incontinent women reported that fecal incontinence significantly affected quality of life and only half of the studied women had consulted a physician for the symptom.",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2008 Oct,England,2008,00

OBJECTIVE: To draw on sport physiotherapists' expert knowledge to increase understanding of adherence issues in practice and identify factors that influence adherence and strategies that can be used to enhance adherence. DESIGN: An interview design with inductive content analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Nine (6 women and 3 men) experienced sports physiotherapists. RESULTS: Under-adherence and over-adherence were issues in practice for some practitioners, and adherence was viewed as important for successful recovery from injury. Three higher order themes emerged relating to the influence of athlete characteristics, situational characteristics, and characteristics of the injury and rehabilitation on both facilitating and preventing rehabilitation adherence. Strategies to improve adherence in practice emerged from the data and broadly addressed the key determinants of adherence. CONCLUSION: Adherence to rehabilitation is influenced by a number of factors and strategies to enhance adherence are identified.",Journal of sport rehabilitation,2007 May,United States,2007,00
18243680,Alcohol and other drug related deaths among young people in CIS countries: proximal and distal causes and implications for policy.,"BACKGROUND: Although the mortality crisis that followed the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1992 has been well researched, most attention has been paid to mortality among middle-aged men. There has been relatively little analysis of death rates among young people, many of which appear related to alcohol and other drug (AOD) use. Death rates ranged from exceedingly high in some countries (e.g. Russia) to very low in others (e.g. Armenia). This divergence among Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries increased considerably over the 1990s. What caused this divergence in youth deaths and what policy response is needed? METHOD: An ecological study of country-level data was used to explore the relationships between risk factors, AOD use and youth deaths across time and between countries. Qualitative research literature was used to supplement the statistical data. RESULTS: AOD abuse risk factors were divided into 'proximal causes' (e.g. AOD availability) and 'distal causes' (e.g. social cohesion, welfare, culture). Proximal risk factors appeared to explain some of the AOD use and death data, but they did not explain all of the country differences. Analysis of distal risk factors suggested that family and community strength are important factors in the trends in AOD abuse and youth mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The policy response to AOD abuse and mortality among young people needs to attend to both proximal and distal factors. An exclusive focus on proximal risk factors is unlikely to provide a satisfactory solution. Rather, the social determinants of child and youth development need to be considered. More research is needed on the relationship between AOD abuse and youth mortality, and on the influence of family and community strength on both these outcomes in the region. Useful lessons may be learned from countries such as Armenia, where both AOD abuse and youth mortality have remained low.",The International journal on drug policy,2009 Jan,Netherlands,2009,00
19236360,Indigenous child health research: a critical analysis of Australian studies.,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a critical and systematic analysis of descriptive studies regarding the health, development and wellbeing status of Indigenous children in Australia and to map them according to 1) Reported Indigenous involvement in the research process; 2) Domains of the life-course model of health; and 3) Geographical location of the Indigenous child population sample. METHODS: A search of electronic databases, targeted websites and reference lists of relevant papers. Studies from 1958 to 2005 with clear methods and results were included. Data were extracted, mapped and analysed according to domains of the life-course model of health and development, study location, and reported level of Indigenous involvement. RESULTS: 217 studies were eligible. Research predominantly addressed physical health (75.1%) with few studies addressing mental health and wellbeing (2.8%) or health determinants (27.6%). Indigenous involvement in the research process was not apparent in 71.4% of studies, although it appears to be increasing. Compared with 10.6% in metropolitan locations, 67.2% of the studies were conducted in very remote areas. Remaining studies were conducted in remote or regional areas or were national. CONCLUSIONS: More work is needed to establish an evidence base of Australian Indigenous child health and wellbeing that is founded on Indigenous values, knowledge and participation. Not withstanding the significant need to address issues of core morbidity and physical health for Indigenous children, more research addressing emotional and social health and wellbeing is required, as are research questions of importance to Indigenous children living in urban settings.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2009 Feb,Australia,2009,00
18631386,Healthcare professionals' intentions and behaviours: a systematic review of studies based on social cognitive theories.,"BACKGROUND: There is an important gap between the implications of clinical research evidence and the routine clinical practice of healthcare professionals. Because individual decisions are often central to adoption of a clinical-related behaviour, more information about the cognitive mechanisms underlying behaviours is needed to improve behaviour change interventions targeting healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to systematically review the published scientific literature about factors influencing health professionals' behaviours based on social cognitive theories. These theories refer to theories where individual cognitions/thoughts are viewed as processes intervening between observable stimuli and responses in real world situations. METHODS: We searched psycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CIHNAL, Index to theses, PROQUEST dissertations and theses and Current Contents for articles published in English only. We included studies that aimed to predict healthcare professionals' intentions and behaviours with a clear specification of relying on a social cognitive theory. Information on percent of explained variance (R(2)) was used to compute the overall frequency-weighted mean R(2) to evaluate the efficacy of prediction in several contexts and according to different methodological aspects. The cognitive factors most consistently associated with prediction of healthcare professionals' intention and behaviours were documented. RESULTS: Seventy eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Among these studies, 72 provided information on the determinants of intention and 16 prospective studies provided information on the determinants of behaviour. The theory most often used as reference was the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) or its extension the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). An overall frequency-weighted mean R(2) of 0.31 was observed for the prediction of behaviour; 0.59 for the prediction of intention. A number of moderators influenced the efficacy of prediction; frequency-weighted mean R(2) varied from 0.001 to 0.58 for behaviour and 0.19 to 0.81 for intention. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the TPB appears to be an appropriate theory to predict behaviour whereas other theories better capture the dynamic underlying intention. In addition, given the variations in efficacy of prediction, special care should be given to methodological issues, especially to better define the context of behaviour performance.",Implementation science : IS,2008 Jul 16,England,2008,00
15750852,Cancer disparities: developing a multidisciplinary research agenda - preface.,"In this Special Issue, we present a series of papers concerned with developing a multidisciplinary research agenda to address social disparities in cancer. Motivating this Special Issue are two concerns: (1) despite major advances in knowledge during the 20th century about the extent, determinants, treatment, and prevention of cancer, social disparities in cancer, including within the United States, remain serious, persistent, and require redress; and (2) huge gaps in knowledge exist regarding the causes of and solutions to social disparities in cancer across the full cancer continuum, from prevention to occurrence to diagnosis to treatment and, all too often, to death. Consequently, critical research is critically needed, both to answer the unanswered questions and to ascertain why existing knowledge is not implemented to reduce and eliminate these disparities. To help advance work in this field, we share papers developed for a January 2004 workshop on cancer disparities held at the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC), in Boston, MA. Topics addressed include: the definition and magnitude of, and programmatic responses to, social disparities in cancer, plus development of a systematic approach to raising research questions to address cancer disparities, using the case examples of breast, cervix, colon, and prostate cancer.",Cancer causes & control : CCC,2005 Feb,Netherlands,2005,00
19368906,Determinants of regional differences in the incidence of impetigo.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Impetigo is a common contagious skin infection, mostly seen in children and caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or group A B-hemolytic Streptococcus. Two surveys performed in general practice showed a strong geographical gradient in the incidence rates among children in the Netherlands. The incidence in the south was approximately twice as high as in the rest of the Netherlands. We hypothesized that this difference could be explained by differences in the presence of animal farms and differences in temperature. This study examined whether there is a relationship with the numbers of bovines, pigs, sheep, and poultry per km2, and temperature, which could explain the observed regional gradient in the incidence of impetigo. DESIGN AND SETTING: In this ecological study, data on the incidence of impetigo in children 0-17 years of age from the second Dutch national survey were linked to data on the density of farm animals from Statistics Netherlands and temperature data from the Dutch Metereological Service. Using logistic regression allowing for overdispersion, we tested the significance of the effect of bovines, pigs, sheep, and poultry per km2, and temperature on the incidence of impetigo, correcting for known risk factors. RESULTS: Only the number of sheep at the (COROP) regional level was significant; however, this effect could not explain the regional differences. CONCLUSION: The regional differences in the incidence of impetigo in children cannot be explained by the variation in the presence of farm animals or differences in temperature.",Environmental research,2009 Jul,Netherlands,2009,00
12594821,"Sociodemographic determinants of incidence of primary fallopian tube carcinoma, Finland 1953-97.","Primary fallopian tube carcinoma is very rare. In Western countries, it accounts for about 1% of all female genital malignant tumors. Its etiology remains poorly known, but high parity is considered to be protective. We studied determinants of incidence of primary fallopian tube carcinoma in Finland. Incidence rates for primary fallopian tube carcinoma, according to the population based Finnish Cancer Registry, from 1953- 97 were assessed by age, year of diagnosis, and type of residential area. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for the years 1971- 95 were calculated by occupation and social class variables taken from the 1970 Population Census. There were 485 cases of primary fallopian tube carcinoma registered during 45 years. The age-adjusted incidence rate increased from 1.2/1000000 in 1953-57 to 5.4/1000000 in 1993-97. This 4.5-fold increase in incidence rate corresponds to a 7-fold increase in the number of new cases. The increase is attributable to the age group beyond 55 years, the peak incidence occurring between 60-64 years. Although the relative increase in incidence rate has been larger in rural areas than in cities, the rate in the latter remains 2-fold. Women in the 2 highest social classes had a 1.8-fold incidence (95% CI = 1.2-2.6) as compared to the lowest social class. Women in agriculture and those not working outside the home had only half the cancer incidence of those in academic or clerical occupations. The incidence of primary fallopian tube carcinoma increases in Finland. Evidently, the incidence has increased simultaneously with the affluence of urban life. Part of the variation in incidence correlates with variation in parity.",International journal of cancer,2003 May 1,United States,2003,00

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The authors argue that:i) the direct impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events will have significant mental health implications;ii) climate change is already impacting on the social, economic and environmental determinants of mental health with the most severe consequences being felt by disadvantaged communities and populations; iii) understanding the full extent of the long term social and environmental challenges posed by climate change has the potential to create emotional distress and anxiety; and iv) understanding the psycho-social implications of climate change is also an important starting point for informed action to prevent dangerous climate change at individual, community and societal levels.",International journal of mental health systems,2008 Sep 17,England,2008,00
18554896,Drugscapes and the role of place and space in injection drug use-related HIV risk environments.,"Although considerable research has been conducted to identify the behavioural characteristics that predispose individuals to inject drugs or become infected with HIV via injection drug use, much less research has been conducted on structural and policy determinants, cultural norms, stigma, and ecological factors which may affect drug use risk behaviour, users' networks and HIV rates associated with drug use across geographic areas. For programme planners, whether official or grassroots, an understanding of place-based characteristics can help better identify risk environments to injection drug use-related HIV, and determine how to facilitate actions regarding public policy and harm reduction to aid in the reduction of risk. As such, we consider in this commentary the importance of geographic place and the socio-spatial and political processes related to place that may help determine where IDU-related HIV risk environments occur.",The International journal on drug policy,2009 Jan,Netherlands,2009,00
16570091,Early determinants of overweight at 4.5 years in a population-based longitudinal study.,"OBJECTIVES: The roots of the obesity epidemic need to be traced back as early in life as possible in order to develop effective means for preventing obesity and its health consequences in the future. The aim of this paper is to examine a broad range of factors that may simultaneously contribute to childhood overweight in a population-based cohort of children followed from birth to 4.5 years, to determine which factors exert the most influence in early life. DESIGN: The analyses were performed using data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development 1998-2002 (QLSCD). SUBJECTS: The study follows a representative sample (n=2103) of children born in 1998 in the Canadian province of Quebec. MEASURE: Measured height and weight were available for 1550 children aged 4.5 years. At 4.5 years, BMI was analyzed using the US CDC sex- and age-specific growth charts. In order to study children at their highest weights at various ages, odds ratios were presented for high birth weight, weight-for-stature at or above the 95th percentile at 5 months, and BMI at or above the 95th percentile at 4.5 years. Monthly weight gain between birth and five months has been analyzed. Children were also evaluated by the Z-score obtained from the standardized weight divided by height. Factors potentially related to children's weight include sex, gestational age and birth rank, breastfeeding, mothers' smoking status during pregnancy, family type at child's birth, and family income before pregnancy and when the children were 5 months and 4.5 years old. Other parental factors such as height and overweight/obesity (based on BMI) and other maternal factors (age, education, immigrant status) were also part of the analysis. RESULTS: Being in the highest quintiles of weight gain between birth and 5 months, as well as maternal smoking during pregnancy, almost double the odds of being overweight at 4.5 years. Parental overweight or obesity also increased the odds of being overweight at this age, as well as being raised in middle-income or in poor families. A greater proportion of children born to nonsmoking mothers with higher weights (more than 4000 g) were overweight at 4.5 years, the percentage being greatest for those in the highest weight-gain categories from birth to 5 months. The pattern was different for children born to smoking mothers. The greatest proportion of 4.5-year-old overweight children was seen for children born in the normal weight-range category (3000-4000 g) who were in the highest quintiles of weight gain from birth to 5 months, and for children with high birth weights (more than 4000 g) who were in the lowest quintiles of birth-to-5-months weight gain. Children who were overweight at 4.5 years and who had been born to smoking mothers started life with a birth weight around that for the population means, but they gained more weight in the first 5 months of life than did the children of nonsmoking mothers. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that behavioral and social factors exert critical influences on the onset of childhood overweight in preschool years. From a population-health perspective, interventions aimed at preventing childhood obesity would do well to target smoking pregnant women, as well as nonsmoking pregnant women at risk for giving birth to high-birth-weight children, paying particular attention to rapid weight gain in the first months of life.",International journal of obesity (2005),2006 Apr,England,2006,00

Model concepts were parents' characteristics, definition of situation, desired services, expectations, met desires, met expectations, and satisfaction. The sample included 120 parents of children, ages 3-18 years, admitted to one of five treatment programs. With minor changes, results of structural equation modeling indicated a good fit between the data and the proposed relationships. The strongest predictor of parent satisfaction was met expectations; however, inclusion of the desire concepts was essential in obtaining a strong, acceptable model fit.",Archives of psychiatric nursing,2006 Apr,United States,2006,00
19477880,Exposure to interparental violence and psychosocial maladjustment in the adult life course: advocacy for early prevention.,"BACKGROUND: Early family-level and social-level stressors are both assumed to be the components of two main path models explaining the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and its long-term consequences on mental health explored through life-course epidemiological studies. AIMS: To investigate the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and mental health outcomes in adulthood when taking into account early family and social stressors. METHODS: A retrospective French cohort study of 3023 adults representative of the general population in the Paris metropolitan area was conducted in 2005 through at-home, face-to-face interviews. The outcomes measures were current depression and lifetime suicide attempt, intimate partner violence, violence against children and alcohol dependence. RESULTS: The adults exposed to interparental violence during childhood had a higher risk of psychosocial maladjustment. After adjusting for family- and social-level stressors in childhood, this risk was, respectively, 1.44 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.00) for depression, 3.17 (1.75 to 5.73) for conjugal violence, 4.75 (1.60 to 14.14) for child maltreatment and 1.75 (1.19 to 2.57) for alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The adult consequences of parental violence in childhood-and this independently of the other forms of domestic violence and the related psychosocial risks-should lead to intensifying the prevention of and screening for this form of maltreatment of children.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2009 Jul,England,2009,00

The study was conducted with 312 male (mean age = 66.10; SD = 5.28) and 253 female adults (mean age = 66.67; SD = 5.79) who worked as volunteers in several associations and organizations in Italy. In two occasions over the course of several months, participants respectively completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires and responded to telephone interviews which assessed the study's constructs of interest. Structural equation model analyses provided support for the guiding hypothesis and findings suggested that the more general approach of SDT can be successfully integrated with a social-cognitive framework such as the TPB to provide a better insight onto the origins of the cognitive predictors of intentions in older volunteers.",International journal of aging & human development,2008,United States,2008,00

11227062,"Brief Strategic Family Therapy: twenty-five years of interplay among theory, research and practice in adolescent behavior problems and drug abuse.","This article describes a systematic program of research that focuses on Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) and the adaptations that were developed based on BSFT principles. The culture-specific origins of BSFT are reviewed, as well as its broader applications to the field of family therapy. Research is reviewed demonstrating that BSFT is a promising family-based approach to treating Hispanic youth behavior problems and drug abuse. Treatment innovations are described that address the combination of intergenerational and cultural differences that occur among youths and their Hispanic parents. Programmatic work is described that challenges basic principles of family therapy by expanding BSFT to a One Person modality and a strategic engagement procedure. Both of these novel approaches are intended to add tools to therapists' repertoire in working with difficult-to-engage families. A preview discussion of results is presented from a randomized clinical trial that is an application of an ecosystemic prevention version of BSFT. The implications of the work of the Center for Family Studies are discussed in the context of the broader service system. Ultimately, this article articulates a way of thinking about adolescent problem behavior, its social interactional determinants, and a range of theoretically consistent family-centered strategies that attempt to change social ecological processes that impact adolescent developmental trajectories.",Clinical child and family psychology review,2000 Jun,United States,2000,00

METHODS: We measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio and fibrinogen at medical screenings and smoking and alcohol consumption in health questionnaires among Japanese non-manual and manual employees of a steel products company and among English non-manual employees working in Civil Service departments. RESULTS: In England, higher employment grades were advantaged with regard to most risk factors studied. In Japan the picture was different in that higher grades had higher BMI, waist-to-hip-ratio and lower HDL cholesterol. In Japan employment grade differences in these three risk factors are clearly larger among younger men than among older men, while in England age differentials in the grade differences are small. Similar results were obtained for education. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences in the social patterning of risk factors were observed in our cohorts of employed Japanese and English men. The contribution that these risk factors make in explaining social differences in health may vary accordingly.

DATA SOURCE: Latino and black adult participants (n = 873) identified by random digit dialing were interviewed by telephone in four low-income neighborhoods in New York City: the South Bronx, East Harlem, Central Harlem, and Bedford-Stuyvesant. STUDY DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, generalized estimating equations were used to fit multilevel multivariable models to test the association between discrimination and poor mental and physical health while controlling for socioeconomic status, access to health care, social support, smoking, and the racial and ethnic composition of each neighborhood. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Discrimination due to race and discrimination due to other attributes were associated with poor self-assessed mental but not physical health in separate multivariable models. Persons who experienced multiple domains of discrimination had a greater probability of reporting poor mental health than persons who experienced no discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Discrimination due to race and other attributes was a significant correlate of mental health among Latinos and blacks independent of other accepted determinants of health.",Health services research,2003 Dec,United States,2003,00
16171258,Determinants of dental service utilization among 2 to 11-year-old California children.,"OBJECTIVE: The 2001 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) was designed to elicit population-based estimates about health care access and insurance coverage. This study aimed to determine factors associated with dental service utilization among children ages 2 to 11 years in California. METHODS: CHIS was a random digit dialing telephone survey. Interviews were conducted with the adult in the household that was most knowledgeable about the child's care, and information was collected on the child's last dental visit. RESULTS: Data on dental visits were collected on 10,569 children ages 2-11 years. In 2001, 73.5 (+/- 0.6)% of children had a dental visit, 58.2 (+/- 0.6)% a preventive dental visit, while 18.3 (+/- 0.5)% had never visited the dentist. Nearly 1 million children had never visited the dentist, primarily children ages 2-5 years. Overall, 76.3 (+/- 0.6)% of children had dental insurance. Children with a past-year dental visit were likely to be school age, insured and from high-income households. Other predictors of utilization were the responding adult's age and educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Dental service utilization is determined by a mix of parental, child and household factors.",Journal of public health dentistry,2005 Summer,United States,2005,00
17525686,The role of adherence to antiretroviral therapy in the management of HIV infection.,"Despite multiple studies demonstrating the relation between the success of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and adherence, inadequate adherence continues to be one of the most frequent reasons for poor treatment outcomes and/or lack of sustained treatment benefits. Interventions targeting patient-related social and psychologic barriers to adherence and issues related to mental health and substance abuse and access to health care may ameliorate their negative impact on adherence. Specific drug-related factors that influence adherence such as pill burden, dosing frequency, food requirements, and acute tolerability and safety concerns, however, are further issues that must be considered to optimize adherence. Fortunately, the availability of once-daily and coformulated agents with simple dosing requirements may help to improve adherence, and thereby make the difference between success and failure of HAART for some patients. A better understanding of adherence and its determinants and how to define specific goals in a given clinical setting are keys for clinicians to become more effective partners with patients in the achievement and maintenance of long-term virologic suppression and, more importantly, long-term health.",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2007 Jun 1,United States,2007,00
19300428,Differential effects of abdominal adipose tissue distribution on insulin sensitivity in black and white South African women.,"Black South African women are more insulin resistant than BMI-matched white women. The objective of the study was to characterize the determinants of insulin sensitivity in black and white South African women matched for BMI. A total of 57 normal-weight (BMI 18-25 kg/m(2)) and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) black and white premenopausal South African women underwent the following measurements: body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), body fat distribution (computerized tomography (CT)), insulin sensitivity (S(I), frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test), dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire), physical activity (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire), and socioeconomic status (SES, demographic questionnaire). Black women were less insulin sensitive (4.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.5 +/- 0.8 and 3.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 6.0 +/- 0.8 x 10(-5)/min/(pmol/l), for normal-weight and obese women, respectively, P < 0.001), but had less visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (P = 0.051), more abdominal superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) (P = 0.003), lower SES (P < 0.001), and higher dietary fat intake (P = 0.001) than white women matched for BMI. S(I) correlated with deep and superficial SAT in both black (R = -0.594, P = 0.002 and R = 0.495, P = 0.012) and white women (R = -0.554, P = 0.005 and R = -0.546, P = 0.004), but with VAT in white women only (R = -0.534, P = 0.005). In conclusion, body fat distribution is differentially associated with insulin sensitivity in black and white women. Therefore, the different abdominal fat depots may have varying metabolic consequences in women of different ethnic origins.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2009 Aug,United States,2009,00
17243077,Introductory lecture the epidemiology and determinants of obesity in developed and developing countries.,"Obesity is recognized as a serious problem in the industrialized and developed countries of the world. However, little attention is paid to the fact that obesity is becoming an increasing problem in developing countries too, with some countries showing increasing rates of obesity in the midst of the persisting occurrence of childhood malnutrition and stunting. As developing countries embrace the dominant western economic ways of development, industrialization and urbanization they contribute to improvements in living standards, with consequent dramatic changes in diets and lifestyles leading to weight gain and obesity which in turn poses a growing threat to the health. Overweight and obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyper-lipidaemia, and cardiovascular disease. It is also associated with increased rates of breast, colo-rectal and uterine cancer. Obesity is thus an important factor in the increasing morbidity and mortality due to chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and thereby contributes to premature mortality in the population. Thus, while the problem of undernutrition persists in much of the developing world, overweight and obesity and its related co-morbidities are posing an increasingly important public health problem both in the developed and developing world.",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

11565162,The utility of social capital in research on health determinants.,"Social capital has become a popular subject in the literature on determinants of health. The concept of social capital has been used in the sociological, political science, and economic development literatures, as well as in the health inequalities literature. Analysis of its use in the health inequalities literature suggests that each theoretical tradition has conceptualized social capital differently. Health researchers have employed a wide range of social capital measures, borrowing from several theoretical traditions. Given the wide variation in these measures and an apparent lack of consistent theoretical or empirical justification for their use, conclusions about the likely role of ""social capital"" on population health may be overstated or even misleading. Elements of a research agenda are proposed to further elucidate the potential role of factors currently subsumed under the rubric of ""social capital.""",The Milbank quarterly,2001,United States,2001,00

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on sick leave frequency for 137 cleaning workers in the regions of Utrecht (mean sick leave frequency: 0.89 spells) and South Limburg (mean sick leave frequency: 1.66 spells) were obtained from a Dutch social fund, and the data regarding their job, and health-related and individual characteristics were elicited by an interview. RESULTS: A statistical analysis of the sick leave frequency in the two regions showed little differences, except for the determinant 'perceived physical workload' which was associated with the sick leave frequency in South Limburg but not in Utrecht. CONCLUSION: A regional difference in the sick leave frequency was noted with respect to 'perceived physical workload' as the study parameter. This would indicate that the findings of our earlier studies performed in the nineties of the last century. are still relevant. In further research, the principles of the new certification system on sick leave frequency should also be considered, as the previous uniform statutory compensation system has been terminated.",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,2009,Poland,2009,00
17505578,[Social and familial determinants of anxiety and depressive symptoms in middle to low income women].,"BACKGROUND: Among women, risk factors for mental disorders are violence, economical inequities and disadvantages and discrimination. AIM: To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in women and to determine factors associated with them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross sectional study of a probabilistic sample of 422 women aged 34 years as a mean, living in a medium to low income neighborhood in Temuco, Chile. Mental health was assessed with the self reporting questionnaire (SRQ20), partner violence was evaluated using a 12 item scale and family conflict and violence was evaluated using the Conflicts Tactics scale. A logistic repression analysis was used to identify factors associated with mental health alterations. RESULTS: Forty one percent of women had anxiety or depressive symptoms. The main associated factors with these symptoms were severe physical violence against children (odds ratio (OR)=14.3), sexual violence against women (OR=9.7), self perception of health (OR=4.5), alcohol abuse (OR=4.4), psychological violence during childhood (OR=3.2) and lack of family support network (OR=2.7). Unemployment and lack of a support network of relatives had an OR 3.3 for mental health alterations. The OR for psychological violence plus sexual violence was 18.5. The figure for psychological violence plus sexual violence plus a history of parental violence during childhood was 26.5.

16775603,Lessons in ethnonephrology.,"Only recently has the nephrology community moved beyond a fairly singular focus on terminal kidney failure to embrace population-based studies of earlier stages of disease, its markers and risk factors, and of interventions. Observations in developing countries, and in minority, migrant, and disadvantaged groups in westernized countries, have promoted these developments. We are only beginning to interpret renal disease in the context of public health history, social and health transitions, changing population demography, and competing mortality. Its intimate relationships to other health issues are being progressively exposed. Perspectives on the multideterminant etiology of most disease and the pedestrian nature of most risk factors are maturing. We are challenged to reconcile epidemiologic patterns with morphology in diseased renal tissue, and to consider structural markers, such as nephron number and glomerular size, as determinants of disease susceptibility. New work force models are mandated for population-based studies and intervention programs. Intervention programs need to be integrated with other chronic disease initiatives and nested in a matrix of systematic primary care, and although flexible to changing needs, must be sustained over the long term. Cross-disciplinary collaboration is essential in designing those programs, and in promoting them to health-care funders. Substantial expansion and restructuring of the discipline is needed for the nephrology community to participate effectively in those processes.",Kidney international,2006 Jul,United States,2006,00
19344512,Easier surveillance of climate-related health vulnerabilities through a Web-based spatial OLAP application.,"BACKGROUND: Climate change has a significant impact on population health. Population vulnerabilities depend on several determinants of different types, including biological, psychological, environmental, social and economic ones. Surveillance of climate-related health vulnerabilities must take into account these different factors, their interdependence, as well as their inherent spatial and temporal aspects on several scales, for informed analyses. Currently used technology includes commercial off-the-shelf Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Database Management Systems with spatial extensions. It has been widely recognized that such OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing) systems were not designed to support complex, multi-temporal and multi-scale analysis as required above. On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is central to the field known as BI (Business Intelligence), a key field for such decision-support systems. In the last few years, we have seen a few projects that combine OLAP and GIS to improve spatio-temporal analysis and geographic knowledge discovery. This has given rise to SOLAP (Spatial OLAP) and a new research area. This paper presents how SOLAP and climate-related health vulnerability data were investigated and combined to facilitate surveillance. RESULTS: Based on recent spatial decision-support technologies, this paper presents a spatio-temporal web-based application that goes beyond GIS applications with regard to speed, ease of use, and interactive analysis capabilities. It supports the multi-scale exploration and analysis of integrated socio-economic, health and environmental geospatial data over several periods. This project was meant to validate the potential of recent technologies to contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between public health and climate change, and to facilitate future decision-making by public health agencies and municipalities in Canada and elsewhere. The project also aimed at integrating an initial collection of geo-referenced multi-scale indicators that were identified by Canadian specialists and end-users as relevant for the surveillance of the public health impacts of climate change. This system was developed in a multidisciplinary context involving researchers, policy makers and practitioners, using BI and web-mapping concepts (more particularly SOLAP technologies), while exploring new solutions for frequent automatic updating of data and for providing contextual warnings for users (to minimize the risk of data misinterpretation). According to the project participants, the final system succeeds in facilitating surveillance activities in a way not achievable with today's GIS. Regarding the experiments on frequent automatic updating and contextual user warnings, the results obtained indicate that these are meaningful and achievable goals but they still require research and development for their successful implementation in the context of surveillance and multiple organizations. CONCLUSION: Surveillance of climate-related health vulnerabilities may be more efficiently supported using a combination of BI and GIS concepts, and more specifically, SOLAP technologies (in that it facilitates and accelerates multi-scale spatial and temporal analysis to a point where a user can maintain an uninterrupted train of thought by focussing on ""what"" she/he wants (not on ""how"" to get it) and always obtain instant answers, including to the most complex queries that take minutes or hours with OLTP systems (e.g., aggregated, temporal, comparative)). The developed system respects Newell's cognitive band of 10 seconds when performing knowledge discovery (exploring data, looking for hypotheses, validating models). The developed system provides new operators for easily and rapidly exploring multidimensional data at different levels of granularity, for different regions and epochs, and for visualizing the results in synchronized maps, tables and charts. It is naturally adapted to deal with multiscale indicators such as those used in the surveillance community, as confirmed by this project's end-users.",International journal of health geographics,2009 Apr 3,England,2009,00
11571013,Reducing social vulnerability to HIV/AIDS: models of care and their impact in resource-poor settings.,"There has been an increasing understanding of the social, economic, cultural and political factors that have shaped the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has been widely recognized that in order to have effective prevention programmes for HIV/AIDS, the broader determinants of health must be addressed. Concurrently, a deeper understanding of personal and societal vulnerability to HIV/AIDS has emerged. Some prevention efforts have expanded their focus, addressing not only individual risk factors and behaviour, but also social justice and including community mobilization activities to address the wider context of the disease. However, the transition to an expanded approach to mitigating the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has not been complete. There is little evidence that care and support strategies have systematically tried to address these concepts. While the role care plays in prevention is considered vital, viewing models of care in terms of their impact on the social vulnerability of certain groups to HIV/AIDS has been largely neglected. Yet appropriate care programmes that help reduce vulnerability will arguably also make the greatest contribution for prevention. Drawing on examples of the role social vulnerability has played in prevention efforts, this paper evaluates the impact of HIV/AIDS care models on socially vulnerable groups, such as women and children.",AIDS care,2001 Oct,England,2001,00
11762892,The main determinants of infant mortality in Nepal.,"Infant mortality has reached a low stable rate in developed countries while it is still high and on a slow decline in developing countries. There are many factors that contribute to the incidence of a high or low level of infant mortality. Although credit for contributing to the lowering of infant mortality has been given to health programs by public health personnel and to the improvement in socio-economic status by social scientists, in a traditional and agricultural country such as Nepal, both these factors are found to influence infant mortality. Data on infant mortality obtained by the 1991 Demographic Health Survey of Nepal are analyzed in this study. A logistic regression model is used for analyzing the data. Several hypotheses are tested to explain the incidence of infant mortality in Nepal. The various reasons for the persistence of high infant mortality and the difficulties in lowering it are discussed. The findings suggest that among all the variables analyzed in the study, parity, place of residence, immunization, and ethnicity influence infant mortality the most.",Social science & medicine (1982),2001 Dec,England,2001,00

However, there is still a lack of consensus on this appealing and challenging concept. Therefore, we present an overview of its definition, psychosocial determinants and conceptual models. We report that the meaning of the concept varies according to the cultural context (individualistic/relational societies), to the actors' perspectives (researcher/elderly) and according to the dominant approach (biomedical/holistic). Several models have also been identified: some are specific to a scientific domain and rely on a unique marker of well aging; others are multicriterion and embrace a broader field. Psychosocial factors are the most frequent determinants addressed by models. Among these factors, social and personal resources can be mobilized and learned, contrarily to the less modifiable personality traits. In summary, the << well aging >> framework offers a unique opportunity to identify and to reinforce positive aspects in the aging process. However, the integration of the various models, more complementary than opposite, into only one meta-model remains a task to be done by researchers for a better effectiveness of << well aging >> promotion programs.",Medecine sciences : M/S,2006 Mar,France,2006,00
15639629,Sociomicrobiology: the connections between quorum sensing and biofilms.,"In the past decade, significant debate has surrounded the relative contributions of genetic determinants versus environmental conditions to certain types of human behavior. While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria. Bacteria exhibit many social activities and they represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level. Therefore, we introduce the term 'sociomicrobiology'.",Trends in microbiology,2005 Jan,England,2005,00
17019826,Structural determinants of child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa: A cross-national study of economic and social influences from 1970 to 1997.,"This cross-national study seeks to understand the lagging child mortality declines in sub-Saharan Africa by using World Bank data to investigate social and economic factors at three points in time: 1970, 1985, and 1997. Women's education, foreign debt-to-export ratio, and GNP per capita are among the strongest correlates of under five mortality over time. Cross-sectional and longitudinal results suggest that female education is the best overall predictor of child mortality. Average national income does not emerge as a strong predictor, particularly since 1985. Increasing levels of foreign debt are associated with a substantial excess mortality burden. In 1997, the effect of adult HIV prevalence on child mortality was moderate and statistically significant. The study concludes that, although future gains in social factors such as female education will likely be beneficial, without simultaneously addressing high levels of foreign debt and high HIV prevalence, it may be difficult to improve child mortality rates across sub-Saharan Africa.",Social biology,2004 Fall-Winter,United States,2004,00
12194444,A comparative study of determinants of uxorilocal marriage in two counties of China.,"A strictly maintained patrilineal family system makes virilocal marriage almost universal and uxorilocal marriage rare in the history of rural China. Uxorilocal marriage can be divided into two types that may be termed, respectively, contingent and institutional. The former preserves family lineages in families without a son and occurs when uxorilocal marriage is uncommon. The latter serves practical economic purposes in families with sons and occurs when uxorilocal marriage is relatively prevalent. Using data from a survey in two counties of Shaanxi--Lueyang, where both kinds of uxorilocal marriage are prevalent, and Sanyuan, where uxorilocal marriage is rare and usually contingent--this paper employs logistic regression models in a quantitative comparative study of determinants of uxorilocal marriage in rural China. We show that the purposes and prevalence of the two types of uxorilocal marriage differ and that their determinants are also different in the two counties. In Sanyuan, the determinants are only a couple's sibling composition, membership in a large family clan, and educational level. In Lueyang, in addition to those determinants in Sanyuan, important contributions to the type of uxorilocal marriage include a couple's parental marriage type, age at marriage, adoption status, marriage arrangement, and their attitudes toward uxorilocal marriage. The results indicate the potential importance of encouraging uxorilocal marriage in rural areas as a means of mitigating demographic and social problems related to son preference, such as high sex ratio at birth and lack of old-age security, which are projected for China's future.",Social biology,2001 Spring-Summer,United States,2001,00
18248341,A conceptual framework for Hispanic oral health care.,"The need to study the health and health care determinants of US Hispanics is mandated by their rapid population growth. Nonetheless, it is challenging to study such a diverse population that incorporates many similarities and differences in values and experiences. This paper aims to highlight the factors that should be considered in Hispanic oral health research in the United States, and presents, in a theoretical framework, the relationships between these factors. The proposed ecological framework is supported by an extensive literature review, with an emphasis on the factors that are reported to differ among ethnic groups. It has a foundation in social science and is based on existing models from different fields of knowledge. To be comprehensive, the framework simultaneously addresses individual and environmental constructs. Within these, antecedent factors shape the intention to seek oral health care, while empowerment factors play a mediating role between intention and actual receipt of care. Individual antecedent factors incorporate risk markers, need, and predisposing factors. Environmental antecedent factors are represented by social constructs that allude to the population's health culture. Empowerment factors explain the level of control that a person perceives or the environment provides in receiving care. A thorough consideration of the factors that drive Hispanics' oral health care usage will aid US researchers and practitioners in improving this population's health and access to care.",Journal of public health dentistry,2008 Winter,United States,2008,00
19171669,"Water, ecology and health: ecosystems as settings for promoting health and sustainability.","Despite the proposed ecological and systems-based perspectives of the settings-based approach to health promotion, most initiatives have tended to overlook the fundamental nature of ecosystems. This paper responds to this oversight by proposing an explicit re-integration of ecosystems within the healthy settings approach. We make this case by focusing on water as an integrating unit of analysis. Water, on which all life depends, is not only an integral consideration for the existing healthy settings (schools, hospitals, workplaces) but also highlights the ecosystem context of health and sustainability. A focus on catchments (also know as watersheds and river basins) exemplifies the scaled and upstream/downstream nature of ecosystems and draws into sharp focus the cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary context of the social and environmental determinants of health. We position this work in relation to the converging agendas of health promotion and ecosystem management at the local, regional and global scales--and draw on evidence from international initiatives as diverse as the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Using water as a vehicle for understanding the systemic context for human wellbeing, health promotion and disease prevention draws inevitable attention to key challenges of scale, intersectoral governance and the complementary themes of promoting resilience and preventing vulnerability. We conclude by highlighting the importance of building individual and institutional capacity for this kind of integration--equipping a new generation of researchers, practitioners and decision-makers to be conversant with the language of ecosystems, capable of systemic thought and focused on settings that can promote both health and sustainability.",Health promotion international,2009 Mar,England,2009,00
11514863,[Health services utilization: a systematic review of related factors].,"Health services utilization is determined by various factors. In order to study which factors are most important in different countries, a systematic review was conducted from 1970 to 1999. The mean number of visits, proportion of persons who see a doctor, and proportion that concentrate the most visits were similar. Children, childbearing-age women, and the elderly use health care services the most. Lower-income and less educated groups are also significantly associated with more frequent utilization. Increased health needs mediate more frequent utilization by these groups. However, the poorest groups may not receive adequate care, depending on the respective type of health system. Health need is one of the most important determinants in utilization, and if a health system's equity is to be analyzed, one must consider patterns of utilization among social groups in relation to the level of greatest need. Regularly visiting the same physician, a characteristic of accessibility to health care services, can determine more adequate utilization. This factor can reduce differences in health care among groups. The authors conclude by proposing a hierarchy of related factors.",Cadernos de saude publica,2001 Jul-Aug,Brazil,2001,00
12556605,Patterns of service use among persons with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed 12-month service use patterns among people with psychotic disorders and sought to identify determinants of service use. METHODS: As part of a large two-phase Australian study of psychotic disorders, structured interviews were conducted with a stratified random sample of adults who screened positive for psychosis. Demographic characteristics, social functioning, symptoms, mental health diagnoses, and use of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric services were assessed. Data were analyzed for 858 persons who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder and who had been hospitalized for less than six months during the previous year. RESULTS: People with psychotic disorders had high levels of use of health services, both in absolute terms and relative to people with nonpsychotic disorders. Those with psychotic disorders were estimated to have an average of one contact with health services per week. Use of psychiatric inpatient services was associated with parenthood, higher symptom levels, recent attempts at suicide or self-harm, personal disability, medication status, and frequency of alcohol consumption. Services provided by general practitioners (family physicians) were more likely to be obtained by older people, women, people with greater availability of friends, those with fewer negative symptoms, and those whose service needs were unmet by other sources. People who were high users of health services also reported having more contact with a range of non-health agencies. CONCLUSIONS: The predictors of service use accounted for small proportions of the variance in overall use of health services. The role of general practitioners in providing and monitoring treatment programs and other psychosocial interventions needs to be acknowledged and enhanced.","Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",2003 Feb,United States,2003,00

12489838,Early childhood caries and infant feeding practice.,"OBJECTIVES: Early childhood caries (ECC) has been suggested as a new term to describe the presence of caries on at least one primary tooth in children under six years of age. The prevalence and severity of ECC in low socio-economic, immigrant and indigenous communities is high. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between selected social and behavioural variables, including previous infant feeding practice, and the presence of ECC in an Australian child population. METHOD: A cross sectional sample of 3,375 four to six-year-old children from the north Brisbane region were examined in a school based setting using dmft/s indices and a self-administered questionnaire obtained information regarding social background and past infant feeding practice. The data were modelled using a forward stepwise logistic regression procedure to explore a statistical model for ECC presence. RESULTS: Significant determinants for ECC presence were ethnicity other than Caucasian (OR=1.99, CI=1.37, 2.88), language other than English (OR=1.97, CI=1.35, 2.86), single parent status (OR=1.93, CI=1.47, 2.52), sweetened bottle contents (OR=4.29, CI=2.90, 6.38), going to sleep with the bottle (OR=1.73, CI=1.49, 2.00) and sipping from the bottle during the day (OR=1.58, CI=1.35, 1.84).

18043298,"Prevalence and determinants of prehypertension among African Surinamese, Hindustani Surinamese, and White Dutch in Amsterdam, the Netherlands: the SUNSET study.","BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that prehypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Little is known about ethnic differences in prehypertension in Europe. We aimed to assess these ethnic differences and to determine the factors associated with prehypertension in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Prehypertension was defined as having a blood pressure 120-139/80-89 mmHg. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of prehypertension was 32.8% (men 37.9% and women 29.9%). The prevalence of prehypertension did not differ between the ethnic groups in men. African Surinamese and Hindustani Surinamese women, however, had a higher prevalence of prehypertension than White Dutch women. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratios [95% confidence interval] for being prehypertensive were 2.25 (1.38-3.67; P<0.001) for African Surinamese and 2.06 (1.18-3.60; P<0.01) for Hindustani Surinamese women, compared with White Dutch women. BMI was strongly associated with prehypertension in both men and women. Total cholesterol was positively associated with prehypertension in women, whereas increased physical activity was negatively associated. The independent factors associated with prehypertension vary by ethnic group. In men, BMI was associated with prehypertension in the White Dutch, total cholesterol and low education in the African Surinamese, and fasting glucose in the Hindustani Surinamese. In women, total cholesterol was associated with prehypertension in the African Surinamese; the corresponding factor was the BMI in the Hindustani Surinamese. CONCLUSION: Prehypertension is common in minority women. As a large proportion of people with prehypertension progress to clinical hypertension, targeting these people early with lifestyle-modification interventions aimed at weight loss, increased physical activity, and healthy dietary habits can provide important long-term benefits. The results indicate that the primary foci of such lifestyle interventions should vary between ethnic groups.","European journal of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation : official journal of the European Society of Cardiology, Working Groups on Epidemiology & Prevention and Cardiac Rehabilitation and Exercise Physiology",2007 Dec,England,2007,00

The last step is to determine the scoring method, including whether to address issues of depth of inequality.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2006 Sep-Oct,Switzerland,2006,00
18982816,Determinants of quality of life of elderly Nigerians: results from the Ibadan study of ageing.,"Little is known about factors that determine the QoL of elderly persons living in developing societies undergoing rapid social changes. A representative sample of elderly Nigerians, aged 65 years and over (n = 2152), was assessed for QoL using the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument (WHOQoL-Bref). Other than sociodemographic factors, respondents were also evaluated for major depressive disorder, physical conditions as well as for social network, support and engagement. Using linear regression modeling, these factors were explored for their ability to predict the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of QoL. Economic status was the most consistent predictor of the four domains of QoL, with the coefficients ranging between 1.0 and 1.68 (p < 0.001 in every instance). Among health variables, functional disability (range: 7.07-19.86) and self-rated overall health (range: 7.89-18. 42) were the most salient. Participation in community activities (range 7.74-17.48) was the most consistent social predictor. Even though health factors are important, social factors, in particular those relating to the quality of social support and participation, are the most important predictors of QoL.",African journal of medicine and medical sciences,2008 Sep,Nigeria,2008,00
19454147,[Determinants in an occupational health and safety program implementation].,"OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors for the degree to which a program that integrates occupational health surveillance with labor safety, and involves occupational health/safety specialists, company management, and employees, is implemented. METHOD: This ecological study evaluated companies implementing the occupational health and safety program (OHSP) proposed by the state of Bahia's regional department of Servico Social da Industria (Social Services for Industry, SESI) during the 2005-2006 cycle. The companies that participated were randomly selected. Data were collected through interviews with key contacts within the companies and from technical reports issued by SESI. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors related to the company, employee, occupational/safety specialist, and any subdimensions that might promote OHSP implementation. RESULTS: Of the 78 companies selected (3 384 employees), the degree to which OHSP was implemented was ""advanced"" in 24.4%, ""intermediate"" in 53.8%, and ""initial"" in 19.3%. Company-related, employee-related and specialist-related factors were positively associated with OHSP implementation (P < 0.001). The most important factor overall was the program's financial autonomy (beta = 4.40; P < 0.001). Bivariate analysis revealed that the degree of implementation was associated with the employees' level of health/safety knowledge (beta = 1.58; P < 0.05) and training (beta = 0.40; P < 0.001) and with communication between the occupational safety team (beta = 1.89; P < 0.01) and the health team (beta = 0.58; P < 0.05). These findings remained unchanged after adjustment for levels of education among managers and employees, salary/wages, company size, and risk. CONCLUSIONS: The time and resources available for employees to dedicate to occupational health and safety, the integration and reinforcement of employee and manager training programs, and improved relationship between occupational health and safety teams may contribute to the success of health and safety promotion efforts among employees.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2009 Mar,United States,2009,00
17602257,Predicting opportunities for greening and patterns of vegetation on private urban lands.,"This paper examines predictors of vegetative cover on private lands in Baltimore, Maryland. Using high-resolution spatial data, we generated two measures: ""possible stewardship,"" which is the proportion of private land that does not have built structures on it and hence has the possibility of supporting vegetation, and ""realized stewardship,"" which is the proportion of possible stewardship land upon which vegetation is growing. These measures were calculated at the parcel level and averaged by US Census block group. Realized stewardship was further defined by proportion of tree canopy and grass. Expenditures on yard supplies and services, available by block group, were used to help understand where vegetation condition appears to be the result of current activity, past legacies, or abandonment. PRIZM market segmentation data were tested as categorical predictors of possible and realized stewardship and yard expenditures. PRIZM segmentations are hierarchically clustered into 5, 15, and 62 categories, which correspond to population density, social stratification (income and education), and lifestyle clusters, respectively. We found that PRIZM 15 best predicted variation in possible stewardship and PRIZM 62 best predicted variation in realized stewardship. These results were further analyzed by regressing each dependent variable against a set of continuous variables reflective of each of the three PRIZM groupings. Housing age, vacancy, and population density were found to be critical determinants of both stewardship metrics. A number of lifestyle factors, such as average family size, marriage rates, and percentage of single-family detached homes, were strongly related to realized stewardship. The percentage of African Americans by block group was positively related to realized stewardship but negatively related to yard expenditures.",Environmental management,2007 Sep,United States,2007,00
18848620,Determinants of the NF-kappaB response to acute psychosocial stress in humans.,"Previous research has shown that psychosocial stress is associated with an increased activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a major inducer of inflammatory genes. While considerable individual variation has been noted, factors contributing to this variation have not been described so far. Therefore, 29 healthy participants (35.8+/-12 yrs) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test. Blood was collected before and repeatedly afterward for determination of NF-kappaB activity, leukocyte subset numbers, cortisol, norepinephrine, and in vitro-stimulated IL-6 production. Additionally, age, sex, and ratings of perceived chronic and acute stress were assessed. Regression analyses revealed that older participants showed a lower NF-kappaB stress response compared to younger adults (beta= -.42, p=.026). Higher NF-kappaB stress responses were associated with lower cortisol stress responses (beta= -.37, p=.05), higher pre-stress IL-6 production (beta=.38, p=.043), and high chronic in combination with low acute stress, or vice versa (beta= -.61, p=.06). Norepinephrine and sex were not associated with NF-kappaB stress responses (all p.13). In summary, the present study shows for the first time in human psychosocial stress the negative association of cortisol and NF-kappaB. This parallels results from in vitro studies. Our finding of lower NF-kappaB stress responses in older age and in people with high chronic and acute stress might be interpreted as an adaptive dampening of NF-kappaB activity. In the absence of longitudinal data, however, this interpretation remains speculative.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2009 Aug,Netherlands,2009,00
18519873,Determinants of disability and quality of life in mild to moderate Parkinson disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that independently contribute to disability and quality of life (QoL) in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: A group of 190 patients with PD recruited from outpatient clinics and the Dutch Parkinson's Disease Association participated in this cross-sectional study. Data on demographic and clinical factors, motor symptoms, cognitive functions, affective symptoms, comorbidity, and social support were collected during neurologic and neuropsychological examinations. Disability was rated using the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (SE-ADL), the AMC Linear Disability Score (ALDS), and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). QoL was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire (PDQL) and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to identify determinants of disability and poor QoL. RESULTS: Axial impairment (postural instability and gait difficulty) explained the largest proportion of variance in disability. Bradykinesia and comorbidity contributed to disability, but to a lesser extent. Self-reported mood symptoms and axial impairment were the two factors most closely associated with poorer QoL, but comorbidity and bradykinesia additionally contributed to the explanatory power. Semantic fluency and psychomotor skills were the only cognitive variables related to some aspects of functional outcome. CONCLUSION: Axial impairment is strongly associated with disability in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease (PD). Self-report indices of mood status and axial impairment are identified as the main determinants of poor quality of life (QoL). The results of this study may help to identify patients with PD at risk for functional dependence and reduced QoL.",Neurology,2008 Jun 3,United States,2008,00

Analysis of 711 naturalistic goal-directed classroom behaviors of four school-age children with autism and four comparable children with Down syndrome (DS) was conducted. The definition of engagement was expanded to include child compliance and congruence. A main finding was both child and environmental factors influenced type of engagement. Children with DS produced 20% more goal-directed behaviors that were both congruent and compliant compared to children with autism. Large group instruction was associated with less congruent engagement but more compliant engagement for children with autism. These findings suggest specific types of engagement which may lead to advances in developing evidence-based practices for specific developmental disorders.,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2007 Sep,United States,2007,00
11851959,"Female genital cutting in southern urban and peri-urban Nigeria: self-reported validity, social determinants and secular decline.","Despite growing public resistance to the practice of female genital cutting (FGC), documentation of its prevalence, social correlates or trends in practice are extremely limited, and most available data are based on self-reporting. In three antenatal and three family planning clinics in South-west Nigeria we studied the prevalence, social determinants, and validity of self-reporting for FGC among 1709 women. Women were interviewed on social and demographic history, and whether or not they had undergone FGC. Interviews were followed by clinical examination to affirm the occurrence and extent of circumcision. In total, 45.9% had undergone some form of cutting. Based on WHO classifications by type, 32.6% had Type I cuts, 11.5% Type II, and 1.9% Type III or IV. Self-reported FGC status was valid in 79% of women; 14% were unsure of their status, and 7% reported their status incorrectly. Women are more likely to be unsure of their status if they were not cut, or come from social groups with a lower prevalence of cutting. Ethnicity was the most significant social predictor of FGC, followed by age, religious affiliation and education. Prevalence of FGC was highest among the Bini and Urhobo, among those with the least education, and particularly high among adherents to Pentecostal churches; this was independent of related social factors. There is evidence of a steady and steep secular decline in the prevalence of FGC in this region over the past 25 years, with age-specific prevalence rates of 75.4% among women aged 45-49 years, 48.6% among 30-34-year olds, and 14.5% among girls aged 15-19. Despite wide disparities in FGC prevalence across ethnic, religious and educational groups, the secular decline is evident among all social subgroups.",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,2002 Jan,England,2002,00
12231015,"Social capital and violence in the United States, 1974-1993.","Social capital is a characteristic of communities. Cross-sectional studies have shown that social capital is inversely associated with homicide and violent crime. We hypothesized that variations in social capital in US states over time can predict variations in regional homicide mortality both across and within time periods. We analyzed serial cross-sectional data for measures of social capital and age-adjusted homicide rates between 1974 and 1993. We used perception of social trust and per capita membership in voluntary associations, obtained from responses to the General Social Surveys, as the principal measures of social capital. We controlled for potential confounding by mean levels of income, urbanization, and region. Measures of perceived trust were strongly inversely correlated with homicide rates in an aggregate cross-sectional analysis (r=-0.51, p<0.001) and also within each time period. Social capital was an independent predictor of rates of violence when controlling for income, region, and urbanization (p<0.001). Homicide rates also predicted levels of social capital in adjusted models (p<0.001). To investigate directionality of this relationship we developed Markov transition matrices that described the change in the states' levels of social capital and homicide across time intervals. Analysis of the transitional probabilities confirmed that a simple unidirectional association between social capital and violence was not sufficient to describe this association. There is likely an impact of violence on levels of perceived trust in communities that complements the hypothesized effect of social capital on homicide. We conclude that the relationship between social capital and violence over time is non-linear and dynamic. More complex analytic models describing the relationship between violence and ecological social determinants need to be considered.",Social science & medicine (1982),2002 Oct,England,2002,00
17265660,Determinants of Oregon hospice chaplains' views on physician-assisted suicide.,"BACKGROUND: Although religiousness is a strong predictor of attitudes towards physician-assisted suicide (PAS), Oregon hospice chaplains express wide variation in their opposition to or support for legalized PAS. We explored factors associated with chaplains' views on PAS. METHODS: A mailed survey to chaplains from 51 Oregon hospices. RESULTS: Fifty of 77 eligible hospice chaplains (65%) returned surveys. Views on PAS were associated with views on suicide in general. Moral and theological beliefs were the most important influences on views on PAS. Chaplains who were opposed to PAS believed that God alone may take life, that life is an absolute good, and that suffering has a divine purpose. Those who supported PAS placed emphasis on the importance of self-determination and sanctity of life as defined by quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Oregon hospice chaplains' diverse views towards PAS are closely related to their views on suicide in general, and their personal and theological beliefs.",Journal of palliative care,2006 Summer,United States,2006,00
17934965,Toward a theory of patient satisfaction with physiotherapy: exploring the concept of satisfaction.,"Patient satisfaction is increasingly seen as an important area of research because it has been found that satisfied patients are more likely to benefit from their health care. However, there has been comparatively little work in this field within physiotherapy. Eliciting patients' expectations and needs of their care and addressing these during treatment could not only influence their subsequent health-related behaviour but could also contribute to a more favourable evaluation of the whole therapeutic experience. While various determinants of satisfaction have been identified and examined in the literature, there has been little work to develop a theory to underpin the concept of satisfaction. Such a theory is important in physiotherapy because it can inform current practice and its evaluation and have implications for future patient care. In this article satisfaction with physiotherapy is defined on the basis of a review of the satisfaction literature in health care. A theory of patient satisfaction with physiotherapy is then developed by exploring the concepts of need and expectations that are proposed as being important determinants of the construct in relation to the physiotherapeutic approach to care, drawing on need theory and relevant social science and marketing theories.",Physiotherapy theory and practice,2007 Sep-Oct,England,2007,00
17387617,The design of housing and shelter programs: the social and environmental determinants of inequalities.,"Both developed and less developed countries are becoming increasingly urbanized. The earlier industrialized countries have developed more infrastructure to support the building of healthy housing, in neighborhoods that are strongly linked to municipal and global health initiatives, but to some degree housing and neighborhood issues vary only in degree between the developing and developed worlds. Overall, a billion people, a third of people living in urban areas, live in slums, where environmental determinants lead to disease. Although communicable diseases predominate in the developing world and have reemerged in the developed world, noncommunicable diseases are also growing disproportionately in the developing world. At a global level, the Millennium Development Goals explicitly focus on an integrated approach to slum upgrading. The per capita cost of slum upgrading is almost twice the cost of providing new affordable housing at the outset. It is argued that to improve health and well-being in the slums we need to have interventions that reduce urban poverty in the broadest sense and improve the deficiencies associated with slums. There is an urgent need to scale up the best-practice interventions. Examples are given of successful local community initiatives that have been set up under national strategies in Tanzania and by Indian women's collectives that are globally linked and have helped develop housing and sanitation improvements. The unit costs for such interventions are within the reach of all the key stakeholders. Global commitment is the only missing link.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2007 May,United States,2007,00
19477907,What causes racial disparities in very preterm birth? A biosocial perspective.,"Very preterm birth (<32 weeks' gestation) occurs in approximately 2% of livebirths but is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the United States. African-American women have a 2-fold to 3-fold elevated risk compared with non-Hispanic white women for reasons that are incompletely understood. This paper reviews the evidence for the biologic and social patterning of very preterm birth, with attention to leading hypotheses regarding the etiology of the racial disparity. A systematic review of the literature in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and EMBASE indices was conducted. The literature to date suggests a complex, multifactorial causal framework for understanding racial disparities in very preterm birth, with maternal inflammatory, vascular, or neuroendocrine dysfunction as proximal pathways and maternal exposure to stress, racial differences in preconceptional health, and genetic, epigenetic, and gene-environment interactions as more distal mediators. Interpersonal and institutionalized racism are mechanisms that may drive racially patterned differences. Current literature is limited in that research on social determinants and biologic processes of prematurity has been generally disconnected. Improved etiologic understanding and the potential for effective intervention may come with better integration of these research approaches.",Epidemiologic reviews,2009,United States,2009,00
17446793,Gender-specific issues in cardiac rehabilitation: do women with ischaemic heart disease need specially tailored programmes?,"Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) has changed from a disease of middle-aged men in the late 1970s to a disease of elderly women in the 2000s. Most clinical studies during the past three decades have been conducted with men. Cardiac rehabilitation programmes were also developed with special regard to improving the rate of return to work in middle-aged men. The rehabilitation needs of older patients and women in particular have been largely neglected. The aim of this review is briefly to outline our present knowledge on gender issues in cardiac rehabilitation, and to specify barriers with regard to physical activities especially in (older) women. Coping with a cardiac event, women tend to minimize or play down the impact of their health situation and avoid burdening their social contacts. After a first cardiac event, women report greater psychological distress and lower self-efficacy and self-esteem. In addition, older age, lower exercise levels and reduced functional capacity or co-morbid conditions such as osteoporosis and urinary incontinence are barriers to physical activities in women with IHD. Recent studies on psychosocial intervention revealed less favourable results in women compared with men. These findings have not yet been well explained. This emphasizes our current lack of knowledge about the processes and determinants of successful psychosocial interventions in men and women with IHD. A large (European) trial on gender-specific coping styles, needs, and preferences of older women, and the effects of psychosocial intervention is proposed.","European journal of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation : official journal of the European Society of Cardiology, Working Groups on Epidemiology & Prevention and Cardiac Rehabilitation and Exercise Physiology",2007 Apr,England,2007,00
11703553,A relational approach to providing care for a person suffering from dementia.,"AIMS OF THE PAPER: This paper examines the care provision for people suffering from dementia and explores the potential benefits associated with an approach to care that emphasizes the importance of relationships. BACKGROUND: Recent research findings have provided an incentive to re-evaluate the established approaches to care for this client group. Two separate studies identified education and intellectual stimulation as important determinants of the onset of Alzheimer's disease (Ott et al. 1995, Snowdon et al. 1996). These findings have encouraged the hypothesis that potential symptomatic benefits may be achieved by providing a more stimulating environment for people with dementia. METHODS: A case study is outlined which illustrates an approach to caring influenced by the Continental philosopher, Emmanuel Levinas. Primacy is given to the relationships that make up caring, and not to a method that sets out to achieve an identified objective. The issue of mutual responsibility within the provision of care is highlighted in the case study. FINDINGS: The hypothesis presented in this paper is that a person has more of an opportunity to develop to the limits of their potential by establishing the importance of relationships in providing care by means of education and training of the people involved. The beneficiaries might be the caregiver or the person in receipt of care. CONCLUSIONS: An environment that attempts to educate people to recognize the importance of relationships will be more effective in achieving the potential benefits of symptom alleviation identified by the research into Alzheimer's disease outlined in this paper.",Journal of advanced nursing,2001 Nov,England,2001,00
19023730,Discriminatory behavior towards a person with Alzheimer's disease: examining the effects of being in a nursing home.,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined determinants of discriminatory behavior towards a person with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using an attribution model. More specifically, the effects of residing in a nursing home compared with the community were examined. METHOD: A phone survey was conducted during the summer of 2007 with a representative sample of 501 lay persons (mean age = 49) in Israel. Information regarding participants' discriminatory behavior towards a male person with AD was elicited using a vignette methodology. The effects of emotional reactions, perceptions of dangerousness and responsibility of the person depicted in the vignette as well as perceptions about the susceptibility of developing Alzheimer's disease were examined together with the effects of place of residence. RESULTS: Four forms of discriminatory behavior were found: coercion to restraint physically, coercion to restraint medically, segregation and avoidance. Results of the study provided partial support for an extended version of the attribution model, in that negative emotions were found to increase discrimination, whereas pity decreased avoidance. Perceptions of dangerousness were one of the main variables predicting discrimination. Contrary to the hypothesized relationships, being in a nursing home did not increase discrimination. CONCLUSION: The present study adds new information about factors associated to the stigma of AD.",Aging & mental health,2008 Nov,England,2008,00

16682869,Socio-cultural and cognitive predictors of eating disorder symptoms in young girls.,"There is some evidence for a relationship between socio-cultural variables and the development of disordered eating or concerns. However, the role of individual cognition in adding to this relationship has not yet been investigated. The current study therefore had two main questions. Firstly, which of the socio-cultural factors investigated (parental, peers and the media) predict girls' eating disorder related symptoms? Secondly, do individuals' cognitions add to this prediction? Thirty-eight girls participated in the study. They completed the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), Eating Disorder Belief Questionnaire (EDBQ), measures of parental, peer and media influence, and a measure of their awareness and internalisation of societal standards of attractiveness. The results indicated that several of the socio-cultural factors were related to girls' EAT score. The belief that being thinner would make boys like them more was the most significant predictor in the whole sample (and in younger girls). Individual cognitions added significantly to this prediction in the whole sample but not in the younger girls. For older girls, the importance of magazines as a source of information about beauty and ideals was the strongest predictor of EAT score, and their cognitions added significantly to this prediction. It is concluded that peer and media influences are important determinants of girls' eating disorder related symptoms. However, individual cognitions add to this relationship, particularly in older girls. The implications and limitations of the study are discussed.",Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2005 Dec,Germany,2005,00
14592213,Determinants of nasal CPAP compliance.,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is a prevalent condition with potentially serious medical and psychosocial consequences. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment-of-choice and has been shown to reduce the frequency of nocturnal respiratory events, improve sleep architecture and decrease daytime sleepiness. Patient compliance with CPAP is disappointingly low. Previous studies examining determinants of CPAP compliance have limited the variables studied to patient (sociodemographic), disease status, and treatment variables, with few reliable determinants found. METHODS: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship between objectively measured CPAP compliance and variables from social cognitive theory (SCT) and the transtheoretical model (TM). Scales that measure variables from each model were developed and reliability evaluated. The relationship between the SCT and TM variables and compliance at 1-month post-CPAP-fitting was prospectively evaluated on 51 first-time CPAP users. SCT and TM variables were measured on the day of CPAP-fitting, at 1-week post-CPAP-fitting, and at 1-month post-CPAP-fitting. RESULTS: SCT variables measured 1-week post-CPAP-fitting (R(2)=0.261, P=0.001) and TM variables measured 1-week post-CPAP-fitting (R(2)=0.17, P=0.002) accounted for a statistically significant amount of variance in objective CPAP compliance measured at 1 month. The decisional balance index (from TM) individually accounted for a significant amount of variance in objective CPAP compliance in the above analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of these new behavior change scales to predict CPAP compliance provides us with a new direction of research to better understand factors associated with compliance. The principal advantage of these theory-driven and empirically validated scales are that they measure modifiable factors that can provide the basis for sound interventions to improve CPAP compliance.",Sleep medicine,2002 May,Netherlands,2002,00

In interviewing a group of vulnerable young women, ranging in age from 15 to 22, we discovered how they experience the link between health and justice in their lives. Participants were living on the street, in extreme poverty, or both. Traumatic early childhood events continued to affect their ability to function healthy.

15639629,Sociomicrobiology: the connections between quorum sensing and biofilms.,"In the past decade, significant debate has surrounded the relative contributions of genetic determinants versus environmental conditions to certain types of human behavior. While this debate goes on, it is with a certain degree of irony that microbiologists studying aspects of bacterial community behavior face the same questions. Information regarding two social phenomena exhibited by bacteria, quorum sensing and biofilm development, is reviewed here. These two topics have been inextricably linked, possibly because biofilms and quorum sensing represent two areas in which microbiologists focus on social aspects of bacteria. We will examine what is known about this linkage and discuss areas that might be developed. In addition, we believe that these two aspects of bacterial behavior represent a small part of the social repertoire of bacteria. Bacteria exhibit many social activities and they represent a model for dissecting social behavior at the genetic level. Therefore, we introduce the term 'sociomicrobiology'.",Trends in microbiology,2005 Jan,England,2005,00
10982070,The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus and its determinants in The Netherlands: a population-based survey.,"The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus was assessed in a Dutch nationwide sample (n = 7367). A questionnaire was used to study the association with various sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, 33.8% (95% CI 31.6-36%) of the population had hepatitis A antibodies. The seroprevalence was less than 10% in people under 35; it increased from 25% at 35 years to 85% at 79 years. For those 15-49 years of age, Turks (90.9%) and Moroccans (95.8%) had greater seroprevalence than autochthonous Dutch (20.2%) and other Western people (25%). Low or middle socio-economic status, as indicated by the highest educational level achieved, was associated with greater seroprevalence, independently of age and reported immunization (OR 2.11 and 1.45; 95% CI 1.67-2.67 and 1.11-1.89, respectively). These data suggest autochthonous Dutch and other Westerners born after World War II were exposed to hepatitis A during childhood less frequently than older birth cohorts. Thus, more susceptibility is likely in the coming decades. Since this means a greater risk of outbreaks in future years, and since morbidity and mortality are more frequent in older persons, studying the cost effectiveness of selective and general vaccination might be worthwhile.",Epidemiology and infection,2000 Jun,England,2000,00
17214418,[Social participation of the 55-64 year olds: is the new generation more socially active than its predecessor?].,"Nowadays people speak of the 'new' generation of young old who would be healthier and more socially active compared to the earlier generation. Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam it was examined to what degree this is a realistic image. The study compared the social participation level of 55-64 year olds in 1992 and the same age group in 2002, and aimed to explain the differences from cohort differences in four determinants of participation: level of education, labour participation, health and partner status. Descriptive analyses showed that the younger cohort was more actively involved in voluntary organisations and participated more often in cultural and leisure activities compared to the older cohort. In addition, the younger cohort was more highly educated, yet reported more functional disabilities, and more often hold paid jobs compared to the older cohort. No cohort differences were found with respect to the proportion of married persons. Logistic regression analyses showed that the higher level of social participation of the younger cohort was mainly due to the higher level of education, but that this effect was reduced by the larger disability of the younger cohort. Job and partner status did not explain the cohort differences in social participation. It is concluded that the current young old are more socially active and higher educated than their predecessors. Their (somewhat) worse health status, however, asks for a more nuanced image of the 'new' young old.",Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie,2006 Dec,Netherlands,2006,00
11434324,"[Secular trends in respiratory diseases of childhood in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil (1984-1996)].","OBJECTIVE: Data from two consecutive household surveys undertaken in mid-80s and mid-90s allow to characterize and analyse secular trends in infant and child respiratory diseases in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The two surveys included random population samples aged from zero to 59 months (1,016 in the period of 1984-85 and 1,280 in 1995-96). In both surveys the instant prevalence of high respiratory diseases (above the epiglottis) and low respiratory diseases with or without wheezing were calculated. All sampled children were examined in their household at a random day by trained pediatricians using standardized procedures. The examinations included medical history, past respiratory diseases and a complete physical examination. In both surveys the examinations were distributed throughout a period of almost 12 months to assure a uniform coverage of the various areas of the city along the four seasons of the year. For each survey, the study of the social distribution of the diseases took into account tertiles of the per capita family income. For the study of the determinants of secular trends, hierarchical causal models, multivariate regression analyses and calculations analogous to the ones used to assess population attributable risks were applied. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In the time span from the first to the second survey, there was a substantial increase in the prevalence of both low (from 22.2% to 38.8%) and high respiratory diseases (from 6.0% to 10.0% and from 0.8% to 2.8%, without and with wheezing, respectively). In the case of high respiratory disease and low respiratory disease without wheezing, an increase in prevalence was observed among all social strata, which did not interfere with the slightly less favourable situation of the lower income groups. In the case of low respiratory disease with wheezing, the increase was only observed among middle and low-income groups, being particularly high among the lower income group, yielding a significant inverse gradient between income and respiratory disease. Positive changes in distal (family income and maternal schooling) and in intermediate determinants related to housing characteristics would have resulted in a decline, not an increase, in the prevalence of respiratory diseases in the city. The duplication in the attendance rate to day care nurseries seen in the period could have counterbalanced the positive effect due to socioeconomic and housing variables but would not be enough to explain an increase in the disease.",Revista de saude publica,2000 Dec,Brazil,2000,00
16446301,"Relation between the socioeconomic status of the family and primary allergy prevention in infant feeding in Hajdu-Bihar County, Hungary.","BACKGROUND: The relationship between socioeconomic status and preventive care is an important issue in public health practice in Hungary. Our aim was to investigate the association between the socioeconomic status and the present practice of primary allergy prevention in infant feeding in Hajdu-Bihar County, Hungary. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was performed among 3076 infants aged 0-6 months. We studied how socioeconomic status, type of settlement, allergic background of the family and skin symptoms indicative for allergy were related to primary allergy prevention in infant feeding. Prevalence odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Independent determinants of breast feeding were age [OR corresponding to one month change 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.77], the female gender (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06-1.46), the socioeconomic status of the family (OR comparing the worst with the best category 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.93), and birth weight (OR comparing <1500 g to >2500 g category 0.17; 95% CI 0.07-0.41). Among supplementary nutrient users independent determinants of the use of hydrolysed infant formulae were the socioeconomic status (OR comparing the worst with the best category 0.06; 95% CI 0.01-0.27), the type of settlement (OR comparing village with town 0.48; 95% CI 0.28-0.80), history of allergy in the family (OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.28-4.11), and skin symptoms indicative of allergy (OR 3.46; 95% CI 1.96-6.14).

15212778,Understanding environmental influences on walking; Review and research agenda.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding how environmental attributes can influence particular physical activity behaviors is a public health research priority. Walking is the most common physical activity behavior of adults; environmental innovations may be able to influence rates of participation. METHOD: Review of studies on relationships of objectively assessed and perceived environmental attributes with walking. Associations with environmental attributes were examined separately for exercise and recreational walking, walking to get to and from places, and total walking. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were identified. Aesthetic attributes, convenience of facilities for walking (sidewalks, trails); accessibility of destinations (stores, park, beach); and perceptions about traffic and busy roads were found to be associated with walking for particular purposes. Attributes associated with walking for exercise were different from those associated with walking to get to and from places. CONCLUSIONS: While few studies have examined specific environment-walking relationships, early evidence is promising. Key elements of the research agenda are developing reliable and valid measures of environmental attributes and walking behaviors, determining whether environment-behavior relationships are causal, and developing theoretical models that account for environmental influences and their interactions with other determinants.",American journal of preventive medicine,2004 Jul,Netherlands,2004,00
19187875,Can successful aging and chronic illness coexist in the same individual? A multidimensional concept of successful aging.,"For the past 4 decades, many studies seeking to develop a definition and identify critical determinants of successful aging have been published. To date, there is still no consensus on a standard definition or measure of ""successful aging."" Most constructs have been one dimensional; although a few have been multidimensional, none has emerged as standard. The most serious limitation of contemporary successful aging constructs is the undue focus on physiologic aspects of aging. To move beyond this limited perspective that stresses disease and impairment, we postulate that successful aging may coexist with diseases and functional limitations if compensatory psychological and/or social mechanisms are used. With this premise, this article presents a new definition and conceptual framework of successful aging, together with an operational definition (measurement) that delineates our successful aging concept. We discuss how the proposed multidimensional measurement may be used as a screening tool, and address its relevance for health services research and health care delivery.",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2009 Feb,United States,2009,00
19330564,Socioeconomic and maternal determinants of small-for-gestational age births: patterns of increasing disparity.,"OBJECTIVE: To better characterize the relation between socioeconomic disadvantage and small-for-gestational age births (SGA). DESIGN: Analysis of data from a mandatory population-based surveillance system. SETTING: Public or private hospitals and at home. POPULATION: All 877,951 singleton births occurring in New South Wales, Australia, between 1994 and 2004. METHODS: Multilevel models were developed to determine the factors associated with babies weighing less than the 3rd percentile for gestation and gender. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds of SGA. RESULTS: The risk of SGA increased with increasing socioeconomic disadvantage. Smoking accounted for approximately 40% of the increased risk associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, and delayed antenatal care approximately 5%. While the absolute rate of SGA remained stable over the study period, the odds of SGA in mothers living in the most disadvantaged areas compared to those in the least disadvantaged areas increased from approximately 1.7 to 2.2. This trend persisted after accounting for maternal smoking. The risk of SGA over this period also increased in mothers commencing antenatal care after the first trimester. After accounting for smoking, socioeconomic disadvantage and clinical conditions, mothers under 21 years of age were at reduced risk of SGA, but mothers over 35 were at increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic disadvantage remains one of the dominant determinants of SGA, even in a developed country with universal insurance. This relation appears to be strengthening. Smoking patterns, inadequate antenatal care and clinical conditions partially account for this association and trend, however, most is mediated by other factors.",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,2009,United States,2009,00
12799782,Psycho-social determinants for psychiatric hospitalisation for neurotic disorders in women--a case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: Much has been written about the determinants of psychiatric hospitalisation, chiefly for psychotic patients in an emergency. This paper reports the results of a comparative study between in-patients and pathological subjects from the general population. The aim of this work is to evidence the psycho-social determinants of hospitalisation in a psychiatric department for neurotic disorders. METHODS: This study was conducted on a socially fairly privileged population which was, therefore, also fairly homogeneous. The subjects from the two groups were assessed clinically using standardised instruments both for diagnosis (SCAN) and for psycho-social variables (Stressful Life Events: LEDS; Social Support and Self-esteem: Pearlin checklist; care itinerary). RESULTS: Following the analysis of frequency and a multivariate logistic regression analysis, four risk factors for hospitalisation for neurotic disorders were evidenced, including: severity of neurotic disorders, taking a long time to consult a specialist after first onset of anxiety disorders, poor social support, and having experienced one or more provoking agents (Brown and Harris methodology) in the year previous to hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: The severity of the mental pathology is largely responsible for hospitalisation in neurotic patients as it is in psychotic patients, but it is not the only determinant for hospitalisation.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2003 Jun,Germany,2003,00
25871710,Embodied history. Uniqueness and exemplarity of South African AIDS.,"The exceptionality of AIDS in South Africa, both for its epidemiological features and public controversies, seems to have its correspondence in the exceptionalism of South African history, with its unprecedented regime of apartheid and its unexpected turn to democracy. The article shows that AIDS in this country can simultaneously be seen as unique (because of the historical context in which it is inscribed) and exemplar (of social determinants observed in other countries characterised by similar past or present of domination). As an alternative to cultural and behavioural models of the epidemic which have been widely spread on the African continent, the concept of embodiment of history is proposed in order to account for both the structural facts underlying the epidemic (inequality, violence, migration) and the construction of collective as well as individual narratives of the disease (including victimisation and accusation).",African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2002,South Africa,2002,00
18806192,MOBILE and the provision of total joint replacement.,"Modern joint replacements have been available for 45 years, but we still do not have clear indications for these interventions, and we do not know how to optimize the outcome for patients who agree to have them done. The MOBILE programme has been investigating these issues in relation to primary total hip and knee joint replacements, using mixed methods research. There have been five main strands: (1) Epidemiological investigations to find out who is receiving total hip and knee replacements in the National Health Service (NHS). This has shown that there are extensive variations in different regions of the UK, with inequalities and probable inequities in the provision of these operations; (2) Epidemiological work to ascertain the population-based needs for the operations, showing under-provision of knee joint replacements, and a relative reluctance of both patients and GPs to consider knee surgery; (3) Quantitative and qualitative research into the views of patients, health care professionals and the public on the indications for, and prioritization of, total hip and knee joint replacements. This has shown lack of agreement within or between professional groups, as well as a mismatch between the views of patients and the public, and those of professionals; (4) Theoretical and experimental work on patient-related outcome measures, and the development of new instruments to assess both pain and function in people with osteoarthritis, based on the International Classification of Function, as well as a new integrated model of function; (5) Cohort studies of patients undergoing hip or knee joint replacements to find out what the determinants of good and bad outcomes are. These studies have emphasized the huge variation in disease severity at the time of surgery.

11355716,Psychosomatic complaints in schoolchildren: a Nordic comparison.,"AIMS: This study investigates the association between psychosomatic complaints (PSC) and background factors from children in the five Nordic countries, their families, and their social context in a model using proximal (child), intermediate (family), and distal (society) levels. Similarities and differences between the countries were compared. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to the parents of a representative sample of 3,760 Nordic children aged seven to 12 years. The relationship between PSC and background factors was analysed using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: Headaches and stomach complaints were most common. The prevalence was higher in girls than in boys. A LISREL analysis showed that determinants of PSC varied little between countries. The most important factors associated with PSC were the mother's health and well-being, the child's mental stability and social competence, and the family's socioeconomic status. Families with low education, blue-collar work, low income, and unemployed fathers were found to be most vulnerable. High risk factors could be influenced by other intervening protective factors. The greatest country differences were found on the distal level, where macroeconomic, legislative, and social factors dominated. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of PSC was quite similar between the Nordic countries, although there were some small differences. The results also confirm that the determinants of PSC are multidimensional.

17697401,"Dietary patterns of the Andean population of Puna and Quebrada of Humahuaca, Jujuy, Argentina.","The aim of the present study was to describe dietary patterns in a representative sample from Puna and Quebrada of Humahuaca, Jujuy, Argentina. A cross-sectional nutritional survey was carried out in a representative sample (n 1236) of individuals from these regions. For the present study, only children aged 2-9 years (n 360), adolescents aged 10-18 years (n 223) and adults aged 18 years or over (n 465) were considered. Breast-fed children, pregnant women and lactating women were excluded. Dietary data collection methods comprised one 24 h recall and a semi-quantitative FFQ. We used principal component (PC) analyses to identify prevailing dietary patterns. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the determinants of the identified dietary patterns. Two dominant PC were identified: PC1 reflected a 'Western-like' diet with an emphasis on not-autochthon foods. This pattern tended to be present in urban areas of the Quebrada region and was associated with a younger age, a higher level of development, and a worse diet quality. PC2 reflected an 'Andean-like' diet including a variety of autochthon crops. This was preferred by individuals living in rural areas from Puna with a high level of development during the post-harvest season, and was associated with a greater diet quality. These results suggest that the nutrition transition phenomenon is a reality in certain sectors of this population and might be one of the leading causes of the observed double burden of malnutrition.",The British journal of nutrition,2008 Feb,England,2008,00
19243657,"Nature, prevalence and factors associated with depression among the elderly in a rural south Indian community.","BACKGROUND: Depression in old age is an important public health problem causing considerable morbidity and disability worldwide. There is a dearth of community studies from India investigating geriatric depression and its associated risk factors. This study aimed to establish the nature, prevalence and factors associated with geriatric depression in a rural south Indian community. METHODS: We recruited 1000 participants aged over 65 years from Kaniyambadi block, Vellore, India. We assessed their socio-demographic profile, psychiatric morbidity, cognitive functioning, anthropometrics and disability status using the following structured assessment tools: Geriatric Mental State, Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, Modified CERAD 10 word list learning task, History and Aetiology Schedule Dementia Diagnosis and Subtype, WHO Disability Assessment Scale II, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We adopted a case control framework to study the factors associated with geriatric depression. RESULTS: Prevalence of geriatric depression (ICD-10) within the previous one month was 12.7% (95% CI 10.64-14.76%). Low income (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.08-2.91), experiencing hunger (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.56-4.26), history of cardiac illnesses (OR 4.75; 95% CI 1.96-11.52), transient ischemic attack (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.17-5.05), past head injury (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.36-5.36) and diabetes (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.15-4.72) increased the risk for geriatric depression after adjusting for other determinants using conditional logistic regression. Having more confidants (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.06-0.26) was the significant protective factor. Age, female gender, cognitive impairment and disability status were not significantly associated with geriatric depression. DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression was significantly correlated with experiencing hunger, diabetes, transient ischemic attack, past head injury, more disability and less nourishment; having more friends was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric depression is prevalent in rural south India.

16698975,Living arrangements and mental health in Finland.,"BACKGROUND: Non-married persons are known to have poor mental health compared with married persons. Health differences between marital status groups may largely arise from corresponding differences in interpersonal social bonds. However, official marital status mirrors the social reality of persons to a decreasing extent, and living arrangements may be a better measure of social bonds. Little is known about mental health in different living arrangement groups. This study aims to establish the extent and determinants of mental health differences by living arrangement in terms of psychological distress (GHQ) and DSM-IV psychiatric disorders (CIDI). METHODS: Data were used from the nationally representative cross sectional health 2000 survey, conducted in 2000-1 in Finland. Altogether 4685 participants (80%) aged 30-64 years were included in these analyses; comprehensive information was available on measures of mental health and living arrangements. Living arrangements were measured as follows: married, cohabiting, living with other(s) than a partner, and living alone. RESULTS: Compared with the married, persons living alone and those living with other(s) than a partner were approximately twice as likely to have anxiety or depressive disorders. Cohabiters did not differ from the married. In men, psychological distress was similarly associated with living arrangements. Unemployment, lack of social support, and alcohol consumption attenuated the excess psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity of persons living alone and of those living with other(s) than a partner by about 10%-50% each. CONCLUSIONS: Living arrangements are strongly associated with mental health, particularly among men. Information on living arrangements, social support, unemployment, and alcohol use may facilitate early stage recognition of poor mental health in primary health care.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2006 Jun,England,2006,00

HBSC provides intelligence for the development and evaluation of public health policy and practice at national, sub-national and international levels. However, the mere existence of evidence does not automatically change policy nor necessarily improve the lives of young people. Effective mechanisms to ensure use of evidence in policy-making and practice are needed. The WHO/HBSC Forum series is a platform designed to facilitate the translation of evidence into action. Forum processes convene researchers, policy-makers and practitioners from across Europe to analyse data, review policies and interventions, and identify lessons learned to improve the health of adolescents through actions that address the social contexts that influence their health. Each Forum process consists of case studies produced by interdisciplinary teams in countries and regions, cross-country evidence reviews, a European consultation, an outcomes statement within a final publication, and a Web-based knowledge platform. In addition to emphasizing the translation of research into action, the Forum series focuses on increasing know-how to scale up intersectoral policies and interventions; reduce health inequities; and involve young people in the design, implementation and evaluation of policies and interventions. Interviews with selected participants in the 2007 Forum process revealed that national-level impacts of involvement were: brokering new or strengthening existing working relationships among members of case study drafting teams and national delegations to events; feeding into the formulation of national policy or practice design; and enabling the comparison of information systems, policies, interventions, and working methods with other countries and against the evidence base, thus providing encouragement for new and/or validation of existing activities. The WHO/HBSC Forum series is an evolving platform. The methodology for each Forum process incorporates lessons learnt through past Fora - within resource constraints - and is based on the principles of efficiency and effectiveness. Areas requiring further development, identified through the aforementioned interviews and based on the reflections of co-organizers, include identification of means to ensure systematic, appropriate and meaningful youth involvement; maximization of the usefulness of the European consultation; and definition of a budget line and framework for evaluation of the process' impact at country level.",International journal of public health,2009 Sep,Switzerland,2009,00
16000345,"Child morbidity and healthcare utilization in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya.","Rapid urbanization and inequitable distribution of social services in African cities significantly contribute to the current deterioration of child health indicators in the region. Determinants of child morbidity and healthcare utilization among slum residents in Nairobi City, Kenya were assessed. Using a morbidity surveillance system, we visited 1691 households every 90 days for 9 months and registered 696 children below 5 years. 264 (37.9 per cent) children were reported to have been sick or injured at least once during the study period. A total of 447 illness episodes were reported among the 264 children (an average of 1.7 episodes per child). Cough, fever, diarrhea, skin problems and eye diseases made up the top five causes of morbidity. Child age below 1 year (OR=2.7; 95 per cent CI=1.33, 5.49) and having a working-mother (OR=2.0; 95 per cent CI=1.19, 3.31) were significantly associated with child morbidity report. About half of the mothers sought proper medical care for their sick children mostly from health institutions located outside the slum. Healthcare seeking within the slum heavily relied on informal private clinics. Working mothers sought medical care more often than non-working mothers (OR=0.29; 95 per cent CI=0.12, 0.7) and infants got priorities compared to older sick children (OR=0.2; 95 per cent CI=0.05, 0.83). We conclude that maternal engagement in non-formal low-paying jobs might in the long-run have a questionable gain in child survival among slum residents.",Journal of tropical pediatrics,2005 Oct,England,2005,00
19383630,Factors influencing attitudes to violence against women.,"Attitudes toward men's violence against women shape both the perpetration of violence against women and responses to this violence by the victim and others around her. For these reasons, attitudes are the target of violence-prevention campaigns. To improve understanding of the determinants of violence against women and to aid the development of violence-prevention efforts, this article reviews the factors that shape attitudes toward violence against women. It offers a framework with which to comprehend the complex array of influences on attitudes toward violent behavior perpetrated by men against women. Two clusters of factors, associated with gender and culture, have an influence at multiple levels of the social order on attitudes regarding violence. Further factors operate at individual, organizational, communal, or societal levels in particular, although their influence may overlap across multiple levels. This article concludes with recommendations regarding efforts to improve attitudes toward violence against women.","Trauma, violence & abuse",2009 Apr,United States,2009,00
19761078,Relationships of exclusion and cohesion with health: the case of Bangladesh.,"The concept of social exclusion, applied widely in the European Union, has in recent years been gaining use in Bangladesh, mostly by international development agencies. Does this discourse of deprivation, developed in the welfare states of northern Europe, have salience in its application to deprivation in countries like Bangladesh where, for example, 31% of the rural population lives in chronic poverty? The concept of social exclusion has three principal components: a dynamic and relational perspective which requires the identification of who or what causes exclusion; an explicit recognition of multiple dimensions of deprivation; and a longitudinal perspective, recognizing that individuals and groups are dynamic intra- and intergenerationally. The Social Exclusion Knowledge Network of the World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health expanded the concept to include health status as a contributor to and an outcome of exclusion and to show that actors beyond the state or public sector can critically impact exclusionary processes. In the Bangladesh application, the relevance of the modified model was explored to find that while there are negative associations between social exclusion and health status, much stronger documentation is needed of the relationship. The modification of including multiple sectors, such as private enterprise and civil society, in addition to the state, as having potential to impact exclusionary processes is fundamental to the application of the social exclusion model in Bangladesh.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",2009 Aug,Bangladesh,2009,00
16365074,Early programming of body composition and fat distribution in adolescents.,"Size at birth and early postnatal growth are determinants of adult height and BMI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of birth weight on body composition and fat distribution in a group of Spanish adolescents. Current body composition was assessed by both skinfold thickness and dual X-ray absorptiometry in 234 adolescents born at term (140 girls and 94 boys), now aged 13-18 y and living in the city of Zaragoza. Relative fat distribution was estimated using the ratio of the subscapular to triceps skinfolds (S:T). Birth weight and gestational age were assessed by a questionnaire. Birth weight was inversely associated with the S:T ratio (P < 0.05) in boys and directly associated with bone mass (P < 0.01) and fat-free mass (P < 0.05) in girls. This association was independent of factors such as age, Tanner stage, gestational age, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and height. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that impaired fetal growth, measured by birth weight, may be related to central fat distribution in boys and decreased bone and fat-free mass in girls.",The Journal of nutrition,2006 Jan,United States,2006,00

An important aspect of promoting social and behavioral change is to understand race-related mechanisms that structure desire for students to engage in alcohol use. This article presents findings based on undergraduate students attending a Midwest university. The current study contributes to the theoretical literature on alcohol use and race.

15275024,Determinants of suicide in the Transkei sub-region of South Africa.,"BACKGROUND: South Africa has a history of traumatized citizens and is a society in transition. Suicidal behavior among the black population group in South Africa appears to be on the increase. Under the post-apartheid dispensation they are undergoing a lot of stresses especially in relation to their as yet unmet expectations and demands from the government. OBJECTIVE: To identify the possible determinants of suicide in the Transkei sub-region of South Africa. METHODS: Interviews with relatives of suicide victims, and analysis of victims' demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial data. RESULTS: Rural people (> 90%) were much more likely to commit suicide than urban dwellers (< 10%). Suicide notes were left by 13% of the victims. Hanging was the method of choice in 57%, gunshot in 30%, and poisoning in 13%. Among those who died by hanging and by gunshot injuries, males far outnumbered the females (82% and 89%, respectively). By contrast, females constituted the greater proportion of deaths by poisoning (75%). Apparent precipitating factors included economic hardship (87%), alcohol abuse (23%), health related issues (17%), marital problems (13%), and social disputes (10%). The uneducated (70%) and unemployed (64%) used hanging as the method of choice. The highly educated 5 (17%) were all employed, and used a firearm in committing suicide. Family disputes 5 (17%) and separation of parents from teenage children were recorded in 17% of the cases. CONCLUSION: Financial hardship was the main underlying reason, identified in 87% victims of suicide. To break this vicious cycle of unemployment, alcohol abuse, and poor health, a comprehensive poverty alleviation program along with community education could be an important step towards reducing suicides in the Transkei sub-region of South Africa.",Journal of clinical forensic medicine,2003 Jun,Scotland,2003,00
16042158,Determinants of healthy eating in Canada: an overview and synthesis.,"This article uses a population health perspective to examine the complex set of interactions among the determinants of healthy eating. An overview of current knowledge on determinants of healthy eating was organized as follows: 1) individual determinants of personal food choices and 2) collective determinants, including a) environmental determinants as the context for eating behaviours and b) public policies as creating supportive environments for healthy eating. A conceptual synthesis of the literature revealed that individual determinants of personal food choice (physiological state, food preferences, nutritional knowledge, perceptions of healthy eating and psychological factors) are necessary, but not sufficient, to explain eating behaviour, which is highly contextual. Collective determinants of eating behaviour include a wide range of contextual factors, such as the interpersonal environment created by family and peers, the physical environment, which determines food availability and accessibility, the economic environment, in which food is a commodity to be marketed for profit, and the social environment, in which social status (income, education and gender) and cultural milieu are determinants of healthy eating that may be working ""invisibly"" to structure food choice. Policy is a powerful means of mediating multiple environments. There are gaps in our understanding of the process of intervening in macro-level environments and the impact of such interventions on the promotion of healthy eating. Collective determinants of food choice and policy contexts for promoting healthy eating, therefore, require investment in research. Applying a population health promotion lens to understanding the multiple contexts influencing healthy eating provides insight into prioritizing research and action strategies for the promotion of healthy eating.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2005 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,2005,00
19531164,Health as freedom: addressing social determinants of global health inequities through the human right to development.,"In spite of vast global improvements in living standards, health, and well-being, the persistence of absolute poverty and its attendant maladies remains an unsettling fact of life for billions around the world and constitutes the primary cause for the failure of developing states to improve the health of their peoples. While economic development in developing countries is necessary to provide for underlying determinants of health--most prominently, poverty reduction and the building of comprehensive primary health systems--inequalities in power within the international economic order and the spread of neoliberal development policy limit the ability of developing states to develop economically and realize public goods for health. With neoliberal development policies impacting entire societies, the collective right to development, as compared with an individual rights-based approach to development, offers a framework by which to restructure this system to realize social determinants of health. The right to development, working through a vector of rights, can address social determinants of health, obligating states and the international community to support public health systems while reducing inequities in health through poverty-reducing economic growth. At an international level, where the ability of states to develop economically and to realize public goods through public health systems is constrained by international financial institutions, the implementation of the right to development enables a restructuring of international institutions and foreign-aid programs, allowing states to enter development debates with a right to cooperation from other states, not simply a cry for charity.",Bioethics,2009 Feb,England,2009,00
17708005,Pathways of disadvantage and smoking careers: evidence and policy implications.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate in older industrialised societies (a) how social disadvantage contributes to smoking risk among women (b) the role of social and economic policies in reducing disadvantage and moderating wider inequalities in life chances and living standards. METHODS: Review and analysis of (a) the effects of disadvantage in childhood and into adulthood on women's smoking status in early adulthood (b) policy impacts on the social exposures associated with high smoking risk. MAIN RESULTS: (a) Smoking status--ever smoking, current smoking, heavy smoking, and cessation--is influenced not only by current circumstances but by longer term biographies of disadvantage (b) social and economic policies shape key social predictors of women's smoking status, including childhood circumstances, educational levels and adult circumstances, and moderate inequalities in the distribution of these dimensions of life chances and living standards. Together, the two sets of findings argue for a policy toolkit that acts on the distal determinants of smoking, with interventions targeting the conditions in which future and current smokers live. CONCLUSIONS: An approach to tobacco control is advocated that combines changing smoking habits with reducing inequalities in the social trajectories in which they are embedded. Policies to level up opportunities and living standards across the lifecourse should be championed as part of an equity oriented approach to reducing the disease burden of cigarette smoking.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2006 Sep,England,2006,00
11434324,"[Secular trends in respiratory diseases of childhood in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil (1984-1996)].","OBJECTIVE: Data from two consecutive household surveys undertaken in mid-80s and mid-90s allow to characterize and analyse secular trends in infant and child respiratory diseases in the city of S. Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The two surveys included random population samples aged from zero to 59 months (1,016 in the period of 1984-85 and 1,280 in 1995-96). In both surveys the instant prevalence of high respiratory diseases (above the epiglottis) and low respiratory diseases with or without wheezing were calculated. All sampled children were examined in their household at a random day by trained pediatricians using standardized procedures. The examinations included medical history, past respiratory diseases and a complete physical examination. In both surveys the examinations were distributed throughout a period of almost 12 months to assure a uniform coverage of the various areas of the city along the four seasons of the year. For each survey, the study of the social distribution of the diseases took into account tertiles of the per capita family income. For the study of the determinants of secular trends, hierarchical causal models, multivariate regression analyses and calculations analogous to the ones used to assess population attributable risks were applied. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In the time span from the first to the second survey, there was a substantial increase in the prevalence of both low (from 22.2% to 38.8%) and high respiratory diseases (from 6.0% to 10.0% and from 0.8% to 2.8%, without and with wheezing, respectively). In the case of high respiratory disease and low respiratory disease without wheezing, an increase in prevalence was observed among all social strata, which did not interfere with the slightly less favourable situation of the lower income groups. In the case of low respiratory disease with wheezing, the increase was only observed among middle and low-income groups, being particularly high among the lower income group, yielding a significant inverse gradient between income and respiratory disease. Positive changes in distal (family income and maternal schooling) and in intermediate determinants related to housing characteristics would have resulted in a decline, not an increase, in the prevalence of respiratory diseases in the city. The duplication in the attendance rate to day care nurseries seen in the period could have counterbalanced the positive effect due to socioeconomic and housing variables but would not be enough to explain an increase in the disease.",Revista de saude publica,2000 Dec,Brazil,2000,00
17236299,Psychometric evaluation of Romanian version of Job Content Questionnaire in physicians.,"UNLABELLED: With the development of modern civilization and with continuous changing of job characteristics, occupational stress becomes increasingly important. Physicians are an exposed category and they are prone to develop stress-related disease and risk behaviors. METHODS: We conduct a study among 118 physicians. The Romanian version of Job Content Questionnaire was mailed to all the subjects. We investigate the main scales of JCQ: decision latitude (DL), psychological job demands (PJD) and social support (SoS), along with the prevalence of risk behaviors, depression and sleeping problems. RESULTS: The final response rate was 112 (94.9%). The differences between women and men are significant for psychological demands (36.55 versus 32.9, P < 0.01), decision latitude (73.83 versus 67.05) and skill discretion (36.47 versus 34.6). Age positively correlated with SD (r = 0.40), DA (r = 0.40) and PJD (r = 0.29) in women and negatively with CoS (r = -0.39) in men. PJD negatively correlated with SS (r = -0.5) and CoS (r = -0.28) in women and with CoS (r = -0.54) in men. Smoking (32% women and 56% men) and sedentary behavior (over 60% women and men) positively correlated with PJD and negatively with social support in both men and women. DISCUSSIONS: The issue of professional stress is very important in modern medicine. Age and gender can be determinants of job strain, but also of job characteristics. Many studies have shown positive relations between job strain, and some harmful habits such as tobacco smoking and sedentary lifestyle; we have to outline again the importance of organizational factors in managing both stress and satisfaction at workplace.",Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,2006,Germany,2006,00
18047157,Conceptualizing and operationalizing neighbourhoods: the conundrum of identifying territorial units.,"BACKGROUND: Over the past 10 years, there has been a surge of interest in studying small-area characteristics as determinants of population and individual health. Accumulating evidence indicates the existence of variations in the health status of populations living in areas that differ in affluence and shows that selected small-area characteristics are associated with the occurrence of selected health behaviours. These variations cannot be attributed solely to differential characteristics of populations living within small areas. One vexing problem that confronts researchers is that of conceptualizing and operationalizing neighbourhoods through delineation of small territorial units in health research. GOALS AND METHODS: The aims of this paper are to selectively overview conceptual definitions of neighbourhoods and to illustrate the challenges of operationalizing neighbourhoods in urban areas by describing our attempts to map out small territorial units on the Island of Montreal and in the City of Calgary. CONCLUSION: We outline guiding principles for the construction of a methodology for establishing small-area contours in urban areas and formulate recommendations for future research.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2007 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,2007,00
11074104,The estimated rate of depressed mood in US adults: recent evidence for a peak in later life.,"OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study is to add new evidence on the descriptive epidemiology of depressed mood, and to investigate suspected determinants for depressed mood in adulthood. METHODS: The data are from a continuing survey of a nationally representative sample of adult household residents in the United States, conducted in 1995 and 1996, totaling 26,883 respondents. Multiple logistic regression procedures yielded estimated associations. RESULTS: We found that an estimated 1.9% of adult females and 1.0% of adult males experience a spell of sustained depressed mood during a span of approximately 2 weeks duration (i.e. point prevalence). For most of these cases, this is not the first spell. Among women, the smoothed curve for the prevalence estimates shows a peak in the youngest age stratum and decreases across age strata before 60 years, and has a slight secondary peak thereafter. In contrast, for males, the prevalence estimates of depression show no peak in the older age strata. Evidence from logistic regression analyses supports the inference of this later life peak in frequency of depressed mood among women. These new findings add to a growing body of epidemiological evidence on age and depression, and provoke new questions about the possibly etiological relationships involving social structural characteristics of local neighborhoods in combination with individual-level risk factors that have received primary attention in recent psychiatric epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to the need for further etiological research, including studies of relationships between social structural characteristics of local neighborhoods and the occurrence of spells of depressed mood, as well as clinical implications for depression mood in late life.",Journal of affective disorders,2000 Nov,Netherlands,2000,00

18037616,Early life determinants of physical activity in 11 to 12 year olds: cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine factors in early life (up to age 5 years) that are associated with objectively measured physical activity in 11-12 year olds. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Avon longitudinal study of parents and children, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 11-12 years from the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Physical activity levels in counts per minute (cpm) and minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity for seven days measured with a uniaxial actigraph accelerometer. RESULTS: Valid actigraph data, defined as at least three days of physical activity for at least 10 hours a day, were collected from 5451 children. Several factors were associated with physical activity at ages 11-12 years. Regression coefficients are compared with the baseline of ""none"" for categorical variables: maternal brisk walking during pregnancy (regression coefficient 5.0, 95% confidence interval -8.5 to 18.5; cpm for <1 h/wk and > or =2 h/wk of physical activity 17.7, 5.3 to 30.1), maternal swimming during pregnancy (21.5, 10.9 to 32.1 and cpm for <1 h/wk and > or =2 h/wk of physical activity 24.2, 7.8 to 40.7), parents' physical activity when the child was aged 21 months (28.5, 15.2 to 41.8 and cpm of physical activity for either parent active and both parents active 33.5, 17.8 to 49.3), and parity assessed during pregnancy (2.9, -7.6 to 13.4 and cpm of physical activity for 1 and > or =2 parity 21.2, 7.1 to 35.3). CONCLUSIONS: Few factors in early life predicted later physical activity in 11-12 year olds. Parents' physical activity during pregnancy and early in the child's life showed a modest association with physical activity of the child at age 11-12 years, suggesting that active parents tend to raise active children. Helping parents to increase their physical activity therefore may promote children's activity.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2008 Jan 5,England,2008,00
16174145,Social and economic determinants of disparities in professional help-seeking for child mental health problems: evidence from a national sample.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the role of social determinants-including race, education, income, and demographic factors-of child mental health services use, defined as having had a visit to a mental health professional for depression, attention-deficit, or for any reason. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Child/Young Adult supplement, a nationally representative sample of 7-14-year-old children born to women who were 14-22 years old at the start of data collection, in 1979. African Americans and Latinos were over-sampled, and population weights are available to make nationally representative inferences. STUDY DESIGN: Indicators of mental health service use were regressed on social and economic determinants, family structure variables, and insurance variables, controlling for need as captured by several different symptom scales. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Girls are much less likely to obtain needed treatment for externalizing behavior disorders than are boys, and are somewhat less likely to obtain needed treatment for depression than boys. Middle children are less likely to obtain needed treatment for any mental health problem than are oldest, youngest, or only children. The presence of the father inhibits the likelihood that the child will receive treatment, particularly for depression. African Americans and Latinos are less likely than white children to receive treatment. In contrast to these rich results for the social and demographic determinants of children's specialty mental health utilization, the economic and insurance variables (including maternal education and income) seem to hold little predictive power. CONCLUSIONS: These results argue for interventions to sensitize parents-especially fathers-to the need to pay attention to the mental health needs of their children, in particular girls and middle children. The analysis also suggests that the literature on intrahousehold decision making and on the gender dimensions of investment in children is worth extending to mental health treatment decisions.",Health services research,2005 Oct,United States,2005,00

OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and incidence of neck pain and disability in workers; to identify risk factors for neck pain in workers; to propose an etiological diagram; and to make recommendations for future research. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous reviews of the etiology of neck pain in workers relied on cross-sectional evidence. Recently published cohorts and randomized trials warrant a re-analysis of this body of research. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline for literature published from 1980-2006. Retrieved articles were reviewed for relevance. Relevant articles were critically appraised. Articles judged to have adequate internal validity were included in our best evidence synthesis. RESULTS: One hundred and nine papers on the burden and determinants of neck pain in workers were scientifically admissible. The annual prevalence of neck pain varied from 27.1% in Norway to 47.8% in Quebec, Canada. Each year, between 11% and 14.1% of workers were limited in their activities because of neck pain. Risk factors associated with neck pain in workers include age, previous musculoskeletal pain, high quantitative job demands, low social support at work, job insecurity, low physical capacity, poor computer workstation design and work posture, sedentary work position, repetitive work and precision work. We found preliminary evidence that gender, occupation, headaches, emotional problems, smoking, poor job satisfaction, awkward work postures, poor physical work environment, and workers' ethnicity may be associated with neck pain. There is evidence that interventions aimed at modifying workstations and worker posture are not effective in reducing the incidence of neck pain in workers. CONCLUSION: Neck disorders are a significant source of pain and activity limitations in workers. Most neck pain results from complex relationships between individual and workplace risk factors. No prevention strategies have been shown to reduce the incidence of neck pain in workers.",Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics,2009 Feb,United States,2009,00
17313411,Determinants of long-term weight maintenance.,"The aim of this paper is to discuss existing evidence on the determinants of weight maintenance by examining population based studies on weight gain as well as studies on weight loss maintenance. The data shows that disadvantaged groups are less likely to maintain healthy weight, and various social and economic problems starting from early in the life cycle may increase the risk of later weight gain. Long-term data on weight loss maintenance is still very limited. It is obvious that permanent behavioural changes that lead to reduced energy intake and/or increased energy expenditure are needed but otherwise the search for predictors in weight loss maintenance has been largely discouraging. In conclusion, since social and economic problems seem to increase the risk of weight gain more attention should be paid to environments that promote healthy weight maintenance.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2007 Apr,Norway,2007,00
19033160,Determinants of the incidence of childhood asthma: a two-stage case-control study.,"Extensive literature exists on potential risk factors for childhood asthma. To the authors' knowledge, no investigators have yet attempted to disentangle the effects of those determinants within a single study setting. The authors aimed to evaluate the independent effects of 47 potential determinants (from the prenatal, perinatal, and childhood periods) of asthma development in children within the first 10 years of life. From a Canadian birth cohort of 26,265 children (1990-2002), a 2-stage case-control study was conducted. In the first stage, 20 controls per case were selected from 3 administrative databases. In the second stage, selected mothers were mailed questionnaires for assessment of additional determinants. Increased risks of childhood asthma were found for > or =1 previous diagnosis of bronchopulmonary disease and atopic dermatitis in the child, oxygen administration after birth, prescription of antibiotics within the first 6 months of life, male gender, asthma during pregnancy, use of antibiotics during pregnancy, maternal receipt of social aid, paternal asthma, and asthma in siblings. Protective effects included use of intranasal corticosteroids during pregnancy, having a wood-burning fireplace, having pets in the home prior to the index date, breastfeeding, and day-care attendance. This study allowed the authors to identify, within a single setting, the most influential determinants of childhood asthma among 47 predictors assessed for the prenatal, perinatal, and childhood periods.",American journal of epidemiology,2009 Jan 15,United States,2009,00

12510201,Postpartum depression: prevalence and determinants in Lebanon.,"This study assesses the prevalence and determinants of postpartum depression (PPD). 396 women delivering in Beirut and a rural area (Beka'a Valley) were interviewed 24 hours and 3-5 months after delivery. During the latter visit, they were screened using the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale. The overall prevalence of PPD was 21% but was significantly lower in Beirut than the Beka'a Valley (16% vs. 26%). Lack of social support and prenatal depression were significantly associated with PPD in both areas, whereas stressful life events, lifetime depression, vaginal delivery, little education, unemployment, and chronic health problems were significantly related to PPD in one of the areas. Prenatal depression and more than one chronic health problem increased significantly the risk of PPD. Caesarean section decreased the risk of PPD, particularly in Beirut but also in the Beka'a Valley. Caregivers should use pre- and postnatal assessments to identify and address women at risk of PPD.",Archives of women's mental health,2002 Oct,Austria,2002,00
19755191,"Testing a model of patient characteristics, psychologic status, and cognitive function as predictors of self-care in persons with chronic heart failure.","OBJECTIVE: Self-care is a key component in the management of chronic heart failure (CHF). Yet there are many barriers that interfere with a patient's ability to undertake self-care. The primary aim of the study was to test a conceptual model of determinants of CHF self-care. Specifically, we hypothesized that cognitive function and depressive symptoms would predict CHF self-care. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients hospitalized with CHF were assessed for self-care (Self-Care of Heart Failure Index), cognitive function (Mini Mental State Exam), and depressive symptoms (Cardiac Depression Scale) during their index hospital admission. Other factors thought to influence self-care were tested in the model: age, gender, social isolation, self-care confidence, and comorbid illnesses. Multiple regression was used to test the model and to identify significant individual determinants of self-care maintenance and management. RESULTS: The model of 7 variables explained 39% (F [7, 42] 3.80; P = .003) of the variance in self-care maintenance and 38% (F [7, 42] 3.73; P = .003) of the variance in self-care management. Only 2 variables contributed significantly to the variance in self-care maintenance: age (P < .01) and moderate-to-severe comorbidity (P < .05). Four variables contributed significantly to the variance in self-care management: gender (P < .05), moderate-to-severe comorbidity (P < .05), depression (P < .05), and self-care confidence (P < .01). When cognitive function was removed from the models, the model explained less of the variance in self-care maintenance (35%) (F [6, 43] 3.91; P = .003) and management (34%) (F [6, 43] 3.71; P = .005). CONCLUSION: Although cognitive function added to the model in predicting both self-care maintenance and management, it was not a significant predictor of CHF self-care compared with other modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. Depression explained only self-care management.",Heart & lung : the journal of critical care,2009 Sep-Oct,United States,2009,00
17640787,"Pathways to obesity: identifying local, modifiable determinants of physical activity and diet.","Many studies document small area inequalities in morbidity and mortality and show associations between area deprivation and health. However, few studies unpack the ""black box"" of area deprivation to show which specific local social and physical environmental characteristics impact upon health, and might be amenable to modification. We theorised a model of the potential causal pathways to obesity and employed path analysis using a rich data set from national studies in England and Scotland to test the model empirically. Significant associations between obesity and neighbourhood disorder and access to local high street facilities (local shops, financial services and health-related stores found in a typical small UK town) were found. There was a tendency for lower levels of obesity in areas with more swimming pools and supermarkets. In turn, policing levels, physical dereliction and recorded violent crime were associated with neighbourhood disorder. The analysis identifies several factors that are associated with (and are probably determinants of) obesity and which are outside the standard remit of the healthcare sector. They highlight the role that public and private sector organisations have in promoting the nation's health. Public health professionals should seek to work alongside or within these organisations to capitalise on opportunities to improve health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2007 Nov,England,2007,00
15565075,Food frequency questionnaire results correlate with metabolic control in insulin-treated veterans with type 2 diabetes: the Diabetes Outcomes in Veterans Study.,"OBJECTIVE: To validate food frequency analysis as a predictor of metabolic status in persons with type 2 diabetes and to identify psychosocial factors affecting dietary adherence. METHODS: Three hundred forty-seven subjects with stable, insulin-treated type 2 diabetes completed a food frequency questionnaire and six instruments measuring different psychosocial attributes. Eight metabolic parameters were used as principal endpoints. Data from the food frequency questionnaires were used to estimate daily energy intake and determine each subject's adherence to seven dietary standards derived from the 2003 Dietary Recommendations of the American Diabetes Association. We excluded 105 subjects reporting daily energy intake <1,000 kcal because these results were considered unreliable. Subjects were then categorized into three groups depending on their adherence rates to American Diabetes Association dietary standards. RESULTS: Subjects with the lowest dietary adherence had the poorest metabolic control. Adherence to dietary standards was particularly poor among subjects with metabolic syndrome (2.1%) and/or obesity (4.1%). The most important determinants of following recommended dietary practices were positive attitudes, fewer social barriers, and a conviction that diet could control diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: For subjects with type 2 diabetes reporting a dietary intake of >1,000 kcal/day, food frequency questionnaire data could identify those with poor metabolic control. Nutrition interventions to improve metabolic control should focus on reducing fat intake and emphasizing the importance of diet. Multidisciplinary efforts should be directed at overcoming social barriers to recommended dietary practices and to treating depression.",Journal of the American Dietetic Association,2004 Dec,United States,2004,00

19226922,Why does the social gradient in health not apply to overweight?,"BACKGROUND: In developed countries, there is a negative association between socioeconomic status (SES) and a variety of health outcomes, known as the social gradient in health. This is contrasted by a weak, absent or even positive gradient for overweight. The objective of this study was to investigate why overweight does not follow the social gradient. DATA AND METHODS: Data from adult respondents to the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (cycle 2.2) were used. A series of multivariate models regressing overweight and determinants of overweight on household education and household income were performed, stratified by gender. RESULTS: Except for education among women, negative associations between SES measures and overweight emerged. Respondents from higher household income groups reported more meals away from home, compared with those from lower household income groups. In addition, adults in higher-education households were more likely than those in lower-education households to have quit smoking. INTERPRETATION: Differences in food consumption patterns and smoking cessation between SES groups may have contributed to the lack of a clear negative association between household education and income and overweight in the CCHS.",Health reports,2008 Dec,Canada,2008,00
15377557,Determinants of surgery related anxiety in cataract patients.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Not much is known about the relative importance of different determinants of anxiety in cataract patients. This study analysed the predictive value of factors related to surgery induced anxiety. METHODS: In 128 cataract patients, recruited from two hospitals (Medical Centre Maastricht Annadal (MCMA) and Rotterdam Eye Hospital (REH)), state anxiety was assessed at four different time points using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The following predictive factors of anxiety were measured: trait anxiety, outcome expectancies, doctor-patient relationship, coping strategy, social support, information supply, sociodemographic variables, and previous cataract surgery. Repeated measures ANOVA, t tests, multiple regression analysis, and correlations were used to analyse data. RESULTS: In general patients reported little anxiety. The level of anxiety (scale 1-4) was the highest before surgery, decreased immediately after surgery, and increased again after the postoperative visit. Patients with higher trait anxiety levels (r = 0.41; p<0.01), and women (r = 0.30; p<0.01) reported more anxiety. The REH patients showed lower anxiety scores than the MCMA patients. CONCLUSION: Women and patients with higher trait anxiety were more likely to experience higher levels of state anxiety. Positive outcome expectancies and social support may decrease anxiety.",The British journal of ophthalmology,2004 Oct,England,2004,00
16931531,No association of neighbourhood volunteerism with mortality in New Zealand: a national multilevel cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: The association of social capital with health and mortality is contentious, and empirical findings are inconsistent. This study tests the association of neighbourhood-level volunteerism with mortality. METHODS: Cohort study of 1996 New Zealand census respondents aged 25-74 years (4.75 million person years) using multilevel Poisson regression analyses. Neighbourhood (average population 2,034) measures included indices of social capital (volunteering activities for all census respondents) and deprivation. RESULTS: Adjusting for just age and marital status, the mortality rate ratios for people living in the quintile of neighbourhoods with the lowest compared with highest volunteerism were 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.24) and 1.09 (1.01-1.18), for males and females, respectively. Adjusting for potential individual-level and neighbourhood-level socioeconomic confounders reduced the rate ratios to 0.94 (0.88-1.01) and 0.92 (0.85-1.01), respectively. There was no significant association with any cause of death, including suicide [rate ratios 0.89 (0.64-1.22) and 0.57 (0.31-1.05), respectively]. Restricting the analyses to only those census respondents living at their census night address for five or more years, and therefore 'exposed' to that level of volunteerism for a longer period, did not substantially alter findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the largest multilevel studies yet, found no statistically significant independent association of a structural measure of neighbourhood social capital with mortality-including suicide. Assuming social features of neighbourhoods are important determinants of health, future research should examine other features (e.g. social fragmentation) and other outcomes (e.g. behaviour).",International journal of epidemiology,2006 Aug,England,2006,00
15758201,Sociality and the rate of molecular evolution.,"The molecular clock does not tick at a uniform rate in all taxa but may be influenced by species characteristics. Eusocial species (those with reproductive division of labor) have been predicted to have faster rates of molecular evolution than their nonsocial relatives because of greatly reduced effective population size; if most individuals in a population are nonreproductive and only one or few queens produce all the offspring, then eusocial animals could have much lower effective population sizes than their solitary relatives, which should increase the rate of substitution of ""nearly neutral"" mutations. An earlier study reported faster rates in eusocial honeybees and vespid wasps but failed to correct for phylogenetic nonindependence or to distinguish between potential causes of rate variation. Because sociality has evolved independently in many different lineages, it is possible to conduct a more wide-ranging study to test the generality of the relationship. We have conducted a comparative analysis of 25 phylogenetically independent pairs of social lineages and their nonsocial relatives, including bees, wasps, ants, termites, shrimps, and mole rats, using a range of available DNA sequences (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA coding for proteins and RNAs, and nontranslated sequences). By including a wide range of social taxa, we were able to test whether there is a general influence of sociality on rates of molecular evolution and to test specific predictions of the hypothesis: (1) that social species have faster rates because they have reduced effective population sizes; (2) that mitochondrial genes would show a greater effect of sociality than nuclear genes; and (3) that rates of molecular evolution should be correlated with the degree of sociality. We find no consistent pattern in rates of molecular evolution between social and nonsocial lineages and no evidence that mitochondrial genes show faster rates in social taxa. However, we show that the most highly eusocial Hymenoptera do have faster rates than their nonsocial relatives. We also find that social parasites (that utilize the workers from related species to produce their own offspring) have faster rates than their social relatives, which is consistent with an effect of lower effective population size on rate of molecular evolution. Our results illustrate the importance of allowing for phylogenetic nonindependence when conducting investigations of determinants of variation in rate of molecular evolution.",Molecular biology and evolution,2005 Jun,United States,2005,00
11007156,Social-cognitive determinants of nutrition behavior among supermarket food shoppers: a structural equation analysis.,"A social-cognitive model of nutrition behavior (A. Bandura, 1997) was tested using structural equation modeling of data from 307 food shoppers recruited from 5 supermarkets in Southwest Virginia. The shoppers were participating in the baseline phase of an ongoing nutrition promotion program. As part of the evaluation, data were collected on the self-efficacy and outcome-expectations components of social-cognitive theory as well as on food purchases and intake. The structural analyses presented here support the social-cognitive model. Self-efficacy, physical outcome expectations, age, socioeconomic status, and number of children were important predictors of nutrition behavior among shoppers. Implications for interventions using social-cognitive variables to improve the nutritional content of food purchases and intake are discussed.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2000 Sep,United States,2000,00
16698975,Living arrangements and mental health in Finland.,"BACKGROUND: Non-married persons are known to have poor mental health compared with married persons. Health differences between marital status groups may largely arise from corresponding differences in interpersonal social bonds. However, official marital status mirrors the social reality of persons to a decreasing extent, and living arrangements may be a better measure of social bonds. Little is known about mental health in different living arrangement groups. This study aims to establish the extent and determinants of mental health differences by living arrangement in terms of psychological distress (GHQ) and DSM-IV psychiatric disorders (CIDI). METHODS: Data were used from the nationally representative cross sectional health 2000 survey, conducted in 2000-1 in Finland. Altogether 4685 participants (80%) aged 30-64 years were included in these analyses; comprehensive information was available on measures of mental health and living arrangements. Living arrangements were measured as follows: married, cohabiting, living with other(s) than a partner, and living alone. RESULTS: Compared with the married, persons living alone and those living with other(s) than a partner were approximately twice as likely to have anxiety or depressive disorders. Cohabiters did not differ from the married. In men, psychological distress was similarly associated with living arrangements. Unemployment, lack of social support, and alcohol consumption attenuated the excess psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity of persons living alone and of those living with other(s) than a partner by about 10%-50% each. CONCLUSIONS: Living arrangements are strongly associated with mental health, particularly among men. Information on living arrangements, social support, unemployment, and alcohol use may facilitate early stage recognition of poor mental health in primary health care.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2006 Jun,England,2006,00
19523592,"Women's expectations of treatment and care after an antenatal HIV diagnosis in Lilongwe, Malawi.","Women in sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly learning their HIV status in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programmes in the context of antenatal care. This paper examines women's decisions about HIV testing and their experience of PMTCT and HIV-related care in one clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. It is based on qualitative, ethnographic research conducted in 2004 and 2005, including interviews and focus group discussions with 55 HIV-positive women participating in a PMTCT programme, and 21 interviews with key informants from the programme and the health system. Women's expectations from testing were consistent with the benefits for their own health and their infants' health, as communicated by nurses. However, the PMTCT programme only poorly met their expectations. Reasons for this disjuncture included the construction of women as still healthy even when they needed treatment, a focus only on infant health, health system weaknesses, lack of integrated care and timely referral, and defining HIV exclusively as a medical issue, while ignoring the social determinants of health. Women's own health was particularly marginalised within the PMTCT programme, yet good models exist for comprehensive care for women, infants and their families that should be implemented as testing is scaled up.",Reproductive health matters,2009 May,Netherlands,2009,00
16303256,Decreased brain tryptophan availability as a partial determinant of post-partum blues.,"BACKGROUND: The post-partum blues is a transient mood alteration affecting most women a few days after delivery. Its stereotypic pattern of symptoms and time course, peaking on post-partum day 3-5, is suggestive of biological determinants superimposed on psycho-social factors. This study was designed to evaluate the possible role of the serotonin system during this period through assessment of brain tryptophan availability. METHODS: Blood samples from 50 women were collected just before (D0) and 3 days after (D3) delivery. Based on plasma concentration of tryptophan, amino acids competing with tryptophan for transport across the blood-brain barrier and on their respective affinities for this transporter, a brain tryptophan availability index (BTAI) was calculated and its variation correlated with the intensity of post-partum blues evaluated through the Kennerley and Gath score at D3. RESULTS: The BTAI showed a -15% decrease between D0 and D3 (p < 0.01, paired t-test). This decrease was not supported by a drop in plasma tryptophan since its level rather increased (+19%). There was no evidence for change in placental indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity since the variation in plasma l-kynurenine (+12%) paralleled the change in tryptophan level. The decreased BTAI appeared the consequence of a dramatic increase in plasma levels of most amino acids, particularly the competitor aminoacids leucine, isoleucine, valine and tyrosine, during the early post-partum. This decrease in brain tryptophan availability was concomitant to the post-partum blues, whose intensity significantly correlated with the amplitude of BTAI variation (Pearson's coefficient -0.283, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that generalized, large amplitude metabolic and/or nutritional changes occurring in the early post-partum result in a transient decrease in brain tryptophan availability, partly accounting for the mood alteration referred to as the post-partum blues, a model for the triggering of puerperal mood disorder in vulnerable women.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2006 Apr,England,2006,00
16618370,Household and community socioeconomic and environmental determinants of child nutritional status in Cameroon.,"BACKGROUND: Undernutrition is a leading cause of child mortality in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. We examine the household and community level socioeconomic and environmental factors associated with child nutritional status in Cameroon, and changes in the effects of these factors during the 1990s economic crisis. We further consider age-specific effects of household economic status on child nutrition. METHODS: Child nutritional status was measured by weight-for-age (WAZ) and height-for-age (HAZ) z-scores. Data were from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 1991 and 1998. We used analysis of variance to assess the bivariate association between the explanatory factors and nutritional status. Multivariate, multilevel analyses were undertaken to estimate the net effects of both household and community factors. RESULTS: Average WAZ and HAZ declined respectively from -0.70 standard deviations (SD), i.e. 0.70 SD below the reference median, to -0.83 SD (p = 0.006) and from -1.03 SD to -1.14 SD (p = 0.026) between 1991 and 1998. These declines occurred mostly among boys, children over 12 months of age, and those of low socioeconomic status. Maternal education and maternal health seeking behavior were associated with better child nutrition. Household economic status had an overall positive effect that increased during the crisis, but it had little effect in children under 6 months of age. Improved household (water, sanitation and cooking fuel) and community environment had positive effects. Children living in the driest regions of the country were consistently worst off, and those in the largest cities were best off. CONCLUSION: Both household and community factors have significant impact on child health in Cameroon. Understanding these relationships can facilitate design of age- and community-specific intervention programs.",BMC public health,2006 Apr 17,England,2006,00

19168935,The burden of prenatal exposure to alcohol: revised measurement of cost.,"BACKGROUND: In Canada the incidence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 1 in 100 live births. FASD is the leading cause of developmental and cognitive disabilities in Canada. Only one study has examined the cost of FASD in Canada. In that study we did not include prospective data for infants under the age of one year, costs for adults beyond 21 years or costs for individuals living in institutions. OBJECTIVE: To calculate a revised estimate of direct and indirect costs associated with FASD at the patient level. METHODS: Cross-sectional study design was used. Two-hundred and fifty (250) participants completed the study tool. Participants included caregivers of children, youth and adults, with FASD, from day of birth to 53 years, living in urban and rural communities throughout Canada participated. Participants completed the Health Services Utilization Inventory (HSUI). Key cost components were elicited: direct costs: medical, education, social services, out-of-pocket costs; and indirect costs: productivity losses. Total average costs per individual with FASD were calculated by summing the costs for each in each cost component, and dividing by the sample size. Costs were extrapolated to one year. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant determinants of costs and to calculate the adjusted annual costs associated with FASD. RESULTS: Total adjusted annual costs associated with FASD at the individual level was $21,642 (95% CI, $19,842; $24,041), compared to $14,342 (95% CI, $12,986; $15,698) in the first study. Severity of the individual's condition, age, and relationship of the individual to the caregiver (biological, adoptive, foster) were significant determinants of costs (p < 0.001). Cost of FASD annually to Canada of those from day of birth to 53 years old, was $5.3 billion (95% CI, $4.12 billion; $6.4 billion). CONCLUSIONS: Study results demonstrated the cost burden of FASD in Canada was profound. Inclusion of infants aged 0 to 1 years, adults beyond the age of 21 years and costs associated with residing in institutions provided a more accurate estimate of the costs of FASD. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed.

16042158,Determinants of healthy eating in Canada: an overview and synthesis.,"This article uses a population health perspective to examine the complex set of interactions among the determinants of healthy eating. An overview of current knowledge on determinants of healthy eating was organized as follows: 1) individual determinants of personal food choices and 2) collective determinants, including a) environmental determinants as the context for eating behaviours and b) public policies as creating supportive environments for healthy eating. A conceptual synthesis of the literature revealed that individual determinants of personal food choice (physiological state, food preferences, nutritional knowledge, perceptions of healthy eating and psychological factors) are necessary, but not sufficient, to explain eating behaviour, which is highly contextual. Collective determinants of eating behaviour include a wide range of contextual factors, such as the interpersonal environment created by family and peers, the physical environment, which determines food availability and accessibility, the economic environment, in which food is a commodity to be marketed for profit, and the social environment, in which social status (income, education and gender) and cultural milieu are determinants of healthy eating that may be working ""invisibly"" to structure food choice. Policy is a powerful means of mediating multiple environments. There are gaps in our understanding of the process of intervening in macro-level environments and the impact of such interventions on the promotion of healthy eating. Collective determinants of food choice and policy contexts for promoting healthy eating, therefore, require investment in research. Applying a population health promotion lens to understanding the multiple contexts influencing healthy eating provides insight into prioritizing research and action strategies for the promotion of healthy eating.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2005 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,2005,00
11939367,Self-reports of aberrant behaviour on the roads: errors and violations in a sample of Greek drivers.,"Recent studies have shown that unsafe driver acts can be classified into two distinct categories (i.e.. errors and violations) entailing different measures for reducing road traffic accidents. A survey of over 1,400 drivers in Greece is reported in which a variety of aberrant driving behaviours have been identified. The present study has confirmed the results of earlier studies in the driving populations of Britain. Australia and Sweden that errors and violations are the major determinants in the factor structure of aberrant behaviours. Three types of violations were identified including, highway code-, aggressive- and parking-violations (or situational violations). Mistakes and lapses were two major forms of errors. The factor analysis identified another two classes of behaviour that could not be accounted for very well by the error-violation distinction. One class of behaviours referred to a state of low preparedness and negligence while the other class referred to communication errors and 'social disregard' for the other road users. Each class of behaviour was found to have different demographic correlates. Finally, accident liability was predicted by self-reported tendency to commit highway-code violations, but not by tendency to make errors due to failures of judgement (i.e.. mistakes) or lapses. Aggressive violations were significantly related to involvement in speeding convictions and law-breaking whilst highway-code violations were related to speeding convictions only.",Accident; analysis and prevention,2002 May,England,2002,00

To address this subject, they analyzed QOL, as measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General questionnaire (FACT-G), Spanish Version 4, and depicted the complex relations among physical, psychological, social, and cultural factors, including spirituality. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used with a sample of 309 patients with cancer. The influence of several possible determinants was first studied by univariate regression analysis. Variables showing an association were included in a forward stepwise multivariate regression model. RESULTS: Five regression models were studied, for the FACT-G total score and its four subscales. Five variables explained 32.1% of the variance of the FACT-G total score: tumor stage, spiritual well-being, income, mood disorders, and mode of questionnaire administration. The type and relevance of the explanatory variables differed among the various dimensions of QOL. CONCLUSIONS: The authors underlined the entwining of biologic, psychosocial, and spiritual factors as determinants of the QOL of patients with cancer, thus supporting the multidimensional definition and modeling of the construct.",Cancer,2005 Mar 1,United States,2005,00

23008679,Perception of body weight among saudi school children.,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to explore the perception of body weight among students in schools in Jeddah City and identify the main determinants of self-perceived obesity, weight management goals and practices. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from a sample of Saudi school children of 42 boys' and 42 girls' schools in Jeddah city during the month of April 2000. Personal interviews were conducted to collect data on socio-demographic factors, food choices, perception of body weight, weight management goals and weight management practices, as well as the actual measurement of weight and height. Students were asked about their perception of their body weight [responses included: very underweight (thin), slightly underweight, about right weight, slightly overweight and grossly overweight (obese)]. Proportion, prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for an attempt to lose weight and weight management practices. RESULTS: The distribution of self-perception of body size was nearly similar to the measured body mass index (BMI) classification except for the overweight students, where 21.3% perceived themselves, as slightly overweight and 5.5% as very overweight although 13.4% were actually overweight and 13.5% were obese by BMI standards. Approximately half the students took at least 3 pieces of fruit or fruit juice servings, and a third ate at least 4 vegetable servings per day. A third of the students managed to lose weight. This coincides with the proportion of those actually overweight and obese. Around 28.0% of the students ate less food, fat or calories, 31.0% took exercise and 17.6% were engaged in vigorous exercise to lose weight or prevent weight gain. Staying for at least 24 hours without food which is a potentially harmful means of weight control was practiced by 10.0% of students. Females were less likely than males to be overweight and obese but more likely to perceive themselves as grossly overweight and more likely to try to lose weight. Factors associated with efforts to lose weight by eating less fat or fewer calories were older age, high social class, being actually obese and perceiving oneself as being obese. Staying for at least 24 hours without eating was mainly practiced by females, older age groups, and the actually obese. Exercise was done mainly by the older age groups, those with educated and highly educated mothers, obese and perceiving oneself as being obese. Vigorous exercise was mainly performed by males, younger age groups, taking < 3 pieces of fruit or fruit juice servings per day, eating < 4 vegetable servings per day, and those perceiving themselves as obese. CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity are prevalent among our youth and not all obese have a correct image of their body size. Highly recommended are intervention programs of education on nutrition starting in childhood through school age to promote and ensure healthy food choices, improve student's awareness of ideal body size and clinical obesity, encourage physical exercise but discourage potentially harmful weight control measures.",Journal of family & community medicine,2002 Sep,India,2002,00
19333738,Behavioral determinants as predictors of return to work after long-term sickness absence: an application of the theory of planned behavior.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective, longitudinal cohort study was to analyze the association between the three behavioral determinants of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) model--attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy--and the time to return-to-work (RTW) in employees on long-term sick leave. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 926 employees on sickness absence (maximum duration of 12 weeks). The employees filled out a baseline questionnaire and were subsequently followed until the tenth month after listing sick. The TPB-determinants were measured at baseline. Work attitude was measured with a Dutch language version of the Work Involvement Scale. Subjective norm was measured with a self-structured scale reflecting a person's perception of social support and social pressure. Self-efficacy was measured with the three subscales of a standardised Dutch version of the general self-efficacy scale (ALCOS): willingness to expend effort in completing the behavior, persistence in the face of adversity, and willingness to initiate behavior. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify behavioral determinants of the time to RTW. RESULTS: Median time to RTW was 160 days. In the univariate analysis, all potential prognostic factors were significantly associated (P < 0.15) with time to RTW: work attitude, social support, and the three subscales of self-efficacy. The final multivariate model with time to RTW as the predicted outcome included work attitude, social support and willingness to expend effort in completing the behavior as significant predictive factors. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, longitudinal cohort-study showed that work attitude, social support and willingness to expend effort in completing the behavior are significantly associated with a shorter time to RTW in employees on long-term sickness absence. This provides suggestive evidence for the relevance of behavioral characteristics in the prediction of duration of sickness absence. It may be a promising approach to address the behavioral determinants in the development of interventions focusing on RTW in employees on long-term sick leave.",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,2009 Jun,Netherlands,2009,00
14498934,"The determinants of health: structure, context and agency.","The concept of social structure is one of the main building blocks of the social sciences, but it lacks any precise technical definition within general sociological theory. This paper reviews the way in which the concept has been deployed within medical sociology, arguing that in recent times it has been used primarily as a frame for the sociological interpretation of health inequalities and their social determinants. It goes on to examine the contribution that medical sociologists have made to the debate over health inequalities, giving particular attention to contributions to Sociology of Health and Illness. These have often provided a focus for discussions outside or critical of the mainstream debates that have been driven primarily by epidemiologists. The paper reviews some of the main points of criticism of epidemiological approaches, focusing in particular on the methodological constraints that limit the capacity of epidemiologists to develop more theoretically satisfactory accounts of the inter-relationships of social structure, context and agency in their impact on health and well being. Some recent examples from the Journal of more theoretically innovative and analytically fine-grained approaches to understanding the impact of social structure on health are then explored. The paper concludes with an argument for a more historically-informed analysis of the relationships between social structure and health, using the knowledgeable narratives of people in places as a window onto those relationships.",Sociology of health & illness,2003,England,2003,00
18189306,"Determinants of breast cancer knowledge among newly diagnosed, low-income, medically underserved women with breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Among women with breast cancer (BC), greater BC knowledge has been associated with greater participation in treatment decision-making, patient satisfaction, and survival. The objective of this study was to identify modifiable determinants associated with BC knowledge. METHODS: Data were collected from a telephone survey of medically underserved women with BC in California (n = 909). The dependent variable for analysis was BC knowledge. The modifiable determinants that were assessed included 1) physician-patient discussion of BC topics, 2) receipt of written BC-related material, 3) self-efficacy in interacting with physicians, 4) physician emotional support, 5) discussions with a BC survivor, and 6) office visit support by relatives/friends. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the effect of those determinants on BC knowledge while controlling for socioeconomic factors, clinical characteristics, and treatment received. RESULTS: The average knowledge score was 6.9 (standard deviation, 2.3; range, 0-10). In multivariate analyses among women with less physician emotional support, those with the greatest self-efficacy had higher knowledge scores than those with the least self-efficacy (8.2 vs 5.4; P < .001). For women with low self-efficacy, those with more physician emotional support had higher knowledge scores than those with less physician emotional support when the analysis was controlled for confounding factors (6.3 vs 5.4; P < .001); physician information-giving had no effect on BC knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggested significant associations of patient self-efficacy and physician emotional support with BC knowledge; physician emotional support appeared to be more important than physician informational support. Further research will be needed to investigate whether interventions that target these 2 domains may be effective in increasing BC knowledge in disadvantaged populations.",Cancer,2008 Mar 1,United States,2008,00
17962839,[Heath and political regimes: presidential or parliamentary government for Colombia?].,"OBJECTIVE: Changing the presidential regime for a parliamentarian one is currently be-ing discussed in Colombia. This preliminary study explores the potential effects on health of both presidential and parliamentary regimes by using world-wide data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An ecological study was undertaken using countries from which comparable information concerning life-expectancy at birth, political regime, economic development, inequality in income, social capital (as measured by general-ised trust or Corruption Perceptions Index), political rights, civil freedom and cultural diversity could be obtained. Life-expectancy at birth and macro-determinants were compared between both political regimes. The co-relationship between these macro-determinants was estimated and the relationship between political regimen and life-expectancy at birth was estimated using robust regression. RESULTS: Crude analysis revealed that parliamentary countries have greater life-expectancy at birth than countries having a presidential regime. Significant co-relationships between all macro-determinants were observed. No differential effects were observed between both political regimes regarding life-expectancy at birth in multiple robust regressions. DISCUSSION: There is no evidence that presidential or parliamentary regimes provide greater levels of health for the population. It is suggested that public health policies be focused on other macro-determinants having more known effects on health, such as income inequality.","Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)",2007 Apr-Jun,Colombia,2007,00
10894258,"Factors affecting contraceptive use in women seeking pregnancy tests: Missouri, 1997.","CONTEXT: If the national health objective of reducing unintended pregnancy is to be met, a better understanding is needed of barriers to women's acquisition and use of contraceptives. METHODS: A sample of 311 Missouri women who were seeking pregnancy tests in public health department clinics in 1997 and who said their potential pregnancy was unintended were asked about potential barriers to family planning. Factors affecting contraceptive use among these women were examined by frequency of use, insurance status, education and race. RESULTS: In general, the women mostly disagreed that particular factors were potential barriers to contraceptive use. For only one item--worry over the potential side effects of the hormonal injectable contraceptive--did a majority agree or strongly agree that it was a barrier to method use in the previous six months. Women who used a contraceptive infrequently were more likely than frequent users to identify 33 factors in nine areas as being potential barriers to contraceptive use. These ranged from factors involving access to services and condom-specific issues to cost-related concerns, social norms, pregnancy denial, embarrassment over discussing or obtaining birth control, worry about side effects and experience with forced sex, among others. Perceived barriers differed somewhat by insurance status in the areas of access, embarrassment, side effects and forced sex. For example, women with no insurance coverage reported a higher level of agreement that transportation problems had hindered their access to a clinic than did women with private insurance. Level of education affected agreement only in the area of side effects, with more-educated women expressing greater concern about side effects than less-educated women. The respondent's race affected agreement in six areas: access, social norms, pregnancy denial, embarrassment, forced sex and other miscellaneous concerns, such as condom use and relationship issues. CONCLUSION: Better education and improved access to and delivery of services might address several factors affecting contraceptive use that are associated with unintended pregnancy. Some barriers, however, such as those related to self-efficacy, self-esteem and fatalistic attitudes about pregnancy, would be much harder for family planning providers to resolve.",Family planning perspectives,2000 May-Jun,United States,2000,00
19484638,"Social context, sexual risk perceptions and stigma: HIV vulnerability among male sex workers in Mombasa, Kenya.","Knowledge about sexual practices and life experiences of men having sex with men in Kenya, and indeed in East Africa, is limited. Although the impact of male same-sex HIV transmission in Africa is increasingly acknowledged, HIV prevention initiatives remain focused largely on heterosexual and mother-to-child transmission. Using data from ten in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions (36 men), this analysis explores social and behavioural determinants of sexual risks among men who sell sex to men in Mombasa, Kenya. Analysis showed a range and variation of men by age and social class. First male same-sex experiences occurred for diverse reasons, including love and pleasure, as part of sexual exploration, economic exchange and coercion. Condom use is erratic and subject to common constraints, including notions of sexual interference and motivations of clients. Low knowledge compounds sexual risk taking, with a widespread belief that the risk of HIV transmission through anal sex is lower than vaginal sex. Traditional family values, stereotypes of abnormality, gender norms and cultural and religious influences underlie intense stigma and discrimination. This information is guiding development of peer education programmes and sensitisation of health providers, addressing unmet HIV prevention needs. Such changes are required throughout Eastern Africa.","Culture, health & sexuality",2009 Nov,England,2009,00
12158990,Active population growth and immigration hypotheses in Western Europe.,"The paper examines, in respect of 12 Western European countries over a period of 20 years, the widely held view that any decline in their working population should be offset by greater reliance on immigrant labor. This research, based on demographic projections and forecasts regarding labor market participation rates by age and sex for each of the countries concerned, focuses on the two most likely scenarios. It appears that only Italy will be faced with a fall in its working population. All other western countries will either maintain the same level or, more generally, see their workforce grow substantially. Accordingly, the authors may safely assert that there is no risk of a shortage of workers between now and the year 2020, and that an increasing supply of labor will render reliance on a greater influx of immigrant workers unnecessary. The second part analyses changes in the structure of the demand for labor. The authors deal chiefly with the phenomenon of the concentration of foreign manpower in each sector, its flexibility and mobility in a context of unemployment, as well as the impact of new technologies and globalization on the main determinants of international migration of labor.",European journal of population = Revue europeenne de demographie,2000 Mar,Netherlands,2000,00
11580765,"Social functioning, psychological functioning, and quality of life in epilepsy.","PURPOSE: Part of our research intended to explain ""Quality of Life"" (QoL) differences between people with epilepsy. To this end, a series of already existing generic and disease-specific health status measures were used. In this study, they were considered as determinants of people's QoL, whereas QoL itself was conceived as a general ""value judgment"" about one's life. METHODS: From the records of four outpatient clinics, 210 persons with epilepsy were randomly selected. During their visit to the outpatient clinic, they completed a questionnaire assessing, among other things, health perceptions and social and psychological functioning. Additional information about their medical and psychosocial status was gathered from the patient files. Data were analysed by using a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: In decreasing order of importance, ""psychological distress,"" ""loneliness,"" ""adjustment and coping,"" and ""stigma perception"" appeared to contribute most significantly to the outcome QoL as judged by the patients themselves, regardless of their physical status. In the final model, none of the clinical variables (onset, seizure frequency, side effects of antiepileptic drugs) contributed significantly anymore to the patients' ""quality-of-life judgement."" Apparently the effect of other variables such as seizure frequency and health perceptions, medication and side effects, life fulfillment, self-esteem, and mastery is mediated by these variables. CONCLUSIONS: Because all of the variance in QoL of the patients was explained by the psychosocial variables included in this study, health professionals should be aware of the significance of the psychosocial functioning of the patients and the role it plays in the achievement of a good QoL. Both informal and professional support may be an adjunct to conventional treatment. In future research, this issue should be given high priority.",Epilepsia,2001 Sep,United States,2001,00
15362476,What do Canadian seniors say supports their quality of life? Findings from a national participatory research study.,"BACKGROUND: A national project investigated seniors' perceptions of the influences upon their quality of life. The seven participating cities were Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, Toronto, Regina, Vancouver and Whitehorse. The project focussed on policy decisions affecting the quality of life of seniors. It was a participatory study in which seniors controlled the direction and shape of the project in each city. METHODS: Focus groups and individual interviews with seniors and stakeholders. Data analysis used qualitative methods to see the world through the eyes of participants. Each project was committed to hearing the voices of seniors and their views on which issues were affecting the quality of their lives. RESULTS: Across the seven cities, seniors highlighted access to information, health care, housing, income security, safety and security, social contacts and networks, and transportation as key issues that affect the quality of life of seniors in Canada. CONCLUSIONS: The findings affirm the value of participatory activities that involve seniors working with other sectors as a productive policy-informing approach. The Seniors' Quality of Life projects demonstrate the conceptual power of the determinants of health perspective to understand seniors' quality of life issues. While seniors considered health care to be a continuing concern, they also recognized socio-economic issues as significantly affecting the quality of their lives.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2004 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,2004,00
17466064,Inequity in the provision of and access to palliative care for cancer patients. Results from the Italian survey of the dying of cancer (ISDOC).,"BACKGROUND: The palliative services and programs have been developed with different intensity and modalities in all countries. Several studies have reported that a geographic variation in the availability and provision of palliative care services between and within countries exists, and that a number of vulnerable groups are excluded from these services. This survey estimates the distribution of places of care for Italian cancer patients during the last three months of their lives, the proportion receiving palliative care support at home and in hospital, and the factors associated with the referral to palliative care services. METHODS: This is a mortality follow-back survey of 2,000 cancer deaths identified with a 2-stage probability sample, representative of the whole country. Information on patients' experience was gathered from the non-professional caregiver through an interview, using an adapted version of the VOICES questionnaire. A section of the interview concerned the places of care and the palliative care services provided to patients. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the determinants of palliative care service use. RESULTS: Valid interviews were obtained for 67% of the identified caregivers (n = 1,271). Most Italian cancer patients were cared for at home (91%) or in hospital (63%), but with substantial differences within the country. Only 14% of Italian cancer patients cared for at home against 20% of those admitted to hospital, received palliative care support. The principal determinants identified for receiving these service were: an extended interval between diagnosis and death (P = 0.01) and the caregiver's high educational level (P = 0.01) for patients at home; the low patient's age (P < 0.01) and the caregiver's high educational level (P = 0.01) for patients in hospital. CONCLUSION: In Italy palliative care services are not equally available across the country. Moreover, access to the palliative care services is strongly associated with socio demographic characteristics of the patients and their caregivers. Italian Policy-makers need to equalise palliative care provision and access across the country to meet the needs of all cancer patients.",BMC public health,2007 Apr 27,England,2007,00
19948599,Geographic disparities in access to the medical home among US CSHCN.,"OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined geographic disparities in medical home access among US children with special health care needs (CSHCN) aged 0 to 17 years. METHODS: The 2005-2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs was used to estimate prevalence and odds of not having a medical home and 5 component outcomes according to state. Logistic regression was used to examine individual-level and state-level determinants of access. RESULTS: Medical home access varied substantially across geographic areas. CSHCN in Alaska, Arizona, Washington, DC, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, and Virginia had at least 50% higher adjusted odds of not having a medical home than CSHCN in Iowa. The adjusted prevalence of CSHCN lacking a medical home varied from a low of 46% in Iowa and Ohio to a high of 59% in Alaska and 61% in New Jersey. CSHCN in several western and southwestern states experienced greater problems with access to a personal doctor/nurse, a usual source of care, specialty care referrals, care coordination, and family-centered care. Adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, household socioeconomic status, language use, insurance coverage, and functional limitation reduced state disparities in access. CSHCN in states with higher immigrant and non-English-speaking populations had significantly lower medical home access. Increases in state health care expenditure and infrastructure and Medicaid/State Children's Health Insurance Program eligibility were associated with increased access to a personal doctor/nurse. CONCLUSIONS: Although individual-level sociodemographic and state-level health policy variables are important predictors of access, substantial geographic disparities remain, with CSHCN in several western and northeastern states at high risk of not having a medical home.",Pediatrics,2009 Dec,United States,2009,00
16904413,Contraceptive failures and determinants of emergency contraception use.,"OBJECTIVES: Two years after emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) were made available without prescription in France, we investigated the determinants of ECP use in a representative sample of women at risk for unintended pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This study is based on data collected from a population-based cohort exploring contraceptive practices and abortion (N=2863). RESULTS: Among the 706 women at risk for unintended pregnancy during the first year of follow-up (2001), only 11.1% used ECPs. Women in stable relationships or using the same contraceptive method during the year were less likely to use ECPs than other women. The study also demonstrates that detailed knowledge of ECPs increases the probability of its subsequent use. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low frequency of ECP use in cases of unintended pregnancy risk, these results suggest that information campaigns should be targeted not only at women with irregular contraceptive practices but also at women who experience errors in the use of their regular contraceptive method.",Contraception,2006 Sep,United States,2006,00
15328302,Determinants of forward stage transitions: a Delphi study.,"Insight into stage transition determinants is necessary to develop and evaluate stage-tailored health-promoting interventions. A three-round Delphi study among stages of change researchers was conducted to make an inventory of opinions and examine agreement on determinants of forward transitions between Transtheoretical stages of change. In the first round, 10 experts completed an electronic questionnaire with open-ended questions about potential determinants for each stage transition. In the second round, a structured electronic questionnaire based on the first round results was sent to authors of scientific papers on stages of change, published between 1995 and May 2002. In the third round, participants were presented feedback about the second round and were asked to re-rate their answers based on the information provided. Results showed that participants agreed on various transition determinants, but that determinants were not always stage-specific, e.g. control-related issues and social support were identified as determinants of all transitions from contemplation to maintenance. The results further showed lower consensus about determinants of earlier stage transitions than about determinants of later stage transitions. The Delphi study identified hypotheses worthy of further examination in longitudinal observational and experimental studies.",Health education research,2005 Apr,England,2005,00
19473152,Biomarkers of periodontal inflammation in the Australian adult population.,"BACKGROUND: Several inflammatory biomarkers are implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and C-reactive protein (CRP). This study investigated the presence of these factors in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and their relationship to clinical and social determinants of periodontitis in the Australian population. METHODS: Equal numbers of periodontitis cases and non-cases were sampled during oral epidemiologic examination in the National Survey of Adult Oral Health. GCF was sampled from four sites where probing pocket depth (PPD) and recession were recorded. From these, IL-1beta and CRP were quantified by ELISA and the log amount of GCF IL-1beta (pg) per person and the proportion of adults with detectable CRP was computed. RESULTS: Periodontitis cases (n = 511) had significantly higher levels of IL-1beta and CRP than non-cases (n = 562). PPD, clinical attachment loss, plaque and gingivitis indices were positively associated with elevated levels of both biomarkers. Levels of both were positively associated with age, low socio-economic position and non-Australian birth. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IL-1beta and CRP in GCF are associated with periodontal disease parameters within the Australian population. The levels of both biomarkers are influenced by age, education and eligibility for public dental care.",Australian dental journal,2009 Jun,Australia,2009,00
19852832,Using theories of behaviour to understand transfusion prescribing in three clinical contexts in two countries: development work for an implementation trial.,"BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion is an essential part of healthcare and can improve patient outcomes. However, like most therapies, it is also associated with significant clinical risks. In addition, there is some evidence of overuse. Understanding the potential barriers and enablers to reduced prescribing of blood products will facilitate the selection of intervention components likely to be effective, thereby reducing the number of costly trials evaluating different implementation strategies. Using a theoretical basis to understand behaviours targeted for change will contribute to a 'basic science' relating to determinants of professional behaviour and how these inform the selection of techniques for changing behaviour. However, it is not clear which theories of behaviour are relevant to clinicians' transfusing behaviour. The aim of this study is to use a theoretical domains framework to identify relevant theories, and to use these theories to identify factors that predict the decision to transfuse. METHODS: The study involves two steps: interview study and questionnaire study. Using a previously identified framework, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with clinicians to elicit their views about which factors are associated with waiting and further monitoring the patient rather than transfusing red blood cells. Interviews will cover the following theoretical domains: knowledge; skills; social/professional role and identity; beliefs about capabilities; beliefs about consequences; motivation and goals; memory, attention, and decision processes; environmental context and resources; social influences; emotion; behavioural regulation; nature of the behaviour. The interviews will take place independently in Canada and the UK and involve two groups of physicians in each country (UK: adult and neonatal intensive care physicians; Canada: intensive care physicians and orthopaedic surgeons). We will: analyse interview transcript content to select relevant theoretical domains; use consensus processes to map these domains on to theories of behaviour; develop questionnaires based on these theories; and mail them to each group of physicians in the two countries. From our previous work, it is likely that the theories will include: theory of planned behaviour, social cognitive theory and the evidence-based strategy, implementation intention. The questionnaire data will measure predictor variables (theoretical constructs) and outcome variables (intention and clinical decision), and will be analysed using multiple regression analysis. We aim to achieve 150 respondents in each of the four groups for each postal survey.",Implementation science : IS,2009 Oct 24,England,2009,00
19142700,Within-species differences in primate social structure: evolution of plasticity and phylogenetic constraints.,"Primate socioecological studies have attempted to derive general frameworks using the average behavioural traits of species or genera to place them into categories. However, with the accumulation of primate studies, it is timely to place more emphasis on understanding within-species variation in social structure. In this review we have four objectives. First, we examine within-species variation in the potential determinants of social structure, including diet, demography, predation and infanticide, and document considerable variation. Second, we present case studies of within-species variation in social structure to illustrate the potential magnitude of this variation. For example, there are cases within a single interbreeding population where multi-male, uni-male, fission-fusion and monogamous groups are found. Third, by examining widespread primate lineages that occur in a variety of habitats, we note that there are differences in the magnitude of variation in social structures across different lineages and as a result we consider phylogenetic constraints on phenotypic variation in social structure. Finally, we reflect on the implications of extensive variation in social structure. We suggest that primate social structure will represent a combination of adaptation to present-day environment and phylogenetic inertia. To advance our understanding of the relative contribution of phylogeny versus ecology we propose two approaches. One approach is to compare groups in the same interbreeding population that inhabit different ecological conditions. Any differences that are found can be attributed to ecological differences, since phylogeny should not play a role within a single population. The second approach is to study distantly related species that have similar social structures to illustrate how similar ecological pressures might be operating to select for parallel social structures.",Primates; journal of primatology,2009 Jan,Japan,2009,00
15584467,[School-based education strategies to promote fruit and vegetable consumption: the Pro Children Project].,"Available population data suggest that a high proportion of European children and young people eat less fruit and vegetables than desirable. School based health promotion strategies fostering healthy eating practices and regular physical activity has the potential for a major impact on health and wellbeing during childhood and later stages in life. The aim of Pro-Children project is to estimate the consumption of fruit and vegetables as well as its main determinants among 11 year old European children and their families. It also aims to develop and assess the effectiveness of a school-based intervention program to promote adequate consumption levels of fruit and vegetables among school children. In the first phase of the project, cross-sectional studies were carried out on random population samples in nine European countries. The study protocol included assessment of fruit and vegetable consumption and a questionnaire to ascertain key determinants. A school-based intervention program was designed based on the Attitude, Social Influence and Self-Efficacy model (ASE). Theoretically similar but culturally relevant interventions were designed to be tested in Norway, The Netherlands and Spain during two school years. Each intervention site follows-up 10 intervention schools implementing the program and 10 control schools. Intervention planning and design followed an intervention mapping procedure. Key behaviours and determinants to be addressed through the intervention were identified in order to develop a matrix of educational objectives. The provision of fruit and vegetables in the school is an outstanding element. Program activities include guided classroom activities, computer tailored messages for children, activities to be completed at home with the family and family targeted specific actions. Additionally, optional components for community reinforcement include mass media, school health services participation and implication of grocery stores in the project. Despite cultural and social diversity, common school-based strategies to increase fruit and vegetable consumption among children are feasible across Europe. Understanding specific situations will enhance implementation and gain support.",Archivos latinoamericanos de nutricion,2004 Jun,Venezuela,2004,00
11900188,The case for more active policy attention to health promotion.,"Until recently, when anthrax triggered a concern about preparedness in the public health infrastructure, U.S. health policy and health spending had been dominated by a focus on payment for medical treatment. The fact that many of the conditions driving the need for treatment are preventable ought to draw attention to policy opportunities for promoting health. Following a brief review of the determinants of population health-genetic predispositions, social circumstances, environmental conditions, behavioral patterns, and medical care-this paper explores some of the factors inhibiting policy attention and resource commitment to the nonmedical determinants of population health and suggests approaches for sharpening the public policy focus to encourage disease prevention and health promotion.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2002 Mar-Apr,United States,2002,00
17307954,Gender and health promotion: a multisectoral policy approach.,"Women and men are different as regards their biology, the roles and responsibilities that society assigns to them and their position in the family and community. These factors have a great influence on causes, consequences and management of diseases and ill-health and on the efficacy of health promotion policies and programmes. This is confirmed by evidence on male-female differences in cause-specific mortality and morbidity and exposure to risk factors. Health promoting interventions aimed at ensuring safe and supportive environments, healthy living conditions and lifestyles, community involvement and participation, access to essential facilities and to social and health services need to address these differences between women and men, boys and girls in an equitable manner in order to be effective. The aim of this paper is to (i) demonstrate that health promotion policies that take women's and men's differential biological and social vulnerability to health risks and the unequal power relationships between the sexes into account are more likely to be successful and effective compared to policies that are not concerned with such differences, and (ii) discuss what is required to build a multisectoral policy response to gender inequities in health through health promotion and disease prevention. The requirements discussed in the paper include i) the establishment of joint commitment for policy within society through setting objectives related to gender equality and equity in health as well as health promotion, ii) an assessment and analysis of gender inequalities affecting health and determinants of health, iii) the actions needed to tackle the main determinants of those inequalities and iv) documentation and dissemination of effective and gender sensitive policy interventions to promote health. In the discussion of these key policy elements, we use illustrative examples of good practices from different countries around the world.",Health promotion international,2006 Dec,England,2006,00
14678314,Frequency and determinants of formal respite service use among caregivers of children with cerebral palsy in Ontario.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of formal respite services among caregivers of children with cerebral palsy in Ontario and discuss the factors that may contribute to respite use and non-use. METHODS: A total of 468 caregivers were interviewed about their experience with formal respite services. Interviews were part of a larger cross-sectional study on caregiver health. Caregivers were asked about their knowledge of formal respite services; their use of formal respite services in the past year; financial implications relating to formal respite use; perceived barriers to formal respite service use; and reasons for not using formal respite services (if applicable). RESULTS: Nearly half (46%) of caregivers in the sample reported using respite services in the past year. Most of the caregivers who used respite services used more than one source of respite, had services provided in their home, often for less than 1 day, and reported using them more than six times. The most commonly cited reason for using formal respite services was for a planned break. Many factors influenced caregivers' use of formal respite services. Caregivers who had a child with a lower level of function, with multiple additional conditions, or who was male, were more likely to use formal respite services. Although over 90% of caregivers indicated that respite use is beneficial for both their family and child, over 60% reported facing many barriers while attempting to access respite services. CONCLUSION: Results from this cross-sectional study indicate that caregivers who used respite services used them frequently for breaks from caregiving. Caregivers described facing many barriers while attempting to access respite services therefore to improve caregiver's experience with respite services, strategies are suggested.","Child: care, health and development",2004 Jan,England,2004,00
20024758,Gender differences in unsafe sexual behavior among young people in urban Mali.,"We developed gender-specific explanatory models for unsafe sexual behavior among unmarried young people living in urban West Africa using a culturally adapted instrument which addresses personal, relational and socio-cognitive factors. Data were collected on condom use and number of sexual partners, and on their potential determinants, using in-person interviews on a heterogeneous sample of in-school and out-of-school young women (n=185) and (n=214) men who reported ever having had sexual intercourse. Recruitment was done at various sites in 21 randomly selected neighborhoods in Bamako. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to identify determinants of lack of condom at last sex and having more than one partner in the last six months and to test for interactions with gender. Similar percentages of men (40%) and women (46%) reported not using a condom at last sex. However, more men (64%) reported multiple partnering in the last six months than women (32%). Our findings suggest that the context of sexual debut, social status, relation to peers and family as well as attitudinal, normative and behavioral control constructs may influence young men and women's sexual behavior, but that pathways leading to unsafe sex are different across genders. Our findings also show that factors associated with condom use and sexual partnering are distinct. Earlier sexual debut seems to be risk-inducing in women while risk-reducing in men. Poor communication with peers and receiving money from sexual partner were associated with lack of condom use in women. High behavioral control was associated with fewer sexual partners in men. Determinants of unsafe sexual behavior were found at the social, interpersonal and individual levels for both men and women, but notable gender differentials existed. These findings underscore the importance of addressing gender as a crucial factor shaping HIV-risk profiles.",AIDS care,2009 Aug,England,2009,00
12772438,The psychosocial determinants of hypertension.,"AIM: To present currently available evidence on the role that adverse psychosocial factors play in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The specific objectives of the review were to (1) provide a picture of what is known about the relationship between psychosocial factors and hypertension, (2) summarize the major methodological and conceptual pitfalls, and (3) identify gaps in the literature and suggest areas for future research. DATA SYNTHESIS: The scope of the literature review was adults and the literature published since 1990 (acknowledging that some articles published earlier would need to be taken into account). A number of journal searches were carried out. They included Medline, PsychInfo, and SocioFile, with keywords, such as hypertension, blood pressure, psychosocial, psychological, social, acculturation, occupation, socio-economic status, social class, education, depression, anger, and anxiety. The search included articles related to hypertension in developed countries and was limited to studies in the English language. CONCLUSION: A growing body of evidence supports the thesis that psychosocial factors play a role in the pathogenesis for hypertension.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2003 Feb,Netherlands,2003,00
12664733,The Sandyford Initiative: creating added value to health and health care.,"The Sandyford Initiative in Glasgow brings together Family Planning, Genitourinary Medicine and the Centre for Women's Health in a new partnership which aims to provide integrated health and social care in a manner which reflects a social model of health. The Steve Retson Project for Gay Men's Sexual Health is also situated within the Sandyford, providing clinical services within the context of a social model of health. The Initiative is managed by the Greater Glasgow Primary Care NHS Trust but has been developed as a result of joint working between three main services, Greater Glasgow Health Board, Glasgow City Council and a number of voluntary organisations. By working to a social model of health, the intention is to ensure that the detection and management of health problems takes into account the social and economic determinants of health and that the provision and practice of health care reflects the social needs of the user. As such the Initiative is expected to make a significant contribution to the sexual health of men and women and the general and reproductive health of women in the Greater Glasgow area and beyond. The core of the Initiative is housed in premises tailored to the needs of the services and their users although satellite services are being planned. In addition to the core clinical and non-clinical care there are services designed to respond to the needs of specific groups such as young people, black and ethnic minority communities and disabled people, in order to improve access and uptake by previously marginalised groups. It is recognised that often the relationship between health and social service providers and their users becomes strained. Implementation of the Sandyford Initiative is intended to inspire confidence and contribute effectively to improving health and managing complex health problems.",Health bulletin,2001 Jul,Scotland,2001,00
22029495,Acculturation and its determinants among adult immigrants in France.,"The present study pursued three aims. First, it sought to determine the distribution of types of identification among adult immigrants in France; second, it investigated certain determinants that might contribute to the emergence of exclusively French or ethnic identifications; and third, it attempted to assess the outcomes of French or ethnic identification strategies for well-being. Participants of the study were 6211 adult immigrants in France, aged between 45 and 70 years (M = 55.8, SD = 7.21), 53.6% males. Findings revealed that participants' dominant identification style of belonging was either French (n = 2758, 44.4%) or home country/ethnic group affiliation (n = 1899, 30.6%), with a greater tendency towards the former. In relation to the study second question, it was found that lower levels of education and involvement with French society, higher degrees of religiosity, and shorter lengths of residence in France were positively connected with home country/ethnic group identification as against French and vice versa. Stronger feelings of being settled in France and a command of French, and lower degrees of involvement with the initial national/ethnic community, were associated with a significant decrease in the likelihood of home country/ethnic group identification as against French and vice versa. While respondents' personal experiences of discrimination in home country/ethnic group before migration to France predicted a lower likelihood of home country/ethnic group identification compared to French and vice versa, immigrants' reports of being discriminated against in France had no significant effect on identification choices. Findings revealed also that those identifying with their home country/ethnic group recorded relatively higher degrees of maladjustment than those asserting a French identification.",International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,2009 Jun,England,2009,00
16078903,Do occupation and work conditions really matter? A longitudinal analysis of psychological distress experiences among Canadian workers.,"This study analyses the relationship between occupation, work conditions and the experience of psychological distress within a model encompassing the stress promoted by constraints-resources embedded in macrosocial structures (occupational structure), structures of daily life (workplace, family, social networks outside the workplace) and agent personality (demography, physical health, psychological traits, life habits, stressful childhood events). Longitudinal data were derived from Statistics Canada's National Population Health Survey and comprised 6,359 workers nested in 471 occupations, followed four times between 1994-1995 and 2000-2001. Discrete time survival multilevel regressions were conducted on first and repeated episodes of psychological distress. Results showed that 42.9 per cent of workers had reported one episode of psychological distress and 18.7 per cent had done so more than once. Data supported the model and challenged the results of previous studies. The individual's position in the occupational structure plays a limited role when the structures of daily life and agent personality are accounted for. In the workplace, job insecurity and social support are important determinants, but greater decision authority increases the risk of psychological distress. Workplace constraints-resources are not moderated either by the other structures of daily life or by agent personality.",Sociology of health & illness,2005 Jul,England,2005,00
16273992,Subjective appraisal of Alzheimer's disease caregiving: the role of self-efficacy and depressive symptoms in the experience of burden.,"Most studies investigating correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver burden have focused on the role of objective factors as opposed to subjective factors. Although objective variables (e.g., caregiver age, patient dementia severity, functional status) have been shown to be significantly associated with burden, the correlations generally are modest and explain relatively little of the variability in caregiver outcomes. Moreover, many of these objective variables are not modifiable and are of limited use in the development of caregiver interventions. Thus, there continues to be a need to identify powerful and modifiable determinants of caregiver burden. This study examined the role of two subjective factors-self-efficacy and depressive symptoms-as predictors of AD caregiver burden. Based on a sample of 80 AD caregivers, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy and depressive symptoms each had a significant independent effect on the experience of burden even after accounting for objective factors. These findings suggest that caregiver interventions aimed to reduce burden may benefit from the incorporation of specific strategies to increase self-efficacy and decrease depressive symptoms.",American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,2005 Sep-Oct,United States,2005,00
15491897,Social capital and health among the aged: comparisons between the United States and Germany.,"Through a cross-national investigation of the United States and Germany, this study examines how individual level social capital relates to the health of the elderly. Data from two national telephone surveys conducted in Germany (N=682) and the United States (N=608) with probability samples of non-institutionalized persons aged 60 and older was used. Indicators of social capital including both norms (reciprocity and civic trust) and behaviors (participation) were tested with three self-reported health indicators-overall health, depression (CES-D) and functional limitations. Housing variables and social support were controlled for in the study. Lack of reciprocity was associated with poorer self-rated health in both countries. Civic mistrust was associated with poorer self-rated health in both countries as well as with depression and functional limitations in America. Lack of participation was, in Germany, associated with poorer self-rated health and depression. The cross-national results indicate that individual-level analysis of social capital along with marco-level determinants are important for understanding the health of the elderly.",Health & place,2004 Dec,England,2004,00
12548297,The burden of anemia among women in India.,"OBJECTIVE: This research investigates the prevalence and determinants of anemia among women in Andhra Pradesh. We examined differences in anemia related to social class, urban/rural location and nutrition status body mass index (BMI). We hypothesized that rural women would have higher prevalence of anemia compared to urban women, particularly among the lower income groups, and that women with low body mass index (BMI; <18.5 kg/m(2)) would have a higher risk compared to normal or overweight women. DESIGN: The National Family Health Survey 1998/99 (NFHS-2) provides nationally representative cross-sectional survey data on women's hemoglobin status, body weight, diet, social, demographic and other household and individual level factors. Ordered logit regression analyses were applied to identify socio-economic, regional and demographic determinants of anemia. SETTING: Andhra Pradesh, a southern Indian state. SUBJECTS: A total of 4032 ever-married women aged 15-49 from 3872 households. RESULTS: Prevalence of anemia was high among all women. In all 32.4% of women had mild (100-109.99 g/l for pregnant women, 100-119.99 for non-pregnant women), 14.19% had moderate (70-99.99 g/l), and 2.2% had severe anemia (<70 g/l). Protective factors include Muslim religion, reported consumption of alcohol or pulses, and high socioeconomic status, particularly in urban areas. Poor urban women had the highest rates and odds of being anemic. Fifty-two percent of thin, 50% of normal BMI, and 41% of overweight women were anemic. CONCLUSIONS: New program strategies are needed, particularly those that improve the overall nutrition status of women of reproductive ages. This will require tailored programs across socio-economic groups and within both rural and urban areas, but particularly among the urban and rural poor.",European journal of clinical nutrition,2003 Jan,England,2003,00
18972240,Determinants of business sustainability: an ergonomics perspective.,"There is a need to integrate both macro- and micro-ergonomic approaches for the effective implementation of interventions designed to improve the root causes of problems such as work safety, quality and productivity in the enterprise system. The objective of this study was to explore from an ergonomics perspective the concept of business sustainability through optimising the worker-work environment interface. The specific aims were: (a) to assess the working conditions of a production department work process with the goal to jointly optimise work safety, quality and quantity; (b) to evaluate the enterprise-wide work process at the system level as a social entity in an attempt to trace the root causes of ergonomic issues impacting employees throughout the work process. The Work Compatibility Model was deployed to examine the experiences of workers (that is, effort, perceived risk/benefit, performance and satisfaction/dissatisfaction or psychological impact) and their associations with the complex domains of the work environment (task content, physical and non-physical work environment and conditions for learning/growth/development). This was followed by assessment of the enterprise system through detailed interviews with department managers and lead workers. A system diagnostic instrument was also constructed from information derived from the published literature to evaluate the enterprise system performance. The investigation of the production department indicated that the stress and musculoskeletal pain experienced by workers (particularly on the day shift) were derived from sources elsewhere in the work process. The enterprise system evaluation and detailed interviews allowed the research team to chart the feed-forward and feedback stress propagation loops in the work system. System improvement strategies were extracted on the basis of tacit/explicit knowledge obtained from department managers and lead workers. In certain situations concerning workplace human performance issues, a combined macro-micro ergonomic methodology is essential to solve the productivity, quality and safety issues impacting employees along the trajectory or path of the enterprise-wide work process. In this study, the symptoms associated with human performance issues in one production department work process had root causes originating in the customer service department work process. In fact, the issues found in the customer service department caused performance problems elsewhere in the enterprise-wide work process such as the traffic department. Sustainable enterprise solutions for workplace human performance require the integration of macro- and micro-ergonomic approaches.",Ergonomics,2009 Mar,England,2009,00
16423028,Pattern and severity of early childhood caries.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between selected social and behavioural variables and the pattern and severity of early childhood caries (ECC) within a community child population. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 2515 children aged 4-5 years were examined in a preschool setting using decayed, missing, filled teeth/surface (dmft/dmfs) indices and a self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding social, demographic, birth, infant feeding, oral and general health attitudes. Children with caries (847) were divided into anterior or posterior caries pattern groups and severe (dmfs score > or =6) or non-severe (dmfs score <6) caries groups. The data were analysed using a chi-square test and modelled using a logistic regression procedure. RESULTS: Significant variables associated with anterior ECC pattern were ethnicity other than Caucasian (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.4-3.1), sipping from the bottle during the day (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3-2.7), male gender (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.2) and sleeping with a bottle at night (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.2). Significant variables associated with severe ECC form were sipping from the bottle during the day (OR = 2, 95% CI = 1.4-2.8), maternal age at birth < or =24 years (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.3-2.7), ethnicity other than Caucasian (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.5) and sleeping with a bottle at night (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.2). CONCLUSIONS: Infant bottle-feeding habits (either allowing a child to sip from a bottle during the day or put to sleep at night) and ethnicity other than Caucasian were significant determinants for both anterior caries pattern and severity of ECC in 4-5-year-old Australian children.",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,2006 Feb,Denmark,2006,00
15619589,Personality psychology's comeback and its emerging symbiosis with social psychology.,"Psychology's early allegiance to behaviorism and experimental methods led many to disparage personality approaches throughout much of last century. Doubts about personality psychology's viability culminated in Mischel's assertion that measures of personality account for modest amounts of variance in behavior. In the years immediately following this critique, interest in personality research waned and many psychology departments dropped their training programs in personality. Throughout the past two decades, however, personality psychology has enjoyed a resurgence. The authors discuss several possible explanations for personality's comeback and then describe the emergence of a promising symbiosis between personality psychology and its sister discipline, social psychology. The article concludes by noting that although this emerging symbiosis is likely to continue bearing considerable theoretical fruit, the traditional distinction between personal, situational, and interactional determinants of behavior continues to be useful within appropriate contexts.",Personality & social psychology bulletin,2005 Feb,United States,2005,00
10705364,Socioeconomic factors and breast carcinoma in multicultural women.,"Breast carcinoma is the most common cancer in women in the U.S. and the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Furthermore, there are racial differences in breast carcinoma incidence, mortality, and survival rates. Social and economic factors within racial/ethnic groups are being examined as risk factors not only for breast carcinoma mortality and survival but also as determinants of the rate of incidence. Social and economic factors have been associated in the literature predominantly with cancer mortality and survival. When socioeconomic status (SES) is considered, certain studies suggest that racial disparities in breast carcinoma are smaller than when social and economic factors are examined alone, but these disparities still persist. Sources of data for this discussion include the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] program, a group of population-based cancer registries that cover up to 14% of the U.S. population. SEER reports cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates), the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and numerous articles from the scientific literature. Socioeconomic factors or SES can be considered ""cross-cutting risk factors"" (i.e., they can be related to the risk of developing breast carcinoma [rate of incidence] as well as to the risk of dying [mortality] from this disease). They also are the risk factors that ""cut across"" racial and ethnic populations. Socioeconomic factors are related to breast carcinoma mortality and survival rates in multicultural women. Racial disparities in breast carcinoma mortality and survival rates can be explained partially by stage distribution at the time of diagnosis, which may be related to SES. For example, African-American women present with more advanced stage distributions for breast carcinoma than white women. Similarly, women of lower SES present with higher stage disease than women of upper SES who present with more localized breast carcinoma. The lack of data regarding the SES of cancer patients limits our understanding of the contributions of SES to cancer incidence and mortality rates. SES appears to be related to breast carcinoma incidence, mortality, and survival rates. Breast carcinoma mortality is higher in women of lower SES. Additional research on SES, race, culture, and the relation of these factors to cancer incidence rate is needed.",Cancer,2000 Mar 1,United States,2000,00
15978130,Health information generation and utilization for informed decision-making in equitable health service management: the case of Kenya Partnership for Health program.,"CONTEXT: The Kenya Partnership for Health (KPH) program began in 1999, and is currently one of the 12 field projects participating in the WHO's 'Towards Unity for Health initiative' implemented to develop partnership synergies in support of the Primary Health Care (PHC) approach 1. CONTENT: This paper illustrates how Program-linked Information Management by Integrative-participatory Research Approach (PIMIRA) as practised under KPH has been implemented within Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya to enhance community-based health initiatives. It shows how this model is strategically being scaled-up from one community to another in the management of political, social, cultural and economic determinants (barriers and enhancers) of health. OBJECTIVE: Target rural communities in the development of a community-based health information management and feedback initiatives that can provide insights on the social, cultural, political and economic determinants of health for utilization in informed health service management. KEY FINDINGS AND ACHIEVEMENTS: 1. Cues for health seeking and health service utilization are determined by the social, cultural, political and economic factors as seen by the individual and as defined by the community but not due to the pathological nature of the illness. 2. Establishment of community-based health surveillance and health action initiatives as the best practices in transferring health as a resource that can be 'owned and guarded' by the community. 3. Establishment of Healthy Villages Initiative (HVI) through which health service delivery and scale-up can be sustained at the community level. 4. Provision of actionable health information necessary for health planning and evaluation of preventive health programs thorough PIMIRA. CONCLUSION: It has been realized that for every one person who visits a health facility for medication, there are nine others who had the same condition but sought health care from other sources including self-medication and five others who never sought health care. Innovative means of involving the community in health information management and utilization such as PIMIRA are hence the best ways of guaranteeing equitable delivery of health services that are accessible and sustainable by the community.",International journal for equity in health,2005 Jun 24,England,2005,00
17729043,"Prevalence, characteristics and causes of aggressive behaviour observed within a neurobehavioural rehabilitation service: predictors and implications for management.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and determinants of aggressive behaviour observed within a neurobehavioural unit. RESEARCH DESIGN: Statistical analysis of a database of routinely administered clinical measures, including the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified for Neurorehabilitation. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Records of aggressive behaviour shown by 108 patients over 14 days were studied. Patient characteristics were also captured using 23 items from the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago-Functional Assessment Scale. Four factors were identified: 'communication', 'cognition/function', 'neurobehavioural disability' and 'mood & self-esteem'. Relationships between patient characteristics, external factors and their interactions with aggression were examined. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Many (5548) episodes of aggression were recorded. Whilst most comprised verbal aggression, 729 physical assaults were made on others. Aggressive behaviour typically followed staff prompting or no obvious antecedent. Medical intervention was rare, most aggression was managed by staff not reinforcing this behaviour. Over 80% of physical assaults were made by people rated as having severe symptoms of neurobehavioural disability and poor communication. CONCLUSIONS: Neurobehavioural units require sufficient staff resources to engage patients in purposeful activities as these were associated with the least severe aggression. Despite increased OAS-MNR usage, a standardized methodology for investigating aggression is required to ensure compatibility between datasets.",Brain injury,2007 Aug,England,2007,00

OBJECTIVES: To describe the socioeconomic and cultural determinants, organisational structure, distinct categories, and spatial patterning of sex work in Tallinn, Estonia, and identify recent temporal changes in sex work patterns. METHODS: In-depth interviews with key informants; naturalistic observations of sex work and drug use venues, geo-mapping of sex work sites, review of media, public policy, and commissioned reports, and analyses of existing data. RESULTS: Sex work takes place in a hierarchy of locations in Tallinn ranging from elite brothels and ""love flats"" to truck stops. These sites vary in terms of their public health importance and social organisation. There are full time, part time, and intermittent male and female sex workers. Among others, the taxi driver, madam and the bartender are central roles in the organisation of sex work in Tallinn. Cell phone and internet technology enable sex work to be highly dispersed and spatially mobile. CONCLUSION: Future research and programmatic service delivery or outreach efforts should respond to the changing profile of sex work in Tallinn and its implications for STD/HIV epidemiology.",Sexually transmitted infections,2006 Oct,England,2006,00
14705266,Quality of life and colorectal cancer: a review.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe what is known of quality of life for colorectal cancer patients, to review what has been done in the Australian setting and to identify emerging directions for future research to address current gaps in knowledge. METHOD: A literature search (using Medline, Psychinfo, CINAHL and Sociological Abstracts) was conducted and 41 articles identified for review. RESULTS: Three key areas relating to quality of life in colorectal cancer patients emerged from the literature review: the definition and measurement of quality of life; predictors of quality of life; and the relationship of quality of life to survival. Results of existing studies are inconsistent in relation to quality of life over time and its relationship to survival. Small sample sizes and methodological limitations make interpretation difficult. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for large-scale, longitudinal, population-based studies describing the quality of life experienced by colorectal cancer patients and its determinants. Measurement and simultaneous adjustment for potential confounding factors would productively advance knowledge in this area, as would an analysis of the economic cost of morbidity to the community and an assessment of the cost effectiveness of proposed interventions. IMPLICATIONS: As the Australian population ages, the prevalence of colorectal cancer within the community will increase. This burden of disease presents as a priority area for public health research. An improved understanding of quality of life and its predictors will inform the development and design of supportive interventions for those affected by the disease.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2003,Australia,2003,00
17040335,Behavioral facilitation of medical treatment for headache--part I: Review of headache treatment compliance.,"Noncompliance or nonadherence with medical regimens represents a major challenge to the practice of medicine including the treatment of headache. Indeed, medication use patterns are particularly relevant to headache because of the potential for headache therapies to induce medication-overuse headache. Previous research has demonstrated that adherence to long-term medication therapy for various chronic illnesses averages only about 50%. The rate of adherence among headache patients has been found to be similarly poor. Misuse or overuse of symptomatic medication has been demonstrated to contribute to treatment failure, and one-fourth to one-half of patients are noncompliant with prophylactic headache medications and at least 40% nonadherent with appointment-keeping. Adherence declines with more frequent and complex dosing regimens, side effects, and costs, and is subject to a wide range of psychosocial influences. Subjective reports of adherence are likely not only to overestimate but also to be discordant with more objective measurements. As the first of 2 articles, this paper describes the problem of noncompliance in medical practice and reviews literature addressing compliance specific to headache management. A companion paper (Behavioral Facilitation of Medical Treatment for Headache--Part II: Theoretical Models and Behavioral Strategies for Improving Adherence) summarizes social learning models proposed to characterize the multiple determinants of adherence and guide behavioral adherence-enhancing interventions, and then presents cognitive and behavioral strategies that may facilitate treatment adherence with headache patients.",Headache,2006 Oct,United States,2006,00

19484638,"Social context, sexual risk perceptions and stigma: HIV vulnerability among male sex workers in Mombasa, Kenya.","Knowledge about sexual practices and life experiences of men having sex with men in Kenya, and indeed in East Africa, is limited. Although the impact of male same-sex HIV transmission in Africa is increasingly acknowledged, HIV prevention initiatives remain focused largely on heterosexual and mother-to-child transmission. Using data from ten in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions (36 men), this analysis explores social and behavioural determinants of sexual risks among men who sell sex to men in Mombasa, Kenya. Analysis showed a range and variation of men by age and social class. First male same-sex experiences occurred for diverse reasons, including love and pleasure, as part of sexual exploration, economic exchange and coercion. Condom use is erratic and subject to common constraints, including notions of sexual interference and motivations of clients. Low knowledge compounds sexual risk taking, with a widespread belief that the risk of HIV transmission through anal sex is lower than vaginal sex. Traditional family values, stereotypes of abnormality, gender norms and cultural and religious influences underlie intense stigma and discrimination. This information is guiding development of peer education programmes and sensitisation of health providers, addressing unmet HIV prevention needs. Such changes are required throughout Eastern Africa.","Culture, health & sexuality",2009 Nov,England,2009,00
17384957,How to improve satisfaction with hospital stay of severely injured patients.,"BACKGROUND: In the context of medical quality assurance, patient satisfaction with medical and organisational aspects of health care service is considered to be a relevant outcome of patient surveys after a stay in hospital. Within quality research, it is assumed that assessments of patient satisfaction represent a direct measure of the quality of health care received. Furthermore, there is evidence that satisfied patients demonstrate higher levels of compliance for the course of their treatment and that the probability of successful treatment completion thus considerably increases. The present analysis aims to identify determinants of satisfaction of seriously injured patients with regard to their acute hospitalisation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-one seriously injured survivors of work-related or traffic-related accidents treated in two hospitals in Cologne during the years 1996 to 2001 were sent a survey questionnaire. In addition to socio-demographic details, the survey covered the subjective evaluation of organisational and structural aspects of the acute hospitalisation and the psychosocial care provided by the medical staff. RESULTS: Employing the ""tailored design method"", a response rate of 74.4% (n = 90) was obtained. Three highly significant factors influencing the satisfaction of seriously injured patients were identified by means of logistic regression: (1) patients' perception of being involved in treatment, (2) patients' feeling of being neglected by physicians and (3) patients' perception of trust in physicians. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the perceived quality of psychosocial care proved to have a significant effect on patients' satisfaction with their hospital stay. Results of the current analysis thus indicate that psychosocial aspects of physician-patient interaction are of considerable importance in the medical care of seriously injured patients. Although this study is mainly based on subjective patient reported outcome, there is evidence that the subjective view of a patient is relevant in many aspects of medical treatment and outcome. These results already gave the motivation to develop a prospective interventional study with a training programme of communication skills to improve subjective and objective outcome parameters of severely injured patients.",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,2007 Nov,Germany,2007,00

15005732,Determinants of endotoxin levels in living environments of farmers' children and their peers from rural areas.,"BACKGROUND: Lower frequencies of asthma and hayfever have been observed in children with contact to livestock. At school age, the amount of endotoxin measured in the dust of children's mattresses is inversely related to the occurrence of atopic asthma, hayfever and atopic sensitization both in children from farming and non-farming households. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate which home and lifestyle characteristics of farm and non-farm families contribute to endotoxin levels measured in different indoor home environments. METHODS: In the framework of the Allergy and Endotoxin (ALEX) Study, endotoxin was measured in dust samples from the living room floor and the child's mattress of 319 farmers' families and 493 non-farming families, and in settled dust from stables. Endotoxin content of all dust samples was determined by a kinetic Limulus assay (Limulus-Amebocyte-Lysate test). Information about the child's activities on farms, home characteristics and cleaning behaviours was obtained from parental questionnaires. RESULTS: Endotoxin levels in stables did not predict the amount of endotoxin measured in floors or mattresses. However, a dose-dependent association between the child's activity on the farm and indoor home endotoxin levels was observed, both in farm and non-farm children. In non-farm children pet keeping and the frequency of floor cleaning were additionally associated with endotoxin levels, whereas in farm children parental farm activities, study area, time since last cleaning, the mattress type as well as younger age of the children contributed to increased microbial exposure. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that regular contact to farm animals increases indoor home endotoxin concentrations, both in farm and non-farm children, and might thus explain the protective effect of contact to livestock on atopic outcomes. To assess children's individual exposure to a microbial environment, measures of mattress dust exposure are needed as stable endotoxin concentrations were not associated with indoor home levels.",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2004 Mar,England,2004,00
17558245,The enduring impact of social factors on exercise tolerance in men attending cardiac rehabilitation.,"PURPOSE: This study explored the influence of social support on a prognostic indicator among cardiac patients, exercise tolerance. The relationship of sociodemographic factors to social support was examined, as well as the role of social support as a potential mediator between sociodemographic factors and exercise tolerance. METHODS: Archival data were collected from a sample of 254 men referred to cardiac rehabilitation. An exercise tolerance test was completed upon entry into cardiac rehabilitation, after 14 weeks, and after 9 months. RESULTS: Sociodemographic factors and social support reported upon entry into the cardiac rehabilitation program were related to initial and post-cardiac rehabilitation exercise tolerance, after controlling for admitting diagnoses, medical history, smoking, and perceived severity of illness. Overall, 28% of the variance in exercise tolerance was explained at baseline, 19% at 14 weeks, and 20% at 9 months. Specifically, older individuals had poorer exercise tolerance, whereas those with more income had better exercise tolerance. Social support was positively related to exercise tolerance at all 3 times. Older men reported less social support than younger men did, and those with more income reported more social support. However, social support did not mediate the relationship between sociodemographic factors and exercise tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the potential use of broad social factors in examining the determinants of prognostic factors for heart patients.",Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and prevention,2007 Mar-Apr,United States,2007,00

OBJECTIVES: Insight in (1) the changes in participation in vocational and leisure activities and (2) satisfaction with the current participation level of people with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) after reintegration in society. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of data from a questionnaire. SETTING: Rehabilitation centre with special department for patients with SCIs, Groningen, The Netherlands. SUBJECTS: A total of 57 patients with traumatic SCI living in the community, who were admitted to the rehabilitation centre two to 12 years before the current assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in participation in activities; current life satisfaction; support and unmet needs. RESULTS: Participation expressed in terms of hours spent on vocational and leisure activities changed to a great extent after the SCI. This was mainly determined by a large reduction of hours spent on paid work. While 60% of the respondents successfully reintegrated in work, many changes took place in the type and extent of the job. Loss of work was partially compensated with domestic and leisure activities. Sports activities were reduced substantially. The change in participation level and compensation for the lost working hours was not significantly associated with the level of SCI-specific health problems and disabilities. As was found in other studies, most respondents were satisfied with their lives. Determinants of a negative life satisfaction several years following SCI were not easily indicated. Reduced quality of life was particularly related to an unsatisfactory work and leisure situation. CONCLUSIONS: Most people with SCI in this study group were able to resume work and were satisfied with their work and leisure situation.",Spinal cord,2005 Apr,England,2005,00
12396543,"Psychosocial determinants of sexual activity and condom use intention among youth in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.","Determinants of sexual activity and intentions for condom use were examined guided by the Attitude, Social influences, and Self-efficacy (ASE) model as a theoretical framework. A total of 561 in and out-of-school youth (15-24 years) in Addis Ababa completed a self-administered questionnaire. A third of them reported sexual intercourse in the past and half of the sexually active used condoms during recent intercourse. Being out-of-school, male, aged 20-24 years, alcohol use and khat (amphetamine-like substance) consumption predicted the likelihood of engagement in sexual activity. Of these variables, however, male sex was more associated with reported condom use during recent sexual intercourse. Self-efficacy, skills, and barriers predicted 23% of the variance in intentions to use condoms. Self-efficacy was also associated with past condom use. Psychosocial constructs predicted more variations in condom use intention for males than for females. In general, self-efficacy was found to be the strongest predictor of the constructs, whereas attitude and social influences were the weakest. The study implies that HIV/AIDS prevention programmes for young people in Ethiopia need to emphasize building assertive communication skills in sexual negotiations and condom use. Minimizing the gender gap in sexual relationships forms the cornerstone for such educational strategies.",International journal of STD & AIDS,2002 Oct,England,2002,00
15345065,The Social Context of Women's Health.,"HEALTH ISSUE: The discussion of health emphasizes the importance of analyses of social determinants of health. Social determinants permit the targeting of policies towards the social factors that impair or improve health. Two broad questions are considered: (i) what do we know about the social determinants of women's health? (ii) are there gender-related differences in health problems, and how we might explain them? KEY FINDINGS: While 'sex' may be used to denote the biological difference between women and men, it is an imperfect measure of 'gender'. It is argued that a single measure cannot hope to capture the complexity of gender nor the ways in which gender relations change over time and give rise to or exacerbate health problems. The literature on the social determinants of health shows the importance of placing a primary emphasis on addressing the social and economic sources of ill health at national, provincial and community levels. DATA GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Recent studies of gender differences in health point to a lack of data and to the importance of understanding changing gender relations; differences in power and access to resources between women and men, and changing expectations of appropriate gender roles and behaviours. Poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, poor working conditions and unequal gender relations have a profound influence on patterns of health and illness. We suggest some material markers of change that might be used in health surveillance. With a more complete understanding of gender's role in shaping daily lives, these markers could be refined and expanded.",BMC women's health,2004 Aug 25,England,2004,00
18684850,Comparison of tuberculosis surveillance systems in low-incidence industrialised countries.,"The comparative analysis of National Tuberculosis Control Programmes (NTPs) in industrialised, low-tuberculosis-incidence countries is limited. Analysis of applied methods, function and accumulated experience contributes to improving global tuberculosis control. A questionnaire addressing NTP surveillance infrastructure and characteristics was completed in 19 industrialised countries, with populations of >3 million and annual notified tuberculosis incidence rates of <16 cases per 100,000 population (2003 data). All European countries surveyed adopted World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance of Tuberculosis in Europe (EuroTB) definitions. Surveillance information, which usually includes names, was transferred electronically to the national level in 17 out of the 19 countries. Surveillance systems capture process and social determinants. Case notification to the central level occurred within a median period of 7 days, independent of mandatory notification requirements. The mean completeness of tuberculosis case-reporting was estimated to be 93.5% (range 65-100%). Integration between HIV and tuberculosis registries was performed in two countries, and, in seven others, both databases were cross-matched periodically. National Tuberculosis Control Programme function in industrialised low-incidence countries utilises well-established infrastructure and relies upon centralised operations. Approaches are consistent with current World Health Organization surveillance recommendations. The present study lays collaborative groundwork for additional multinational analyses for the enhancement of global tuberculosis surveillance, which may assist policy-makers in countries moving from medium to low rates of incidence.",The European respiratory journal,2008 Dec,England,2008,00
15545072,"Road rage experience and behavior: vehicle, exposure, and driver factors.","Road rage has generated increasing public concern. Research has shown that victimization and perpetration of road rage is more common among males and younger drivers. We aimed to extend the understanding of determinants of road rage to driving exposure and vehicle factors, based on a 20022003 population survey of 1,631 regular drivers in Ontario, Canada. Regression analyses revealed that number of times drivers reported experiencing road rage in the previous 12 months was significantly greater for males, younger respondents, and those residing in Toronto. Also, victimization was significantly greater for drivers who did all their driving on busy roads and increased with number of kilometers driven on a typical week; however, type of vehicle driven was not significant. Number of times road rage perpetration was reported in the past 12 months was significantly greater for males, younger respondents, and those residing in Toronto, and lower for those in the Eastern and Northern region. Road rage perpetration increased significantly with number of weekly kilometers driven and was significantly greater for drivers who are always on busy roads and lower for those who never drive on busy roads, and higher for high-performance vehicle drivers. Even after controlling for driving exposure, road rage victimization and perpetration were highest for drivers in Toronto, where the pace of life may be more demanding. As expected, high-performance vehicle drivers reported more road rage perpetration. These individuals may experience more frustration when they are prevented from using the full performance capacities of their vehicles by crowded urban roadways.",Traffic injury prevention,2004 Dec,England,2004,00
18631388,Practice postcode versus patient population: a comparison of data sources in England and Scotland.,"BACKGROUND: Health professionals, policy-makers and researchers need to be able to explore potential associations between prevalence rates and quality of care with a range of possible determinants including socio-economic deprivation and morbidity levels to determine the impact of commissioning and service delivery. In the UK, data in England are only available nationally at practice postcode level. In Scotland, such data are available based on an aggregate of the practices population's postcodes. The use of data assigned to the practice postcode may underestimate the association between ill health and income deprivation. Here, we report on the impact of using data assigned to the practice population by comparing analyses using English and Scottish data. RESULTS: Income deprivation based on data assigned to the practice postcode under-estimated deprivation compared to using income deprivation data assigned to the practice population for the five least deprived deciles, and over-estimated deprivation for the five most deprived deciles. The biggest differences were found for the most deprived decile. A similar trend was found for limiting long-term illness (LLTI). Differences between the QOF prevalence rates of the least and most deprived deciles using practice postcode data were similar (0.2% points or less) in England and Scotland for 8 out of 10 clinical domains. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences in the prevalence rate between the least and most deprived deciles increase for all clinical domains. A similar trend was again found for LLTI. Using practice population assigned deprivation, differences for population achievement increase for all CHD quality indicators with the exception of beta-blockers (CHD10). With practice postcode assigned deprivation, significant differences between the least and most deprived deciles were found for 2 out 8 indicators, compared to 5 using practice population assigned deprivation. For LLTI differences between the lowest and most deprived deciles increased for all indicators when ill health assigned to the practice population was used. CONCLUSION: We have found, through comparing deprivation and ill health data assigned to either the practice postcode or the practice population postcode in Scotland, that analyses based on practice postcode assigned data under-estimated the relationship between deprivation and ill health for both prevalence and quality care. Given the importance of understanding the effect of deprivation and ill health on a range of determinants related to health care, policy makers should ensure that practice population data are available and used at national level in England and elsewhere where possible.",International journal of health geographics,2008 Jul 16,England,2008,00
11708047,"Personality, shame, and the breakdown of social bonds: the voice of quantitative depression research.","Scheff's argument (2001), whereby shame and the breakdown of social ties are causality implicated in depression, has potential to inform quantitative research on depression, particularly research focused on determinants of personality vulnerability. In the present article, I relate Scheff's argument to more than two and a half decades of theory and research on the interpersonal nature of depression, and on personality vulnerability to depression. The focus of this review is on the personality theories of Blatt (1974) and Beck (1983), in which an introjective/self-critical/autonomous personality dimension and an anaclitic/dependent/sociotropic personality dimension are each conceptualized as a marker of vulnerability. Reviewing empirical research on these two dimensions, I then point out a certain puzzle emerging from previous findings: The introjective personality dimension appears to confer considerably more vulnerability than the anaclitic personality dimension. An attempt is made to reconcile this puzzle by drawing from Scheff's discussion of shame, as well as from psychosocial research on internal representations of self and others (Blatt, Auerbach, and Levy 1997), and from sociological work on the depressogenic conditions of modernity (Giddens 1991; Seligman 1990).",Psychiatry,2001 Fall,United States,2001,00
19303184,Ethnicity and nativity status as determinants of perceived social support: testing the concept of familism.,"Research has demonstrated a protective effect of social support on health. Social support is most often treated as an independent variable. However, as with disease risk factors, which are not randomly distributed, health-promoting resources such as social support are also systematically patterned. For example, in the USA, family support is thought to be high among Latinos, Mexican Americans in particular. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, we explored the relationships between ethnicity/nativity status, socioeconomic status (SES) and perceived social support from family and friends. We also assessed the role of retention of culture-measured as primary language spoken at home-on social support. Finally, we tested whether SES moderated the relationship between ethnicity/nativity status and social support. Foreign and US-born Latinos, most notably, foreign-born Mexicans, reported higher family support compared to non-Latino whites. Primary language spoken at home seems to account for the relationship between ethnicity/nativity and familial social support. Mexican-born and US-born Latino immigrants reported lower social support from family at higher levels of SES. Each ethnic minority group reported lower perception of friend support compared to non-Latino whites. There was a strong SES gradient in subjective support from friends with higher support reported among those with higher SES. This study provides evidence for the notion that Latinos in the USA, specifically foreign-born Mexicans, may rely on family ties for support more than do non-Latino whites. Findings also help identify ethnicity/nativity status, primary language spoken and SES as determinants of social support. Specifically, the higher familial social support found among Latino immigrants may be due to retention of culture. Effect modification by SES suggests that Latinos of lower and higher SES may differ with regard to the traditionally-held value of familism.",Social science & medicine (1982),2009 May,England,2009,00
15082624,Inequality and leprosy in Northeast Brazil: an ecological study.,"BACKGROUND: Leprosy is an important public health problem in many developing countries and many features of its determinants are still obscure. METHODS: To investigate whether the incidence of leprosy is related to certain environmental and socioeconomic determinants, an ecological study was undertaken in 165 municipalities of the state of Ceara, Brazil. Social, economic, education, sanitation, demography, meteorology, and health data were collected. The dependent variable was the average incidence rate of leprosy from 1991 to 1999. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed to assess the relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. RESULTS: The average incidence rate for all the municipalities for the 1991-1999 period, varied from 0.06 to 14.68 per 10000 persons per year. The level of inequality (beta = 1.67, P = 0.011), the mean years of study among the population >or=25 years old (beta = 1.35, P < 0.001), the population growth from 1991 to 1996 (beta = 0.02, P = 0.007), the percentage of children 7-14 years old that did not go to the school (beta = 0.02, P = 0.028), and the presence of a railroad in the municipality (beta = 0.45, P = 0.038) were found to be predictors of the incidence rate of leprosy in Ceara. CONCLUSION: Our findings fit the assumption that, in Ceara, leprosy is associated with a high level of poverty and uncontrolled urbanization. We put forward the hypothesis that urbanization increases not only social inequality eventually leading to strong polarization, but also excludes people from social and material opportunities. Apparently, such deprivations render them susceptible for leprosy.",International journal of epidemiology,2004 Apr,England,2004,00
11562158,Personal food systems of male college hockey players.,"This study sought to improve the understanding of processes involved in food choice and dietary change by examining how members of a college men's ice hockey team experienced the multiple factors influencing their food choices. The study employed a theory-guided, grounded-theory approach, participant observation, and open-ended interviews with ten team members. Field notes and transcripts were analysed using the constant comparative method. Going to college and playing hockey involved adjusting to new food and athletic environments, increased personal responsibility for food choices, and new meanings for food and eating. Players viewed hockey, health, and taste as major determinants of their food practices. Hockey meant structured schedules, a social network, and performance expectations. Health meant ""feeling good"" for hockey, having a lean body composition, and a desirable body image. Low-fat foods were viewed generally as healthy, but as not providing taste satisfaction or reward. Players' food practices cycled through four phases over the year according to the changing meanings and importance of hockey, health, and taste. The findings advance the concept of personal food system to represent the way that a person constructs the options, barriers, trade-offs, rules, and routines in food choice in response to how s/he views his/her relationships with food and the environment.",Appetite,2001 Aug,England,2001,00
14674048,Determinants of the public's preference for social distance from people with schizophrenia.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which the public's desire for social distance from people with schizophrenia is influenced by beliefs about the disorder and stereotypes about those suffering from it. METHODS: In spring 2001, we carried out a representative survey of individuals of German nationality aged 18 years and over (n = 5025). Each subject was given a fully structured interview that began with the presentation of a vignette. RESULTS: Both labelling and beliefs about the disorder's causes and prognosis, as well as the perception that those suffering from it are unpredictable and dangerous, had an impact on the public's desire for social distance. However, the latter proved to be more important. As expected, respondents who identified the disorder depicted in the vignette as mental illness, those who blamed the individual for its development, and those who anticipated a poor prognosis expressed a stronger desire for social distance. Endorsing biological factors as a cause was also associated with increased social distance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have important implications for interventions aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination related to schizophrenia. Targeting the stereotype of unpredictability and dangerousness appears to be particularly important.",Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie,2003 Nov,United States,2003,00
12070901,[Sexually transmitted diseases: epidemiological and social aspects].,"STDs represent a major public health problem for two reasons: their serious sequelae and the facts that they facilitate transmission of HIV. This article presents WHO estimates new cases of some of curable STDs, and italian data from national reporting system (published from ISTAT and ISS). The number of new reported cases decreases in Italy, but reported cases are not all cases. People with STDs tend not to seek treatment or to self-medicate, this behaviour is common in youths. In many cases STDs are asymptomatic in both sexes, particularly in women. Women are also much more vulnerable biologically, culturally, socioeconomically. There is also a lack of notification by physicians. Important social determinants of STDs diffusion are migration and travels. Prevention and control of STDs need collaboration between medical disciplines: gynaecology, urology, dermo-venerology, microbiology, epidemiology, public health. Contributions of nurses, laboratory technician and social workers are also required. The role of public health specialists in the prevention is strictly related to health education.

In Western countries, it accounts for about 1% of all female genital malignant tumors. Its etiology remains poorly known, but high parity is considered to be protective. We studied determinants of incidence of primary fallopian tube carcinoma in Finland. Incidence rates for primary fallopian tube carcinoma, according to the population based Finnish Cancer Registry, from 1953- 97 were assessed by age, year of diagnosis, and type of residential area. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for the years 1971- 95 were calculated by occupation and social class variables taken from the 1970 Population Census. There were 485 cases of primary fallopian tube carcinoma registered during 45 years. The age-adjusted incidence rate increased from 1.2/1000000 in 1953-57 to 5.4/1000000 in 1993-97. This 4.5-fold increase in incidence rate corresponds to a 7-fold increase in the number of new cases. The increase is attributable to the age group beyond 55 years, the peak incidence occurring between 60-64 years. Although the relative increase in incidence rate has been larger in rural areas than in cities, the rate in the latter remains 2-fold. Women in the 2 highest social classes had a 1.8-fold incidence (95% CI = 1.2-2.6) as compared to the lowest social class. Women in agriculture and those not working outside the home had only half the cancer incidence of those in academic or clerical occupations. The incidence of primary fallopian tube carcinoma increases in Finland. Evidently, the incidence has increased simultaneously with the affluence of urban life. Part of the variation in incidence correlates with variation in parity.",International journal of cancer,2003 May 1,United States,2003,00
18727993,Gender differences in health-related quality of life among healthy aged and old-aged Austrians: cross-sectional analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Although they experience lower mortality rates and lower rates of several chronic diseases than do their male counterparts, aging women are more likely to experience functional impairment in mobility and a general diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The determinants of these gender differences have been the subject of controversy. OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed gender differences in HRQoL in relation to social and biomedical factors such as age, marital status, educational level, and living arrangements. METHODS: Participants were recruited via snowball sampling. All were healthy and lived independently in private homes. Data were obtained from personal interviews, based on a 30-item questionnaire, in the private homes of the participants. Additionally, HRQoL was assessed by means of the abbreviated version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) 26-item questionnaire, which contains 1 general health item, 1 general QoL item, and 24 specific items covering 4 broad domains: physical (DOM I), psychological (DOM II), social (DOM III), and environmental (DOM IV). RESULTS: The participants (98 women, 62 men) enrolled in the study ranged in age from 57 to 95 years (mean [SD] age: 71.8 [8.6] years). The younger age group (aged 57-70 years) comprised 54 women and 25 men, and the older age group (aged >70 years) comprised 44 women and 37 men. Women aged < or =70 years rated their health and QoL significantly higher than did men in the same age group (P = 0.02). These women rated physical capacity (DOM I), social relationships (DOM III), and environment (DOM IV) higher, but not statistically significantly different, than did same-aged men. Women and men exhibited nearly identical psychological health (DOM II) values. Physical capacity (DOM I) differed significantly between women and men aged >70 years (P = 0.03). Women aged >70 years rated their QoL lower than their male counterparts did, although not significantly so. These women depended more on medical treatment, felt significantly less safe in everyday life (P = 0.03), and were less satisfied with themselves. The results of the multiple regression analyses suggest that gender may have a significant impact on general QoL for both age groups (P < 0.01 for the younger age group; P > 0.04 for the older age group). In these analyses, gender also had a significant impact on 2 domains, physical capacity and social relationships (P < 0.02 for both domains), among the participants of the younger age group. CONCLUSION: Depending on the age group (< or =70 vs >70 years) in this small sample of Austrian women and men, gender influenced HRQoL.",Gender medicine,2008 Sep,United States,2008,00

10962782,Can general practitioners influence the nation's health through a population approach to provision of lifestyle advice?,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle advice from general practitioners (GPs) has been shown to have a positive effect on population health. In practice, GPs provide lifestyle advice to a minority of their patients only, those who are high risk or already have symptoms. AIM: To look in depth at GPs' attitudes towards adopting a population approach to lifestyle advice and to use these results to identify ways of maximising the potential of GPs to affect population health. METHOD: Thirty-six GPs, purposively sampled by identifying characteristics likely to affect their health promotion activity, participated in a focus group study. Data from the focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analysed using standard methods. RESULTS: The main themes that emerged suggested that GPs do not take a population approach to lifestyle advice because they prefer a high risk approach and doubt their ability to be effective in a population approach. GPs believed that social, cultural, and environmental factors were the most important determinants of population health. Furthermore, they were concerned about the detrimental effects on the doctor-patient relationship of providing lifestyle advice to all patients. GPs believed that a multi-agency, centrally co-ordinated approach was the preferred way to improve population health and that their role should be limited to secondary prevention. CONCLUSION: Large amounts of resources would be necessary to convince GPs to adopt a population approach to lifestyle advice.

Against this backdrop, we investigate the determinants of accessibility and affordability of health care utilisation in Tajikistan. A modified version of the Andersen Behavioural Model is used to conceptualise the determinants of health care utilisation in Tajikistan. Poisson and Ordered Logit regression models are performed to estimate the determinants of health care utilisation. Empirical results demonstrate that poverty, chronic illness and disability are the most important determinants of health care utilisation and affordability in Tajikistan. Other significant determinants include gender, the level of education of the household head, and the availability of medical personnel at a given population point. These findings suggest an urgent need for health care reform in order to ensure equality in accessibility and affordability for the entire population.",Global public health,2009,England,2009,00
16585483,Social interactions in adolescent television viewing.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether social interactions influence the television viewing choices of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. DESIGN: Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey were used to examine the association between individual-level and school-level television choices. An instrumental variables approach was used to solve the simultaneity problem found in models that examine the association between individual and aggregate choices. SETTING: In-home interviews in the United States collected in 1996. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 4532 students in grades 7 through 12 in 132 US public and private schools who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). MAIN EXPOSURE: The reported television viewing choices of an individual's schoolmates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number of hours of television individuals reported viewing in a week. RESULTS: The number of hours of television that adolescents report viewing per week was associated with their peers' reported hours of television viewing. Adjusted for other covariates, a 1-hour increase in average school-level television viewing was associated with an increase in almost half an hour of television viewing at the individual level. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that social interactions within schools influence the hours of television that adolescents report viewing. This finding is important for both future attempts at modeling the determinants of adolescent television viewing and suggestions for future policy interventions. The presence of social interactions implies that interventions that affect the social norms of television viewing within schools could also change individual television viewing. In reducing the number of hours of television watched, these interventions could also positively affect adolescent obesity, emotional problems, and academic achievement.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2006 Apr,United States,2006,00

METHODS: The European Male Ageing Study (EMAS) sampled from population registers in cities (centres) of eight European countries. Each centre recruited an age-stratified sample of men aged 40-79 years. Information on pain was collected by questionnaire and subjects were classified according to whether they satisfied the American College of Rheumatology definition of CWP. Information was collected on social status, mental health, recent life events and co-morbidities. RESULTS: Across all centres 3963 subjects completed a study questionnaire, with participation rates ranging from 24% in Hungary to 72% in Estonia. There were significant differences in prevalence: between 5% and 7% in centres in Italy, England, Belgium and Sweden, 9-15% in centres in Spain, Poland and Hungary and 15% in Estonia. There were strong relationships between poor mental health, adverse recent life events, co-morbidities and CWP. Adjustment for these factors explained between half and all of the excess risk in the eastern European centres: the excess risk in Poland was explained (odds ratio (OR) 1.1, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.2) but there remained excess risk in Hungary (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.8) and Estonia (OR 2.6, 95% CI 2.2 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first directly to compare the occurrence of CWP internationally. There is an excess prevalence in countries of eastern Europe and this excess is associated with adverse psychosocial factors as well as poorer psychological and physical health.",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,2009 May,England,2009,00
17062544,Racial/ethnic differences in the protective effects of self-management skills on adolescent substance use.,"A variety of cognitive and behavioral self-management skills have been posited as protective in terms of adolescent substance use. This study examined whether these skills measured in the 7th grade served a protective function in 9th grade substance use across ethnically diverse samples of adolescents. Participants consisted of Black (n = 461) and Hispanic (n = 320) urban youth and White suburban youth (n = 757). Structural equation modeling indicated that a second order Self-Management Skills latent factor consisting of first order latent factors of Decision-Making, Self-Regulation, and Self-Reinforcement skills was protective for adolescent substance use across racial/ethnic subgroups. However, Self-Management Skills were more strongly protective for suburban White youth and less protective for urban minority youth. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that predictive power of risk and protective factors derived from psychosocial theories varies widely across racial/ethnic subgroups of youth and is weaker among racial/ethnic minority youth compared to White youth. An important next step is to broaden the focus of etiology research from individual-level determinants to studying adolescent substance use behavior in the context of the cultural background and primary social settings of young people, such as family, school, and community environments.",Substance abuse,2006 Jun,United States,2006,00
12476643,Access to health care in a system transition: the case of Bulgaria.,"OBJECTIVE: Throughout the 1990s, the Soviet-style model in central and eastern Europe that provided free health services has been subject to radical reforms. Socio-economic inequalities have also increased but there is little information on inequalities in health care utilization. This paper examines the pattern of illness behaviour in Bulgaria, seeking evidence of inequalities in access to services and eliciting users' pathways to care. DESIGN: Analysis drew on a representative population survey in Bulgaria (1997). The financial determinants of service use were tested in a multivariate model adjusted first for age, and then for age, marital status and self-reported health. In-depth interviews with users and providers addressed pathways to care, use of connections and other informal strategies to obtain care. RESULTS: As expected, rates of illness vary with income, with highest rates among the poor. After adjustment for illness, consultation rates are relatively equal across income levels, with the exception of worse-off women who tend to consult more. For first contact, there are few differences according to income, with the better off preferring secondary level. Pathways slightly differ, with women more often treated in primary care. Private sector utilization is low. Qualitative research reveals well-established strategies to obtain more advanced care, including use of connections, informal payments and use of emergency services. CONCLUSIONS: An apparent lack of inequalities in access to care conceals a more complex picture in which income and gender influence the pathways taken through the system.",The International journal of health planning and management,2002 Oct-Dec,England,2002,00
18713172,Determinants of work among older adults in urban China.,"OBJECTIVE: We examined the role of personal, family and institutional factors on the work status of older adults in urban China. METHOD: The analysis was based on data from a large population survey (N = 7381) of community-dwelling urban Chinese aged 60 years and older. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model work status. RESULTS: Demographic variables such as gender, ethnicity, age and self-perceived health status were identified as important determinants of work status. Having material assets, savings, a public pension and health insurance were all negatively correlated with remaining in the workforce, whereas earning a high income was positively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications regarding the impact of health policy and pension reform on employment retention. While economic growth may create an incentive for some to continue working, the lack of widespread public and private old-age support may force others to remain in the workforce out of economic necessity.",Australasian journal on ageing,2008 Sep,Australia,2008,00
18475144,Residential environment and blood pressure in the PRIME Study: is the association mediated by body mass index and waist circumference?,"OBJECTIVES: Few studies have examined whether social characteristics of the residential environment are associated with blood pressure after controlling for individual sociodemographic characteristics. Even less is known about the processes by which these associations operate. Therefore, we examined whether distinct dimensions of the residential environment (socioeconomic position and urbanicity) were associated with systolic blood pressure. To better understand the processes involved in the associations between contextual factors and blood pressure, we assessed the extent to which these associations were mediated by body mass index and waist circumference. METHODS: We analysed data from the PRIME Study (7850, 50-60-year-old men surveyed in 1991-1993 in three French regions and recently geocoded on a local scale). We used multilevel regression models to estimate associations between contextual factors and blood pressure, and path analysis to investigate possible mediators of these associations. RESULTS: After adjustment for individual socioeconomic variables, systolic blood pressure increased independently with decreasing municipality population density and decreasing neighbourhood educational level. Path analysis indicated that approximately 37% of the association between neighbourhood education and blood pressure was statistically explained by the heavier weight and stronger central adiposity of people from deprived neighbourhoods. Approximately 19% of the association with population density was mediated by anthropometric factors. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the neighbourhood environment may influence blood pressure; only part of the associations between contextual factors and blood pressure may operate through body weight and body shape modification.",Journal of hypertension,2008 Jun,England,2008,00

This work was aimed at assessing the level and factors that determine the awareness of undergraduate Students of Usmanu Dandfodiyo University, Sokoto. METHODOLOGY: In a descriptive cross-sectional study, a total of 450 students were recruited by means of multistage and simple random sampling techniques. RESULTS: Overall, there is a knowledge gap on aetiology, mode of transmission and preventive measures with only 40.2% and 38.5% of the respondents having adequate knowledge and indicated their willingness to learn more about AIDs respectively. Age (P<0.05), Sex (P<0.005) and number of years spent in the University (P<0.025) are important determinants of level of AIDS knowledge. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: This finding could be as a result of strong interactions between the social environment and human sexuality. Hence, student bodies should be involved in reproductive health programmes. Key words: awareness, university students, AIDS.",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,2005 Sep,Nigeria,2005,00
14642554,Determinants of participation of women in a cervical cancer visual screening trial in rural south India.,"The efficacy of a single round of screening of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) on cervical cancer incidence and mortality is investigated in a cluster randomized controlled trial in south India. Women aged 30-59 years in 113 clusters in Dindigul District were randomized to VIA screening by nurses (57 clusters, 48,225 eligible women) and to a control group (56 clusters, 30,167 women). 30,577 (63.4%) eligible women participated in screening. Younger, educated, married, multiparous, low-income women and those who have had tubal sterilization had a higher compliance with screening. Of the 2069 women diagnosed with CIN and invasive cancer, 1498 (72.4%) received treatment. Young women, those who practiced contraception and women with high-grade precursor lesions and invasive cancers were more likely to comply with treatment. In summary, our study indicates that women accept screening with VIA by nurses and a moderate level of compliance with screening and treatment can be reached through appropriate service delivery systems including health education activities, personal invitations, clinics in proximity to the target women, and testing and treatment in the same session. Our results imply that integration of screening activities with primary health services seems to have the potential to replicate most of these service delivery conditions in routine programs.",Cancer detection and prevention,2003,England,2003,00
11683569,Breastfeeding determinants and a suggested framework for action in Europe.,"This is a background paper for the EURODIET initiative. A number of international initiatives and documents were identified, such as the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes and a number of consensus reports from professional groups, that propose ways forward for breastfeeding promotion. These point at a range of initiatives on different levels. The determinants for successful breastfeeding have to be identified. They can be categorised into five groups; socio-demographic, psycho-social, health care related, community- and policy attributes. A framework for future breastfeeding promoting efforts on European level is suggested, within which these determinants are considered. A common surveillance system needs to be built in Europe, where determinants of breastfeeding are included. There is also a need for a surveillance system which makes it possible to use the collected data on local level, not only on national and supranational level. Combined with a thorough review of the effectiveness of already existing breastfeeding promotion programmes, a co-ordinated EU-EFTA action plan on breastfeeding should be formulated and implemented within a few years. Urgent action could take place in parallel, especially targeting young, low-income, less educated mothers.",Public health nutrition,2001 Apr,England,2001,00
16880215,Lay concepts of the relative importance of different influences on health; are there major socio-demographic variations?,"There is an extensive literature within anthropology, sociology and psychology about lay concepts of determinants of health and illness. Many of these studies have used single sex or social class samples, often in narrow age bands, and many are qualitative in approach. We asked respondents in a health survey to say how important (on a five-point scale) they thought seven potential influences on health (habits, self-care, the environment, family relationships, one's constitution, money and luck) were. The first three were regarded as very important, the second three as less important and luck as least important. Responses were consistent with current public health and epidemiological knowledge; these respondents endorsed prevailing views about personal responsibility for health and about the role of the physical and social environment in influencing health. In mutually adjusted models, there were no significant gender differences, social class differences and neighbourhood differences in three out of seven influences, and age differences in four out of seven influences. Thus, socio-demographic differences were less marked than might be inferred from studies of specific social groups, indicating a need for caution in health education and health promotion practice against always assuming socio-demographic differences.",Health education research,2006 Oct,England,2006,00
16754946,Determinants and consequences of smoke-free homes: findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey.,"OBJECTIVE: To report on prevalence, trends and determinants of smoke-free home policies in smokers' homes in different countries and to estimate the effects of these policies on smoking cessation. DESIGN: Two waves of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey (ITC-4), a cohort survey of smokers conducted by telephone. Wave 1 was conducted in October/December 2002 with broadly representative samples of over 2000 adult (>or= 18 years) cigarette smokers in each of the following four countries: Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, 75% of whom were followed up at Wave 2 on average seven months later. KEY MEASURES: Levels of smoking restrictions in homes (both waves). RESULTS: Australian smokers were most likely to live in smoke-free homes and UK smokers least likely (34% v 15% at Wave 1). Levels of smoke-free homes increased between waves. Logistic regressions indicated that the main independent predictors of smokers reporting smoke-free homes or implementation of a smoke-free policy between waves included household factors such as having a child, particularly a young child, and having other non-smoking adults in the household. Positive attitudes to smoke-free public places and/or reported presence of smoke-free public places were independent predictors of having or implementing smoke-free homes, supporting a social diffusion model for smoking restrictions. Intentions to quit at Wave 1 and quitting activity between survey waves were associated with implementing bans between Waves 1 and 2. Presence of bans at Wave 1 was associated with significantly greater proportions of quit attempts, and success among those who tried at Wave 2. There was no significant interaction between the predictive models and country. CONCLUSIONS: Smoke-free public places seem to stimulate adoption of smoke-free homes, a strategy associated with both increased frequency of quit attempts, and of the success of those attempts.",Tobacco control,2006 Jun,England,2006,00

12734052,Cancer incidence and socioeconomic geography of Finland: a correlation study.,"The influence that social determinants exert on cancer incidence and patterns is an expected aftermath of the predominantly environmental origin of cancer. This happens because social changes determine a wide range of individual behaviors, and hence of ""proximate"" causes of cancer. Whereas most of the previous social epidemiological studies focused on individual social classes and groups, in this paper we studied the influence of the social factors on cancer etiology at the larger scale of a whole country: Finland. The ecological analysis of cancer incidence and patterns in the Finnish regions pointed to both local and general correlations between tumors and socioeconomic descriptors. The most important correlations were: a) a general effect of economic and societal factors on cancer (namely, on the profiles of tumors in males and females, on the global cancer incidence in females, and on the difference in cancer incidence between the two sexes); b) a very specific pattern of correlations for the Ahvenanmaa islands; c) a clear geographic cline in tumor profile variability. The ecological epidemiology approach can provide important clues to public health policies.","Journal of environmental science and health.

This article explores 3 conceptual and methodological issues impeding nursing research in this area: (1) ambiguity surrounding socioeconomic status (SES), both conceptually and as a scientific indicator; (2) the narrow focus on biological and behavioral risks for chronic disease development; and (3) the persistent centrality of individual behavior in studies examining SES-health contextual relationships.

17768520,A comprehensive assessment of maternal deaths in Argentina: translating multicentre collaborative research into action.,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a comprehensive assessment of maternal mortality in Argentina, the ultimate purpose being to strengthen the surveillance system and reorient reproductive health policies to prevent maternal deaths. METHODS: Our multicentre population-based study combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies included a descriptive analysis of under-registration and distribution of causes of death, a case-control study to identify risk factors in health-care delivery and verbal autopsies to analyse social determinants associated with maternal deaths. FINDINGS: A total of 121 maternal deaths occurred during 2002. The most common causes were abortion complications (27.4%), haemorrhage (22.1%), infection/sepsis (9.5%), hypertensive disorders (8.4%) and other causes (32.6%). Under-registration was 9.5% for maternal deaths (n = 95) and 15.4% for late maternal deaths (n = 26). The probability of dying was 10 times greater in the absence of essential obstetric care, active emergency care and qualified staff, and doubled with every 10-year increase in age. Other contributing factors included delays in recognizing ""alarm signals""; reluctance in seeking care owing to desire to hide an induced abortion; delays in receiving timely treatment due to misdiagnosis or lack of supplies; and delays in referral/transportation in rural areas. CONCLUSION: A combination of methodologies is required to improve research on and understanding of maternal mortality via the systematic collection of health surveillance data. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive intervention to address public health and human rights issues in maternal mortality, and our results contribute to the consensus-building necessary to improve the existing surveillance system and prevention strategies.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,2007 Aug,Switzerland,2007,00
16905888,Psychological and physical activity training for older persons: who does not attend?,"BACKGROUND: Interventions to promote successful aging include psychological and physical activity programs. Identification of determinants of attendance of older persons may be useful to develop strategies to improve attendance. For physical activity programs determinants of attendance have been investigated extensively. For psychological programs hardly any knowledge is available. Determinants of attendance at psychological and physical activity programs have never been investigated simultaneously. OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic, physical and psychological determinants of attendance of older subjects following multifaceted psychological training - aimed at promoting active social participation - and physical activity training and to compare the variation of these determinants between the two training programs. METHOD: 118 subjects aged 65-92 years were randomized over psychological and physical activity training. Determinants of attendance were obtained at pretest with questionnaires and performance-based tests. RESULTS: Mean attendance was 62%. Attendance was not related to type of program. Having chronic diseases facilitated attendance in the psychological training group and limited attendance in the physical activity training group. Low and high levels of Activities of Daily Living performance (ADLs) and walking endurance were related to a high attendance in the psychological training group. A low level of activities of daily living (ADL) and a low walking endurance were related to a low attendance in the physical activity training group. For both training groups, persons living with a partner had higher attendance rates than persons living alone, and persons with a low level of anxiety had higher attendance rates than persons with a moderate or a high level of anxiety. CONCLUSION: Psychological training may be more suitable for frail older persons with chronic diseases, low ADL levels and low walking endurance than physical activity training, and may help to prepare such persons for physical activity.",Gerontology,2006,Switzerland,2006,00
17420997,"Microlevel determinants of blood pressure among women of two ethnic groups in a periurban area of Kolkata city, India.","Blood pressure (BP) trends vary cross-culturally, and studies on the risk factors associated with hypertension are limited in periurban regions of India. This study was conducted to examine the effect of socioeconomic factors (income, expenditure, activity time) and anthropometric measurements (skinfolds of biceps, triceps, subscapular, supra iliac, and body mass index) on 102 Munda (tribe) and 135 Pod (caste) women of childbearing age in a periurban area of Kolkata city. Results indicate that Munda women had significantly higher diastolic BP in the 30+ age group. However, no difference in the systolic and diastolic BP was observed between the two groups, when the socioanthropometric factors were controlled as covariates. Also, according to the JNC (JNC, 2004, The JNC 7 Report NIH Publication No. 04-5230) classification of hypertension, no significant difference in hypertension was noted between the women of the two social groups. But the risk factors associated with hypertension varied between the two ethnic groups. Expenditure on alcohol and activity time was associated with hypertension among the Munda, while body mass index was significantly associated with hypertension among the Pod women. Alcohol consumption is a rare phenomenon among Indian women. Yet, Munda women in this transitional periurban environment, in spite of high poverty were more inclined to spent their earnings in alcohol consumption (due to their cultural preferences), increasing the risk of hypertension in their childbearing age.",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,2007 May-Jun,United States,2007,00
15903086,[Shamanic healing in the age of modern medicine].,"This study on the therapeutic aspects of shamanic medicine differentiates the anthropologic approaches used in the 19th and early 20th century from contemporary approaches developed since the n Central to Eastern Asia. In addition to reviewing the major works on shamanic practice, this study takes into account lesser-known data on contemporary shamanic practices in Nepal. Shamanism embraces special cosmogenic beliefs. From a biological standpoint the shamanic trance like various healing techniques raises interesting questions about the involvement of certain brain regions in the development of mental factors that may generate somatic symptoms. From the therapeutic standpoint it shows the importance of managing social and psychoaffective factors. The current resurgence of shamanism could signal the revival of the disrupted ethnic identities. The shaman and medical doctor occupy symmetric, inversed positions.

17891274,Chagas disease in the Amazon region.,"The risk that Chagas disease becomes established as a major endemic threat in Amazonia (the world's largest tropical biome, today inhabited by over 30 million people) relates to a complex set of interacting biological and social determinants. These include intense immigration from endemic areas (possibly introducing parasites and vectors), extensive landscape transformation with uncontrolled deforestation, and the great diversity of wild Trypanosoma cruzi reservoir hosts and vectors (25 species in nine genera), which maintain intense sylvatic transmission cycles. Invasion of houses by adventitious vectors (with infection rates > 60%) is common, and focal adaptation of native triatomines to artificial structures has been reported. Both acute (approximately 500) and chronic cases of autochthonous human Chagas disease have been documented beyond doubt in the region. Continuous, low-intensity transmission seems to occur throughout the Amazon, and generates a hypoendemic pattern with seropositivity rates of approximately 1-3%. Discrete foci also exist in which transmission is more intense (e.g., in localized outbreaks probably linked to oral transmission) and prevalence rates higher. Early detection-treatment of acute cases is crucial for avoiding further dispersion of endemic transmission of Chagas disease in Amazonia, and will require the involvement of malaria control and primary health care systems. Comprehensive eco-epidemiological research, including prevalence surveys or the characterization of transmission dynamics in different ecological settings, is still needed. The International Initiative for Chagas Disease Surveillance and Prevention in the Amazon provides the framework for building up the political and scientific cooperation networks required to confront the challenge of preventing Chagas disease in Amazonia.",Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,2007 Oct 30,Brazil,2007,00
12910464,Characteristics of reproductive biology and proximate factors regulating seasonal breeding in captive golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas).,"Reproduction is highly demanding in terms of energy expenditure, and the costs and benefits associated with postponing or investing in a reproductive effort are crucial determinants of an individual's fitness. Understanding the reproductive potential of a species under varying ecological conditions offers important insights into the dynamics of its social system. This study provides the first detailed analysis of the reproductive potential of wild- and captive-born golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) under captive conditions, based on studbook data compiled during 1984-2000. Litters produced by wild-born females breeding in captivity are similar in size to litters observed in the wild, but smaller than litters of captive-born females. The more stringent ecological conditions experienced by wild-born females during maturation may result in a lifelong effect on litter size. However, interbirth intervals are shorter for wild-born than captive-born females. The relatively smaller burden of infant care that results from having smaller litters may allow wild-born females to sustain the next pregnancy sooner. Reproduction in the Brazilian captive population is highly seasonal for both wild-born females and females born in captivity in Brazil. Changes in photoperiod over a year provide a proximate explanation for changes in the proportion of conceptions and births per month. Outside Brazil, breeding occurs year-round, and no clear birth peak is apparent. Information from field reports that could be used to relate this finding to ecological factors, such as resource availability, is unavailable.",American journal of primatology,2003 Aug,United States,2003,00
19686599,The social determinants of child health: variations across health outcomes - a population-based cross-sectional analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Disparities in child health outcomes persist despite advances in medical technology and increased global wealth. The social determinants of health approach is useful in explaining the disparities in health. Our objective in this paper is four-fold: (1) to test whether the income relationship (and the related income gradient) is the same across different child health outcomes; (2) to test whether the association between income and child health outcomes persists after controlling for other traditional socioeconomic characteristics of children and their family (education and employment status); (3) to test the role of other potentially mediating variables, namely parental mental health, number of children, and family structure; and (4) to test the interaction between income and education. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study used data from the 2003 US National Survey of Children's Health involving 102,353 children aged 0 to 17 years. Using multivariate logistic regression models, the association between household income, education, employment status, parental mental health, number of children, family structure and the following child health outcomes were examined: presence or absence of asthma, headaches/migraine, ear infections, respiratory allergy, food/digestive allergy, or skin allergy. RESULTS: While the associations of some determinants were found to be consistent across different health outcomes, the association of other determinants such as household income depended on the specific outcome. Controlling for other factors, a gradient association persisted between household income and a child having asthma, migraine/severe headaches, or ear infections with children more likely to have the illness if their family is closer to the federal poverty level. Potentially mediating variables, namely parental mental health, number of children, and family structure had consistent associations across health outcomes. CONCLUSION: There appears to be evidence of an income gradient for certain child health outcomes, even after controlling for other traditional measures of socioeconomic status. Our study also found evidence of an association between certain child health outcomes and potential mediating factors.",BMC pediatrics,2009 Aug 17,England,2009,00
16533108,Measuring population health: a review of indicators.,"This article reviews the historical development of population health indicators. We have long known that environmental, socioeconomic, early life conditions, individual actions, and medical care all interact to affect health. Present quantitative reporting on the impact of these factors on population health grew out of Bills of Mortality published in the 1500s. Since then, regular censuses, civil registration of vital statistics, and international classification systems have improved data quality and comparability. Regular national health interview surveys and application of administrative data contributed information on morbidity, health services use, and some social determinants of health. More recently, traditional health databases and datasets on ""nonhealth"" sector determinants have been linked. Statistical methods for map-making, risk adjustment, multilevel analysis, calculating population-attributable risks, and summary measures of population health have further helped to integrate information. Reports on the health of populations remain largely confined to focused areas. This paper suggests a conceptual framework for using indicators to report on all the domains of population health. Future ethical development of indicators will incorporate principles of justice, transparency, and effectiveness.",Annual review of public health,2006,United States,2006,00

14982707,"Physiological, psychological, social, and cultural influences on the use of menthol cigarettes among Blacks and Hispanics.","Patterns of menthol cigarette consumption among Blacks and Hispanics are likely a product of the interactive effects of several factors: the physiological and pharmacological sensory effects of menthol, the ""cool"" psychological identity of being menthol smokers, the promotional marketing of menthol cigarettes, and the cultural effects of health-related beliefs and subjective culture norms. This article presents two conceptual frameworks--a moderation logic model and a mediation logic model--for organizing the disparate literature on factors affecting the consumption of menthol cigarettes among Blacks and Hispanics. Three factor domains are examined as direct effect predictors of menthol cigarette smoking: (a) physiological and pharmacological, (b) psychological, and (c) social and environmental. In addition, a fourth domain of cultural variables is presented as a class of moderator or mediator variables that can interact with these physiological, psychological, and social factors as determinants of menthol cigarette use. These cultural variables are examined as mediating or moderating factors that influence the use of menthol cigarettes by Black and Hispanic consumers. Recommendations are offered for future research to further understand the influence of cultural and other factors as determinants of menthol cigarette smoking among Blacks and Hispanics.",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,2004 Feb,England,2004,00
10814661,Setting health priorities in a Swiss canton: what do different methods tell us?,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Despite excellent mortality indicators, there is clear evidence that the health status of the population of Geneva could be improved if more attention and resources were devoted to prevention strategies. To identify a set of robust health priorities an original approach was used triangulating results between three methods. METHODS: The study calculated potential years of life lost, disability adjusted years of life lost, and conducted a Delphi survey to gather the opinion of health professionals and the general public. MAIN RESULTS: Several health conditions were unanimously selected by all three methods as top priorities: cardiovascular diseases, AIDS, respiratory cancer, breast cancer for women, suicide and traffic accidents. In addition, two determinants-alcohol abuse and tobacco abuse-for which a clear conceptual link could be established between all methods were chosen. Connections between priorities identified through the DALY and the Delphi method lead to further inclusion of chronic back pain and depression. Some issues solely identified through the Delphi survey were included as they were consistently considered important by professionals and the lay public alike-violence in the family, unemployment, social exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that health priorities, and by extension health care priorities, would benefit from using a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods. The triangulation of results allows for a broader perspective and makes results more acceptable.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2000 May,England,2000,00
12864889,End-stage renal disease in sub-Saharan and South Africa.,"The major health problems in Africa are AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, gastroenteritis and hypertension; hypertension affects about 20% of the adult population. Renal disease, especially glomerular disease, is more prevalent in Africa and seems to be of a more severe form than that found in Western countries. The most common mode of presentation is the nephrotic syndrome, with the age of onset at five to eight years. It is estimated that 2 to 3% of medical admissions in tropical countries are due to renal-related complaints, the majority being the glomerulonephritides. There are no reliable statistics for ESRD in all African countries. Statistics of the South African Dialysis and Transplant Registry (SADTR) reflect the patients selected for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and do not accurately reflect the etiology of chronic renal failure (CRF), where public sector state facilities will offer RRT only to patients who are eligible for a transplant. In 1994, glomerulonephritis was recorded as the cause of ESRD in 1771 (52.1%) and hypertension in 1549 (45.6%) of patients by the SADTR. In a six-year study of 3632 patients with ESRD, based on SADTR statistics, hypertension was reported to be the cause of ESRD in 4.3% of whites, 34.6% of blacks, 20.9% mixed race group and 13.8% of Indians. Malignant hypertension is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among urban black South Africans, with hypertension accounting for 16% of all hospital admissions. In a ten-year study of 368 patients with chronic renal failure in Nigeria, the etiology of renal failure was undetermined in 62%. Of the remaining patients whose etiology was ascertained, hypertension accounted for 61%, diabetes mellitus for 11% and chronic glomerulonephritis for 5.9%. Patients with CRF constituted 10% of all medical admissions in this center. Chronic glomerulonephritis and hypertension are principal causes of CRF in tropical Africa and East Africa, together with diabetes mellitus and obstructive uropathy. The availability of dialysis and transplantation is quite variable in Africa: treatment rates in North Africa are 30 to 186.5 per million population (pmp) in countries with more established programs: Algeria 78.5; Egypt 129.3; Libya 30; Morocco 55.6; Tunisia 186.5 pmp. In South Africa, treatment rates of 99 pmp were reported; Dialysis and transplant programs in the rest of Africa are dependent on the availability of funding and donors. Services are still predominantly urban and therefore generally inaccessible to the poorer, less educated rural patient. There is not enough money for healthcare in the developing world, particularly for expensive and chronic treatment such as RRT. The goal should be to have a circumscribed chronic dialysis program, with as short a time on dialysis as possible, and to increase the availability of transplantation (both living donor and cadaver). Efforts should be made to optimize therapy of renal disease and renal failure globally and particularly in developing countries. Strategies should be developed to screen for and manage conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus at the primary healthcare level in an effort to decrease the incidence of chronic renal failure. Increasingly, health is influenced by social and economic circumstances. Any improvements in health thus demand integrated, comprehensive action against all the determinants of ill health.",Kidney international. Supplement,2003 Feb,United States,2003,00
19454147,[Determinants in an occupational health and safety program implementation].,"OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors for the degree to which a program that integrates occupational health surveillance with labor safety, and involves occupational health/safety specialists, company management, and employees, is implemented. METHOD: This ecological study evaluated companies implementing the occupational health and safety program (OHSP) proposed by the state of Bahia's regional department of Servico Social da Industria (Social Services for Industry, SESI) during the 2005-2006 cycle. The companies that participated were randomly selected. Data were collected through interviews with key contacts within the companies and from technical reports issued by SESI. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors related to the company, employee, occupational/safety specialist, and any subdimensions that might promote OHSP implementation. RESULTS: Of the 78 companies selected (3 384 employees), the degree to which OHSP was implemented was ""advanced"" in 24.4%, ""intermediate"" in 53.8%, and ""initial"" in 19.3%. Company-related, employee-related and specialist-related factors were positively associated with OHSP implementation (P < 0.001). The most important factor overall was the program's financial autonomy (beta = 4.40; P < 0.001). Bivariate analysis revealed that the degree of implementation was associated with the employees' level of health/safety knowledge (beta = 1.58; P < 0.05) and training (beta = 0.40; P < 0.001) and with communication between the occupational safety team (beta = 1.89; P < 0.01) and the health team (beta = 0.58; P < 0.05). These findings remained unchanged after adjustment for levels of education among managers and employees, salary/wages, company size, and risk. CONCLUSIONS: The time and resources available for employees to dedicate to occupational health and safety, the integration and reinforcement of employee and manager training programs, and improved relationship between occupational health and safety teams may contribute to the success of health and safety promotion efforts among employees.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2009 Mar,United States,2009,00

Seventy-nine members (24%) and 26 coordinators (45%) were included in the study. Three incomplete questionnaires (from prenatal program members) were discarded. Sixty-one percent of members who reported income level and family size (n=61) had incomes below the low-income cut-off. Fifty-eight members (73%) reported improvements in their lives because of the program. Sixty-four members (81%) perceived they learned to feed their families healthier foods. The members reported their fruit and vegetable consumption before and since joining a collective kitchen, and the proportion of those consuming at least five fruit and vegetable servings a day rose from 29% to 47%. The most common reasons for joining this program concerned social interactions and support. Over 90% of the coordinators perceived that they were competent to coordinate a kitchen. The results indicate that the collective kitchens program addresses several health determinants, and may increase members' capacity to attain food security and to achieve improved nutritional health.",Canadian journal of dietetic practice and research : a publication of Dietitians of Canada = Revue canadienne de la pratique et de la recherche en dietetique : une publication des Dietetistes du Canada,2004 Summer,Canada,2004,00
17888800,Genomic imprinting and the evolution of sex differences in mammalian reproductive strategies.,"Two major developments have occurred that have influenced the evolution of sexually dimorphic reproductive strategies of mammals. Viviparity and development of a placenta is one such development, especially in small-brained rodent lineages, where there has been a major impact of placental hormones on the maternal brain. In the Old World primate/hominoid lineages, the massive expansion of the brain through growth of the neocortex has radically changed how reproductive strategies are determined. Genomic imprinting has played a significant part in both of these developments. Most of the imprinted genes investigated to date are expressed in the placenta and a subset are expressed in both placenta and hypothalamus. Based on phenotypes derived from targeted mutagenesis, a hypothesis is developed for the coadaptive evolution of placenta and hypothalamus, particularly in the context of neurohormonal regulation of maternalism. In small-brained mammals, maternalism places a severe restriction on sexual activity, which in the case of a female rodent is little more than several hours in a lifetime compared with the several weeks given over to maternalism. The consequent sparsity of oestrous, sexually receptive females imposes a rigorous competitive reproductive strategy in males, with the onus being on the male's ability to find oestrous females. This has resulted in a marked sex difference in the chemosensory system, particularly the VNO accessory olfactory system, for the engagement of male sexual behavior in response to oestrous females. Genomic imprinting, together with neonatal androgens, has also played a role in the developing accessory olfactory system and its role in detecting oestrous females. With the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex seen in Old World primates and hominids, reproductive strategies are complex and embedded in the social structure and hierarchies which characterize primate societies. Reproductive strategies depend far more on intelligent behavioral determinants than they do on hormonal determinants. In females, sexual activity is not restricted to oestrous periods, indeed most of the sexual activity is not reproductive. Male Old World primates continue to mate for years after castration, but loss of dominance status leads to a loss of sexual interest within days. The genetic basis for the expansion of neocortical development is complex, but those parts of the brain which have expanded are undoubtedly under the influence of imprinted genes, as studies using parthenogenetic and androgenetic chimeras and allometric analysis of brains across comparative phylogenies have shown. Sex differences in behavior owe much to social structure, social learning, and the deployment of intelligent behavioral strategies. The epigenetic effects of social learning on brain development have become equally as important as the epigenetic effects of hormones on brain development and both contribute to sex differences in behavior in large-brained primates.",Advances in genetics,2007,United States,2007,00

19335945,Lessons from tuberculosis control for public health.,"Tuberculosis (TB) control in many ways exemplifies evidence-based public health practice, rigorously implemented, with appropriate emphasis on the central importance of political support for success. With more than 30 million patients treated in the past decade, TB control has important implications for managing both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Simple diagnostic tests, meticulously proven standardized treatment regimens with assured drug supply, supportive case management and a superb information system that tracks the progress of every patient, all facilitate effective program implementation. TB control shows that public health programs, including those that require long-term treatment in the primary care system, can be effective in poor countries; however, TB rates are heavily influenced by the social, environmental and epidemiologic context, emphasizing that treatment is not enough and that socio-economic factors may be more important determinants of epidemiologic trends than treatment programs. TB control is effective when it combines two essential components: a practical, implementable, proven technical package, and political commitment. Political commitment is also essential to implement other interventions that can improve health, including healthier air, water and food, as well as programs to prevent or reduce tobacco smoking, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity and other growing public health problems. By implementing evidence-based practices, ensuring operational excellence, using information systems that facilitate accountability and evaluation, and obtaining and maintaining political support, we can address the public health challenges of the twenty-first century.",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,2009 Apr,France,2009,00
18259870,Involving local health departments in community health partnerships: evaluation results from the partnership for the public's health initiative.,"Improving community health ""from the ground up"" entails a comprehensive ecological approach, deep involvement of community-based entities, and addressing social determinants of population health status. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Office of the Surgeon General, and other authorities have called for public health to be an ""inter-sector"" enterprise, few models have surfaced that feature local health departments as a key part of the collaborative model for effecting community-level change. This paper presents evaluation findings and lessons learned from the Partnership for the Public's Health (PPH), a comprehensive community initiative that featured a central role for local health departments with their community partners. Funded by The California Endowment, PPH provided technical and financial resources to 39 community partnerships in 14 local health department jurisdictions in California to promote community and health department capacity building and community-level policy and systems change designed to produce long-term improvements in population health. The evaluation used multiple data sources to create progress ratings for each partnership in five goal areas related to capacity building, community health improvement programs, and policy and systems change. Overall results were generally positive; in particular, of the 37 partnerships funded continuously throughout the 5 years of the initiative, between 25% and 40% were able to make a high level of progress in each of the Initiative's five goal areas. Factors associated with partnership success were also identified by local evaluators. These results showed that health departments able to work effectively with community groups had strong, committed leaders who used creative financing mechanisms, inclusive planning processes, organizational changes, and open communication to promote collaboration with the communities they served.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2008 Mar,United States,2008,00
14592213,Determinants of nasal CPAP compliance.,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is a prevalent condition with potentially serious medical and psychosocial consequences. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment-of-choice and has been shown to reduce the frequency of nocturnal respiratory events, improve sleep architecture and decrease daytime sleepiness. Patient compliance with CPAP is disappointingly low. Previous studies examining determinants of CPAP compliance have limited the variables studied to patient (sociodemographic), disease status, and treatment variables, with few reliable determinants found. METHODS: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship between objectively measured CPAP compliance and variables from social cognitive theory (SCT) and the transtheoretical model (TM). Scales that measure variables from each model were developed and reliability evaluated. The relationship between the SCT and TM variables and compliance at 1-month post-CPAP-fitting was prospectively evaluated on 51 first-time CPAP users. SCT and TM variables were measured on the day of CPAP-fitting, at 1-week post-CPAP-fitting, and at 1-month post-CPAP-fitting. RESULTS: SCT variables measured 1-week post-CPAP-fitting (R(2)=0.261, P=0.001) and TM variables measured 1-week post-CPAP-fitting (R(2)=0.17, P=0.002) accounted for a statistically significant amount of variance in objective CPAP compliance measured at 1 month. The decisional balance index (from TM) individually accounted for a significant amount of variance in objective CPAP compliance in the above analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of these new behavior change scales to predict CPAP compliance provides us with a new direction of research to better understand factors associated with compliance. The principal advantage of these theory-driven and empirically validated scales are that they measure modifiable factors that can provide the basis for sound interventions to improve CPAP compliance.",Sleep medicine,2002 May,Netherlands,2002,00
12476643,Access to health care in a system transition: the case of Bulgaria.,"OBJECTIVE: Throughout the 1990s, the Soviet-style model in central and eastern Europe that provided free health services has been subject to radical reforms. Socio-economic inequalities have also increased but there is little information on inequalities in health care utilization. This paper examines the pattern of illness behaviour in Bulgaria, seeking evidence of inequalities in access to services and eliciting users' pathways to care. DESIGN: Analysis drew on a representative population survey in Bulgaria (1997). The financial determinants of service use were tested in a multivariate model adjusted first for age, and then for age, marital status and self-reported health. In-depth interviews with users and providers addressed pathways to care, use of connections and other informal strategies to obtain care. RESULTS: As expected, rates of illness vary with income, with highest rates among the poor. After adjustment for illness, consultation rates are relatively equal across income levels, with the exception of worse-off women who tend to consult more. For first contact, there are few differences according to income, with the better off preferring secondary level. Pathways slightly differ, with women more often treated in primary care. Private sector utilization is low. Qualitative research reveals well-established strategies to obtain more advanced care, including use of connections, informal payments and use of emergency services. CONCLUSIONS: An apparent lack of inequalities in access to care conceals a more complex picture in which income and gender influence the pathways taken through the system.",The International journal of health planning and management,2002 Oct-Dec,England,2002,00
12003249,Healthy aging among inner-city men.,"OBJECTIVE: Until now, prospective studies of aging have begun with 50- to 60-year olds, not adolescents. Premature deaths, childhood variables, and alcohol abuse have been often ignored. So has positive aging. As people live longer, gerontology needs to understand the determinants of health as well as illness in the later years. METHOD: The present study follows a cohort of adolescent boys (332 inner-city youths) for 60 years or until death. Complete physical exams were obtained every 5 years and psychosocial data every 2 years. Predictor variables assessed prior to age 50 include six variables reflecting uncontrollable factors--parental social class, environmental strengths, number of family problems, major depression, ancestral longevity, and premorbid physical health at age 50--and six variables reflecting (at least some) personal control: alcohol abuse, smoking, marital stability, body mass index, coping mechanisms, and education. The four outcome variables chosen to assess healthy aging at 70 reflected both ""mind"" and ""body."" They included objectively assessed variables (death and/or disability prior to 70, and objective mental health) and two subjectively assessed variables (perceived instrumental activities of daily living and life enjoyment). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis suggested that positive aging at 70 could be predicted by variables assessed prior to age 50. More hopeful still, if the six variables under some personal control were controlled, depression was the only uncontrollable variable that affected the quality of subjective and objective aging. CONCLUSIONS: First, we may have greater personal control over our biopsychosocial health after retirement than previously recognized. Second, in this cohort, psychiatric rather than sociological predictors appeared more important.",International psychogeriatrics,2001 Dec,England,2001,00
17363221,Psychotic experiences in the general population: a twenty-year prospective community study.,"PURPOSE: Recent work suggested that psychosis might be expressed at subclinical levels. However, the determinants of subclinical psychotic symptoms, the degree of continuity over the life span, and the impact on functioning remain unclear. Thus we analyzed the prevalence, determinants, patterns and impact of subclinical psychotic symptoms in a community cohort over a 20-year period. METHODS: The Zurich Study - a longitudinal community study - started in 1979 with a sample of 591 participants aged 20/21 years. Follow-up interviews were conducted at age 23, 28, 30, 35 and 41. Symptoms were assessed with a semi-structured interview and the SCL90-R. In this analysis, items of the SCL90-R symptom dimensions ""paranoid ideation"" and ""psychoticism"" were examined. RESULTS: Two distinct symptom dimensions of subclinical psychosis became evident, one representing schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, the other representing schizotypal signs. Cannabis use in adolescence was associated specifically with schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, whereas childhood adversity as well as chronic physical or mental disorders in parents contributed to schizotypal signs. Individuals with a persistently high level of either of the two identified symptom dimensions over 20 years experienced significant deficiencies in social achievement and functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of psychotic symptoms in populations is continuous and characterized by differing levels of severity and persistence. A small group of individuals displays persistence of subclinical psychotic symptoms over a period of 20 years. The causes of and pathways to clinical psychotic disorder can be studied long before the disorder becomes clinically relevant.",Schizophrenia research,2007 May,Netherlands,2007,00
11183441,Winning hearts and minds: using psychology to promote voluntary organ donation.,"Recent psychological research concerning determinants of and barriers to organ donation is reviewed with the intention of ascertaining acceptable and potentially effective ways of improving organ retrieval. On the basis of this review, five recommendations are made. (1) Individuals' donation wishes, where explicit, should be decisive. (2) Next of kin should witness donor decisions. (3) Mandated choice should replace voluntary 'opting-in'. (4) Initial donation choices should be repeatedly re-evaluated. (5) Those involved in organ procurement should distance themselves from model of bodies as machines or gardens and embrace models where bodies are viewed as sacred extensions of self. In combination, these recommendations are argued to be preferable in several ways to opt-out/presumed consent procurement options.",Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,2000,Netherlands,2000,00
12166612,Breaking the barriers to optimal glycaemic control--what physicians need to know from patients' perspectives.,"Diabetes is a largely self-managed disease with a major psychosocial impact on the lives of patients and their families. Coping effectively with the stresses related to living with and having to manage diabetes on a daily basis is not a simple function of education, i.e., knowing ""what is right for you."" Clearly, knowledge is a prerequisite, but in no way a guarantee, of making the recommended changes in self-care necessary to achieve optimal glycaemic control. To understand patients' self-care behaviour, we need to take into account various psychological and social factors. Behavioural research findings underscore the role of attitudes and illness beliefs as determinants of patients' health behaviours. For example, misperceptions regarding the seriousness and controllability of diabetes can inhibit active participation of the patient in the treatment. A reluctance to start insulin therapy can be observed in patients with type 2 diabetes who have poor glycaemic control on maximum dosage of oral hypoglycaemic agents. This phenomenon of ""psychological insulin resistance"" clearly demonstrates how even irrational beliefs can impact health outcomes. Misconceptions about having to start insulin treatment (""now I am seriously ill"") are often linked to negative emotions, e.g. anger and fear. Negativistic attitudes and low self-efficacy expectations are not uncommon among people with diabetes, precipitated and maintained by repeated experiences of failure to ""master"" the diabetes and achieve satisfactory diabetes control. Ultimately, cumulative negative experiences can result in a state of ""learned helplessness"" or ""diabetes burnout."" Relational conflicts and lack of social support can also seriously hamper patients' self-care behaviours. In addition, contextual factors such as financial barriers and difficulty with access to health care influence peoples' self-care behaviours. In diabetes care, a bio-psychosocial approach to the patient and his or her coping problems is warranted. Learning to understand the patient's perspective will help health care professionals communicate more effectively and tailor the treatment to the needs of the individual.",International journal of clinical practice.

15296585,Factors influencing the breastfeeding decisions of long-term breastfeeders.,"Understanding determinants of mothers' decisions regarding long-term breastfeeding is important for the promotion of breastfeeding for up to 12 months postpartum and beyond. In this longitudinal infant feeding study, the theory of planned behavior was used to explain the intended and actual breastfeeding duration of 80 participants who were breastfeeding 9-month-old infants. Participants perceived less approval for breastfeeding the longer they breastfed. Perceived approval did not explain prenatal intended duration but strongly explained intended duration at 9 months postpartum. The amount of control mothers perceived they had over breastfeeding, however, explained both prenatal and 9-month breastfeeding duration intentions. Reasons for weaning between 9 and 12 months reflected the effects of perceived control but not of perceived approval. These results suggest the need for (1) interventions to increase the social acceptability of long-term breastfeeding and (2) ongoing breastfeeding guidance and support for long-term breastfeeders.",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,2004 Aug,United States,2004,00
16171258,Determinants of dental service utilization among 2 to 11-year-old California children.,"OBJECTIVE: The 2001 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) was designed to elicit population-based estimates about health care access and insurance coverage. This study aimed to determine factors associated with dental service utilization among children ages 2 to 11 years in California. METHODS: CHIS was a random digit dialing telephone survey. Interviews were conducted with the adult in the household that was most knowledgeable about the child's care, and information was collected on the child's last dental visit. RESULTS: Data on dental visits were collected on 10,569 children ages 2-11 years. In 2001, 73.5 (+/- 0.6)% of children had a dental visit, 58.2 (+/- 0.6)% a preventive dental visit, while 18.3 (+/- 0.5)% had never visited the dentist. Nearly 1 million children had never visited the dentist, primarily children ages 2-5 years. Overall, 76.3 (+/- 0.6)% of children had dental insurance. Children with a past-year dental visit were likely to be school age, insured and from high-income households. Other predictors of utilization were the responding adult's age and educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Dental service utilization is determined by a mix of parental, child and household factors.",Journal of public health dentistry,2005 Summer,United States,2005,00
10951443,Fatigue and its impact on patients with myasthenia gravis.,"We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population.",Muscle & nerve,2000 Sep,United States,2000,00
20041036,HIV Prevention Research: Are We Meeting the Needs of African American Men Who Have Sex With Men?,"Two decades of HIV prevention efforts with men who have sex with men (MSM) have not eliminated the risk of new HIV infections in this vulnerable population. Indeed, current incidence rates in African American MSM are similar to those usually only seen in developing countries. A review of the existing literature suggests that the prevention research agenda for Black MSM could benefit from reframing conceptualization of risk as a function of individual properties to a broad consideration of social and interpersonal determinants. Studies that investigate dyadic and social-level influences on African American MSM's relationships are needed. This includes research explicating the diversity existing within the categorizations of Black MSM with respect to perceived identity (gay, bisexual, ""men on the down low,"" ""homo thugz""), constructions of masculinity, sexual scripts, sources of social support, and perceived norms and expectations. Recommendations are proposed for a research agenda focusing on linkages between interpersonal and social-structural determinants of HIV risk.",The Journal of black psychology,2004,United States,2004,00
17578487,Perinatal and socioeconomic determinants of breastfeeding duration in very preterm infants.,"AIM: To describe the impact of prematurity, size at birth, neonatal disorders and the families' socioeconomic status (SES) on breastfeeding duration in mothers of very preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective population-based cohort study. Data on breastfeeding, registered in databases in two Swedish counties in 1993-2001, were matched with data from two national registries: the Medical Birth Registry and Statistics Sweden. Mothers of 225 very preterm singleton infants were identified and included. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the mothers breastfed at 2 months, 62% at 4 months, 45% at 6 months, 22% at 9 months and 12% at 12 months. Prematurity, size at birth and neonatal disorders did not show an effect on breastfeeding duration. Being adversely exposed to any of the SES factors (maternal education, unemployment benefit, social welfare and equivalent disposable income in the household) was significantly associated with earlier weaning up to 6 months of infants' postnatal age. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows new and noteworthy results concerning breastfeeding duration in mothers of very preterm infants, which was not influenced by degree of prematurity, size at birth or neonatal disorders but was affected by SES. This highlights the need for improved support of socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers, during and after the hospital stay.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2007 Aug,Norway,2007,00
18716614,Long-term outcome of presymptomatic testing in Huntington disease.,"Our study on long-term outcome of presymptomatic testing for Huntington disease had two aims: the comparison of the psychological well-being and social adjustment of carriers and non-carriers of the mutation, and the identification of psychological determinants to improve care/support of testees. We performed a cross-sectional study of 351 persons who underwent presymptomatic testing. Those who had motor signs were excluded from the comparison of asymptomatic carrier and non-carriers. A structured interview including five self-report scales and the MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory) was proposed to detect a psychopathology or problem with social adjustment.We interviewed 119 testees (53%), 62 non-carriers and 57 carriers after a mean delay of 3.7 years (range: 0.32 to 8.9) after their result. Depression was frequent in asymptomatic carriers (58%). Interestingly, the self reported impact of the test showed that 27% of non-carriers did not cope well with a favourable result, and a significant percentage of non-carriers (24%) were depressed during follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed that only a previous episode of depression was predictive of depression after genetic testing in both carriers and non-carriers of the HD mutation (P<0.0001).Psychological support is necessary for all testees regardless of the result of their presymptomatic test, because psychiatric care is often needed by both carriers and non-carriers.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2009 Feb,England,2009,00
17099123,Access to health care and hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions.,"Hospitalization for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSH) is an accepted indicator of access to health care and avoidable morbidity. Accessible care of reasonable quality should reduce ACSH. Little research has examined the indicator's external validity. We calculated standardized ACSH rates for 32 areas of Victoria, Australia (population 4.4 million). A representative survey measured access, disease prevalence, propensity to seek care, disease burden, social determinants of health services use, and behavioral risk factors. Regression analyses compared self-rated access with ACSH rates. Independent of prevalence, propensity to seek care, disease burden, and physician supply, better access was associated with lower ACSH rates. Results provide support for the ACSH indicator. When rural residence was considered, the covariate measuring access was not significant. However, rural residence also may contribute importantly to access. Results suggest both the complexity of the meaning of access and the desirability of further research to validate the ACSH indicator.",Medical care research and review : MCRR,2006 Dec,United States,2006,00
20024758,Gender differences in unsafe sexual behavior among young people in urban Mali.,"We developed gender-specific explanatory models for unsafe sexual behavior among unmarried young people living in urban West Africa using a culturally adapted instrument which addresses personal, relational and socio-cognitive factors. Data were collected on condom use and number of sexual partners, and on their potential determinants, using in-person interviews on a heterogeneous sample of in-school and out-of-school young women (n=185) and (n=214) men who reported ever having had sexual intercourse. Recruitment was done at various sites in 21 randomly selected neighborhoods in Bamako. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to identify determinants of lack of condom at last sex and having more than one partner in the last six months and to test for interactions with gender. Similar percentages of men (40%) and women (46%) reported not using a condom at last sex. However, more men (64%) reported multiple partnering in the last six months than women (32%). Our findings suggest that the context of sexual debut, social status, relation to peers and family as well as attitudinal, normative and behavioral control constructs may influence young men and women's sexual behavior, but that pathways leading to unsafe sex are different across genders. Our findings also show that factors associated with condom use and sexual partnering are distinct. Earlier sexual debut seems to be risk-inducing in women while risk-reducing in men. Poor communication with peers and receiving money from sexual partner were associated with lack of condom use in women. High behavioral control was associated with fewer sexual partners in men. Determinants of unsafe sexual behavior were found at the social, interpersonal and individual levels for both men and women, but notable gender differentials existed. These findings underscore the importance of addressing gender as a crucial factor shaping HIV-risk profiles.",AIDS care,2009 Aug,England,2009,00
17157105,The determinants and circumstances of use of emergency contraceptive pills in France in the context of direct pharmacy access.,"BACKGROUND: In France, the 1999 introduction of a dedicated emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) available without a prescription has resulted in a 72% increase in its use over the past 5 years, especially among younger women. METHODS: We used a population-based health survey conducted in 1999 and in 2004 to examine the changes in the determinants of lifetime ECP use among women aged between 15 and 24 years. We also explored the determinants and circumstances of recent use of ECPs in 2004 among women aged between 15 and 44 years who are at risk for unplanned pregnancy. RESULTS: In 1999, 14.6% of women aged between 15 and 24 years had ever used ECPs; this proportion rose to 31.7% in 2004. Results show consistent patterns of lifetime ECP use in 1999 and in 2004, with greater use among higher-educated women and women living in large cities. In 2004, 22% of women were using no contraceptive at the time they used ECPs and 84% resumed use of a regular contraceptive after ECP use. However, 5.5% had unprotected intercourse after taking ECPs in the same menstrual cycle and in the next. CONCLUSION: Despite direct pharmacy access, differences in ECP use remain by social and residential status. Emergency contraceptive pills were used as a backup method in case of contraceptive failure and did not impede the use of subsequent regular contraception.",Contraception,2006 Dec,United States,2006,00
11825636,Iron stores in low-income pregnant Mexican women at term.,"BACKGROUND: Iron stores can be depleted during pregnancy. Serum ferritin is the most useful non-invasive test to assess iron stores in women of reproductive age. Iron status of pregnant Mexican women at term from a low-income group was investigated through serum ferritin determinations. METHODS: Hemoglobin and serum ferritin were measured in 201 low-income urban women with at-term pregnancy receiving attention at a public university hospital. Hemoglobin cut-off value was 110.0 g/L. Depending on their serum ferritin concentration, women were divided into three groups: group I, iron deficiency, serum ferritin <12 microg/L; group II, borderline iron stores, serum ferritin >or=12 microg/L and <30 microg/L, and group III, normal iron stores, serum ferritin >or=30 microg/L. RESULTS: Mean SF value in the entire group was 7.0 +/- 6.4 microg/L, with a mean Hb of 110.1 +/- 15.8 g/L. One hundred seventy-two women (85.6%) had empty iron stores. Ninety-two women (46%) in the entire group had iron deficiency anemia, as did 79 (46%) of the 172 iron-deficient women. During their pregnancy, 165 women (82%) did not ingest any supplemental iron and 131 (65%) did not receive any prenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: We documented a high prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, together with practically no prenatal care utilization and no supplemental iron ingestion in this low-income group. A serum ferritin concentration >or=12 microg/L was always accompanied by a normal hemoglobin concentration. These data suggest that prenatal care and iron supplementation may be considered as major determinants of maternal iron stores to prevent iron deficiency anemia.",Archives of medical research,2002 Jan-Feb,United States,2002,00
18769194,The impact of allergy on atopic eczema from data from epidemiological studies.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aimed to review the association between atopic eczema and allergic sensitization and food allergy and its determinants on the basis of current epidemiological literature. RECENT FINDINGS: About 50% of children with atopic eczema and about 35% of adults are sensitized to common allergens. Gender, geography (e.g. East and West Germany), and socioeconomic factors determine the proportion of atopic eczema with allergic sensitization. Allergic sensitization in addition to atopic eczema obviously increases the risk for respiratory allergies. Sensitization to house dust mites seems to be important and clinically relevant for atopic eczema. Population-based studies on the association between food allergy and atopic eczema are limited. Although, up to 40% of children in hospital settings react to certain food allergens by a flare-up of their atopic eczema, there is an indication that on a population basis, adults with atopic eczema do only react occasionally with a worsening of their skin disease due to food allergens. SUMMARY: Atopic eczema is not necessarily associated with allergic sensitization. Sensitization to house dust mites, however, seems to be clinically relevant. The impact of food allergy on atopic eczema is difficult to assess on the basis of epidemiological studies and more detailed studies are needed.",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,2008 Oct,United States,2008,00
20024760,"Household impacts of AIDS: using a life course approach to identify effective, poverty-reducing interventions for prevention, treatment and care.","A life course approach was used to assess household level impacts and inform interventions around HIV risk and AIDS vulnerability across seven major age-related stages of life. Our focus was sub-Saharan Africa. We provided a qualitative review of evidence from published literature, particularly multicountry reviews on impacts of AIDS, on determinants of risk and vulnerability, and reports of large surveys. Areas of potential stress from birth to old age in households affected by AIDS, and interventions for dealing with these specific stresses were identified. While specific interventions for HIV are important at different stages, achieving survival and development outcomes demands a wider set of health, social security and development interventions. One way to determine the priorities amongst these actions is to give weighting to interventions that address factors that have latent impacts later in life, which interrupt accumulating risk, or that change pathways to reduce the risk of both immediate and later stress. This qualitative review suggested that interventions, important for life cycle transitions in generalised epidemics where HIV risk and AIDS vulnerability is high, lie within and outside the health sector, and suggested examples of such interventions.",AIDS care,2009 Aug,England,2009,00

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation ward at an urban community hospital in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 326 inpatients admitted for rehabilitation poststroke. INTERVENTION: Multidisciplinary rehabilitation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Discharge home versus nursing home. RESULTS: A total admission FIM score of 75 or lower was associated with a higher probability of nursing home discharge. Married patients with a total FIM admission score of 75 or lower were significantly more likely to be discharged home, after adjusting for immigrant status, type and side of stroke, sex, and age (odds ratio, 6.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-22.40; P<.01). This effect was also observed for low motor and cognition components of FIM admission score. The effect of immigrant status did not remain significant after adjusting for marital status. Area-based SES and stroke characteristics did not substantially attenuate the relationship between immigrant status, marital status, and discharge location. CONCLUSIONS: Marital status is a significant determinant of discharge destination. Immigrant status and area-based SES were not significant predictors of discharge disposition.",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2007 Jun,United States,2007,00
18649984,Does place explain racial health disparities? Quantifying the contribution of residential context to the Black/white health gap in the United States.,"The persistence of the black health disadvantage has been a puzzling component of health in the United States in spite of general declines in rates of morbidity and mortality over the past century. Studies that have focused on well-established individual-level determinants of health such as socio-economic status and health behaviors have been unable to fully explain these disparities. Recent research has begun to focus on other factors such as racism, discrimination, and segregation. Variation in neighborhood context-socio-demographic composition, social aspects, and built environment-has been postulated as an additional explanation for racial disparities, but few attempts have been made to quantify its overall contribution to the black/white health gap. This analysis is an attempt to generate an estimate of place effects on explaining health disparities by utilizing data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (1989-1994), combined with a methodology for identifying residents of the same blocks both within and across NHIS survey cross-sections. Our results indicate that controlling for a single point-in-time measure of residential context results in a roughly 15-76% reduction of the black/white disparities in self-rated health that were previously unaccounted for by individual-level controls. The contribution of residential context toward explaining the black/white self-rated health gap varies by both age and gender such that contextual explanations of disparities decline with age and appear to be smaller among females.",Social science & medicine (1982),2008 Oct,England,2008,00
17903329,Prevention of overweight and obesity: a Spanish approach.,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered a major public health issue in most developed countries nowadays. This paper provides an overview of current population data available in Spain and the approach to develop preventive strategies in the country. METHODS: Review of population data available is based on individually measured weight and height as well as determinants. On this basis, the approach used in the country to develop preventive strategies is discussed. RESULTS: According to the DORICA study, the prevalence of obesity (BMI >or=30 kg m-2) is 15.5% in Spanish adults aged 25-60 years (13.2% in men and 17.5% in women). Obesity rates are higher among women aged 45 years and older, low social class, living in semi-urban places. Population estimates for the prevalence of obesity in Spanish children and young people based on the enKid study are 13.9% for the whole group. In this study, overweight and obesity is related to absence of breastfeeding, low consumption of fruit and vegetables, high consumption of cakes, buns, softdrinks and butchery products, low physical activity levels and a positive association with time spent watching TV. In 2005, the Spanish Ministry of Health jointly with the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition launched the multifaceted NAOS strategy for nutrition, physical activity and the prevention of obesity. The important role of the family and the school setting as well as the responsibility of the Health Administration and Pediatric Care in the prevention of obesity is highlighted in the document. The need for environmental actions is recognised. The PERSEO programme, a multicomponent school-based intervention project is part of the strategy currently in place. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a public health issue in Spain. A national multifaceted strategy was launched to counteract the problem. Environmental and policy actions are a priority. Young children and their families are among the main target groups.",Public health nutrition,2007 Oct,England,2007,00

It is clear that there are social, environmental, biologic, genetic, and other determinants leading to disparities in the rate of coronary heart disease among different ethnic and racial groups. Many epidemiologic studies have characterized the social and environmental factors leading to these differences, but there has been relatively limited investigation of the potential biologic and genetic factors involved. In this review, we will summarize currently available data on ethnic differences in cardiac risk factors, vascular biology, and genetic determinants of atherosclerosis.",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,2004,United States,2004,00
11676587,"Epidemiology of smoking in Ukraine, 2000.","BACKGROUND: A clear, up-to-date picture of smoking prevalence and its determinants is needed to inform the development of an effective tobacco control policy in Ukraine, particularly given the way in which the tobacco industry has targeted post-Soviet countries since transition. METHODS: A nationally representative household survey was undertaken in Ukraine in February 2000. RESULTS: Data were available on 1,590 individuals (response rate 72%). Fifty-seven percent of men and 10% of women were current smokers and an additional 21 and 7%, respectively, were ex-smokers. Smoking behavior has changed considerably over successive generations, with an increase in the proportion of women smoking and a reduction in the mean age at first smoking. Factors associated with smoking include young age, urban residence (among women), and material hardship, particularly unemployment. Involvement in social networks appears to reduce the probability of smoking. Smoking commonly occurs in public places and smokers differ from nonsmokers in their health beliefs about smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of smoking among men are already high and among young women are increasing rapidly. Unless an effective tobacco policy response is developed to address the issues identified, tobacco will continue to make an increasingly large contribution to premature morbidity and mortality in Ukraine.",Preventive medicine,2001 Nov,United States,2001,00
10996563,Evaluation of sleepiness in epilepsy.,"Excessive daytime sleepiness often complicates the clinical picture of epilepsy, facilitating the occurrence of seizures and aggravating cognitive disabilities and/or behavioral problems. Thus it further adversely affects social and working activities of epileptic subjects. Both unstructured and structured clinical reports documented a not negligible proportion of epilepsy patients suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness. Studies based on neurophysiological testing such as Multiple Sleep Latency Test or Maintenance Wakefulness Test revealed a degree of daytime sleepiness tendency in epilepsy patients greater than that they subjectively estimate. Antiepileptic drugs play a remarkable role in determining drowsiness in epilepsy patients and they are generally viewed as the only cause of sleepiness in these patients. However excessive daytime sleepiness has been documented in epilepsy patients before starting any drug treatment or after its discontinuation. Both clinical and neurophysiological studies have clearly documented the possible role of seizure occurrence and of co-morbidity as determinants of excessive daytime sleepiness in epilepsy patients. Nocturnal sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness have been reported in temporal lobe and frontal lobe epilepsy, namely nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Some recent reports have stressed that obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movements during sleep can significantly account for sleepiness complaints in epilepsy patients; most of the antiepileptic drugs can worsen obstructive sleep apnea. To date the evaluation of daytime sleepiness of epilepsy patients in clinical practice has been based mainly or exclusively on clinical reports. To improve our understanding of this symptom in epilepsy patients, the use of standardized sleepiness scales should be encouraged. Patients with persistent daytime sleepiness without a clear cause-and-effect relationship with antiepiletic drugs treatment or in whom a coincident sleep pathology is suspected, should be investigated by means of neurophysiological testing such as Multiple Sleep Latency Test or Maintenance Wakefulness Test.",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2000 Sep,Netherlands,2000,00

Many of the identified barriers to health related to government policies and actions. Cutbacks in federal transfers to provinces and provincial cutbacks in funding for agencies, reductions in social assistance, ending of new social housing, and other policy changes were seen as negatively impacting the health of the community and its members. These perceptions were remarkably consistent with emerging findings concerning the determinants of health.

16151763,Persistence and determinants of statin therapy among middle-aged patients free of cardiovascular disease.,"AIM: Statins have been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality both in patients with coronary artery disease and in those with dyslipidemia when they are taken regularly. Middle-aged patients have the highest level of forecasting benefit, and little is known about the persistence rate of these therapies in a real-life setting.Objective. To evaluate the persistence rate of middle-aged patients initiating statin therapy as well as its relation to patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: A cohort of 25,733 patients was reconstructed from prescription data recorded in the Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec administrative database. All patients aged 50-64 years old who received at least one statin prescription between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000 for a new intention of treatment for dyslipidemia were included in the cohort and followed up until June 30, 2001. The date of the first prescription of statin was defined as the index date. The cumulative persistence rate was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox regression models were used to estimate the rate ratio of ceasing statins after adjustment. RESULTS: Mean age of patients initiating statin agents was 58 years; 39%were male, 24% received social assistance, 19% had diabetes, 30% had hypertension and 11% had a respiratory disease at cohort entry. Persistence with statin therapy fell to 67% in the first 6 months after treatment and continued to decline over the next 3 years to 39%. At 3 years, persistence varied significantly with statin agents. After controlling for individual patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, we found that patients who were prescribed fluvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin had a higher rate of cessation than those on simvastatin and pravastatin. The adjusted rate ratio of ceasing statin agents in patients with other risk factors of cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes (HR: 0.78; 0.75-0.82) or hypertension (HR: 0.72; 0.69-0.74), demonstrated a lower cessation rate. We observed lower persistence in patients who used the greatest number of pharmacies and prescribing physicians. CONCLUSION: This analysis indicates that barriers to persistence occur early in the therapeutic course. Overall persistence with statins is low, particularly among patients with few other cardiovascular risk factors.",European journal of clinical pharmacology,2005 Oct,Germany,2005,00
15982199,Sustained nurse home visiting in early childhood: exploring Australian nursing competencies.,"Abstract There is strong evidence that a comprehensive model of sustained nurse home visiting (SNHV) in early childhood can improve child and family outcomes for vulnerable and at-risk families. There is also evidence that nurse home visitors experience challenges in delivering SNHV. This article aims to identify the nursing competencies needed for delivering a comprehensive model of SNHV and highlight the areas where further competency development is required. Qualitative analysis compared the content and language of published registered generalist and child and family nursing competency statements for Australian nurses with the work experiences of a team of community-based nurses delivering SNHV. Development of competencies is needed in the areas of (a) enhanced knowledge of child development, social determinants of health, and broader outcomes for individuals and populations; (b) advanced skills in fine observation, anticipatory guidance, negotiating, modelling and experimentation, holistic case management, and working in interdisciplinary teams; and (c) attitudinal competency for working ""with"" and supporting risk taking. The current published competencies for general and child and family nurses do not encompass the different and advanced competencies required for performing SNHV. Competency development and associated nurse training and support are needed for delivery of quality SHNV services.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",2005 May-Jun,United States,2005,00
18834529,Determinants of female sexual function in inflammatory bowel disease: a survey based cross-sectional analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Sexual function is impaired in women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as compared to normal controls. We examined disease specific determinants of different aspects of low sexual function. METHODS: Women with IBD aged 18 to 65 presenting to the university departments of internal medicine and surgery were included. In addition, a random sample from the national patients organization was used (separate analyses). Sexual function was assessed by the Brief Index of Sexual Function in Women, comprising seven different domains of sexuality. Function was considered impaired if subscores were <-1 on a z-normalized scale. Results are presented as age adjusted odds ratios with 95% CI based on multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: 336 questionnaires were included (219 Crohn's disease, 117 ulcerative colitis). Most women reported low sexual activity (63%; 17% none at all, 20% moderate or high activity). Partnership satisfaction was high in spite of low sexual interest in this group. Depressed mood was the strongest predictor of low sexual function scores in all domains. Urban residency and higher socioecomic status had a protective effect. Disease activity was moderately associated with low desire (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.2). Severity of the disease course impacted most on intercourse frequency (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.7). Lubrication problems were more common in smokers (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1). CONCLUSION: Mood disturbances and social environment impacted more on sexual function in women with IBD than disease specific factors. Smoking is associated with lubrication problems.",BMC gastroenterology,2008 Oct 3,England,2008,00
20168034,Social determinants of children's health in urban areas in India.,"Children of the urban poor in India suffer a much poorer health status than the urban non-poor, influenced to a large extent by social determinants. In this paper, National Family Health Survey-3 (2005-06) data were analyzed to assess the health status of urban poor children vis-a-vis the non-poor, and to identify the social determinants precipitating disparities. The analysis shows sharp disparity between child health indicators between urban poor and non-poor. Key findings include under-five mortality per thousand (urban poor 72.7 and non-poor 41.8) and children under-five underweight for age (urban poor 47% and non-poor 26.2%). Significant demographic and social correlates of child health in urban areas included poverty, gender, caste status, religion, mother's educational attainment, occupational status of parents, and women's autonomy in the household. They influenced different facets of child health, such as nutritional status and access to immunization.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,2009,United States,2009,00
16539970,[Screening induced by health services: impact and consequences. Ethical issues].,"The main aim of screening is to identify people with an increased probability to benefit from preventive interventions, generally from secondary prevention but also from primary prevention activities. The goal is to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment in order to modify positively the prognosis (the former case), or to recognize people exposed to risk factors which increase the incidence rate of disease, and then to prevent the disease (the latter case). Good intentions are not enough to achieve good results in terms of effectiveness, safety, efficiency or equity. It is necessary to have a systematic assessment of the consequences of screening, particularly on the impact on peoples health and on the health services. Due to the diversity of types of screenings that are done, it is very difficult to estimate the net impact caused by their implementation. Moreover, the changes in the health of a population depend on many factors other than health service interventions. Thus, it is very important to determine the effectiveness and safety of the screening methods that are most frequently applied. Unfortunately, assessment of the benefits and the harm potentially caused by preventive interventions has not been done often. In Spain only a few partial assessments have been published, and they focus on the activities and the processes themselves rather than the final outcomes. Given that screening activities are carried out in health care services, and that the populations screened are mostly healthy people, the ethical issues have great importance when health policies are designed and implemented. Thus, it is recommended that screenings activities be analyzed applying the ethical principles of autonomy, benefit, safety and justice. If any screening program cannot reasonably satisfy these principles then they should be removed from the list of public health activities that are financed by public resources. In the same sense, all screening procedures offered to the population must be subjected to a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness, safety, efficiency and equity in terms of how the procedure would be applied. Lastly, to achieve an effective implementation of the principle of autonomy as well the desired goal of empowering the population to exercise some control over their determinants of health, it is recommended to explore new ways of achieving active citizen participation to establish preventive priorities and to assess the impact of screening interventions.",Gaceta sanitaria,2006 Mar,Spain,2006,00
12958207,Explaining happiness.,"What do social survey data tell us about the determinants of happiness? First, that the psychologists' setpoint model is questionable. Life events in the nonpecuniary domain, such as marriage, divorce, and serious disability, have a lasting effect on happiness, and do not simply deflect the average person temporarily above or below a setpoint given by genetics and personality. Second, mainstream economists' inference that in the pecuniary domain ""more is better,"" based on revealed preference theory, is problematic. An increase in income, and thus in the goods at one's disposal, does not bring with it a lasting increase in happiness because of the negative effect on utility of hedonic adaptation and social comparison. A better theory of happiness builds on the evidence that adaptation and social comparison affect utility less in the nonpecuniary than pecuniary domains. Because individuals fail to anticipate the extent to which adaptation and social comparison undermine expected utility in the pecuniary domain, they allocate an excessive amount of time to pecuniary goals, and shortchange nonpecuniary ends such as family life and health, reducing their happiness. There is need to devise policies that will yield better-informed individual preferences, and thereby increase individual and societal well-being.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2003 Sep 16,United States,2003,00

Important differences were observed between places where residences of leptospirosis cases are concentrated and other places in the region. Water supply coverage, solid waste collection, sewerage system coverage and flood risk area were the main determining variables from an initial list of ten. The influence of these unfavorable social and environmental factors is verified hundreds of meters distant from the leptospirosis case residences, demonstrating a necessity to broaden the area of health surveillance practices. The geocoding indicated that some cases did not report contact with flood water, even though they were geographically adjacent to cases who did report this contact. Cases may only report exposures they believe are related to the disease. Geocoding is a useful tool for evaluating such bias in the exposure recall.",International journal of environmental health research,2000 Dec,England,2000,00

19418020,"Social inequality, lifestyles and health - a non-linear canonical correlation analysis based on the approach of Pierre Bourdieu.","OBJECTIVES: Based on the theoretical and empirical approach of Pierre Bourdieu, a multivariate non-linear method is introduced as an alternative way to analyse the complex relationships between social determinants and health. METHODS: The analysis is based on face-to-face interviews with 695 randomly selected respondents aged 30 to 59. Variables regarding socio-economic status, life circumstances, lifestyles, health-related behaviour and health were chosen for the analysis. In order to determine whether the respondents can be differentiated and described based on these variables, a non-linear canonical correlation analysis (OVERALS) was performed. RESULTS: The results can be described on three dimensions; Eigenvalues add up to the fit of 1.444, which can be interpreted as approximately 50 % of explained variance. The three-dimensional space illustrates correspondences between variables and provides a framework for interpretation based on latent dimensions, which can be described by age, education, income and gender. CONCLUSION: Using non-linear canonical correlation analysis, health characteristics can be analysed in conjunction with socio-economic conditions and lifestyles. Based on Bourdieus theoretical approach, the complex correlations between these variables can be more substantially interpreted and presented.",International journal of public health,2009,Switzerland,2009,00
10951443,Fatigue and its impact on patients with myasthenia gravis.,"We have examined fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG) by administering a measure of cognitive and physical fatigue to patients and control subjects before and after administration of a lengthy cognitive battery. Subjects also completed a scale that assessed the impact of fatigue on physical, social, and cognitive function. Results of the study revealed that MG patients experience significantly more cognitive and physical fatigue than do control subjects, and the patients' perceptions of both cognitive and physical fatigue increased significantly following completion of demanding cognitive work. Control subjects reported no significant change in fatigue. Furthermore, MG patients reported that fatigue produced mild to moderate effects on cognitive and social function and moderate effects on physical function. Results from this study indicate that cognitive fatigue is an important symptom of MG and that fatigue produces pervasive impairments in important aspects of patients' lives. Additional studies are needed to understand the neurobehavioral determinants of cognitive fatigue in this population.",Muscle & nerve,2000 Sep,United States,2000,00

CONTENT: This paper illustrates how Program-linked Information Management by Integrative-participatory Research Approach (PIMIRA) as practised under KPH has been implemented within Trans-Nzoia District, Kenya to enhance community-based health initiatives. It shows how this model is strategically being scaled-up from one community to another in the management of political, social, cultural and economic determinants (barriers and enhancers) of health. OBJECTIVE: Target rural communities in the development of a community-based health information management and feedback initiatives that can provide insights on the social, cultural, political and economic determinants of health for utilization in informed health service management. KEY FINDINGS AND ACHIEVEMENTS: 1. Cues for health seeking and health service utilization are determined by the social, cultural, political and economic factors as seen by the individual and as defined by the community but not due to the pathological nature of the illness. 2. Establishment of community-based health surveillance and health action initiatives as the best practices in transferring health as a resource that can be 'owned and guarded' by the community. 3. Establishment of Healthy Villages Initiative (HVI) through which health service delivery and scale-up can be sustained at the community level. 4. Provision of actionable health information necessary for health planning and evaluation of preventive health programs thorough PIMIRA. CONCLUSION: It has been realized that for every one person who visits a health facility for medication, there are nine others who had the same condition but sought health care from other sources including self-medication and five others who never sought health care. Innovative means of involving the community in health information management and utilization such as PIMIRA are hence the best ways of guaranteeing equitable delivery of health services that are accessible and sustainable by the community.",International journal for equity in health,2005 Jun 24,England,2005,00
10862383,Genetic technologies and achieving health for populations.,"The remarkable progress in genetics over the last 50 years has led to the development of genetic technologies to identify or alter genes in living organisms, and these technologies can be applied to people. This article presents background information on the role of genetics in human disease, outlines the technologies, and discusses the sources of the strong push for a genetic approach to ill-health and some implications and harmful consequences of using these genetic technologies. The determinants of most diseases are complex and are embedded in a social context. To focus on only one strand of this web--the genetic strand--because it is one that may be amenable to biological/pharmaceutical treatment, although profitable for industry, does not address other important determinants of health and may lead to a harmful overemphasis on genetic approaches. The author outlines some limitations to the potential contribution of genetic technologies to population health across the globe and the need for policy development if these technologies are to have an appropriate place in health care.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2000,United States,2000,00
11766457,[Determinants of professional status among physicians in Mexico].,"OBJECTIVE: This study explored a number of factors that determine the professional status of physicians in Mexico. METHODS: Using structural equation modelling techniques, causal models were developed to investigate the determinants of professional status within the medical field. RESULTS: The findings suggest that the proposed stratification process in the causal model has empirical support. In the prestige dimension, there is an adscriptive effect of gender, the resultant gender segregated the Mexican medical profession; in addition the achievement effects of medical education and work history within significant occupational and bureaucratic structures. In the economic dimension, the ascriptive effect of gender and the resultant differential in income and job opportunities of female physicians exist. CONCLUSIONS: Although social origin seems to have a weak effect on the dimensions of professional status, it is suggested that both medical education and employment history were both significant positive determinants of professional status in the Mexican medical system. On the other hand, there are still significant gender inequities in the stratification structure of the medical profession.",Gaceta medica de Mexico,2001 Nov-Dec,Mexico,2001,00
19077000,"Adolescent leadership and adulthood fertility: revisiting the ""central theoretical problem of human sociobiology"".","Human motivation for social status may reflect an evolved psychological adaptation that increased individual reproductive success in the evolutionary past. However, the association between status striving and reproduction in contemporary humans is unclear. It may be hypothesized that personality traits related to status achievement increase fertility even if modern indicators of socioeconomic status do not. We examined whether four subcomponents of type-A personality--leadership, hard-driving, eagerness, and aggressiveness--assessed at the age of 12 to 21 years predicted the likelihood of having children by the age of 39 in a population-based sample of Finnish women and men (N=1,313). Survival analyses indicated that high adolescent leadership increased adulthood fertility in men and women, independently of education level and urbanicity of residence.

12494745,Psychosocial determinants of cigarette smoking among college students.,"Although the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adolescents and adults consistently declined in the past decade, smoking among college students rose sharply. To reduce the morbidity and premature mortality caused by smoking, antismoking interventions need to target this vulnerable population. Anonymous self-report data were collected from a convenience sample of 224 college students who voluntarily completed a Web-based survey developed to assess the relation of risk-taking tendency, depression, social normative beliefs, and smoking resistance self-efficacy to cigarette smoking behavior. Employing structural analysis using LISREL (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1996), all 4 factors were confirmed as determinants of smoking. Resistance self-efficacy, the only direct antecedent, mediated the link to risk-taking tendency, depression, and social normative beliefs. Antismoking interventions that focus on enhancing refusal skills and are delivered to homogeneous groups are proposed as an effective approach to reducing cigarette smoking among college students.",Journal of community health nursing,2002 Winter,United States,2002,00
11351050,Sickness absence in hospital physicians: 2 year follow up study on determinants.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify determinants of sickness absence in hospital physicians. METHODS: The Poisson regression analyses of short (1--3 days) and long (>3 days) recorded spells of sickness absence relating to potential determinants of sickness absence were based on a 2 year follow up period and cohorts of 447 (251 male and 196 female) physicians and 466 controls (female head nurses and ward sisters). RESULTS: There were no differences in health outcomes, self rated health status, prevalence of chronic illness, and being a case on the general health questionnaire (GHQ), between the groups but physicians took one third to a half the sick leave of controls. All the health outcomes were strongly associated with sickness absence in both groups. Of work related factors, teamwork had the greatest effect on sickness absence in physicians but not in the controls. Physicians working in poorly functioning teams were at 1.8 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.3 to 3.0) times greater risk of taking long spells than physicians working in well functioning teams. Risks related to overload, heavy on call responsibility, poor job control, social circumstances outside the workplace, and health behaviours were smaller. CONCLUSION: This is the first study of hospital physicians to show the association between recorded sickness absence and factors across various areas of life. In this occupational group, sickness absence is strongly associated with health problems, and the threshold for taking sick leave is high. Poor teamwork seems to contribute to the sickness absenteeism of hospital physicians even more than traditional psychosocial risks-such as overload and low job control. These findings may have implications for training and health promotion in hospitals.",Occupational and environmental medicine,2001 Jun,England,2001,00
11804992,Social environment influences the progression of atherosclerosis in the watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit.,"BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence that emotionally stressful behavior can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis, there is less data to support the notion that affiliative social behavior can slow disease progression. The present study examines the influence of social environment on the progression of atherosclerosis in the Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, a model that spontaneously develops lesions because of a genetic defect in lipoprotein clearance. METHODS AND RESULTS: WHHL rabbits were assigned to 1 of 3 social or behavioral groups: an unstable group, in which unfamiliar rabbits were paired daily, with the pairing switched each week; a stable group, in which littermates were paired daily for the entire study; and an individually caged group. The stable group exhibited more affiliative social behavior and less agonistic behavior than the unstable group and significantly less aortic atherosclerosis than each of the other 2 groups. Although the unstable and individually caged groups had comparable aortic lesion areas, the severity of the disease progressed faster in the unstable group, as indexed by a larger area of calcification and increased fibrous cap thickness in complex lesions. The unstable group showed increased agonistic behavior and signs of chronic adrenocortical and gonadal activation, whereas the individually caged group was relatively sedentary, had low glucocorticoid levels, and was hyperinsulinemic compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that social environment can slow, as well as accelerate, the progression of atherosclerosis. It also emphasizes the importance of behavioral factors in atherogenesis, even in a model of disease with strong genetic determinants.",Circulation,2002 Jan 22,United States,2002,00
17578487,Perinatal and socioeconomic determinants of breastfeeding duration in very preterm infants.,"AIM: To describe the impact of prematurity, size at birth, neonatal disorders and the families' socioeconomic status (SES) on breastfeeding duration in mothers of very preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective population-based cohort study. Data on breastfeeding, registered in databases in two Swedish counties in 1993-2001, were matched with data from two national registries: the Medical Birth Registry and Statistics Sweden. Mothers of 225 very preterm singleton infants were identified and included. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the mothers breastfed at 2 months, 62% at 4 months, 45% at 6 months, 22% at 9 months and 12% at 12 months. Prematurity, size at birth and neonatal disorders did not show an effect on breastfeeding duration. Being adversely exposed to any of the SES factors (maternal education, unemployment benefit, social welfare and equivalent disposable income in the household) was significantly associated with earlier weaning up to 6 months of infants' postnatal age. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows new and noteworthy results concerning breastfeeding duration in mothers of very preterm infants, which was not influenced by degree of prematurity, size at birth or neonatal disorders but was affected by SES. This highlights the need for improved support of socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers, during and after the hospital stay.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2007 Aug,Norway,2007,00
16813040,Some determinants of changes in preference over time.,"Results of longitudinal studies suggest that the stability of preferences varies across individuals, although it is unclear what variables account for these differences. We extended this work by conducting periodic assessments of preference for leisure activities over 3 to 6 months with 10 adults with developmental disabilities. Although previous research has collectively shown that preferences identified via repeated assessment are highly variable, our results showed that preferences were relatively stable for the majority (80%) of participants. In an attempt to identify some environmental determinants of shifts in preference, we provided extended daily access to high-preference items (preference-weakening manipulation) and paired access to low-preference items with social and edible putative reinforcers during brief sessions (preference-strengthening manipulation). Preference assessments continued over the course of these manipulations with 2 participants. Results showed that changes in preference across time could be produced systematically and suggest that naturally occurring changes in establishing operations or conditioning histories contribute to temporal shifts in preference. Implications for preference assessments, reinforcer usage, and planned attempts to change preferences are discussed.",Journal of applied behavior analysis,2006 Summer,United States,2006,00
19665250,Social determinants of emergency utilization associated with patterns of care.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the emergency room (ER) utilization among disabled Taiwanese older adults with different patterns of care arrangement. METHOD: A national probability sample of 13,957 disabled older adults (aged 50 and above) was recruited. Individual interview data and National Health Insurance administrative data were used to examine the effects of care arrangements on ER utilization 1 year after the baseline interview. RESULTS: One-third (33.5%) of the subjects used emergency room at least once in the follow-up year. The ER utilization rates among individuals living in institutions, in home with foreigner worker, in home with informal caregiver, and in home without caregiver, were 34.5%, 43%, 32.5% and 25% respectively. After controlling for other predisposing, enabling, need factors, and healthcare services use with multivariate logistic regression model, comparing with subjects staying home with informal caregivers, those who were institutionalized were less likely to use ER services during the study year (OR=0.64, 95%CI=0.54-0.76), those who staying home cared by foreigner worker were more likely to use ER services (OR=1.16, 95%CI=1.05-1.29), and those who staying home without caregiver were less likely to use ER services (OR=0.89, 95%CI=0.78-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Disabled older adults staying at home were more likely to use ER compared to institutionalized individuals. More research is needed to identify the unmet healthcare needs and the quality of home care that may explain the high ER utilization rate.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2009 Dec,Ireland,2009,00
17340179,Rising infant mortality in Delaware: an examination of racial differences in secular trends.,"OBJECTIVES: Recent increases in the Delaware Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) have been attributed to a rise in the mortality of very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) infants born to mothers of higher socioeconomic status. This study examines whether the determinants of infant mortality trends in Delaware vary by race. METHODS: Linked birth/infant death cohort files for the two periods 1993-1997 and 1998-2002 were used to evaluate the determinants of infant mortality trends separately for White and Black racial groups. Kitagawa analyses determined the components of race-specific infant mortality trends attributable to changes in both the birthweight distribution and birthweight-specific mortality rates. Maternal characteristics were examined to identify factors associated with IMR changes. RESULTS: Between the two time periods, infant mortality increased 23% among White infants and 17% among Black infants. For both races, the infant mortality increase was explained by increases in the incidence and mortality of VLBW infants, specifically below <500 grams for Blacks and <1,000 grams for Whites. The increased incidence of VLBW deliveries was statistically significant only among Whites, almost 40% of which was explained by an increase in multiple births. For both Whites and Blacks, the increase in VLBW mortality occurred mainly among births to more traditionally advantaged women who were twenty or older, at least high school educated, married, privately insured, had received first trimester prenatal care, and those who delivered multiple births. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that conventional strategies of increasing access to prenatal care among disadvantaged women may be insufficient to reverse recent IMR increases in Delaware, irrespective of race. Future efforts should focus on understanding the causes of the increased infant mortality associated with higher socioeconomic status, including changes in assisted reproductive technology utilization, maternal health status, and obstetric practice.",Maternal and child health journal,2007 Sep,United States,2007,00
18728119,Health literacy and health actions: a review and a framework from health psychology.,"The association between performance on health literacy measures and health outcomes is well established. The next step is to understand the processes through which health literacy affects health. This review introduces a framework drawing on ideas from health psychology and proposing that associations between health literacy and health outcomes could be mediated by a range of health actions involving access and use of health care, patient-provider interactions, and the management of health and illness. The framework outlines routes through which health literacy might affect either health actions themselves or the motivational and volitional determinants that have been identified in social cognition models. The implications of the framework for future research and intervention strategies are discussed.",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,2009 Oct,United States,2009,00
19556325,Older men with higher self-rated socioeconomic status have shorter telomeres.,"BACKGROUND: previous studies examining the relationship between socioeconomic status and telomere length showed conflicting results, one study finding shorter telomere length in subjects with lower socioeconomic status and one showing no relationship. DESIGN: cross-sectional study. SETTING: community-living elderly Chinese in Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: this study examines the relationship between self-rated social economic status and telomere length in Hong Kong Chinese men and women aged 65 years and over living in the community. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: information was collected from 958 men and 978 women regarding possible confounding factors such as the presence of chronic diseases, smoking, physical activity level, dietary intake and body mass index. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR. RESULT: in men only, after adjustment for age and other confounding factors, a higher ranking in community standing was associated with shorter telomere length. CONCLUSION: men with higher self-rated socioeconomic status have shorter telomeres, possibly mediated through psychosocial rather than lifestyle factors or the presence of chronic disease. There may be cultural ethnic and age-related differences in social determinants of health.",Age and ageing,2009 Sep,England,2009,00
12476643,Access to health care in a system transition: the case of Bulgaria.,"OBJECTIVE: Throughout the 1990s, the Soviet-style model in central and eastern Europe that provided free health services has been subject to radical reforms. Socio-economic inequalities have also increased but there is little information on inequalities in health care utilization. This paper examines the pattern of illness behaviour in Bulgaria, seeking evidence of inequalities in access to services and eliciting users' pathways to care. DESIGN: Analysis drew on a representative population survey in Bulgaria (1997). The financial determinants of service use were tested in a multivariate model adjusted first for age, and then for age, marital status and self-reported health. In-depth interviews with users and providers addressed pathways to care, use of connections and other informal strategies to obtain care. RESULTS: As expected, rates of illness vary with income, with highest rates among the poor. After adjustment for illness, consultation rates are relatively equal across income levels, with the exception of worse-off women who tend to consult more. For first contact, there are few differences according to income, with the better off preferring secondary level. Pathways slightly differ, with women more often treated in primary care. Private sector utilization is low. Qualitative research reveals well-established strategies to obtain more advanced care, including use of connections, informal payments and use of emergency services. CONCLUSIONS: An apparent lack of inequalities in access to care conceals a more complex picture in which income and gender influence the pathways taken through the system.",The International journal of health planning and management,2002 Oct-Dec,England,2002,00
14668644,Quality of life in children and families with bleeding disorders.,"Quality of life (QoL) in children and adolescents with bleeding disorders and their families is a relatively new topic. It is important to understand more about QoL in this patient population to evaluate and if necessary to improve the care patients receive. To achieve this aim, a questionnaire to assess patients' QoL in hemophilia was developed and psychometrically tested. Three hundred twenty hemophiliac children and adolescents from six European countries and their families were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding different aspects of their well-being and functioning, as well as their views on hemophilia care. Generic QoL questionnaires showed that children with hemophilia have a higher QoL than other patients with chronic disease, such as asthma/atopic dermatitis and obesity. Several determinants affected patients' QoL (e.g., number of bleeds, social support). Parents' and children's assessments differed with regard to social and emotional aspects of QoL. The study showed that variations in QoL can be explained by clinical and psychosocial factors and suggested that QoL can be assessed and enhanced both by medical and non-medical (e.g., psychological) interventions.",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,2003 Dec,United States,2003,00
15380317,Impact of informal regulation of pollution on water quality in rivers in India.,"In this paper an attempt is made to assess the impact of informal regulation of water pollution on water quality in Indian rivers. For this purpose, an econometric analysis of determinants of water quality in Indian rivers is carried out using water quality (water class) data for 106 monitoring points on 10 important rivers for five years, 1995-1999. To explain variations in water quality, an Ordered Probit model is estimated, in which poll percentage in parliamentary elections, a proxy for the intensity of informal regulation, is taken as one of the main explanatory variables. Rainfall, industrialization, irrigation intensity and fertilizer use are some of the other explanatory variables used in the model to control for the influence of these factors. As expected, river water quality is found to be positively related with rainfall, and negatively related with industrialization, irrigation intensity and fertilizer use. A significant positive relationship is found between poll percentage and water quality, and also between the rate of increase in literacy level in a district and the water quality in rivers flowing through the district. These results point to a significant favorable effect of informal regulation of pollution on water quality in rivers in India.",Journal of environmental management,2004 Nov,England,2004,00
19344503,Social determinants of health in Tunisia: the case-analysis of Ariana.,"BACKGROUND: Few research projects have analyzed how social determinants of health impact cities in North Africa. The sustained growth in these countries has nevertheless proven to exacerbate health disparities and create many social and economic inequalities. This strategic analysis examines selected social determinants of health in a major urban centre of Tunisia, identifies the most influential stakeholders able to influence equity/inequity, and reviews the accomplishments and need for action to foster health equity. METHODS: This analysis was performed through a literature review and participatory research methods that included focus groups discussions and interview with key informants. RESULTS: Access to health care, changes in lifestyles, housing issues and gender-related inequities are prime, socially-determined elements that affect health in Ariana. CONCLUSION: Recognition of emerging health issues is needed along with improved inter and intrasectoral coordination among stakeholders. The community-participatory approach used in this paper proved to be a useful scoping technique for this setting. A similar methodology could be used by other researchers as a first step toward health equity action at a city level.",International journal for equity in health,2009 Apr 3,England,2009,00
16585483,Social interactions in adolescent television viewing.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether social interactions influence the television viewing choices of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. DESIGN: Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey were used to examine the association between individual-level and school-level television choices. An instrumental variables approach was used to solve the simultaneity problem found in models that examine the association between individual and aggregate choices. SETTING: In-home interviews in the United States collected in 1996. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 4532 students in grades 7 through 12 in 132 US public and private schools who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). MAIN EXPOSURE: The reported television viewing choices of an individual's schoolmates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number of hours of television individuals reported viewing in a week. RESULTS: The number of hours of television that adolescents report viewing per week was associated with their peers' reported hours of television viewing. Adjusted for other covariates, a 1-hour increase in average school-level television viewing was associated with an increase in almost half an hour of television viewing at the individual level. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that social interactions within schools influence the hours of television that adolescents report viewing. This finding is important for both future attempts at modeling the determinants of adolescent television viewing and suggestions for future policy interventions. The presence of social interactions implies that interventions that affect the social norms of television viewing within schools could also change individual television viewing. In reducing the number of hours of television watched, these interventions could also positively affect adolescent obesity, emotional problems, and academic achievement.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2006 Apr,United States,2006,00
11359198,"[Influence of socioeconomic factors on the pesticides poisoning, Brazil].","OBJECTIVE: The indiscriminate use of pesticides has been contributing for the environmental quality degradation, as well as it increases the occupational exposures to these products, determining a serious public health problem in rural areas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the exposures of rural workers of Rio de Janeiro State to anticholinesterasic pesticides, through the analyses of the acetylcholinesterase from red cells (AChE) and plasmatic butyrilcholinesterase (BChE) levels. Social-economic factors, such as the educational level of these workers, can strongly influence this situation, reason why the impact of some social-economic indicators and practices of pesticides' use in the human contamination status for rural areas were also evaluated. METHODS: The evaluation of rural workers exposure to pesticides was performed to a random sample of 55 workers among the 300 inhabitants of the study area - five communities of Mage county, RJ. The AChE and BChE activities were determined to these workers. The enzymatic activities were evaluated according to the Ellman's method modified by Oliveira-Silva. Social-economic and pesticides use data were collected by a structured interview. The possible role of social-economic and pesticide use indicators as determinants of the worker's contamination was estimated by multivariate statistic techniques, using the enzymatic activity as the dependent variable and the social-economics pesticides use indicators as independent variables. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The data showed distinct results concerning the incidence of excessive exposure, according to the enzymatic indicator used. In the studied sample, a result of 3.0 % was found for the BChE values, and 41.8 %, according to AChE. Individuals with at least one positive enzymatic indicator result were considered as ""intoxicated"". When these data were compared to the social-economic and pesticides use factors, it was showed the importance of educational level in the prevalence of intoxication. The others indicators studied did not showed any significant and evident correlation.",Revista de saude publica,2001 Apr,Brazil,2001,00
17453425,"Tooth loss in the elderly and its association with nutritional status, socio-economic and lifestyle factors.","OBJECTIVE: Tooth loss impacts on general health and is a risk factor for malnutrition, disability, loss of self-sufficiency, and deterioration in quality of life. The present study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of edentulism and its association with social and lifestyle factors in a population of elderly Italians. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental, social, and disease conditions were evaluated in a large community-based cohort (3054) of elderly subjects (> or =65 years) of both sexes in northern Italy. Logistic regression analyses with stepwise forward selection were performed to estimate the independent contribution of nutritional, socio-economic, and lifestyle variables to dental status. Adjusted ORs and 95% CI were estimated for variables significantly associated with edentulism. RESULTS: The prevalence of edentulism was about 44.0%. It was more pronounced in females and it was twice as prevalent in the 90+ years age group. Among edentulous subjects, 17.5% wore no prostheses. Difficulties in chewing and in swallowing were reported by 47.6% and 13.7% of the subjects, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicates that edentulism was associated with age in both sexes. For women, independently associated risk factors were: years since menopause >23 (OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.37-2.40), number of children >3 (OR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.36-2.80), and living alone (OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.15-1.88). For men, these were serum albumin <40 g/l (OR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.22-2.63), current smoking (OR = 4.01; 95% CI: 2.59-6.20), and former smoking (OR = 3.42; 95% CI: 2.42-4.82). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of edentulism among the elderly Italian population studied was at the high end among Western countries, and higher in women than in men. In women, tooth loss correlated with aging, female events (pregnancies, menopausal status), and living alone. In men, aging and smoking are important determinants of edentulism, which is associated with the risk condition of hypoalbuminemia. Difficulty in chewing was associated with dentition type. In our study, the high prevalence of edentulous subjects without prostheses suggests a need for educational and social measures to improve patients' attitudes to dental care and to encourage the use of prostheses among the elderly.",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,2007 Apr,England,2007,00
11529612,Social disadvantage and variation in the incidence of end-stage renal disease in Australian capital cities.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate variation in the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within Australian capital cities. To explore the relation between the incidence of ESRD and socioeconomic disadvantage. METHODS: We obtained data from the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) regarding 5,013 patients from capital cities who started ESRD treatment between 1 April 1993 and 31 December 1998. We used the postcode at the start of treatment to calculate the average annual incidence of ESRD for each of 51 capital city regions using 1996 Census counts based on place of usual residence. We calculated standardised incidence ratios with 95% confidence intervals for each region. The standardised incidence ratios were examined in relation to the SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-economic Disadvantage (IRSD), derived from the 1996 Census. Low IRSD values indicate more disadvantaged areas. RESULTS: There is significant variation in the standardised incidence of ESRD within capital cities. There was a significant correlation (r=-0.41, p=0.003) between the standardised incidence ratio for ESRD and the SEIFA IRSD. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Capital city areas that are more disadvantaged have a higher incidence of ESRD. Socioeconomic factors may be important determinants of the risk of developing ESRD.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2001 Aug,Australia,2001,00
16904006,Determinants of fruit and vegetable consumption among children and adolescents: a review of the literature. Part I: Quantitative studies.,"BACKGROUND: In order to more effectively promote fruit and vegetable intake among children and adolescents, insight into determinants of intake is necessary. We conducted a review of the literature for potential determinants of fruit and vegetable intake in children and adolescents. METHODS: Papers were identified from Medline and PsycINFO by using all combinations of the search terms: ""fruit(s) or vegetable(s)"" and ""children or adolescents"". Quantitative research examining determinants of fruit and/or vegetable intake among children and adolescents aged 6-18 years were included. The selection and review process was conducted according to a four-step protocol resulting in information on country, population, design, methodology, theoretical basis, instrument used for measuring intake, statistical analysis, included independent variables, and effect sizes. RESULTS: Ninety-eight papers were included. A large number of potential determinants have been studied among children and adolescents. However, for many presumed determinants convincing evidence is lacking, mostly because of paucity of studies. The determinants best supported by evidence are: age, gender, socio-economic position, preferences, parental intake, and home availability/accessibility. Girls and younger children tend to have a higher or more frequent intake than boys and older children. Socio-economic position, preferences, parental intake, and home availability/accessibility are all consistently positively associated with intake. CONCLUSION: The determinants most consistently supported by evidence are gender, age, socio-economic position, preferences, parental intake and home availability/accessibility. There is a need for internationally comparative, longitudinal, theory-based and multi-level studies taking both personal and environmental factors into account.

19894150,Systems perspective: understanding care giving of the elderly in India.,"In this article I propose a systems model of elder care giver burden among Indian care givers. The systems model specifies the effects of elder characteristics, family structure, and personal characteristics of the care giver on care giver burden. Sampling was conducted using a multistage probability method to generate a sample of 259 care givers. The care giver burden questionnaire was translated from English to Hindi and then back into English and pilot tested before implementation. The care givers were interviewed via face-to-face interviews. Regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of the hypothesized determinants on care giver burden. The r square explained 46% of the variance in care giver burden. The following variables were significant from three dimensions: personal characteristics, elder characteristics, and family level. Personal characteristics of the care giver included whether they adhered to Asian cultural norms, the age of the care giver, and gender. Elder characteristics included behavioral problems of the elder. Family functional variables included number of care giving tasks provided by the care giver, and level of family income. Social work practice issues are discussed in the context of this study.",Health care for women international,2009 Dec,England,2009,00

The main goal of this paper is to propose a conceptual model of factors influencing community integration that takes into account the differential configuration of housing setting and support structure in supportive independent housing. The conceptual model encompasses a multidimensional conceptualization of community integration and considers an array of housing and service characteristics that are potentially relevant determinants of community integration. On the basis of the proposed model, this paper outlines the methodological considerations for future research with regard to measurement, research designs, and statistical models.",Mental health services research,2002 Mar,United States,2002,00

18063899,[The proposal of policies aimed at tackling health inequalities in Korea].,"Although the New National Health Promotion Plan 2010 target to reduce health inequalities, whether the program will be effective for reducing the health inequalities in Korea remains quite unclear. More and more developed countries have been started to concentrate on comprehensive policies for reducing health inequalities. The health policies of the UK, Netherlands, and Sweden are the most wellknown. I propose that a comprehensive blueprint for tackling health inequalities in Korea should be made and that it must contain five domains: a target, structure and process, life-course approach, area-based approach, and reorganization of health care resources. The target should be based on determinants of health and more attention should be paid to socioeconmic factors. The structure and process require changes from the national health care policy based on medical services to the national health policy that involves the establishment of a Social Deputy Prime Minister and the strengthening multidisciplinary action. A life-course approach especially focused on the early childhood years. Area-based approach such as the establishment of healthy communities, healthy schools, or healthy work-places which are focused on deprived areas or places is also required. Finally, health care resources should be a greater investment on public resources and strengthening primary care to reduce health inequalities. The policy or intervention studies for tackling health inequalities should be implemented much more in Korea. In addition, it is essential to have political will to encourage policy action.",Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,2007 Nov,Korea (South),2007,00
11018414,Controlling for the effects of hospital attributes. The efficacy of factor analysis.,"PURPOSE: The assessment of risk often requires controlling for the potentially confounding effects of hospital attributes. This paper (1) describes the use of factor analysis as a means of quantifying hospitals' obstetrical care, and (2) compares within respective unconditional logistic regression models the performance of factor scores with that of the ""obstetrical unit service level"" (OBUSL) classification as defined by the American Hospital Association (AHA).METHODS: A principal components factor analysis was performed on fourteen variables from 116 hospitals in Upstate New York. These variables, descriptive of hospitals' obstetrical care, were obtained from the 1992 AHA's Annual Survey of Hospitals. Factor scores were correlated with the OBUSL. Factor scores were matched to 89,341 women with vaginal deliveries in the 1992 Live Birth Registry for Upstate New York. The performance of factor scores and the OBUSL variable was compared in separate unconditional logistic regression analysis designed to identify determinants of obstetrical anesthesia care.RESULTS: Principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation identified three factors which were strongly correlated with hospital OBUSL. In a model which included the OBUSL variable, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) or receiving an epidural for vaginal delivery were lower among mothers with Medicaid, HMO, or no insurance coverage (i.e., 0.45 [95% CI, 0.43-0.48], 0.68 [0.64-0.71], and 0.44 [0.38-0.52], respectively) than among those with private coverage. In a model in which factor scores were substituted for the OBUSL variable, respective AORs were 0.48 (0.45-0.52), 0.63 (0.60-0.66), and 0.45 (0.39-0.53).CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis provided a parsimonious description of 14 hospital variables, was useful as a control within the regression model, and may prove similarly useful in other areas of clinical care.",Annals of epidemiology,2000 Oct 1,United States,2000,00
18077657,Evaluating psychosocial and behavioral mechanisms of change in a tailored communication intervention.,"This study examined the impact of a tailored nutrition intervention at 3 and 6 months postintervention. In all, 357 Latinas were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a control condition comprised of previously developed Spanish language targeted materials, (2) tailored print materials, or (3) tailored print materials accompanied by personalized dietary counseling via lay heath advisors (promotoras). At 6 months postintervention, significant group by time interactions were observed on the dietary behavioral strategies scales. The promotora condition resulted in significant behavior change initially; however, receipt of tailored and control materials was instrumental in continued behavior change after intervention activities had ceased. Group main effects suggested that the promotora condition was superior at reducing barriers and improving family interactions supporting healthy behaviors. The promotora model is an effective method for changing important dietary behaviors and psychosocial determinants, but longer term behavior change is achievable with less expensive intervention methods.",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,2009 Apr,United States,2009,00

17582668,Determinants of parental reports of children's illnesses: empirical evidence from Nepal.,"Household surveys from the developing world consistently record a generally low level of illness reporting, but the evidence that substantial differences exist in illness reporting between income groups is scanty. In contrast, a huge gap in illness reporting exists between rich and poor countries. Medical anthropologists have highlighted the differential illness perception across income groups but little is known as to what extent economic variables do determine one's illness decision. In this paper, discrete choice theory is used to explain why some parents choose to report their children's illnesses more often than others in Nepal. An empirical model is developed that depicts illness-reporting decisions as a function of inter alia, price and income. Data are drawn from Phase I of the Nepal Living Standards Survey. The results suggest that income as well as the price that parents expect to pay on treatment of their children's non-chronic ailments determine their decision to report an illness, when controlling for other variables (price responsiveness =-1.16; income responsiveness=0.23; p-value=0.00). This behaviour is theoretically consistent as parents weigh the opportunity costs of their decision (here, choosing to report an illness). Its implications are broader and raise other questions, e.g., Can we explain the difference in illness-perception rates between rich and poor countries that have different mechanisms to finance health care?",Social science & medicine (1982),2007 Sep,England,2007,00
11143873,Identity revisited in the new technological culture.,"Cultural changes permeate incrementally our individual and collective identities in subtle, barely perceptible ways. The recent rapid advances in technology impacted, skewed, and changed pre-existing pillars of individual and collective identities. The paper focuses on the changes in roles and relationships between generations. Acceptance and ability to absorb the benefits of globalization demands adjustment, including some tolerance of the pitfalls of globalization. Special concern is voiced about the developing trend, demand, and interest in speed of communication that leads to a decrease in depth of evaluation. There is an increased focus on talking rather than on thinking, and a decrease in human relationship, while technology and finance are enthroned as the overriding determinants of human interaction. These profound changes demand psychosocial flexibility. In order to benefit from the overwhelming benefits of new technology, personal, social, professional, and cultural views need to undergo profound re-examination and re-evaluation.",Medicine and law,2000,United States,2000,00
17376802,The shape of health to come: prospective study of the determinants of 30-year health trajectories in the Alameda County Study.,"BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence now exists indicating that incidence and progression of disease and disability are associated with socio-economic, behavioural, demographic and psychosocial factors. The emerging life course perspective suggests that these factors might be associated with not just the incidence of disease and death, but also trajectories of health over decades. METHODS: Prospective study of a representative, population-based cohort studied on four occasions over 30 years. Trajectories of health over this period, combining self-rated health and date of death, were related to behavioural, psychosocial and socio-economic risk factors. RESULTS: Trajectories of health were associated with behavioural, socioeconomic, and psychosocial risk factors, the strongest predictors being household income and physical activity. Those with an income 1 SD above the mean were approximately 25% more likely to die having previously consistently reported excellent health (Men: relative risk (RR) = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.10-1.46; Women: RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06-1.47), were more likely to remain 'Alive in Excellent Health' (Men: RR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.21-1.51; Women: RR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.19-1.43) and were less likely to have shown an 'Unremitting Decline' (Men: RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.49-1.05; Women: RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.48-1.04). Those with low physical activity were approximately 50% less likely to die having consistently reported excellent health (Men: RR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.39-0.76; Women: RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.33-0.71), and were five-times more likely to show an 'Unremitting Decline' (Men: RR = 5.05, 95% CI = 1.75-14.56; Women: RR = 5.00, 95% CI = 1.48-16.92). They were also less likely to be 'Alive in Excellent Health' (Men: RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.29-0.57; Women: RR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.33-0.57).

14742058,Social determinants of (un)healthy behaviors.,"Medical education has historically relied on the rational choice model as a vehicle for promoting health behavior change, and has largely overlooked the powerful relationships between social class and health behaviors. The rational choice model, which assumes that people can choose to pursue behaviors that are needed for their health, has some clinical utility, especially in some circumstances, but it runs the risk of missing key sources of influence and of blaming the victim. The biopsychosocial model provides an alternative basis for teaching about health behavior change. Health behavior needs to be understood in a broad social context, in which social class is recognized as playing a large part in shaping many people's health behaviors through multiple pathways, including limited opportunities for self-fulfillment, financial constraints, health beliefs, self-efficacy, stress, and social support. In addition to highlighting the limitations of the rational choice model, we illustrate how to integrate the socio-cultural context into teaching about behavior change. Specific curricular suggestions include exercises for: (1) increasing students' awareness of their own biases regarding unhealthy behaviors and individual responsibility for change; (2) enhancing knowledge of social factors that impact health; (3) building advocacy skills; (4) learning from patients; and (5) practicing counseling skills through role-plays.","Education for health (Abingdon, England)",2000,India,2000,00
12664733,The Sandyford Initiative: creating added value to health and health care.,"The Sandyford Initiative in Glasgow brings together Family Planning, Genitourinary Medicine and the Centre for Women's Health in a new partnership which aims to provide integrated health and social care in a manner which reflects a social model of health. The Steve Retson Project for Gay Men's Sexual Health is also situated within the Sandyford, providing clinical services within the context of a social model of health. The Initiative is managed by the Greater Glasgow Primary Care NHS Trust but has been developed as a result of joint working between three main services, Greater Glasgow Health Board, Glasgow City Council and a number of voluntary organisations. By working to a social model of health, the intention is to ensure that the detection and management of health problems takes into account the social and economic determinants of health and that the provision and practice of health care reflects the social needs of the user. As such the Initiative is expected to make a significant contribution to the sexual health of men and women and the general and reproductive health of women in the Greater Glasgow area and beyond. The core of the Initiative is housed in premises tailored to the needs of the services and their users although satellite services are being planned. In addition to the core clinical and non-clinical care there are services designed to respond to the needs of specific groups such as young people, black and ethnic minority communities and disabled people, in order to improve access and uptake by previously marginalised groups. It is recognised that often the relationship between health and social service providers and their users becomes strained. Implementation of the Sandyford Initiative is intended to inspire confidence and contribute effectively to improving health and managing complex health problems.",Health bulletin,2001 Jul,Scotland,2001,00
16581197,Cognitive determinants of MDMA use among college students in Southern Taiwan.,"This study was aimed to examine the Attitudes-Social influence-Efficacy Model for the use of MDMA among college students in Taiwan. A representative sample of 3743 college students participated in this study. Each participant completed a comprehensive survey and 3090 valid data were collected. Correlation analyses displayed that either positive outcome expectancy or social influence was positively related to intention while refusal self-efficacy was negatively associated with intention. Using the Structural Equation Model, the results showed that the model fitted the data well. Intention for using MDMA affected MDMA use. Refusing self-efficacy significantly predicted intention and MDMA use indirectly via intention. Social influence had a direct impact on intention or MDMA use as well as an indirect effect on MDMA use via intention. However, positive outcome expectancy did not have an effect on both intention and the use of MDMA. Our results suggested that preventive programs in colleges for MDMA use should focus on developing strategies in decreasing the social influence and enhancing the refusal self-efficacy.",Addictive behaviors,2006 Dec,England,2006,00
18030953,Caesarean sections and breastfeeding initiation among migrants in Switzerland.,"OBJECTIVES: Twenty-six percent of all women giving birth in Switzerland are of non-Swiss nationality. Differences in reproductive health outcomes such as preterm deliveries, Caesarean sections, and breastfeeding initiation for mother-child pairs of various nationalities are investigated, and the influence of the educational level was assessed. In order to identify trans-national differences, national breastfeeding rates from 22 countries and Caesarean section rates from 24 countries were compared to the rates in Swiss hospitals. STUDY SAMPLE: Drawing on routinely collected monitoring data, 37332 mother-child pairs from various nationalities, who delivered in Swiss Baby-Friendly hospitals between 2000 and 2002, were included in the study. All nationalities with at least 150 deliveries were coded individually, while the remaining were summarised in regional groups. RESULTS: Sub-Saharan African, Latin American and Asian mothers had higher rates of Caesarean sections compared to Swiss mothers (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.49-2.22; OR = 1.80, 1.51-2.17; OR = 1.37, 1.18-1.59). African and Asian children were at an increased risk of being transferred to neonatal care units (OR = 1.48, 95 %CI 1.19-1.83; OR = 1.45, 1.21-1.73;). In addition, infants from Balkan countries, who showed lowest Caesarean section rates, were also more likely to be transferred to an ICU (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.52). Apart from the country or region of origin, the maternal educational level was an important influence and modified the effect of the mother's nationality. Mothers from all regions, apart from Western Europe, were significantly more likely to breastfeed their children after being discharged. Established determinants for breastfeeding duration, including feeding exclusively with breast milk in maternity wards, early initiation of breastfeeding, rooming-in and pacifier use, varied according to nationality. The comparison of Caesarean section and breastfeeding rates with the rates in the mother's country of origin additionally investigates the relation between reproductive health outcomes of migrant women in Switzerland compared to their country of origin. In both cases, a significant rank correlation (Spearman) could be established between the rate in Swiss hospitals and the rate in the mother's country of origin (P < 0.001, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirms inequalities in reproductive health outcomes and responses to health promotion programmes among migrant women in Switzerland. These differences are dependent on educational level and on the mothers' nationality. The large variation suggests that different trans-national experiences play some role in health-related decision-making and access to health care. This should be considered when planning health promotion programs and the individual counselling of pregnant mothers in Switzerland.",International journal of public health,2007,Switzerland,2007,00
10813470,Economic impact of febrile morbidity and use of permethrin-impregnated bed nets in a malarious area II. Determinants of febrile episodes and the cost of their treatment and malaria prevention.,"The objective of this study is to determine the effect of permethrin insecticide-treated bed net (PITN) use on the incidence of febrile episodes and on household malaria expenses in Benin. Over the course of one year, 208 randomly selected PITN user and non-user households were visited weekly to determine expenditures on febrile morbidity and its treatment, and to monitor spending on malaria prevention. Multivariate analyses were performed to distinguish the effects of PITN use from other important determinants of morbidity, such as malaria-related beliefs and practices, income, and other socio-economic variables. Results from the logistic regression analysis show that the use of PITNs decreases the risk of febrile episodes by 34% in children living in the rural zone. Multiple regression analysis reveals that PITN use does not reduce prevention and treatment expenses. These expenses are significantly associated with women's income. This report also discusses other factors associated with febrile morbidity and malaria-related expenditures.",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2000 Feb,United States,2000,00
10772399,Depression and anxiety as predictors of outcome after myocardial infarction.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the significance of emotional distress immediately after a myocardial infarction as a predictor of physical, psychological, and social outcomes and resource use. METHODS: In an epidemiological survey, demographic and cardiological data were obtained for all patients from a defined geographical area who had had a myocardial infarction (according to diagnostic criteria of the Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease [MONICA] trial). Hospital survivors were interviewed and were asked to complete self-report assessments on mental state and quality of life. Full replies were available at baseline for 347 subjects. Self-report follow-up questionnaire information was collected 3 months and 1 year later. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of patients scored as probable cases of anxiety or depression. They were more likely than noncases to report preinfarct distress and poor adjustment (as indicated on the 36-item Medical Outcome Study short form). There was an improvement at 3 months, but there was little overall or individual change after that time. Anxiety and depression did not predict subsequent mortality but did significantly predict poor outcome at 1 year on all dimensions of the 36-item short form quality-of-life measure and on specific measures of everyday activity and reports of chest pain, use of primary care resources, and secondary prevention lifestyle changes. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who are distressed in the hospital are at high risk of adverse psychological and quality-of-life outcomes during the ensuing year. Our findings strengthen the argument for in-hospital identification and treatment of patients with depression and anxiety after myocardial infarction.",Psychosomatic medicine,2000 Mar-Apr,United States,2000,00

This paper looks at the situation of women's health in Lithuania in the context of the social, political and economic transition in the country following independence in 1990, and reforms to the health system. Data since 1990 show that considerable social and demographic inequalities in the health of women exist in Lithuania, with low-educated women and those living in rural areas in the most unfavourable situation, including in relation to reproductive health. Reproductive health issues have received some recognition in recent years, with the main attention and resources directed to the development of a Maternal and Child Health Programme, especially perinatal care and the organisation of neonatology services, which has resulted in a notable decrease in maternal, perinatal and infant mortality. Services for family planning, abortion, infertility, cervical and breast cancer, and violence against women are under-developed. Non-governmental organizations are beginning to be formed to advocate for increased resources and services for reproductive health. Improvements in the health status of Lithuanian women can be expected if attention is paid to social determinants of health.",Reproductive health matters,2002 Nov,Netherlands,2002,00

Against this backdrop, we investigate the determinants of accessibility and affordability of health care utilisation in Tajikistan. A modified version of the Andersen Behavioural Model is used to conceptualise the determinants of health care utilisation in Tajikistan. Poisson and Ordered Logit regression models are performed to estimate the determinants of health care utilisation. Empirical results demonstrate that poverty, chronic illness and disability are the most important determinants of health care utilisation and affordability in Tajikistan. Other significant determinants include gender, the level of education of the household head, and the availability of medical personnel at a given population point. These findings suggest an urgent need for health care reform in order to ensure equality in accessibility and affordability for the entire population.",Global public health,2009,England,2009,00
17363221,Psychotic experiences in the general population: a twenty-year prospective community study.,"PURPOSE: Recent work suggested that psychosis might be expressed at subclinical levels. However, the determinants of subclinical psychotic symptoms, the degree of continuity over the life span, and the impact on functioning remain unclear. Thus we analyzed the prevalence, determinants, patterns and impact of subclinical psychotic symptoms in a community cohort over a 20-year period. METHODS: The Zurich Study - a longitudinal community study - started in 1979 with a sample of 591 participants aged 20/21 years. Follow-up interviews were conducted at age 23, 28, 30, 35 and 41. Symptoms were assessed with a semi-structured interview and the SCL90-R. In this analysis, items of the SCL90-R symptom dimensions ""paranoid ideation"" and ""psychoticism"" were examined. RESULTS: Two distinct symptom dimensions of subclinical psychosis became evident, one representing schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, the other representing schizotypal signs. Cannabis use in adolescence was associated specifically with schizophrenia nuclear symptoms, whereas childhood adversity as well as chronic physical or mental disorders in parents contributed to schizotypal signs. Individuals with a persistently high level of either of the two identified symptom dimensions over 20 years experienced significant deficiencies in social achievement and functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of psychotic symptoms in populations is continuous and characterized by differing levels of severity and persistence. A small group of individuals displays persistence of subclinical psychotic symptoms over a period of 20 years. The causes of and pathways to clinical psychotic disorder can be studied long before the disorder becomes clinically relevant.",Schizophrenia research,2007 May,Netherlands,2007,00

18408231,Using health promotion outcomes in formative evaluation studies to predict success factors in interventions: an application to an intervention for promoting physical activity in Dutch children (JUMP-in).,"JUMP-in is a systematically developed intervention aimed at promoting physical activity among primary school children. It is a joint project involving different authorities and entails six school-based programme components. Measuring effects of such an intervention is a complex challenge. A common problem is the lack of valid instruments to measure physical activity and its determinants. In addition, it usually takes years to find improvements in physical activity and related constructs like weight and fitness, or even in causal factors. For this reason different authors advocate for the establishment of 'health promotion outcomes'; (i) health literacy, (ii) social action and influence and (iii) healthy public policy and organizational practice. It is presumed that these health promotion outcomes lead to changes in determinants, behaviour and finally in health. Insight in these health promotion outcomes and information about input and through-put are important in discussing the impact and output. The formative evaluation study of the JUMP-in pilot shows the health promotion outcomes of the intervention. The health promotion outcomes 'social action and influence' and 'healthy public policy and organizational practices' were found to be positive. By measuring the presence of the conditions to achieve 'health literacy', it became clear that more attention must be paid to implementation in the future. Based on the health promotion outcomes, we expect that JUMP-in will be an effective intervention in the future.",Health promotion international,2008 Sep,England,2008,00
17236743,Neighborhood-level active living buoys for individuals with physical disabilities.,"BACKGROUND: In an effort to advance the research agenda on residential determinants of active living among people with physical disabilities, the purposes of this paper are (1) to describe the extent to which environmental supports (buoys) promoting active living among individuals with disabilities are present in neighborhoods located in a large urban area, and (2) to examine the association between the presence of these buoys and neighborhood-level indicators of affluence, proportions of individuals with disabilities living in the neighborhood, and other neighborhood active living indicators. METHODS: In the context of a larger project, pairs of evaluators assessed potential determinants of active living in 112 neighborhoods (census tracts) on the island of Montreal, Canada, in the summer of 2003. The assessment grid included 18 items related to active living for the general population and three specifically for people with physical disabilities. RESULTS: Analyses performed in 2006 show that few neighborhoods in this large urban area are equipped with environmental buoys that might support active living among people with physical disabilities. Lower levels of environmental buoys to promote active living among those with disabilities were most strongly associated with lower levels of neighborhood activity-friendliness. Less consistent associations were observed between lower environmental buoys and lower density of destinations, greater safety, lower proportions of people with disabilities, and higher proportions of those of low income. CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to better understand the distribution of environmental buoys in residential areas and their influences on active living among people with physical disabilities.",American journal of preventive medicine,2007 Mar,Netherlands,2007,00

The strongest predictor of parent satisfaction was met expectations; however, inclusion of the desire concepts was essential in obtaining a strong, acceptable model fit.",Archives of psychiatric nursing,2006 Apr,United States,2006,00
16110939,Determinants of quality of life in children with psychiatric disorders.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess factors that, in addition to childhood psychopathology, are associated with Quality of Life (QoL) in children with psychiatric problems. METHODS: In a referred sample of 252 8 to 18-year-olds, information concerning QoL, psychopathology and a broad range of child, parent, and family/ social network factors was obtained from children, parents, teachers and clinicians. RESULTS: Poor child, parent, and clinician reported QoL was associated with child psychopathology, but given the presence of psychopathology, also with child factors, such as low self-esteem, and poor social skills, and family/social network factors, such as poor family functioning, and poor social support. In multiple linear regression analyses the importance of parent factors, such as parenting stress, was almost negligible. CONCLUSION: To increase QoL of children with psychiatric problems, treatment of symptoms is important, but outcome might improve if treatment is also focussed on other factors that may affect QoL. Results are discussed in relation to current treatment programs.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2005 Aug,Netherlands,2005,00
16276854,Determinants of service use among young Canadians with mental disorders.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the determinants of service use by young Canadians with mental health problems. METHODS: Data were drawn from a recent large Canadian mental health survey. The analyses were conducted on a subsample of 1092 Canadians aged 15 to 24 years and identified as presenting a mood disorder, an anxiety disorder, or a substance-related disorder in the 12 months preceding the survey. We classified variables potentially associated with any type of service use for a mental health problem over a 12-month period according to predisposing, enabling, and need factors. We conducted weighted multivariate logistic regressions to determine the association of each factor with service use. RESULTS: In the final model, being female and living alone were the predisposing factors associated with service use. None of the enabling factors predicted help seeking. In regard to the perceived need factors, those who had difficulties with social situations were more likely to use services. Having a mood disorder and (or) having a diagnosed chronic illness were the evaluated need factors associated with service use. CONCLUSION: Certain groups of young Canadians are less likely to seek help for mental health problems and could be the target of interventions aimed at increasing service use.",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

11796086,Socio-economic determinants of selected dietary indicators in British pre-school children.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the proportion of pre-school children meeting reference nutrient intakes (RNIs) and recommendations for daily intakes of iron, zinc, vitamins C and A, and energy from non-milk extrinsic sugars. To assess whether meeting these five dietary requirements was related to a series of socio-economic variables. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data on daily consumption of foods and drinks from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of children aged 1.5-4.5 years based on 4-day weighed intakes. SUBJECTS: One thousand six hundred and seventy-five British pre-school children aged 1.5-4.5 years in 1993. RESULTS: Only 1% of children met all five RNIs/recommendations examined; 76% met only two or fewer. Very few children met the recommendations for intakes of zinc (aged over four years) and non-milk extrinsic sugars (all ages). The number of RNIs/recommendations met was related to measures of socio-economic class. Children from families in Scotland and the North of England, who had a manual head of household and whose mothers had fewest qualifications, met the least number of RNIs/recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Very few pre-school children have diets that meet all the RNIs and recommendations for iron, zinc, vitamins C and A, and energy from non-milk extrinsic sugars. Dietary adequacy with respect to these five parameters is related to socio-economic factors. The findings emphasise the need for a range of public health policies that focus upon the social and economic determinants of food choice within families.",Public health nutrition,2001 Dec,England,2001,00
11919235,Impact of referral patterns on the use of chemotherapy for lung cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine the extent to which unexplained variation in the use of chemotherapy for advanced lung cancer is due to access to oncologists' services as opposed to treatment decisions made after seeing an oncologist. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 12,015 patients over age 65 diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer between 1991 and 1996 while living in one of 11 regions monitored by a Survival, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) tumor registry. Assessment by an oncologist and subsequent treatment with chemotherapy were determined by examining linked Medicare claims. RESULTS: Of patients who did not receive chemotherapy, 36% were never assessed by a physician who provides chemotherapy. Patients living in certain areas, those diagnosed in more recent years, and those who received care in a teaching hospital were all more likely to see a cancer specialist. These factors were unrelated to subsequent treatment decisions, however. Conversely, age and comorbidity did not have a significant effect on whether a patient was seen by an oncologist, but they were associated with the likelihood of subsequently receiving chemotherapy. Black race, probably acting as a proxy for lower socioeconomic status, was associated with both a diminished likelihood of seeing a cancer specialist and subsequently receiving chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Nonmedical factors are important determinants of whether a lung cancer patient is seen by a physician who provides chemotherapy. After seeing such a physician, treatment decisions seem to be mostly explained by appropriate medical factors. Racial and socioeconomic disparities still exist at both steps, however. As therapeutic options expand, referring physicians must ensure that biases and barriers to care do not deprive patients of the opportunity to consider all of their treatment options.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2002 Apr 1,United States,2002,00
18505567,"Buruli ulcer disease prevalence in Benin, West Africa: associations with land use/cover and the identification of disease clusters.","BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) disease, caused by infection with the environmental mycobacterium M. ulcerans, is an emerging infectious disease in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. Although vectors and modes of transmission remain unknown, it is hypothesized that the transmission of BU disease is associated with human activities in or around aquatic environments, and that characteristics of the landscape (e.g., land use/cover) play a role in mediating BU disease. Several studies performed at relatively small spatial scales (e.g., within a single village or region of a country) support these hypotheses; however, if BU disease is associated with land use/cover characteristics, either through spatial constraints on vector-host dynamics or by mediating human activities, then large-scale (i.e., country-wide) associations should also emerge. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate associations between BU disease prevalence in villages in Benin, West Africa and surrounding land use/cover patterns and other map-based characteristics, and (2) identify areas with greater and lower than expected prevalence rates (i.e., disease clusters) to assist with the development of prevention and control programs. RESULTS: Our landscape-based models identified low elevation, rural villages surrounded by forest land cover, and located in drainage basins with variable wetness patterns as being associated with higher BU disease prevalence rates. We also identified five spatial disease clusters. Three of the five clusters contained villages with greater than expected prevalence rates and two clusters contained villages with lower than expected prevalence rates. Those villages with greater than expected BU disease prevalence rates spanned a fairly narrow region of south-central Benin. CONCLUSION: Our analyses suggest that interactions between natural land cover and human alterations to the landscape likely play a role in the dynamics of BU disease. For example, urbanization, potentially by providing access to protected water sources, may reduce the likelihood of becoming infected with BU disease. Villages located at low elevations may have higher BU disease prevalence rates due to their close spatial proximity to high risk environments. In addition, forest land cover and drainage basins with variable wetness patterns may be important for providing suitable growth conditions for M. ulcerans, influencing the distribution and abundance of vectors, or mediating vector-human interactions. The identification of disease clusters in this study provides direction for future research aimed at better understanding these and other environmental and social determinants involved in BU disease outbreaks.",International journal of health geographics,2008 May 27,England,2008,00
12661706,"Facilitativeness, conflict, demand for approval, self-esteem, and satisfaction with romantic relationships.","This study is an examination of the extent to which satisfaction with a main current romantic relationship is associated with negative conflict, demand for approval, self-esteem, and the 3 facilitative conditions of unconditional regard, empathy, and congruence. One or more of these conditions have been proposed as important determinants of relationship satisfaction by various relationship-enhancement approaches such as behavioral marital therapy and cognitive-behavioral marital therapy. College students (86 women and 58 men) completed S. S. Hendrick's (1988) Relationship Satisfaction Scale, a measure of negative conflict formulated by the author, R. G.

10838732,[Determinants of health and health policy. Part 2. Classification and effectiveness of the determinants].,"Determinants of the health and disease are factors of the human biology, environment, system of health and the human behaviour. For the clinical practice not only their identification, but also their effectiveness becomes important. Modern epidemiological gnoseology serves to this purpose using methods both on the individual and the population levels. At the same time, all indexes of the population's health status respond sensitively to two factors of the social sphere: Differences in the economical standard of the population, classified according the social status or family income, and on the psychosocial markers of the population groups. Relation between poverty and diseases is apparent, while relation between the wealth and health is in the modern societies less obvious. Complicated and comparatively fast sociopolitical, cultural, and psychological changes brought about the feeling that poverty and wealth are not taken absolutely (though differences among the two has risen) but more relatively. People appreciate more the quality of life, which is based more on the psycho-socio-cultural ""capital"", then on purely materialistic values.",Casopis lekaru ceskych,2000 Mar 15,Czech Republic,2000,00
14722343,The impact of structural and functional characteristics of social relations as determinants of functional decline.,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines whether aspects of social relations at baseline are related to functional decline at 5-year follow-up among nondisabled old men and women. METHODS: The investigation is based on baseline and follow-up data on 651 nondisabled 75-year-old persons in Jyvaskyla (Finland) and Glostrup (Denmark). The analyses are performed separately for men and women. Possible selection problems were considered by using three outcome measures: first, functional decline among the survivors (n = 425); second, functional decline, including death, assuming that death is part of a general decline pattern (n = 565); and third, mortality (n = 651). Social relations were measured at baseline by several items focusing on the structure and function of the social network. RESULTS: In men, no weekly telephone contact was related to functional decline and mortality. Among women, less than weekly telephone contact, no membership in a retirement club, and not sewing for others were significantly related to functional decline and mortality. The associations were stronger when the dead were included in the outcome measure. DISCUSSION: The results point to the importance of social relations in the prevention of functional decline in older adults.","The journals of gerontology.

15353189,"Socio-economic status, health and lifestyle.","The role of lifestyle in mediating the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and health has been discussed extensively in the epidemiological and economic literatures. Previous analyses have not considered a formal framework incorporating unobservable heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a simple economic model in which health is determined (partially) by lifestyle, which depends on preferences, budget and time constraints and unobservable characteristics. We estimate a recursive empirical specification consisting of a health production function and reduced forms for the lifestyle equations using Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) for a multivariate probit (MVP) model with discrete indicators of lifestyle choices and self-assessed health (SAH) on British panel data from the 1984 and 1991 Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS). We find that sleeping well, exercising, and not smoking in 1984 have dramatic positive effects on the probability of reporting excellent or good SAH in 1991, and that these effects are much larger having accounted for endogeneity. The failure of epidemiological analyses to account for unobserved heterogeneity can explain their low estimates of the relevance of lifestyle in the socio-economic status-health relationship. Indicators for prudent alcohol consumption and eating breakfast in 1984 are not found to be statistically significant determinants of SAH in 1991.",Journal of health economics,2004 Sep,Netherlands,2004,00
12046994,Family satisfaction with inpatient palliative care in Japan.,"Whereas satisfaction is one of the most important outcomes in palliative care settings, there have been no systematic studies investigating the effects of family- and organization-related variables on family satisfaction with care. To clarify factors contributing to family satisfaction with inpatient palliative care services, a cross-sectional mailed survey was performed. A 60-item questionnaire was mailed to 1026 bereaved subjects who had lost family members at one of 37 palliative care units in Japan to evaluate their sociodemographic characteristics and satisfaction levels with care. An institution survey was performed to collect organization-related variables. Caregiver satisfaction was rated on the Satisfaction scale for Family members receiving Inpatient Palliative Care (Sat-Fam-IPC). A total of 640 responses were analysed (response rate = 62%). The responses to overall satisfaction were 'satisfied' in 41 % and 'very satisfied' in 47%. The mean total score of the Sat-Fam-IPC was 82.4 +/- 13.2 on the 0-100 scale. The mean subscale scores were: 85.8 +/- 14.5 (Nursing Care), 81.5 +/- 18.4 (Symptom Palliation), 85.0 +/- 13.8 (Facility), 83.3 +/- 16.6 (Information), 83.1 +/- 17.3 (Availability), 78.3 +/- 18.9 (Family Care), and 79.8 +/- 17.3 (Cost). Significant determinants of family satisfaction identified were: nursing system, the number of nurses at night and presence of attending medical social workers (Nursing Care), patient age and the number of physicians (Symptom Palliation), floor space per bed (Facility), duration of admission and presence of attending medical social workers (Availability), patient age, family age, gender and occupational status (Family Care), patient age and the extra charge for a private room (Cost). In conclusion, informal caregivers are generally satisfied with inpatient palliative care services provided by members of the Japanese Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Units.

14763606,More than a leap of faith: the impact of biological and religious correlates on reproductive behavior.,"Using a conceptual model that integrates both social and biomedical factors of causation, this paper tries to delineate the pathways through which the reproductive characteristics of a multidenominational community are characterized. In total, 5513 historical entries from family reconstitution were available. Selection of data was guided by the inclusion of information about religious affiliation. Only married couples with children as well as single mothers with the relevant information were considered. Of these, 1855 entries were of Roman Catholic (C), 1143 of Lutheran/Protestant (L/P2), and 609 of Reformed Calvinist (R) denomination. The analysis documented differential nuptiality and fertility patterns, which at first glance may be interpreted along religious lines. However, the paper attempts to show that these various sociocultural patterns associated with religious behavior are merely proximate determinants, while the ultimate causes are biological in nature (i.e., differential parental age at marriage or birth, different parity progression regimes, differences in median interpregnancy interval, as well as highly variable sibship size within the denominational groups).",Human biology,2003 Oct,United States,2003,00
19317679,"Economic penalties and rewards of family formation, gender and education in the low-income sector in Germany.","This article examines the differential effects of changes in family formations on men's and women's economic vulnerability. The motivating question is whether investments in education provide sufficient resources to escape the risk of poverty in the low-income sector or if changes in household characteristics are more important determinants of one's living standard. Changes in household characteristics are defined in terms of partners' entry into and exit from households and partners' different labour market profiles. The analysis focuses on households in the low-income sector in Germany, a population that is at high risk of poverty in a social welfare state that is expected to mitigate the effects of changes in family formation independent of gender. Findings from panel regression analysis demonstrate that women, in contrast to men, benefit economically as much as or more from investing in traditional family formations than in their own labour market position. This is especially the case for women with lower levels of education.",The British journal of sociology,2009 Mar,England,2009,00

11820673,Gender and outpatient mental health service use.,"The purpose of this study is to describe gender differences in the use of outpatient mental health services and to identify potential determinants of this use. The study sample, N = 7475 respondents 18-64 years, was drawn from the Mental Health Supplement to the Ontario Health Survey. For theoretical and empirical reasons, type of mental disorder was defined as: a Mood and/or Anxiety Disorder (Mood/Anx) or a Substance Use Disorder and/or Antisocial Behaviours (Subs/Asb) within the past year. Use was defined in relation to providers seen within the past year. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed including type of mental disorder, social and economic factors. Female gender remained positively associated with any use despite adjustments (adjusted OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2: 2.4). The magnitude of this association was consistent across the levels of the study variables and various measures of use except volume of use where there were no gender differences. Mood/Anx appeared to mediate the gender-use relationship and was strongly associated with use (adjusted OR: 8.4; 95% CI: 5.9; 11.9). Subs/Asb was also related to use (adjusted OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.5; 4.3) but not to the same degree as Mood/Anx. Mood/Anx explained 60% of the crude Subs/Asb-use relationship. The evidence to suggest that Subs/Asb mediated the gender-use relationship was mixed. These findings raise questions about gender differences in illness and reporting behaviours and the health care system in its preferential treatment of women and those with Mood/Anx.",Social science & medicine (1982),2002 Jan,England,2002,00
14686137,Early origins of the gradient: the relationship between socioeconomic status and infant mortality in the United States.,"Although relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient.",Demography,2003 Nov,United States,2003,00
11885033,Public health and peace.,"The modern concept of public health, the New Public Health, carries a great potential for healthy and therefore less aggressive societies. Its core disciplines are health promotion, environmental health, and health care management based on advanced epidemiological methodologies. The main principles of living together in healthy societies can be summarized as four ethical concepts of the New Public Health essential to violence reduction equity, participation, subsidiarity, and sustainability. The following issues are discussed as violence determinants: the process of urbanization; type of neighborhood and accommodation, and consequent stigmatization; level of education; employment status; socialization of the family; women's status; alcohol and drug consumption; availability of the firearms; religious, ethnic, and racial prejudices; and poverty. Development of the health systems has to contribute to peace, since aggression, violence, and warfare are among the greatest risks for health and the economic welfare. This contribution can be described as follows: 1) full and indiscriminate access to all necessary services, 2) monitoring of their quality, 3) providing special support to vulnerable groups, and 4) constant scientific and public accountability of the evaluation of the epidemiological outcome. Violence can also destroy solidarity and social cohesion of groups, such as family, team, neighborhood, or any other social organization. Durkheim coined the term anomie for a state in which social disruption of the community results in health risks for individuals. Health professionals can make a threefold contribution to peace by 1) analyzing the causal interrelationships of violence phenomena, 2) curbing the determinants of violence according to the professional standards, and 3) training professionals for this increasingly important task. Because tolerance is an essential part of an amended definition of health, monitoring of the early signs of public intolerance is important. The vital interplay between the informed public and efficient administration, however, can only exist in an open society. The link between democracy and health of the people, and between public health and economic welfare is real. The Public Health Collaboration in South Eastern Europe (PH-SEE) evolved just in time to reconnect and strengthen disrupted professional networks in the region as a prerequisite of effective public health action.",Croatian medical journal,2002 Apr,Croatia,2002,00
11483116,Psychosocial correlates of physical activity in healthy children.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the determinants of physical activity in children is critical for the treatment and prevention of childhood obesity. Social-cognitive theory has been used to understand behavioral patterns in children. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between health beliefs, self-efficacy, social support, and sedentary activities and physical activity levels in children and to examine the relationship between physical activity and children's self-esteem. METHODS: Ninety-two children aged 10 to 16 years completed the study. Physical activity was monitored for 1 week with a motion detector (Actitrac; IM Systems, Baltimore, Md). Moderate-level activity and high-level activity were defined based on the results of treadmill testing. Health beliefs, self-efficacy, social influences, and time spent in sedentary behaviors were determined through questionnaires. Self-esteem was measured using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale. Chronic anxiety was measured with the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale. RESULTS: There was a significant decline in physical activity levels between ages 10 and 16 years, particularly in girls. Preteen girls spent approximately 35% more time in low- and high-level activity than did teenage girls (P<.001). Overall, children spent 75.5% of the day inactive, with a mean +/- SD of 5.2 +/- 1.8 hours watching television, sitting at the computer, and doing homework. In contrast, only 1.4% of the day (12.6 +/- 12.2 minutes) was spent in vigorous activity. Time spent in sedentary behaviors was inversely correlated with the amount of moderate-level activity (P<.001) but not high-level activity. In contrast, time spent in high-level activity correlated with self-efficacy scores (P<.001) and social influences scores (P<.005). High-level physical activity was also associated with improved self-esteem (P<.05). Higher health beliefs scores were not correlated with physical activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents are largely sedentary. Correlates of high- and low-level physical activity are different. Time spent on sedentary activities is inversely correlated with moderate-level activity, while self-efficacy and social influences are positively correlated with more intense physical activity. In addition, increased high-level physical activity is an important component in the development of self-esteem in children.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2001 Aug,United States,2001,00
12435839,Factors influencing HIV/AIDS in women of color.,"OBJECTIVE: The author reviews selected findings on the behavioral risk factors for exposure to HIV among women of color and the social, psychological, and cultural factors that may be related to these risks and to the use of condoms. The potential value of empowerment models of AIDS intervention for women of color is examined. OBSERVATIONS: The most common routes of exposure to HIV for women of color are intravenously injected drug use and prostitution related to drug use. A woman's risk for exposure to HIV is related to her ability to protect herself by negotiating a safe sexual relationship with a partner. Women who feel powerless in their relationships are less likely to protect themselves against HIV exposure. These perceptions of powerlessness are the result of a broad array of experiences that may include secondary status, exposure to violence, restricted economic opportunities, and experiences of racism and oppression. CONCLUSIONS: Research on primary and secondary prevention of HIV infection in women of color must acknowledge and address the multiple determinants of health and risk behaviors in research paradigms and methodologies that assess women's risk in relationship to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2002,United States,2002,00
11839162,Why do gay men want to be vaccinated against hepatitis B? An assessment of psychosocial determinants of vaccination intention.,"We assessed to what extent gay men are motivated to obtain vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV), as well as the social cognitive determinants of this motivation. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among homosexual men by means of a written questionnaire that contained assessments of intention, knowledge and social-cognitive determinants of intention (i.e. attitude, social norm and perceived behavioural control towards vaccination, perceived severity and perceived vulnerability regarding HBV infection). Four hundred and thirty-three homosexual men completed the questionnaire. We conducted a linear regression analysis to determine the contribution of social-cognitive variables in explaining intention to be vaccinated. Attitude, social norm and perceived vulnerability were significant predictors of intention. Usually, health education emphasizes the severity of a disease, but from this analysis we can conclude that gay men should be convinced of their personal vulnerability to HBV, the benefits of vaccination, and that important referents of the targeted person think positively about vaccination.",International journal of STD & AIDS,2002 Feb,England,2002,00
18198934,The burden of schizophrenia on caregivers: a review.,"Schizophrenia is a disabling, chronic psychiatric disorder that poses numerous challenges in its management and consequences. It extols a significant cost to the patient in terms of personal suffering, on the caregiver as a result of the shift of burden of care from hospital to families, and on society at large in terms of significant direct and indirect costs that include frequent hospitalizations and the need for long-term psychosocial and economic support, as well as life-time lost productivity. 'Burden of care' is a complex construct that challenges simple definition, and is frequently criticized for being broad and generally negative. Frequently, burden of care is more defined by its impacts and consequences on caregivers. In addition to the emotional, psychological, physical and economic impact, the concept of 'burden of care' involves subtle but distressing notions such as shame, embarrassment, feelings of guilt and self-blame. The early conceptualization of 'burden of care' into two distinct components (objective and subjective) has guided research efforts until the present time. Objective burden of care is meant to indicate its effects on the household such as taking care of daily tasks, whereas subjective burden indicates the extent to which the caregivers perceive the burden of care. Research contributions in later years (1980s to the present) have added more depth to understanding of the construct of burden of care by exploring important determinants and factors that likely contribute or mediate the caregiver's perception of burden of care. Several studies examined the role of gender, and reported that relatives of male patients with schizophrenia frequently experience more social dysfunction and disabilities than those of female patients. Similarly, a number of other studies documented the contribution of ethnicity and cultural issues to subjective burden of care. Although there is no complete agreement on whether a specific cluster of psychotic symptoms has the most impact on a caregiver's burden of care, there is agreement that the severity of symptoms increases it. An extensive literature concerning family interventions in schizophrenia has demonstrated the positive impact of various family interventions in improving family environment, reducing relapse and easing the burden of care. Although the evidence of such positive impact of family interventions in schizophrenia is well documented, such interventions are neither widely used nor appropriately integrated in care plans, and are frequently underfunded. Although the cost of caregiving is considered to be significant, there are no reliable estimates of the costs associated with such care. The majority of available literature categorized the cost of burden of care among the indirect costs of schizophrenia in general. In recent years, attempts to compare the costs of caregiving in several countries have been reported in the evolving literature on this topic. 'Burden of care' as a complex construct certainly requires the development of appropriate methodology for its costing. In achieving a balance between the patients' and caregivers' perspectives, caregivers have to be included in the care plan and adequate information and support extended to the family and caregivers. Access to better treatment for patients, including medications, psychosocial interventions and rehabilitation services, are important basic elements in easing the burden on caregivers. Other measures such as availability of crisis management, provision of legally mandated community treatment to avert hospitalization, and well informed and balanced advocacy are also important. Although research efforts have been expanded in the last 3 decades, an urgent need exists for enhancing such efforts, particularly in the development and evaluation of effective family interventions strategies. There is also a need for continued improvement in the delivery of psychiatric services to the severely psychiatrically ill and their families. As there is a lack of reliable cost information about the family burden of care specific to schizophrenia, there is an urgent need to develop reliable approaches that can generate data that can inform in policy making and organization of services.",PharmacoEconomics,2008,New Zealand,2008,00
12586322,Counseling in the clinical setting to prevent unintended pregnancy: an evidence-based research agenda.,"Unintended pregnancies account for about half of all pregnancies in the United States and, in 1995, numbered nearly 3 million pregnancies. They pose appreciable medical, emotional, social and financial costs on women, their families and society. The US is not attaining national goals to decrease unintended pregnancies, and little is known about effective means for reducing unintended pregnancy rates in adults or adolescents.To examine the evidence about the effectiveness, benefits and harms of counseling in a clinical setting to prevent unintended pregnancy in adults and adolescents and to use the evidence to propose a research agenda.We identified English-language articles from comprehensive searches of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychLit and other databases from 1985 through May 2000; the main clinical search terms included pregnancy (mistimed, unintended, unplanned, unwanted), family planning, contraceptive behavior, counseling, sex counseling, and knowledge, attitudes and behavior. We also used published systematic reviews, hand searching of relevant articles, the second Guide to Clinical Preventive Services and extensive peer review to identify important articles not otherwise found and to assure completeness. Of 673 abstracts examined, we retained 354 for full article review; of these, we used 74 for the systematic evidence review and abstracted data from 13 articles for evidence tables. Four studies addressed the effectiveness of counseling in a clinical setting in changing knowledge, skills and attitudes about contraception and pregnancy; all had poor internal validity and generalizability and collectively did not provide definitive guidance about effective counseling strategies. Nine studies (three in teenage populations) addressed the relationship of knowledge on contraceptive use and adherence. Knowledge of correct contraceptive methods may be positively associated with appropriate use, but reservations about the method itself, partner support of the method, and women's beliefs about their own fertility are important determinants of method adherence that may attenuate the knowledge effect. Many factors influence contraceptive use and adherence; among them are age, marital status, ambivalence about becoming pregnant, attitudes of partner, side effects, satisfaction with provider and costs; however, the impact of such factors may not be consistent across populations defined by cultural, age or other factors. The studies themselves differed materially in outcome variables, populations and methodologies and did not yield a body of work that can reliably identify specific influences on contraceptive use and adherence. No literature reports on harms of counseling or on the costs or cost-effectiveness of different approaches to counseling about unintended conceptions in the primary care setting. Virtually no experimental or observational literature reliably answers questions about the effectiveness of counseling in the clinical setting to reduce rates of unintended (unwanted, mistimed) pregnancies in this country. Existing studies suffer from appreciable threats to internal validity and loss to follow-up and are extremely heterogeneous in terms of populations studied and outcomes measured. The quality of the existing research does not provide strong guidance for recommendations about clinical practice but does suggest directions for future investigations. Numerous issues warrant rigorous investigation.",Contraception,2003 Feb,United States,2003,00
21791815,"The consequences for children of explosive remnants of war: Land mines, unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices, and cluster bombs.","Land mines are particularly a problem for children. The deaths and loss of body parts have been publicized, but the secondary effects - the loss or maiming of parents, the loss of physical and social space the loss of access to education, and the loss of cultivatable land with the resultant malnutrition and sickness, are less frequently considered. ""Explosive Remnants of War"" (ERW) is becoming the generic term to refer to land mines, unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices and cluster bombs. The United Nations estimates that there are currently as many as 100 million unexploded landmines with an equal number stockpiled around the world waiting to be planted. Mines are designed to be difficult to locate and their clearance is costly. Children in at least 80 countries are at risk due to ERW. The type of mine, the proximity of the child to the explosion, and location of the mine in relation to the child's body are the important determinants of the nature and severity of the injury. Children are especially susceptible to picking up explosive remnants thinking they are toys. The result is commonly loss of the hands, facial injuries, blindness and deafness. Rehabilitation for these children is extremely difficult due to remoteness and the limited resources available.",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,2009,Netherlands,2009,00
10894827,Social determinants of von willebrand factor: the Whitehall II study.,"Data from the Whitehall II Study and others have demonstrated a role for the metabolic syndrome and fibrinogen underlying the association between social position and coronary heart disease. In this study, we examined the role of an additional hemostatic factor and marker of endothelial dysfunction, von Willebrand factor (vWF). Four thousand five hundred and forty-eight men and 1837 women were examined in the third phase of the study, which took place between 1991 and 1993. Employment grade was used as a measure of socioeconomic position. An inverse relation between employment grade and vWF was evident (P<0.0003). This employment grade gradient was apparent overall, and the relation persisted even when nonsmokers and participants with poor health were removed from the analyses (P=0.02). The difference between the highest (unified grades 1 to 6) and lowest (clerical/support) employment grades in vWF concentrations was 8.9 IU/dL (95% CI 6.0, 11.8; P<0.001) for men and 6.9 IU/dL (95% CI 4.0, 9.7; P=0.06) for women. vWF was associated with a number of biological factors that themselves showed an employment grade gradient, including fibrinogen (P<0.001), fasting and postload glucose (P<0.05) levels, and fasting and postload insulin (P<0.01) levels. Associations with smoking and alcohol intake were apparent. Smoking showed a threshold effect, such that only men who smoked >21 cigarettes per day produced a significantly increased vWF level (P<0.05) compared with lighter smokers. The health-related behaviors explained 25% of the grade gradient in men and 28% in women, while the biological factors accounted for 32% in men and 22% in women. We conclude that there is a grade gradient in vWF that was not fully explained by health-related behaviors and risk factors for coronary heart disease. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction is part of the explanation for social inequalities in cardiovascular disease.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2000 Jul,United States,2000,00
19944934,Building the base: two active living projects that inspired community participation.,"BACKGROUND: Kalihi Valley is a densely populated, low-income community (28,958 residents in approximately 6 square miles) with insufficient sidewalks, bike lanes, and public green space to support regular physical activity for its residents. Kokua Kalihi Valley (KKV), a community health center formed in 1972, sought to improve Kalihi Valley's built environment based on its history of community- and partnership-based preventive health initiatives that have focused on the social determinants of health. INTERVENTION: Kokua Kalihi Valley used a flexible partnership model and a focus on direct community action to develop an unused 100-acre state park (the Kalihi Valley Nature Park) and establish a bicycle repair and recycling program that mobilized thousands of community volunteers, attracted widespread media coverage, and established a number of innovative programs for active living. Kokua Kalihi Valley and its partners also contributed to the successful passage of a city charter amendment to prioritize Honolulu as a bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly city. RESULTS: This initiative was successful in reclaiming a substantial amount of land for active living and in stimulating both public governmental support and widespread private community involvement in programs and activities. LESSONS LEARNED: Projects that engaged community members in activities with tangible accomplishment were shown to be most successful. CONCLUSIONS: This initiative showed that community health centers may be uniquely positioned to provide leadership and assume responsibility for cross-sectoral active-living health projects.",American journal of preventive medicine,2009 Dec,Netherlands,2009,00
15940398,Adaptive capacity and community-based natural resource management.,"Why do some community-based natural resource management strategies perform better than others? Commons theorists have approached this question by developing institutional design principles to address collective choice situations, while other analysts have critiqued the underlying assumptions of community-based resource management. However, efforts to enhance community-based natural resource management performance also require an analysis of exogenous and endogenous variables that influence how social actors not only act collectively but do so in ways that respond to changing circumstances, foster learning, and build capacity for management adaptation. Drawing on examples from northern Canada and Southeast Asia, this article examines the relationship among adaptive capacity, community-based resource management performance, and the socio-institutional determinants of collective action, such as technical, financial, and legal constraints, and complex issues of politics, scale, knowledge, community and culture. An emphasis on adaptive capacity responds to a conceptual weakness in community-based natural resource management and highlights an emerging research and policy discourse that builds upon static design principles and the contested concepts in current management practice.",Environmental management,2005 Jun,United States,2005,00

MATERIALS & METHODS: A written questionnaire was sent to 121 seriously injured patients who were predominantly hurt by traffic or work related accidents and were treated between june 1996 and july 2000 in two hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia. Information regarding age, gender, education, occupation, income, injury severity, injury of extremities, state anxiety, date of discharge and taking part in a cognitive behavioural intervention were gathered during the inpatient stage, information about self-rated health, patients subjective evaluation of medical treatment outcome and shared decision making with physicians were gathered about four years after trauma. RESULTS: Results of a multivariate stepwise linear regression show that poor self-rated health is significantly associated with a negative subjective evaluation of medical treatment outcome, less shared decision making behaviour of physician, low socio-economic status and older age. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment but not trauma related factors and socio-economic and demographic characteristics of patients are significantly associated with self-rated health of severely injured patients. It seems to be important for long-term health to take into account: 1.) patient reported outcomes e.g. subjective evaluation of medical treatment outcome, 2.) shared decision making behaviour of physicians and 3.) to be aware of patients with low socio-economic status or 4.) older age as a high risk population.",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,2009 May,Germany,2009,00

However, environmental and individual gradients within urban areas occur everywhere, and are resistant to change. Environments are influenced by the degree and type of industrialization, quality of housing, accessibility to green space and - of increasing concern - transport. Individual behaviour, however, also contributes to social differences, both through migration and by the effects on individuals of cultural experiences through the life-course. Reduction on inequalities may be possible through larger social action, for example urban regeneration.

The purpose of this article is to review the current situation of the MDGs worldwide and to analyse the barriers which are preventing them from being attained in each of the MDG areas, as well as to assess a number of the indicators evaluated. In order to do so, a review has been made of the scientific literature published on the MDGs in the principal health sciences and social sciences databases, as well as the most significant reports on the issue drawn up by the United Nations. The scientific studies on the 8 MDGs and their 18 Targets make it possible to undertake a critical analysis of the situation in which each of these Goals are found at the present time, identifying the determinants that are preventing the attainment of the Goals and the actions considered necessary in order to achieve progress. Although there have been improvements in some of the goals on a world level, the research carried out to date reveals barriers to the attainment of the MDGs, as well as the insufficient weight of the developing countries in the economic and political decision-making processes, together with the incoherence between the economic policies and the social and health policies. Furthermore, Sub-Saharan Africa constitutes the most disadvantaged region, which means that it will not attain the majority of the MDGs. Spain and the developed countries, in addition to contributing resources, can also contribute to the MDGs by means of the identification and eradication of the barriers preventing attainment. This involves promoting international economic relations under conditions of social justice, by supporting a greater decision-making power for developing countries and denouncing actions that increase social inequalities and the impoverishment of the population.",Revista espanola de salud publica,2008 Sep-Oct,Spain,2008,00

The field of maternal and child health must strengthen and broaden the social strategies needed to overcome the changing demography and diminished political place of children in society, globally. Four approaches are proposed: First, adopting a life-course orientation emphasizes the continuities of the early part of life with the conditions, developmental tasks, and health problems of the rest of the life cycle; it makes maternal and child health relevant to health and well being across the entire life span. Second, shifting to a focus on the multiple determinants of population health will overcome the limitations of a medical model that is narrowly concerned with etiological risk factors for disease and medical interventions; in particular, poverty among children must be addressed on a global scale. Third, promoting social justice for children demands an open political discussion of the moral and ethical foundations of child health. Finally, preventing health problems across the life span requires a new set of population level, univeral intervention strategies. These fundamental principles are proposed to stimulate a discussion of how to make our field more influential in the 21st century.",Maternal and child health journal,2001 Sep,United States,2001,00
19673052,Genetic and environmental influence on attachment disorganization.,"BACKGROUND: Empirical studies demonstrate that maternal sensitivity is associated with attachment security in infancy, while maternal frightening/frightened behavior is related to attachment disorganization. However, attachment disorganization is also predicted by individual dispositions in infancy. Indeed, recent studies indicate a link between attachment disorganization and DRD4 gene polymorphisms, thus suggesting a genetic vulnerability for attachment disorganization. The aims of our study were twofold, to test a) a possible direct link between molecular genetic variations and attachment disorganization, and b) a possible gene-environment interaction with a moderating effect of early maternal caregiving. METHODS: Attachment security and disorganization, as well as quality of maternal behavior were assessed in the infants of the Regensburg Longitudinal Study IV (N = 106) at the age of 12 months. DNA samples were collected in order to assess the exon III repeat polymorphism in the coding region and the -521 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the regulatory region of the DRD4 gene and a repeat polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. RESULTS: Significant associations were found between attachment disorganization and the short polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene. Also, a gene-environment interaction indicated that this genetic association was only valid for infants of mothers exhibiting low responsiveness. No other significant genetic associations with attachment disorganization were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a gene-environment interaction whereby biological determinants of attachment disorganization are moderated by social experiences. Different pathways of the development of attachment disorganization are discussed based on a bio-behavioral model of development.","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",2009 Aug,England,2009,00

DESIGN: Retrospective follow-up study. SETTING: Mozambique. RESULTS: Compared to children of Xitsonga mother's, children of Emakua and Cisena mother's had a mortality risk of 1.47 (CI = 1.06-1.90) and 1.21 (CI = 1.00-1.62) respectively. The excess mortality risks were partly explained by demographic, household environment, socioeconomic factors including region of residence. CONCLUSION: Ethnic affiliation of the mother (measured by the first language the mother spoke) was statistically associated with under-five mortality in Mozambique. Children of mothers of Emakua and Cisena ethnic affiliations and living in the North and Central regions had the worst survival chances. The relation between mother's ethnicity and under-five mortality was largely explained by demographic, socioeconomic and environmental factors.",East African medical journal,2006 May,Kenya,2006,00

METHODS: The odds of different levels of LTPA were assessed by living arrangements and social contacts following adjustment for measures of health, functioning, physical performance, selected health behaviors, and socioeconomic status for men and women separately (n = 2,073). Level of LTPA also was examined among married couples only (subset of sample, n = 511 spouse pairs). RESULTS: The relationship between living arrangements, social contacts, and LTPA varied by gender and level of LTPA. Among married couples, the LTPA of the partner was the most significant predictor of the LTPA of the participant, with the exception of those who engaged in less than brisk activity.

Resilience: determinants, measurement, and treatment responsiveness.","In human terms, resilience is an ability to cope with stress and varies with context, time, age, gender, and cultural origin. Resilience shifts the focus of psychological investigation onto increasing the positive rather than reducing the negative. Inquiry into resilience has evolved from descriptions of resilient qualities, to discovery of the process to attain resilience, to uncovering the motivation to reintegrate in a resilient manner. Much of the research on resilience has focused on children in settings such as family violence, extreme poverty, war, and natural disasters. A coherent pattern of characteristics associated with successful adaptation has emerged. Salient characteristics include commitment, dynamism, humor in the face of adversity, patience, optimism, faith, and altruism. As such, resilience may represent an important target of treatment in anxiety, depression, and stress reactions. Resilience can be quantified, but available measures need to be validated transculturally. There exist many possible determinants of resilience, including neurobiologic, genetic, temperament, and environmental influences. Resilience is modifiable on individual and cultural levels. Posttraumatic stress disorder is an example of a serious disorder associated with impaired stress coping that can improve with treatment.",CNS spectrums,2006 Oct,United States,2006,00
16457383,"Study of social determinants of malaria in desert part of Rajasthan, India.","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: A longitudinal study on social determinants of malaria has been undertaken in different villages of Ramgarh PHC of Jaisalmer district, Rajasthan. The study aims to determine social determinants of malaria as applicable to existing cast groups of desert part of Rajasthan. METHODS: Out of 940 households in five villages, 150 households of Rajput community (forward community) and Meghwal community (backward community) were selected at random to study whether due to different behaviour of existing caste groups, transmission of malaria and its intensity also vary or not. RESULTS: It was found that magnitude of malaria was three times more in the Meghwal community as compared to Rajput community. In-migration of natives importing malaria was found to be prominent cause of more malaria incidence in the backward community. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: An intervention policy aiming to study existing status of knowledge among different caste groups of desert areas could lead to a substantial control over in-migration as well as further transmission of disease in the desert part of Rajasthan.",Journal of vector borne diseases,2005 Dec,India,2005,00
18437435,The quality of life of Palestinians living in chronic conflict: assessment and determinants.,"This study assessed the quality of life (QoL) of Palestinians living in conditions of chronic conflict and examined its determinants. An adapted World Health Organization quality of life (WHOQoL-Bref) instrument was used in a representative sample of 1,008 adults. Factor analysis and multiple regression were conducted to determine associations between demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and scores of extracted principal determinants, and estimated overall and domain-specific QoL scores. Men, older persons and those less educated reported lower QoL than their counterparts. Negative associations were also found with higher distress and fear levels, and lower financial and freedom status. The chronic and entrenched conflict over generations resulted in lower QoL for the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.",The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,2009 Feb,Germany,2009,00
12211513,Examining social-cognitive determinants of intention and physical activity among black and white adolescent girls using structural equation modeling.,"Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate components within the theories of reasoned action (TRA), planned behavior (TPB), and self-efficacy (SET) for understanding moderate and vigorous physical activity among 1,797 Black and White adolescent girls. Modest to strong support was provided for components of TPB and SET; weak support was provided for components of TRA. Perceived behavioral control was related to vigorous physical activity. Self-efficacy was related to moderate and vigorous physical activity, and it accounted for the effect of intention on physical activity. The observed relationships were similar between Black and White girls. Self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control are independent influences on physical activity among Black and White adolescent girls and warrant study as potential mediators in physical activity interventions.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2002 Sep,United States,2002,00
12775383,Handwashing practices and challenges in Bangladesh.,"Handwashing is universally promoted in health interventions. Studies in Bangladesh and elsewhere have shown a 14 - 40% reduction of diarrhoeal diseases with handwashing. The perceptions and methods related to washing of hands vary widely in Bangladesh. Socio-economic factors are also associated with methods practised. In general, the effectiveness of handwashing practices is poor. Faecal coliform bacteriological counts were reported to be high for both left and right hands. About 85% of women studied who lived in slums and 41% of rural women washed their hands using only water. However, most women rubbed their hands on the ground, or used soil, and rinsed them with water during post-defecation handwashing. Most women claimed that they could not afford to buy soap. Experimental trials showed that use of soap, ash or soil gave similar results when women washed their hands under the same conditions. The washing of both hands, rubbing of hands, and the amount and quality of rinsing water used were found to be important determinants in the reduction of bacterial counts on hands. Although handwashing messages have been revised by most of the main programmes after these studies, there is scope for further improvement, as well as evaluation of their impact.",International journal of environmental health research,2003 Jun,England,2003,00
17520162,Social determinants of self-reported emotional and behavioral problems in Greek adolescents.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the social factors associated with self-reported emotional and behavioral problems among Greek adolescents. METHODS: At age 18, a population-based sample of 3373 Greek adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) questionnaire. RESULTS: The results from the multivariate analysis indicated that both lack of intimate friendships and not having parental monitoring were independently associated with problem behavior among both male and female adolescents. Engagement in sexual activities was significantly associated with higher YSR scores among both genders. Absence of academic motivation was associated with higher YSR scores in girls only. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that social factors, including negative family functions, lack of academic motivation and not having close friends, were associated with emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents and imply the need to develop a supportive social network for adolescents.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2007 Jul,Germany,2007,00

16902386,Internet uses for health information seeking: A literature review.,"BACKGROUND: With the widespread dissemination of the Internet throughout the world of health, it would be relevant to report on current knowledge about health information search on the Internet from the consumers' standpoint. METHODS: We conducted a bibliographical research over the past five years and distinguished between international and French studies. RESULTS: For a long time, the (mostly US) studies have been merely descriptive. The studies highlight that the factors associated with health searches on the Internet are similar to the factors underlying the digital divide. Consumer searches are deemed efficient although search skills are comparatively below standard. Attempts are underway to set up tools, circulate them widely, and ensure better quality information on the Internet. However, comprehension and literacy are still issues in some social groups. Regarding the impact on consumer health per se, a (positive) effect of the Internet seems to emerge but research should be continued. CONCLUSION: Many of the behaviors, uses or limits addressed in this paper pertain to any information search on the Internet but other problems or differences also occur in the specific area of health. Longitudinal investigations are needed, specifically to gain deeper insight into the impacts we have addressed, while rolling out a comprehensive approach to the temporal evolution of user practices and experiences. Specifically, the central issue is still to determine how (and for whom) the Internet alters information search behaviors and, in fine, to what extent this affects health behaviors and the recourse to healthcare.",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,2006 Jun,France,2006,00
19047546,Determinants of health insurance status for children of Latino immigrant and other US farm workers: findings from the National Agricultural Workers Survey.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the health insurance status of farm workers' children, an understudied topic. DESIGN: A population-based multistage survey. SETTING: Employer-based study conducted in the continental United States from 2000 to 2002. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3136 parents with children younger than 18 years and no children residing outside of the United States who participated in the US Department of Labor's National Agricultural Workers Survey, which is administered to a national probability sample of US farm workers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Children's parent-reported health insurance status. RESULTS: Of the farm workers who were parents, 87% were Latino, 81% were foreign born, 15% were migrant workers, 55% had less than a sixth-grade education, and 68% reported little to no English language proficiency. Thirty-two percent of all farm-worker parents, including 45% of migrant-worker parents, reported that their children were uninsured. In multivariate analyses, older parental age (odds ratio [OR] for parents aged 30-39 years, 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.50; OR for parents aged >/=40 years, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.99-4.74), less parental education (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09-2.10), less time in the United States (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.91 per 10 years in the United States), being a migrant worker (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.31-2.93), and living in the Southeast (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.00-5.02) or Southwest (OR, 3.91; 95% CI, 2.32-6.57) were significantly associated with having uninsured children. CONCLUSIONS: Farm workers' children were uninsured at roughly 3 times the rate of all other children and almost twice the rate of those at or near the federal poverty level. Programs aimed at extending insurance coverage for children should consider the unique social barriers that characterize this vulnerable population of US children. Moreover, there is significant regional variation that may reflect varying levels of insurance resources and eligibility from state to state.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00
11153925,Determinants of cariogenic snacking in adolescents in Belfast and Helsinki.,"The aim of the study was to investigate the determinants of reported snack consumption in adolescents residing in Belfast, Northern Ireland and Helsinki, Finland. Ten % random samples of 14-15 yr old Belfast (n = 628) and Helsinki (n = 600) adolescents were obtained. A questionnaire assessed their demography, oral health knowledge, attitudes and the consumption of cariogenic snacks containing non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES). Five hundred and eighty-nine (94%) questionnaires were returned in Belfast and 441 (74%) questionnaires in Helsinki. Belfast adolescents had significantly higher levels of oral health knowledge and higher consumption rates for snacks containing NMES. The Helsinki adolescents had more positive attitudes towards their oral health. Multivariant analysis showed that demography was the most direct determinant of cariogenic snacking. The acquisition of oral health knowledge played a minor role. There is a need to develop tailored and focused programmes to promote healthier snacking regimes in adolescents.",European journal of oral sciences,2000 Dec,England,2000,00
11965528,Evaluation of ambient air concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Germany from 1990 to 1998.,"All available polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentration data in ambient air obtained over the past 10 years in Germany were evaluated to clarify whether it is justified to use benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) as a marker compound for the total PAH exposure. The data basis comprises annual mean concentrations from 1990 to 1998 supplied by the emission protection authorities of the federal states with additional information on the region, year and site of measurement. The data are very heterogeneous with respect to sample size, the number of individual PAHs analyzed, place of origin and year. Nine of 25 individual compounds with sufficient sample size (74<N<518) were submitted to an explorative descriptive analysis and multiple regression analysis. Six compounds were selected for factor analysis to evaluate whether associations can be related to one or several background determinants. The concentration data of BaA, BeP, BaP, DBA, BghiP, COR, BbF, BkF and INP are not normally distributed and demonstrate great variability. Location, East-West differences persisting after the German reunion and time characterize the distributive patterns, e.g., from 1991 to 1997, a significant decrease in BaP could be determined based on the data from North Rhine-Westphalia (1991, N=51, median 1.6 ng/m(3); 1997, N=45, median 0.7 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). The BaP concentrations in the new federal states in the East (N=80, median 2.2 ng/m(3)) are about twice as high compared to the ones in the old federal states in the West (N=438, median 1.1 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). BaP measurements taken at sites characterized by traffic (1.8 ng/m(3)), industrial (1.3 ng/m(3)) or urban environment (1.3 ng/m(3)) rank significantly higher compared to measurements taken at rural sites (0.92 ng/m(3); P<or=0.0001). Factor analysis of the intercorrelation matrix of BaA, BeP, BaP, DBA, BghiP and COR yields one factor to explain 92% of the variability of the six individual PAHs. BaP shows the highest factor loading. These results confirm the common practice to use BaP as marker compound for the PAH exposure in ambient air.",Journal of exposure analysis and environmental epidemiology,2002 Mar,England,2002,00
19142342,"[Prevalence and early determinants of common mental disorders in the 1982 birth cohort, Pelotas, Southern Brazil].","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of common mental disorders and assess its association with risk factors in a cohort of young adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional study nested in a 1982 birth cohort study conducted in Pelotas, Southern Brazil. In 2004-5, 4,297 subjects were interviewed during home visits. Common mental disorders were assessed using the Self-Report Questionnaire. Risk factors included socioeconomic, demographic, perinatal, and environmental variables. The analysis was stratified by gender and crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated by Poisson regression. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of common mental disorders was 28.0%; 32.8% and 23.5% in women and men, respectively. Men and women who were poor in 2004-5, regardless of their poor status in 1982, had nearly 1.5-fold increased risk for common mental disorders (p<0.001) when compared to those who have never been poor. Among women, being poor during childhood (p<0.001) and black/mixed skin color (p=0.002) increased the risk for mental disorders. Low birth weight and duration of breastfeeding were not associated to the risk of these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalence of common mental disorders among low-income groups and race-ethnic minorities suggests that social inequalities present at birth have a major impact on mental health, especially common mental disorders.",Revista de saude publica,2008 Dec,Brazil,2008,00

While cross-sectional studies provide important information on GP visiting patterns at a certain point in time, with panel data we can also control for unobserved individual heterogeneity, as well as identify whether it is the same individuals who consistently visit their GP year on year, or whether there is more mobility in visiting. We therefore estimate dynamic models of GP utilisation, and attempt to decompose the observed variation in GP visiting into components attributable to observed individual characteristics, unobserved individual heterogeneity and state dependence.",Health economics,2007 Feb,England,2007,00
19167058,Trade and social determinants of health.,"The effects of trade and trade liberalisation on the social determinants of health are not well known. Here, we outline a conceptual framework of links between trade liberalisation and health outcomes, and review existing evidence for these by focusing on four key factors: income, inequality, economic insecurity, and unhealthy diets. Even though trade liberalisation seems to have positive effects on economic growth, it is not sufficient to boost growth. In several countries, trade reforms have not translated into enhanced economic expansion because complementary policies are needed. Trade liberalisation and openness are associated with greater wage inequality and raised economic insecurity. Trade liberalisation has facilitated availability of highly processed, calorie-rich, nutrient-poor food in developing countries, but further research is needed to better understand the effects of trade on unhealthy diets. Policymakers and health professionals need to be aware that the global economy affects the health of populations and understand how risks associated with trade liberalisation can be mitigated.","Lancet (London, England)",2009 Feb 7,England,2009,00
19851051,Demographic and socioeconomic determinants of the use of periodic health examinations: public vs. private sector.,"Periodic health examinations (PHEs) are prevalent in Korea. While some people frequently use public PHEs, others use private PHEs with high fees. This study examined the determinants of the use of public and private PHEs using a multinomial logit model. We used the data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) Wave I conducted in 2006. The KLoSA was a national longitudinal study of a representative sample of individuals (n = 10,253) aged 45 years or older. The mean age of the sample was 61.6 years; 77.8% of subjects were married and 37.5% had at least a high school education. The most frequent type of PHE usage was public PHEs only (38.9%), followed by private PHEs only (7.3%) and both public and private PHEs (6.5%). This study found that subjects who lived in rural areas or who were employed were significantly more likely to use public PHEs because of many public health facilities in rural area and mandatory public PHEs for employees. Those who used private PHEs only were educated, wealthy, or unhealthy, because private PHEs required out-of-pocket payments and provided higher quality services. Those who used both types of PHE had a high socio-economic status or a bad health status. The authors suggest that policy makers pay attention to the use of public PHEs among populations with lower socio-economic status. As for the group of subjects who use both types of PHE, their overutilization of PHEs must be reduced through cooperation between the public and private PHEs.",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,2009 Nov,Japan,2009,00
15686147,A First Nations voice in the present creates healing in the future.,"This paper discusses the urgency for change and improvements in health policy determined by the exploding demographics and inequities in the health status of First Nation people. A historical overview of health services for First Nation clients was conducted as set out through government legislation and health and social policies. Until WWII ended, the federal government provided assistance to First Nations through Indian Affairs branches of several departments. This responsibility was gradually transferred to National Health and Welfare. In 1962, the federal government established a Medical Services Branch, later renamed First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, and mandated to provide services to First Nation clients, which fell outside the provincial jurisdiction of health care. Initially centered on public health priorities, services have expanded to include primary health care, dental, mental health, environmental health, home and continuing care, and Non-Insured Health Benefits. The Romanow Report substantiated the urgency for health policy improvements voiced by many First Nations. However, it generalized Aboriginal issues in health care on a national front. Furthermore, its recommendations were specific to health care providers and delivery models and did not address the social and spiritual determinants of health, which are fundamental to a First Nations' holistic approach. Health planners must think holistically, considering traditional and westernized medicine, First Nations' values, priorities and government systems, and present and evolving health systems. Universities, health authorities, provinces and the federal government are continually developing new research and health models, which will also need consideration. Further, the imperative of involving community-level input must be recognized.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2005 Jan-Feb,Switzerland,2005,00
16451362,Swedish dental hygienists' preferences for workplace improvement and continuing professional development.,"UNLABELLED: The present study examined factors for workplace improvement and continuing professional development (CPD) for Swedish dental hygienists. Seventy-one per cent of 577 randomly selected members of Sweden's Dental Hygienist Association responded to a questionnaire. The chi-square test, Spearman's rank correlation, and multiple stepwise logistic regression modelling were used in the statistical analysis. The results showed that dental hygienists having more than 10 sick days annually and with a strong commitment to their work increased the preference for workplace improvements, such as peer recognition of dental hygienists' professional qualifications, clinical process quality, and time for reading research articles and participating in projects. In addition, dental hygienists in the 41-52 age group were associated with workplace improvements. This is in contrast to the factors that decreased preferences for workplace improvements: clear work roles, a 1-year training programme, a male clinic manager, and working in the private sector. Practicing dental hygiene in the public sector and lifestyle factors were the most influential determinants for a strong interest in CPD. CONCLUSION: Workplaces should observe people that are obviously committed to their work, those with many sick days, and those in a specific age group, as they indicate different preferences for workplace improvements. CPD seems to be a lower priority than workplace improvements for Swedish dental hygienists.",International journal of dental hygiene,2005 Aug,England,2005,00
15762394,Self-regulation and recovery: approaching an understanding of the process of recovery from stress.,"Stress has been studied extensively in psychology. Only recently, however, has research started to address the question of how individuals manage to recover from stress. Recovery from stress is analyzed as a process of self-regulation. Several individual difference variables which affect the efficiency of self-regulation have been integrated into a structured model of the recovery process. Such variables are action versus state orientation (a tendency to ruminate, e.g., about a past experience) and volitional components, such as self-determination, self-motivation, emotion control, rumination, and self-discipline. Some of these components are assumed to promote recovery from stress, whereas others are assumed to further the perseverance of stress. The model was supported by the empirical findings of three independent studies (Study 1, N=58; Study 2, N=221; Study 3, N= 105). Kuhl's Action Control Scale measured action versus state orientation. Volitional components were assessed with Kuhl and Fuhrmann's Volitional Components Questionnaire. The amounts of experienced stress and recovery from stress was assessed with Kellmann and Kallus's Recovery-Stress Questionnaire. As hypothesized in the model, the disposition towards action versus state orientation was a more distant determinant of the recovery from stress and perseverance of stress. The volitional components are more proximal determinants in the recovery process. Action orientation promotes recovery from stress via adequate volitional skills, e.g., self-determination, self-motivation, emotion control, whereas state orientation furthers a perseverance of stress through rumination and self-discipline.",Psychological reports,2004 Dec,United States,2004,00
15155595,Periconceptional smoking: an exploratory study of determinants of change in smoking behavior among women in the fertile age range.,"How can women who are not yet pregnant be motivated to stop smoking before they become pregnant? Epidemiological studies have suggested that periconceptional smoking and smoking during the first trimester of the pregnancy may lead to congenital abnormalities. To motivate women to stop smoking before pregnancy, more insight is needed into the differences between 'smoking' women who want to have children and those who do not. A sample of 931 women (65% response rate) aged 15-45 years returned a questionnaire with questions about their smoking behavior, wish to have children, risk perceptions, attitude to smoking, personal efficacy and stage of readiness to change. In spite of some positive outcomes (e.g. negative attitude to smoking, relatively high risk perceptions of the relationship between congenital anomalies and smoking), one cannot automatically assume that these women will stop smoking before they get pregnant. (1) Beliefs, attitude and readiness to change were not well integrated and grounded cognitively. (2) Women who smoked were pessimistic about their ability to quit. Future campaigns need to 'invite' women to associate and to integrate risk information about the relationship between smoking and congenital abnormalities with other cognitions (attitude, intention). It is also important to instruct women in how to stop smoking and to remain non-smokers.",Health education research,2004 Aug,England,2004,00
11825636,Iron stores in low-income pregnant Mexican women at term.,"BACKGROUND: Iron stores can be depleted during pregnancy. Serum ferritin is the most useful non-invasive test to assess iron stores in women of reproductive age. Iron status of pregnant Mexican women at term from a low-income group was investigated through serum ferritin determinations. METHODS: Hemoglobin and serum ferritin were measured in 201 low-income urban women with at-term pregnancy receiving attention at a public university hospital. Hemoglobin cut-off value was 110.0 g/L. Depending on their serum ferritin concentration, women were divided into three groups: group I, iron deficiency, serum ferritin <12 microg/L; group II, borderline iron stores, serum ferritin >or=12 microg/L and <30 microg/L, and group III, normal iron stores, serum ferritin >or=30 microg/L. RESULTS: Mean SF value in the entire group was 7.0 +/- 6.4 microg/L, with a mean Hb of 110.1 +/- 15.8 g/L. One hundred seventy-two women (85.6%) had empty iron stores. Ninety-two women (46%) in the entire group had iron deficiency anemia, as did 79 (46%) of the 172 iron-deficient women. During their pregnancy, 165 women (82%) did not ingest any supplemental iron and 131 (65%) did not receive any prenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: We documented a high prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, together with practically no prenatal care utilization and no supplemental iron ingestion in this low-income group. A serum ferritin concentration >or=12 microg/L was always accompanied by a normal hemoglobin concentration. These data suggest that prenatal care and iron supplementation may be considered as major determinants of maternal iron stores to prevent iron deficiency anemia.",Archives of medical research,2002 Jan-Feb,United States,2002,00
16022212,"Change in the world of occupational health: silica control, then and now.","To control silicosis, we need to understand how change happens in occupational health. Science alone does not drive policy, because we have known the causes of silicosis, and how to prevent it for decades, yet the disease persists. To control occupational disease, we need to enter the social realm of work. To investigate the determinants of a successful silicosis control program, we wrote a social history of the Vermont Granite Industry from 1938 to 1960, examining union journals, newspapers, industry journals, scientific literature and government documents, and interviewing key informants. The crucial factor of the successful program was a strong public health movement to control tuberculosis, rather than pressure to control the occupational disease. Using this lesson, to protect workers from silica exposure now, we chose to regulate silica under an environmental law, the Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act. Science is but one small factor, necessary but insufficient, in policy change. We in occupational health need to hitch onto a stronger movement, currently the environmental movement. Where unions are too weak to demand safe technologies, we need to learn to speak the language of employers, because they may have little idea of the costs of interventions. We need to gather more economic information about the costs of interventions.",Journal of public health policy,2005 Jul,England,2005,00

Eleven published studies investigating physical activity in samples of adult employees were included in this review. Across these studies, self-efficacy, or belief in personal ability to perform this health behavior, was the best predictor of physical activity among employees. Perceived benefits of physical activity and perceived health status were also found to influence participation in physical activity. Occupational health nurses could offer self-care classes and intervention programs that assist employees in improving their perceptions of self-efficacy to perform physical activity. Additionally, occupational health nurses should continue to reinforce the benefits of physical activity in all health promotion venues.",AAOHN journal : official journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses,2006 Jun,United States,2006,00

METHODS: This study used pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis of 11 years of state-level data (n=549). Analyses controlled for education levels, unemployment, racial/ethnic composition, and percent urban. Contemporaneous and time-lagged covariates were modeled. RESULTS: Primary care was negatively associated with stroke mortality in models including all covariates (P<0.0001). The impact of income inequality on stroke mortality was reduced in the presence of primary care (P<0.0001) but disappeared with the addition of covariates (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of social policy that addresses sociodemographic determinants of health, primary care promotion may serve as a palliative strategy for combating stroke mortality and reducing the adverse impact of income inequality on health.",Stroke,2003 Aug,United States,2003,00
19491561,[The determinants of the use of opportunistic screening programs in Korea].,"OBJECTIVES: Both organized and opportunistic screening programs have been widely used in Korea. This paper examined the determinants of the use of opportunistic screening programs in Korea. METHODS: The subjects were a national stratified random sample of 10,254 people aged 45 or older from the first wave of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 2006. A logit model was used to examine the determinants of the use of opportunistic screening programs in terms of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, the type of health insurance and the health status. RESULTS: Thirteen point seven percent of the individuals received opportunistic screening programs within 2 years from the time the survey was conducted in 2006. The individuals who graduated from college or who had even more education were 3.0 times more likely to use opportunistic screening programs compared with the individuals who were illiterate. The individuals who resided in urban areas and who had religious beliefs were more likely to receive opportunistic screening programs compared with their counterparts. Those who were in the first quartile for the total household assets were 2.6 times more likely to use opportunistic screening programs than those who were in the fourth quartile for the total household assets. Privately insured people were 1.6 times more likely to use opportunistic screening programs than those who were not insured. Finally, the individuals who self-assessed their health status as worst were 2.1 times more likely to use opportunistic screening programs compared individuals who self-assessed their health status as best. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that opportunistic screening programs can be an indicator for whether or not an individual is among the advantaged group in terms of their socioeconomic characteristics and type of health insurance.",Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,2009 May,Korea (South),2009,00
25871710,Embodied history. Uniqueness and exemplarity of South African AIDS.,"The exceptionality of AIDS in South Africa, both for its epidemiological features and public controversies, seems to have its correspondence in the exceptionalism of South African history, with its unprecedented regime of apartheid and its unexpected turn to democracy. The article shows that AIDS in this country can simultaneously be seen as unique (because of the historical context in which it is inscribed) and exemplar (of social determinants observed in other countries characterised by similar past or present of domination). As an alternative to cultural and behavioural models of the epidemic which have been widely spread on the African continent, the concept of embodiment of history is proposed in order to account for both the structural facts underlying the epidemic (inequality, violence, migration) and the construction of collective as well as individual narratives of the disease (including victimisation and accusation).",African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,2002,South Africa,2002,00
16414146,Social capital and administrative contextual determinants of lack of access to a regular doctor: a multilevel analysis in southern Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of contextual (social capital and administrative/neo-materialist) and individual factors on lack of access to a regular doctor. METHODS: The 2000 public health survey in Scania is a cross-sectional study. A total of 13,715 persons answered a postal questionnaire, which is 59% of the random sample. A multilevel logistic regression model, with individuals at the first level and municipalities at the second, was performed. The effect (intra-class correlations, cross-level modification and odds ratios) of individual and municipality (social capital and health care district) factors on lack of access to a regular doctor was analysed using simulation method. The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was used as information criterion for the models. RESULTS: The second level municipality variance in lack of access to a regular doctor is substantial even in the final models with all individual and contextual variables included. The model that results in the largest reduction in DIC is the model including age, sex and individual social participation (which is a network aspect of social capital), but the models which include administrative and social capital second level factors also reduced the DIC values. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that both administrative health care district and social capital may partly explain the individual's self reported lack of access to a regular doctor.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2006 Dec,Ireland,2006,00
12153380,Patient factors and medication guideline adherence among older women with asthma.,"BACKGROUND: Asthma guidelines are well established but often followed poorly. Determinants of adherence among older persons may differ from younger persons and have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVES: To assess adherence to asthma medication guidelines among older women with asthma and evaluate predictors of adherence with emphasis on asthma characteristics, comorbid medical conditions, work-related factors, social supports, caregiving, and emotional well-being. METHODS: We assessed adherence to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program medication guidelines among participants in the Nurses' Health Study who reported a physician diagnosis of asthma and reconfirmed the diagnosis on a separate questionnaire, excluding those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Among 121 700 participants in the Nurses' Health Study, 5107 reported physician-diagnosed asthma meeting inclusion criteria. Mean +/- SD age was 63 +/- 7 years in 1998. Adherence with asthma medication guidelines was 57% for mild persistent, 55% for moderate persistent, and 32% for severe persistent asthma (P =.001). In multivariate analysis, nonadherence was associated with severe asthma, increasing age, lower socioeconomic status, current smoking, earlier onset of asthma, and number of comorbid medical conditions. Measures of social isolation, caregiving, and emotional well-being were not associated with nonadherence. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is undertreated among older women, even those who are health care professionals. Women with advanced age and severe asthma were particularly at risk. Given that the greatest increase in asthma mortality has occurred among older women, further research is needed to examine physician prescribing patterns and patient beliefs in this vulnerable population.",Archives of internal medicine,2002 Aug 12-26,United States,2002,00
18773239,Empirical social-ecological system analysis: from theoretical framework to latent variable structural equation model.,"The social-ecological system (SES) approach to natural resource management holds enormous promise towards achieving sustainability. Despite this promise, social-ecological interactions are complex and elusive; they require simplification to guide effective application of the SES approach. The complex, adaptive and place-specific nature of human-environment interactions impedes determination of state and trends in SES parameters of interest to managers and policy makers. Based on a rigorously developed systemic theoretical model, this paper integrates field observations, interviews, surveys, and latent variable modeling to illustrate the development of simplified and easily interpretable indicators of the state of, and trends in, relevant SES processes. Social-agricultural interactions in the Logone floodplain, in the Lake Chad basin, served as case study. This approach is found to generate simplified determinants of the state of SESs, easily communicable across the array of stakeholders common in human-environment interactions. The approach proves to be useful for monitoring SESs, guiding interventions, and assessing the effectiveness of interventions. It incorporates real time responses to biophysical change in understanding coarse scale processes within which finer scales are embedded. This paper emphasizes the importance of merging quantitative and qualitative methods for effective monitoring and assessment of SESs.",Environmental management,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00
17003687,Risk factors for childhood diarrhea incidence: dynamic analysis of a longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND: Several longitudinal studies have investigated factors associated with childhood diarrhea in developing countries. However, most studies have neglected important dynamic features of the longitudinal design and hierarchical interrelationships among the potential risk factors. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of 902 children, age 0 to 36 months at baseline, in a large urban center in northeastern Brazil. Diarrhea data were collected by following children from October 2000 until January 2002 with biweekly home visits. We used a dynamic time-to-event analysis to account for several longitudinal features. We applied an effect-decomposition strategy to quantify direct and indirect effects of risk factors grouped in different blocks. RESULTS: Child's age and an autoregressive effect of past diarrhea episodes explained some of the decline of diarrhea incidence observed throughout the study (from more than 14 episodes to 2 episodes per child-year), a phenomenon already observed but not explained in other longitudinal diarrhea studies. We identified the following major diarrhea determinants: low socioeconomic status, poor sanitation conditions, presence of intestinal parasites, and absence of prenatal examination. The effect of socioeconomic status was mediated mostly by living and sanitation conditions. CONCLUSION: Our study shows important advantages of applying a dynamic analysis approach to longitudinal observational studies of diarrhea or other acute diseases and highlights the complex interrelationships of diarrhea determinants. Our results confirm the importance of sanitation as a major determinant of child health in urban settings of developing countries.","Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2006 Nov,United States,2006,00
16042163,Determinants of healthy eating among low-income Canadians.,"This paper draws on four bodies of literature to consider the determinants of healthy eating for low-income Canadians: a) the social determinants of health; b) socio-economic gradients in diet; c) food security; and d) the sociology of food. Though there is a paucity of data for Canada, it is very likely that, as in other industrialized countries, there are socio-economic gradients in diet such that those who are better off consume healthier diets than those less well-to-do. The available evidence suggests that income affects food intake both directly and indirectly through the dispositions associated with particular social class locations. Thus, there may be both economic and cultural thresholds for some food groups or particular foods in food groups. Understanding these thresholds is especially important in addressing the issues facing those who are the most vulnerable among Canadians with low incomes: the food insecure. The literature reviewed suggests that improved nutrition for low-income Canadians may be difficult to achieve a) in isolation from other changes to improve their lives; b) without improvement in the nutrition of the general population of Canadians; and c) without some combination of these two changes. Four major areas of research need were identified: a) national data on socio-economic gradients in diet; b) sociological research on the interaction of income and class with other factors affecting food practices; c) sociological research on Canadian food norms and cultures; and d) research on the costs of healthy eating.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2005 Jul-Aug,Switzerland,2005,00
15774446,Facets and determinants of quality of life in patients with recurrent high grade glioma.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess patients with recurrent high grade brain glioma with the aim of evaluating facets of quality of life (QOL) and their association with mood, cognition, and physical performance. METHODS: Ninety four glioma patients (four groups with different duration of glioma recurrence) were compared with 24 patients with other chronic neurological diseases and 48 healthy subjects. The Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLIC) provided QOL self evaluations, and standardised scales and neuropsychological tests assessed physical performance, mood, and cognition. RESULTS: In glioma patients, factor analysis of the FLIC items documented five domains: Psychological well being, Role/sociability, Inner experience of disease, Isolation/sharing, and Nausea. Higher FLIC total scores were related to better cognition, physical performances, and mood, and lower grading; poorer Psychological well being and worse Inner experience of disease to depressed mood; minor Role/sociability to worse cognitive and physical performances and higher grading; worse Nausea to longer disease duration. Compared with healthy subjects, all glioma groups were cognitively impaired and more anxious, and two groups with short duration of recurrence were also more depressed. Patients with chronic neurological diseases showed worse mood and cognitive abilities compared with healthy subjects, but performed attention tests better than glioma patients. Glioma and chronic disease patients showed similar FLIC scores and autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that QOL of recurrent high grade glioma patients is multifaceted and determined by multiple factors. Disease severity does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of expressing personal feelings and opinions which could provide criteria for clinical decision making and psychological support.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2005 Apr,England,2005,00
19276102,Sociodemographic differences in return to work after stroke: the South London Stroke Register (SLSR).,"BACKGROUND: Loss of employment contributes significantly to the burden of stroke on individuals and society. There is limited information on factors influencing return to work after stroke. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency and determinants of return to paid work after stroke in a multi-ethnic urban population. METHODS: Patterns of return to work were examined among people with first ever stroke registered in the population based South London Stroke Register. Employment status and functional outcome (Barthel Index (BI), Frenchay Activity Index (FAI)) were assessed 1 year after stroke. Associations between baseline characteristics and return to paid work were analysed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 2874 patients with first ever strokes in 1995-2004, 400 (15%) were working before the stroke. At 1 year, 94 (35%) of 266 survivors had returned to paid work. Black ethnicity (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.88), female sex (0.43; 0.21 to 0.91), older age (p<0.001), diabetes (0.25; 0.08 to 0.79) and dependence (BI < or = 19) in the acute phase (0.24; 0.11 to 0.49) were independently associated with lower odds of return to work in multivariable analysis. Better functional outcome at 1 year was associated with return to paid work (p<0.001) but 53% of 161 independent (BI > 19) and 39% of 96 very active (FAI > 30/45) individuals had not resumed work. CONCLUSIONS: There were important sociodemographic differences in return to work after stroke that were independent of clinical and service use variables included in the analysis. A large proportion of patients did not resume work despite excellent functional outcome.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2009 Aug,England,2009,00
18833350,"Transdisciplinary research strategies for understanding socially patterned disease: the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project as a case study.","As we have seen a global increase in asthma in the past three decades it has also become clear that it is a socially patterned disease, based on demographic and socioeconomic indicators clustered by areas of residence. This trend is not readily explained by traditional genetic paradigms or physical environmental exposures when considered alone. This has led to consideration of the interplay among physical and psychosocial environmental hazards and the molecular and genetic determinants of risk (i.e., biomedical framing) within the broader socioenvironmental context including socioeconomic position as an upstream ""cause of the causes"" (i.e., ecological framing). Transdisciplinary research strategies or programs that embrace this complexity through a shared conceptual framework that integrates diverse discipline-specific theories, models, measures, and analytical methods into ongoing asthma research may contribute most significantly toward furthering our understanding of socially patterned disease. This paper provides an overview of a multilevel, multimethod longitudinal study, the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment and Social Stress (ACCESS), as a case study to exemplify both the opportunities and challenges of transdisciplinary research on urban asthma expression in the United States.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2008 Nov-Dec,Brazil,2008,00
16202178,Socio-demographic determinants of abortion in India: a north-South comparison.,"Data from the 1998-99 National Family Health Survey (NFHS2) of India are used to examine the net effects of social and demographic characteristics of women on the likelihood of abortion while emphasizing important differences between women from northern and southern states. A north-south comparison illustrates that southern women have relatively higher levels of literacy and labour force participation, lower levels of son preference, and smaller family size. Results from logistic regression analyses show that literacy, type of work, belonging to a scheduled caste or tribe, urban residence, standard of living, parity, religion, age, age at union and contraceptive behaviour all have significant effects on the likelihood of abortion. However, most of these effects significantly differ for southern and northern women. Moreover, the effects of agricultural work, son preference and age at union on the likelihood of abortion are significant for northern but not southern women.",Journal of biosocial science,2006 Mar,England,2006,00
11109891,[Sexual development of the child and the onset of gender identity].,"In view of the numerous questions raised by the recently disclosed pedophilia, sexual abuses and prostitution of children, it appeared worthwhile to review the recent studies dealing with the child sexual development and the onset of the gender identity. These studies consist partly in retrospective analysis of pathological situations and partly in the analysis of normal development. It appears that the social and emotional surroundings of the child, provided that they were continuous and devoid of ambiguity, play a prominent role in this process. At present, numerous authors consider that gender identity is achieved at about 2 years of age when the child has a harmonious general development. The family physician and the paediatrician are on the first line to detect potential problems provided that they were aware of the main determinants and symptoms involved.",Revue medicale de Bruxelles,2000 Oct,Belgium,2000,00
19402801,Research and action: toward good quality of life and equity in health.,"A brief summary of key presentations at the 15th Annual International Society for Quality of Life conference is presented. Special highlights of this conference were its location (South America) and its aim to present current and potential contributions of the health-related quality of life (QoL) field to equity in healthcare at a clinical and population level, providing crucial inputs for decision-making in a person-centered health conception. Present and future utilization of health-related QoL measures, norms and bank items were introduced by David Cella, who also called for researchers' cooperation, stating that efforts towards a commonly shared language and metric are better than a relentless pursuit of perfection. Other central topics in the search of equity were stigma and poverty. The importance of negative attributes by others in stigma severity perception and low self-reported QoL was demonstrated by Donald Patrick, who suggested interventions for reducing stigma. Poverty impact on children's QoL and the importance of social determinants were demonstrated through a unique, longitudinal Brazilian study. Complementarily, the importance of a biological basis of oncologic symptoms, particularly cytokines, and the impact of their control on health-related QoL were addressed by Charles Cleeland. The meeting stressed the combined importance of social, psychological and biological factors in determining patient-reported outcomes.",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,2009 Apr,England,2009,00

In confirmation of the hypotheses, (a) the intercorrelation of the rankings was greater for the choice photographs than for the nonchoice photographs when the subjects anticipated an important choice, but not when they anticipated an unimportant choice; and (b) the intercorrelation was greater for the choice photographs than for the nonchoice photographs when the subjects were aroused by caffeine and uninformed as to the source of their arousal, but not when they were informed as to the source of their arousal or not aroused.",Integrative physiological and behavioral science : the official journal of the Pavlovian Society,2005 Jul-Sep,United States,2005,00
17505578,[Social and familial determinants of anxiety and depressive symptoms in middle to low income women].,"BACKGROUND: Among women, risk factors for mental disorders are violence, economical inequities and disadvantages and discrimination. AIM: To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in women and to determine factors associated with them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross sectional study of a probabilistic sample of 422 women aged 34 years as a mean, living in a medium to low income neighborhood in Temuco, Chile. Mental health was assessed with the self reporting questionnaire (SRQ20), partner violence was evaluated using a 12 item scale and family conflict and violence was evaluated using the Conflicts Tactics scale. A logistic repression analysis was used to identify factors associated with mental health alterations. RESULTS: Forty one percent of women had anxiety or depressive symptoms. The main associated factors with these symptoms were severe physical violence against children (odds ratio (OR)=14.3), sexual violence against women (OR=9.7), self perception of health (OR=4.5), alcohol abuse (OR=4.4), psychological violence during childhood (OR=3.2) and lack of family support network (OR=2.7). Unemployment and lack of a support network of relatives had an OR 3.3 for mental health alterations. The OR for psychological violence plus sexual violence was 18.5. The figure for psychological violence plus sexual violence plus a history of parental violence during childhood was 26.5. CONCLUSIONS: Forty one percent of this group of women had mental health alterations. There is a strong association between these alterations, family violence and socioeconomic factors.",Revista medica de Chile,2007 Mar,Chile,2007,00
11213872,Factors influencing glycemic control in young people with type 1 diabetes in Scotland: a population-based study (DIABAUD2).,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in HbA1c concentrations between centers and to assess the factors associated with glycemic control in young people with type 1 diabetes in Scotland. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on 1,755 patients (94% of those registered) were collected from 18 centers providing care to children <15 years of age. At every clinic visit, a duplicate HbA1c sample was measured in a reference laboratory, and clinical information was collected prospectively. RESULTS: Average HbA1c concentration was 9.1% (range 5.0-15.0). The following significant associations with HbA1c level were identified: age, insulin regimen, BMI, season, social circumstances, and family history. HbA1c concentrations were significantly worse in older children (age 10-15 years 9.5% vs. other ages 8.8%, P < 0.001), those using two injections per day (2/day 9.1% vs. 3/day 8.8%, P < 0.01), children without both parents at home (9.4 vs. 9.0%, P < 0.001), a sibling with diabetes (9.7% vs. no family history 9.1%, P < 0.001). HbA1c concentration ranged from 8.1 to 10.2% between centers, after adjustment for factors associated with poor HbA1c (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The overall glycemic control of diabetic young people in Scotland is equivalent to a Diabetes Control and Complications Trial HbA1c concentration of 8.7%, placing the majority at a high risk of the complications of diabetes in adulthood. Although factors were significantly associated with poor HbA1c adjustment for these did not explain the differences between centers. We suggest that factors not analyzed in DIABAUD2 (e.g., deployment of resources, organization of the clinical structure, strategies of care, and clinic philosophy) are the determinants of HbA1c. We speculate that the style of utilization of optimum resources is the key to achieving good glycemic control.",Diabetes care,2001 Feb,United States,2001,00

15885866,Estimation of private and social time preferences for health in northern Tanzania.,"Time preferences for health has a role in informing discounting practice in economic evaluation of health care interventions. Yet virtually no empirical evidence on time preferences for health are available for sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this paper are therefore to estimate time preferences for health in Tanzania, and to explore the relationship between time preferences for one's own private health and for others health. Determinants of time preference rates are also explored. A sample of the general population participated, and each person was asked to indicate the maximum duration of more distant ill-health they would be willing to accept in return for a specified delay in the onset of the condition. People were randomised to answer either questions in the context of their own health or in the context of others health. Estimations were done using clustered least squares regression with robust standard errors. The implied mean and median discount rates were 0.07 and 0.058, respectively. Time preferences for one's own and others' health--conceptualised as social health--seem to be roughly the same in this sample, but people seem to discount the most severe health condition at a significantly lower rate than the least severe condition.",Social science & medicine (1982),2005 Oct,England,2005,00
14608814,Measuring leprosy stigma--a preliminary review of the leprosy literature.,"A literature review was conducted to review work done to date on measuring stigma related to leprosy. References were obtained through a PubMed (Medline) search and through examining relevant bibliographies. Twelve papers were selected that addressed the issue of measurement of stigma and that contained a sample of the instrument used. Three unpublished studies were also included in the review. Studies that attempt to measure stigma can be broadly categorized in two groups, a) studies that assess the effects of stigma on the person affected, and b) surveys that assess community attitudes and/or practices. The study and questionnaire characteristics of the studies in both categories are described and compared. The studies reviewed indicate that leprosy stigma is still a global phenomenon, occurring in both endemic and non-endemic countries. The consequences of stigma affect individuals as well as the effectiveness of leprosy control activities. Despite enormous cultural diversity, the areas of life affected are remarkably similar. They included mobility, interpersonal relationships, marriage, employment, leisure activities, and attendance at social and religious functions. This suggests that development of a standard stigma scale for leprosy may be possible. Data obtained with such an instrument would useful in situational analysis, advocacy work, monitoring and evaluation of interventions against stigma, and research to better understand stigma and its determinants.",International journal of leprosy and other mycobacterial diseases : official organ of the International Leprosy Association,2003 Sep,United States,2003,00
19251078,The burden and determinants of neck pain in workers: results of the Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders.,"STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and best evidence synthesis. OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and incidence of neck pain and disability in workers; to identify risk factors for neck pain in workers; to propose an etiological diagram; and to make recommendations for future research. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous reviews of the etiology of neck pain in workers relied on cross-sectional evidence. Recently published cohorts and randomized trials warrant a re-analysis of this body of research. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline for literature published from 1980-2006. Retrieved articles were reviewed for relevance. Relevant articles were critically appraised. Articles judged to have adequate internal validity were included in our best evidence synthesis. RESULTS: One hundred and nine papers on the burden and determinants of neck pain in workers were scientifically admissible. The annual prevalence of neck pain varied from 27.1% in Norway to 47.8% in Quebec, Canada. Each year, between 11% and 14.1% of workers were limited in their activities because of neck pain. Risk factors associated with neck pain in workers include age, previous musculoskeletal pain, high quantitative job demands, low social support at work, job insecurity, low physical capacity, poor computer workstation design and work posture, sedentary work position, repetitive work and precision work. We found preliminary evidence that gender, occupation, headaches, emotional problems, smoking, poor job satisfaction, awkward work postures, poor physical work environment, and workers' ethnicity may be associated with neck pain. There is evidence that interventions aimed at modifying workstations and worker posture are not effective in reducing the incidence of neck pain in workers. CONCLUSION: Neck disorders are a significant source of pain and activity limitations in workers. Most neck pain results from complex relationships between individual and workplace risk factors. No prevention strategies have been shown to reduce the incidence of neck pain in workers.",Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics,2009 Feb,United States,2009,00
11749102,Factorial invariance and latent mean structure of questionnaires measuring social-cognitive determinants of physical activity among black and white adolescent girls.,"BACKGROUND: We previously developed questionnaires based on contemporary theories to measure physical activity determinants among youth [Motl et al., Prev Med 2000; 31:584-94]. The present study examined the factorial invariance and latent mean structure of unidimensional models fit to the questionnaires measuring attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and self-efficacy about physical activity among black and white adolescent girls. METHODS: Black (n = 896) and white (n = 823) girls in the 8th grade completed the questionnaires measuring attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and self-efficacy about physical activity. The responses were subjected to analyses of factorial invariance and latent mean structure using confirmatory factor analysis with full-information maximum likelihood estimation in AMOS 4.0. RESULTS: The unidimensional models of the four questionnaires generally demonstrated invariance of the factor structure, factor loadings, and factor variance across race but not invariance of the variance-covariance matrices or item uniquenesses. The analyses of latent mean structure demonstrated that white girls had higher latent mean scores on the measures of attitude and self-efficacy than black girls; there were similar, but smaller, differences between white and black girls on the measures of subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaires can be employed in interventions to test the mediating influences of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and self-efficacy on participation in physical activity by black and white adolescent girls.",Preventive medicine,2002 Jan,United States,2002,00
16537675,"Adiponectin, adiposity, and insulin resistance in children and adolescents.","CONTEXT: Determinants of adiponectin and its association with insulin resistance (IR) are less well studied in youth than in adults. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to describe, in youth, the age- and sex-specific distribution of adiponectin concentrations and the association with demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle factors, parental diabetes, and markers of IR. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We studied 1632 French Canadian youth aged 9, 13, and 16 yr who participated in the Quebec Child and Adolescent Health and Social Survey, a province-wide, school-based survey conducted in 1999. RESULTS: Boys had lower adiponectin concentrations than girls by 17% (P < 0.0001). At age 16 yr, mean adiponectin concentrations were 27.7% (boys, P < 0.0001) and 13.3% (girls, P < 0.0001) lower than at age 9 yr (p(interaction) = 0.009). Mean adiponectin decreased for every unit increase in body mass index (BMI) Z-score by 8.1% in boys and 11.2% in girls (P < 0.0001). Growth-related change in BMI explained half the age effect in boys and all the age effect in girls. Self-reported pubertal status, physical activity, smoking, and parental diabetes were not independently associated with adiponectin. Fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment-IR were not associated with adiponectin concentration. However, the interaction of adiponectin and BMI Z-score was significant in a multiple regression model of fasting insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Male sex and changes in body fat may be major determinants of the decreasing adiponectin concentrations of growing youth, which are accompanied by a dissociation of adiponectin and markers of IR. The relationship between adiposity and markers of IR is attenuated in those with higher adiponectin concentrations, making adiponectin a potential intervention target or risk marker.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2006 Jun,United States,2006,00
17469399,[Benchmarking of performance of Mexican states with effective coverage].,"Benchmarking of the performance of states, provinces, or districts in a decentralised health system is important for fostering of accountability, monitoring of progress, identification of determinants of success and failure, and creation of a culture of evidence. The Mexican Ministry of Health has, since 2001, used a benchmarking approach based on the World Health Organization (WHO) concept of effective coverage of an intervention, which is defined as the proportion of potential health gain that could be delivered by the health system to that which is actually delivered. Using data collection systems, including state representative examination surveys, vital registration, and hospital discharge registries, we have monitored the delivery of 14 interventions for 2005-06. Overall effective coverage ranges from 54.0% in Chiapas, a poor state, to 65.1% in the Federal District. Effective coverage for maternal and child health interventions is substantially higher than that for interventions that target other health problems. Effective coverage for the lowest wealth quintile is 52% compared with 61% for the highest quintile. Effective coverage is closely related to public-health spending per head across states; this relation is stronger for interventions that are not related to maternal and child health than those for maternal and child health. Considerable variation also exists in effective coverage at similar amounts of spending. We discuss the implications of these issues for the further development of the Mexican health-information system. Benchmarking of performance by measuring effective coverage encourages decision-makers to focus on quality service provision, not only service availability. The effective coverage calculation is an important device for health-system stewardship. In adopting this approach, other countries should select interventions to be measured on the basis of the criteria of affordability, effect on population health, effect on health inequalities, and capacity to measure the effects of the intervention. The national institutions undertaking this benchmarking must have the mandate, skills, resources, and independence to succeed.",Salud publica de Mexico,2007,Mexico,2007,00
18222500,Multiple influences on children's nutritional deficiencies: a systems perspective.,"Under-nutrition and obesity are multi-determined. The multiple determinants of either under-nutrition or obesity are linked, thus forming a system of influences. How a system of linked multiple influences functions is illustrated with specific reference to early nutritional deficiencies. The traditional explanation that child nutritional deficiencies are due to food scarcity or a lack of family economic resources has been increasingly questioned. In the UNICEF extended care model, deficiencies in children's nutritional intake are due to family economic and food resources and to specific caregiver resources. The role of three caregiver resources, maternal education, intelligence and depression are reviewed. Evidence also is presented on the need to take into account child characteristics, as an additional set of influences on nutritional deficiencies. Using a systems perspective this review documents how the relation to nutrition of family and caregiver resources and child characteristics can be mediated or moderated by alternative linked influences such as cultural characteristics, maternal input into family economic decisions and social support networks. Based on this review a revised extended care model is presented, explicitly integrating child characteristics and specific mediating and moderating links between multiple predictors of child nutritional deficiencies. This is followed by a brief discussion on how a systems perspective can also apply to the study of childhood obesity.",Physiology & behavior,2008 Apr 22,United States,2008,00
16040212,Hormone replacement therapy in Germany: determinants and possible health-related outcomes. Results of National Health Surveys from 1984 to 1999.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the determinants of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use and possible health-related outcomes in Germany. METHODS: 827 current HRT users (age range 31-78 years, who had taken HRT products in the last 7 days before the medical interview) and 2371 age-matched nonusers were identified from five population-representative National Health Surveys performed from 1984 to 1999 in Germany. Cross-sectional comparisons between HRT users and nonusers were performed for socioeconomic factors and possible health-related outcomes. Regression models were used to obtain odds ratios of HRT use. RESULTS: HRT use increased dramatically from 3% in 1984/1985 to 21% in 1998/1999 among German women aged 40-69. Regression analysis and comparison between HRT users and nonusers suggested that HRT use was closely associated with socioeconomic factors and personal lifestyle that may favor better health. In HRT users, however, we did not observe any health-related benefits in satisfaction with life or health. While HRT users appeared superior to nonusers with respect to the glycemic status, histories of cardiovascular diseases, despite a favorable lipid profile, occurred not less than in the group of nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: In the settings of our cross-sectional studies in Germany HRT did not improve users' health benefits and did not show cardioprotective effects. The better glycemic status should be balanced against the higher risks of cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer.",Maturitas,2005 Nov-Dec,Ireland,2005,00
19636745,Childhood and adolescent predictors of late onset criminal careers.,"This study explores the emergence of a criminal career in adulthood. The main hypothesis tested is that late criminal onset (at age 21 or later) is influenced by early factors that delay antisocial manifestations. The Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD) was used to examine early determinants of criminal behavior. 400 Inner London males were followed from ages 8-10 to 48-50, and were classified as follows: 35 late onsetters who were first convicted at age 21 or later, and did not have high self-reported delinquency at ages 10-14 and 15-18; 129 early onsetters first convicted between ages 10 and 20; and 236 unconvicted males. Odds ratios and logistic regression analyses revealed that the best predictors of late onset offenders compared with early onset offenders included nervousness, having few friends at ages 8-10, and not having sexual intercourse by age 18. The best predictors of late onset offenders compared with nonoffenders included teacher-rated anxiousness at ages 12-14 and high neuroticism at age 16. It is concluded that being nervous and withdrawn protected boys against offending in adolescence but that these protective effects tended to wear off after age 21. These findings show that adult offending can be predicted from childhood, and suggest that early intervention might prevent a variety of maladjustment problems and difficulties in adult life.",Journal of youth and adolescence,2009 Mar,United States,2009,00
16053643,"[Determinants of self-rated health among elderly persons in Sao Paulo, Brazil].","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence that demographic determinants, socioeconomic determinants, chronic diseases, and functional capacity have on self-rated health among elderly persons (60 years and older) living in the city of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and to investigate the existence of differences between men and women in terms of their self-rated health. METHODS: The study was carried out using data collected in the city of Sao Paulo as part of a project called Health, Well-being, and Aging in Latin America and the Caribbean (the ""SABE project""). We analyzed data on 2,135 elderly individuals (58.6% women; mean age, 69.4 years; median age, 68.0 years). The dependent variable was self-rated health (good or poor). The following independent variables were considered: (1) demographic ones (age, sex, marital status, and living arrangements (whether the elderly person lived alone or with others)), (2) socioeconomic ones (schooling and income), (3) the number of chronic diseases (hypertension, arthritis or rheumatism, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, bronchitis or emphysema, embolism or stroke, and cancer), and (4) functional capacity. To estimate the association between self-rated health and the independent variables and to study gender differences, a multiple binary logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The presence of chronic diseases in association with gender was the strongest determinant of self-rated health among the elderly in Sao Paulo. Among men with four or more chronic diseases, they were 10.53 times as likely to characterize their health as poor; among women with four or more chronic diseases, the ratio was 8.31. Functional capacity, schooling, and income were also strongly associated with self-rated health, and the influence of age was significant. The elderly women were more likely to report good self-rated health than were men when the women or men either had no chronic diseases or had two or more. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the need for simultaneous, comprehensive actions in the health sector, social services, and the economic sector to address the main determinants of self-rated health in order to promote well-being and quality of life among the elderly.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2005 May-Jun,United States,2005,00
16707074,"Randomised controlled trials of conventional antipsychotic versus new atypical drugs, and new atypical drugs versus clozapine, in people with schizophrenia responding poorly to, or intolerant of, current drug treatment.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different classes of antipsychotic drug treatment in people with schizophrenia responding inadequately to, or having unacceptable side-effects from, their current medication. DESIGN: Two pragmatic, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were undertaken. The first RCT (band 1) compared the class of older, inexpensive conventional drugs with the class of new atypical drugs in people with schizophrenic disorders, whose current antipsychotic drug treatment was being changed either because of inadequate clinical response or owing to side-effects. The second RCT (band 2) compared the new (non-clozapine) atypical drugs with clozapine in people whose medication was being changed because of poor clinical response to two or more antipsychotic drugs. Both RCTs were four-centre trials with concealed randomisation and three follow-up assessments over 1 year, blind to treatment. SETTING: Adult mental health settings in England. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 227 participants aged 18-65 years (40% of the planned sample) were randomised to band 1 and 136 (98% of the planned sample) to band 2. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to a class of drug. The managing clinician selected the individual drug within that class, except for the clozapine arm in band 2. The new atypical drugs included risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and amisulpride. The conventional drugs included older drugs, including depot preparations. As in routine practice, clinicians and participants were aware of the identity of the prescribed drug, but clinicians were asked to keep their participating patient on the randomised medication for at least the first 12 weeks. If the medication needed to be changed, the clinician was asked to prescribe another drug within the same class, if possible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Secondary clinical outcomes included symptoms [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)], side-effects and participant satisfaction. Economic outcomes were costs of health and social care and a utility measure. RESULTS: Recruitment to band 1 was less than anticipated (40%) and diminished over the trial. This appeared largely due to loss of perceived clinical equipoise (clinicians progressively becoming more convinced of the superiority of new atypicals). Good follow-up rates and a higher than expected correlation between QLS score at baseline and at follow-up meant that the sample as recruited had 75% power to detect a difference in QLS score of 5 points between the two treatment arms at 52 weeks. The recruitment to band 2 was approximately as planned. Follow-up assessments were completed at week 52 in 81% of band 1 and 87% of band 2 participants. Band 1 data showed that, on the QLS and symptom measures, those participants in the conventional arm tended towards greater improvements. This suggests that the failure to find the predicted advantage for new atypicals was not due to inadequate recruitment and statistical power in this sample. Participants reported no clear preference for either class of drug. There were no statistically significant differential outcomes for participants entering band 1 for reasons of treatment intolerance to those entering because of broadly defined treatment resistance. Net costs over the year varied widely, with a mean of 18,850 pounds sterling in the conventional drug group and 20,123 pounds sterling in the new atypical group, not a statistically significant difference. Of these costs, 2.1% and 3.8% were due to antipsychotic drug costs in the conventional and atypical group, respectively. There was a trend towards participants in the conventional drug group scoring more highly on the utility measure at 1 year. The results for band 2 showed an advantage for commencing clozapine in quality of life (QLS) at trend level (p = 0.08) and in symptoms (PANSS), which was statistically significant (p = 0.01), at 1 year. Clozapine showed approximately a 5-point advantage on PANSS total score and a trend towards having fewer total extrapyramidal side-effects. Participants reported at 12 weeks that their mental health was significantly better with clozapine than with new atypicals (p < 0.05). Net costs of care varied widely, but were higher than in band 1, with a mean of 33,800 pounds sterling in the clozapine group and 28,400 pounds sterling in the new atypical group. Of these costs, 4.0% and 3.3%, respectively, were due to antipsychotic drug costs. The increased costs in the clozapine group appeared to reflect the licensing requirement for inpatient admission for commencing the drug. There was a trend towards higher mean participant utility scores in the clozapine group. CONCLUSIONS: For band 1, there is no disadvantage in terms of quality of life and symptoms, or associated costs of care, over 1 year in commencing conventional antipsychotic drugs rather than new atypical drugs. Conventional drugs were associated with non-significantly better outcomes and lower costs. Drug costs represented a small proportion of the overall costs of care (<5%). For band 2, there is a statistically significant advantage in terms of symptoms but not quality of life over 1 year in commencing clozapine rather than new atypical drugs, but with increased associated costs of care. The results suggest that conventional antipsychotic drugs, which are substantially cheaper, still have a place in the treatment of patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, current medication. Further analyses of this data set are planned and further research is recommended into areas such as current antipsychotic treatment guidance, valid measures of utility in serious mental illness, low-dose 'conventional' treatment in first episode schizophrenia, QLS validity and determinants of QLS score in schizophrenia, and into the possible financial and other mechanisms of rewarding clinician participation in trials.","Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",2006 May,England,2006,00
14978603,Determinants of diet quality among Quebecers aged 55-74.,"OBJECTIVES: Sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary characteristics were studied to gain insights into determinants of total diet quality and diversity in a weighted sample of 460 participants aged 55-74 (53% female) from the 1990 Enqu te qu b coise sur la nutrition (EQN) dataset. METHODS: Dietary data consisted of an interviewer-administered 24-hour recall and food frequency questionnaire, and a self-administered questionnaire on dietary behaviours, attitudes and perceptions. 24-hour recall data were coded into food groups as described in Canada's Food Guide for Healthy Eating. Diet quality was scored using the categorical Dietary Diversity Score (DDS, range 0-4) and continuous Dietary Adequacy Score (DAS, range 0-18). A second nonconsecutive recall (10% of subjects) permitted correction of food group portions for intraindividual variability and subsequent calculation and validation of usual DDS and DAS. Relationships were examined between the scores and independent variables. Forward leastwise logistic regession (DDS) and stepwise multiple regression (DAS) analyses were conducted with independent variables showing significant bivariate relationships. RESULTS: Among men, breakfast consumption and eating commercially-prepared meals were positively associated with usual DDS, but poor social support and supplement use negatively predicted this score. Eating fewer than 3 meals daily, smoking, and dietary supplement use were negative predictors of usual DAS (r2=0.155). Among women, eating commercial foods was a negative predictor of usual DDS, as was preferring overweight to depriving themselves of favourite foods. Reporting that health concerns influenced food choices and disagreeing with the statement that effort is needed to have a nice body were positive determinants of usual DAS in women. On the other hand, eating fewer than 3 meals daily negatively predicted this dietary index (r2 = 0.162). CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in predictors of diet quality suggest the need to target nutrition health promotion to the needs of older men and women to encourage optimal eating habits.","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2004,France,2004,00
15543432,"The Institute of Medicine report ""Unequal Treatment"": implications for academic health centers.","BACKGROUND: The United States has achieved dramatic improvements in overall health and life expectancy, largely due to initiatives in public health, health promotion and disease prevention. Academic health centers have played a major role in this effort, given their mission of engaging in research, educating health professionals, providing primary and specialty medical services, and caring for the poor and uninsured. However, national data indicate that minority Americans have poorer health outcomes (compared to whites) from preventable and treatable conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, cancer and HIV/AIDS. Two factors contribute heavily to these racial and ethnic disparities in health: minorities are subjected to adverse social determinants, and they are disproportionately represented among the uninsured. In the last twenty years, however, the literature has highlighted the fact that racial and ethnic disparities occur not only in health, but also in health care. The Institute of Medicine Report, ""Unequal Treatment."" The Institute of Medicine (IOM) was asked to determine the extent of racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Their report, entitled ""Unequal Treatment,"" found that racial and ethnic disparities in health care do exist, and that many sources, including health care systems, health care providers, patients and utilization managers, are contributors. Recommendations from ""Unequal Treatment"": Implications for Academic Health Centers. The IOM Report, ""Unequal Treatment,"" provides a series of recommendations to address racial and ethnic disparities in health care, targeted to a broad audience (the executive summary and full IOM Report can be found at www.nap.edu under the search heading ""Unequal Treatment""). Several of the recommendations speak directly to the mission and roles of academic health centers, and have clear and direct implications for patient care, education, and research. These recommendations include collecting and reporting health care access and utilization data by patient=s race/ethnicity, encouraging the use of evidence-based guidelines and quality improvement, supporting the use of language interpretation services in the clinical setting, increasing awareness of racial/ethnic disparities in health care, increasing the proportion of underrepresented minorities in the health care workforce, integrating cross-cultural education into the training of all health care professionals, and conducting further research to identify sources of disparities and promising interventions. CONCLUSION: ""Unequal Treatment"" provides the first detailed, systematic examination of racial/ethnic disparities in health care, and provides a blueprint for how to address them. The report=s recommendations are broad in scope, yet have direct implications for academic health centers.","The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",2004 Oct,United States,2004,00

18700052,Environmental determinants of healthy eating: in need of theory and evidence.,"In order to promote healthful nutrition, insight is needed into the determinants of nutrition behaviours. Behavioural determinant research and behavioural nutrition interventions have focused mostly on individual-level motivational factors. It has been argued that the individual's socio-cultural and physical environments may be the main determinants of nutrition behaviours. However, the theoretical basis and empirical evidence for environmental determinants of nutrition behaviours are not strong. The present paper is a narrative review informed by a series of systematic reviews and recent original studies on associations between environmental factors and nutrition behaviours to provide an overview and discussion of the evidence for environmental correlates and predictors of nutrition behaviour. Although the number of studies on potential environmental determinants of nutrition behaviours has increased steeply over the last decades, they include only a few well-designed studies with validated measures and guided by sound theoretical frameworks. The preliminary evidence from the available systematic reviews indicates that socio-cultural environmental factors defining what is socially acceptable, desirable and appropriate to eat may be more important for healthful eating than physical environments that define the availability and accessibility of foods. It is concluded that there is a lack of well-designed studies on environmental determinants of healthful eating behaviours. Preliminary evidence indicates that social environmental factors may be more important than physical environmental factors for healthful eating. Better-designed studies are needed to further build evidence-based theory on environmental determinants to guide the development of interventions to promote healthful eating.",The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,2008 Aug,England,2008,00
11531131,Social contingency detection and infant development.,"The developmental origins and determinants of social contingency detection are discussed. Based on recent research, the author proposes that the origins of social contingency detection correspond to the early propensity developing in the first 6 months of life to differentiate between what pertains to the self (i.e., one's own body) and what pertains to others. Furthermore, from the second month of life, what infants appear to gain from contingency detection while interacting with others is a sense of shared experience or intersubjectivity. Research suggests that although the development of intersubjectivity is a central feature of infant behavior and development, the meaning of contingency detection, hence the source of intersubjectivity, changes radically between birth and 18 months of age. In general, it is proposed that the origins and determinants of social contingency detection must be construed in relation to (1) the developing sense of self in infancy, (2) the infant's developing sense of reciprocity with others, and (3) the infant's developing sense of participation with others. The author concludes by proposing a relevant map of changing social stances adopted by infants in the course of early development.",Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic,2001 Summer,United States,2001,00

19702430,The role of activity restriction in poststroke depressive symptoms.,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the determinants of poststroke depression. The Activity Restriction Model of Depressed Affect (ARMDA) may be helpful in understanding poststroke depression but has never been tested in that context. The goal of this study was to examine the relation between activity restriction and depressive symptoms in stroke survivors during the period following discharge from the hospital. METHOD: Participants (N = 197) were assessed on three occasions: (1) time 1 (T1), 3 weeks following discharge; (2) time 2 (T2), 3 months after discharge; and (3) time 3 (T3), 6 months after discharge. RESULTS: Although both stroke severity and activity restriction were significantly related to depressive symptoms, the relation between stroke severity and depression was no longer significant after controlling for activity restriction. Moreover, restrictions in daily activities and social roles were both related to depressive symptoms, but these relations were found to vary during the course of the period following discharge.

17629109,[Social determinants and epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases].,"Recent approaches to studies of social determinants and social epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases are reviewed. This approach originating in some industrialized countries has so far been neglected in Croatia in spite of previous experiences and existence of sociomedical tradition. The possible explanations are considered. Obvious health problems related to the standard of living, poverty, high unemployment, work insecurity, unjustified inequality of income, and other forms of discrimination in health are not tackled. The social determinants important for health are defined and at least five categories identified, i. e. broad cultural and economic circumstances, structural determinants and social position, intermediate determinants reflected in lifestyles, available social network and social capital, and finally discrimination in health care are recommended to include in epidemiological research and design of health interventions. The following measures are proposed as necessary in the current situation: 1) changes in scope and orientation of epidemiological and clinical research; 2) intensification of information for the public, experts and politicians on the role of social determinants; and 3) amplification of health interventions avoiding patterns of the predominant neoliberal approaches (blaming the victim), as well as administrative egalitarian approaches (teaching people to become victims waiting for elderly brother to provide solutions).",Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,2007 Jun,Croatia,2007,00
15654409,Socioeconomic status and obesity in adult populations of developing countries: a review.,"A landmark review of studies published prior to 1989 on socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity supported the view that obesity in the developing world would be essentially a disease of the socioeconomic elite. The present review, on studies conducted in adult populations from developing countries, published between 1989 and 2003, shows a different scenario for the relationship between SES and obesity. Although more studies are necessary to clarify the exact nature of this relationship, particularly among men, three main conclusions emerge from the studies reviewed: 1. Obesity in the developing world can no longer be considered solely a disease of groups with higher SES. 2. The burden of obesity in each developing country tends to shift towards the groups with lower SES as the country's gross national product (GNP) increases. 3. The shift of obesity towards women with low SES apparently occurs at an earlier stage of economic development than it does for men. The crossover to higher rates of obesity among women of low SES is found at a GNP per capita of about US$ 2500, the mid-point value for lower-middle-income economies. The results of this review reinforce the urgent need to: include obesity prevention as a relevant topic on the public health agenda in developing countries; improve the access of all social classes in these countries to reliable information on the determinants and consequences of obesity; and design and implement consistent public actions on the physical, economic, and sociocultural environment that make healthier choices concerning diet and physical activity feasible for all.

21635299,"Modeling the Developmental Patterning of Finiteness Marking in English, Dutch, German, and Spanish Using MOSAIC.","In this study, we apply MOSAIC (model of syntax acquisition in children) to the simulation of the developmental patterning of children's optional infinitive (OI) errors in 4 languages: English, Dutch, German, and Spanish. MOSAIC, which has already simulated this phenomenon in Dutch and English, now implements a learning mechanism that better reflects the theoretical assumptions underlying it, as well as a chunking mechanism that results in frequent phrases being treated as 1 unit. Using 1, identical model that learns from child-directed speech, we obtain a close quantitative fit to the data from all 4 languages despite there being considerable cross-linguistic and developmental variation in the OI phenomenon. MOSAIC successfully simulates the difference between Spanish (a pro-drop language in which OI errors are virtually absent) and obligatory subject languages that do display the OI phenomenon. It also highlights differences in the OI phenomenon across German and Dutch, 2 closely related languages whose grammar is virtually identical with respect to the relation between finiteness and verb placement. Taken together, these results suggest that (a) cross-linguistic differences in the rates at which children produce OIs are graded, quantitative differences that closely reflect the statistical properties of the input they are exposed to and (b) theories of syntax acquisition need to consider more closely the role of input characteristics as determinants of quantitative differences in the cross-linguistic patterning of phenomena in language acquisition.",Cognitive science,2007 Mar 4,United States,2007,00
11395186,"Weight, physical activity, and smoking as determinants of insulinemia in adolescents.","BACKGROUND: It is known that insulinemia is the result of the interaction among several factors, such as weight, body fat pattern distribution, and physical activity as well as ethnicity. There is little information regarding this question among Mexican adolescents. The association among fasting insulin levels, weight, fat distribution, physical activity, and cigarette smoking was studied in Mexican adolescents. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from 352 Mexican adolescents aged 14-19 years (response rate 41.5%). Fasting insulin levels were measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay; body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist circumference (WC) were determined using standardized techniques, while physical activity was determined by 7-day Stanford physical activity inventory. Cigarette smoking was defined as number of cigarettes/year. RESULTS: Increased BMI and waist circumference, low physical activity, younger age, and non-smoking were associated with high insulin levels. Non-smokers had higher fasting insulin levels compared to smokers (57.8 pmol +/- 1.84 vs. 49.7 pmol/L +/- 2.8; p = 0.034). However, adjusted odds ratio (OR) between insulin and smoking status was not significant. Multivariate analysis showed the following: insulin increased 1.06 pmol/L for each unit of change in BMI; increased 1.02 pmol/L for each unit of change in waist circumference; increased 1.16 pmol/L for non-smoking, and decreased 1.07 pmol/L for each 250 kcal/day of energy expenditure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that Mexican adolescents who are overweight have abdominal fat distribution and physical inactivity, and significant hyperinsulinemia.

14722343,The impact of structural and functional characteristics of social relations as determinants of functional decline.,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines whether aspects of social relations at baseline are related to functional decline at 5-year follow-up among nondisabled old men and women. METHODS: The investigation is based on baseline and follow-up data on 651 nondisabled 75-year-old persons in Jyvaskyla (Finland) and Glostrup (Denmark). The analyses are performed separately for men and women. Possible selection problems were considered by using three outcome measures: first, functional decline among the survivors (n = 425); second, functional decline, including death, assuming that death is part of a general decline pattern (n = 565); and third, mortality (n = 651). Social relations were measured at baseline by several items focusing on the structure and function of the social network. RESULTS: In men, no weekly telephone contact was related to functional decline and mortality. Among women, less than weekly telephone contact, no membership in a retirement club, and not sewing for others were significantly related to functional decline and mortality. The associations were stronger when the dead were included in the outcome measure. DISCUSSION: The results point to the importance of social relations in the prevention of functional decline in older adults.","The journals of gerontology.

17766495,Influences on children's oral health: a conceptual model.,"OBJECTIVES: Despite marked improvements over the past century, oral health in America is a significant problem: caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Much oral health research examines influences primarily in the oral cavity or focuses on a limited number of individual-level factors. The purpose of this article was to present a more encompassing conceptual model of the influences on children's oral health. METHODS: The conceptual model presented here was derived from the population health and social epidemiology fields, which have moved toward multilevel, holistic approaches to analyze the complex and interactive causes of children's health problems. It is based on a comprehensive review of major population and oral health literatures. RESULTS: A multilevel conceptual model is described, with the individual, family, and community levels of influence on oral health outcomes. This model incorporates the 5 key domains of determinants of health as identified in the population health literature: genetic and biological factors, the social environment, the physical environment, health behaviors, and dental and medical care. The model recognizes the presence of a complex interplay of causal factors. Last, the model incorporates the aspect of time, recognizing the evolution of oral health diseases (eg, caries) and influences on the child-host over time. CONCLUSIONS: This conceptual model represents a starting point for thinking about children's oral health. The model incorporates many of the important breakthroughs by social epidemiologists over the past 25 years by including a broad range of genetic, social, and environmental risk factors; multiple pathways by which they operate; a time dimension; the notion of differential susceptibility and resilience; and a multilevel approach. The study of children's oral health from a global perspective remains largely in its infancy and is poised for additional development.

The objective of this study was to examine whether a relationship between SDB and blood pressure/hypertension is more evident among shift workers than among day workers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we measured BP levels and oxygen desaturation index (by nocturnal pulse oximetry) among 253 male shift workers and 206 male day workers aged 30 to 62 years at nuclear power plants in Japan. RESULTS: The prevalence of SDB (3% oxygen desaturation index >or=10 and >or=15 per hour) in all subjects was 11.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 8.4-14.2) and 6.1% (95% CI 3.9-8.3), respectively, with no statistical difference between shift and day workers. Systolic and diastolic BP levels were correlated with 3% oxygen desaturation index in all subjects after adjustment for potential confounding variables. This association was primarily observed among workers aged >or=40 years, more specifically older shift workers. CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between SDB severity and diastolic BP levels among shift workers aged >or=40 years suggests the importance of screening for SDB among shift workers for BP control.",American journal of hypertension,2006 Apr,United States,2006,00

What contributes to increased cardiovascular risk among heavy smokers?","OBJECTIVE: To analyse risk factor levels and risk factor patterns among heavy smokers compared to never smokers. DESIGN: An incident case-referent study. SETTING: The study was nested within the Vasterbotten Intervention Programme (VIP). SUBJECTS: 286 people (62 women and 224 men) claimed to be heavy smokers, i.e. smoked 25 cigarettes or more per day. For each of them, two referents (who reported never to have been smokers) were matched on age and gender (572 referents). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in biomedical variables and social and lifestyle factors were confirmed. RESULTS: S-cholesterol, s-triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, body weight and body mass index were all significantly elevated among the heavy smokers. Some gender differences were also found. Social and lifestyle factors differed significantly between heavy smokers and never smokers, but without gender differences. CONCLUSIONS: Heavy smokers carry a risk factor pattern corresponding to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Unfavourable changes in serum lipids and in glucose metabolism can exacerbate other deleterious effects of tobacco smoke on the cardiovascular system. Obviously, heavy smokers and never smokers differ not only in regard to biomedical variables but also to lifestyle and social health determinants.

METHODS: A total of 547 first-episode psychotic patients (18-45) were randomised to standard or integrated treatment, (ACT, social skills training and family intervention), and followed up at 2 years. RESULTS: Service use or psychotic symptom score did not influence the social network size, measured after the first 2 years of treatment. Small network size was associated with long duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), poor premorbid adjustment, male gender and severe negative symptoms. The number of friends at 2-year follow-up was predicted by age, A-level status, negative symptoms and number of friends at entry, while the determinants for number of family contacts were age, gender, disorganised dimension and family contacts at entry. CONCLUSIONS: Premorbid functioning, network size at entry and DUP is closely related to small social network size. The integrated psychosocial treatment programme was not sufficient to address this problem.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2006 Oct,Germany,2006,00
18463466,"Race, racism, and racial disparities in adverse birth outcomes.","While the biologic authenticity of race remains a contentious issue, the social significance of race is indisputable. The chronic stress of racism and the social inequality it engenders may be underlying social determinants of persistent racial disparities in health, including infant mortality, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. This article describes the problem of racial disparities in adverse birth outcomes; outlines the multidimensional nature of racism and the pathways by which it may adversely affect health; and discusses the implications for clinical practice.",Clinical obstetrics and gynecology,2008 Jun,United States,2008,00
12818312,Integrated perinatal health framework. A multiple determinants model with a life span approach.,"BACKGROUND: Despite great strides in improving prenatal care utilization among American women, key perinatal indicators have remained stagnant or worsened in the past decade, and the United States continues to rank near the bottom compared to other developed countries. A new approach is needed if we are to achieve improvements in perinatal health. METHODS: To propose a new framework that integrates a ""life span"" approach with a multiple determinants model. RESULTS: We recognize that (1) powerful influences on outcome occur long before pregnancy begins; (2) pregnancy outcome is shaped by social, psychological, behavioral, environmental, and biological forces; and (3) the demography of pregnancy has changed dramatically in the last few decades with more women delaying their first birth. Approaches that simultaneously consider the entire life span as well as multiple determinants may need to be adopted. We propose a framework that integrates these approaches and is supported by the research literature. The life span perspective focuses attention toward the preconceptional and interconceptional periods as targets for intervention in improving perinatal health. The multiple determinants model distinguishes among concepts of disease, health and functioning, and well-being for both women and their offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Our intent is to influence how policymakers, public health professionals, clinicians, and researchers approach perinatal health.",American journal of preventive medicine,2003 Jul,Netherlands,2003,00
19751519,Oral health related behaviors among adult Tanzanians: a national pathfinder survey.,"BACKGROUND: The oral health education programs which have been organised and delivered in Tanzania were not based on a thorough understanding of behaviours which influence oral health. Therefore, evaluation of these programs became difficult. This study aimed at investigating the oral health related behaviours and their determinants among Tanzanian adults. METHODS: A national pathfinder cross sectional survey was conducted in 2006 involving 1759 respondents from the six geographic zones of mainland Tanzania. Frequency distributions, Chi square and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0. RESULTS: The rates of abstinence from alcohol for the past 30 days and life time smoking were 61.6% and 16.7% respectively, with males being more likely to smoke (OR 9.2, CI 6.3 -12.9, p < 0.001) and drink alcohol (OR 1.5, CI 1.2 -1.8, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that; having dental pain (OR 0.7, CI 0.5-0.8; p < 0.001) and being minimally educated (OR 0.48, CI 0.4-0.6; p < 0.001) reduced the likelihood of having a high sugar score. Whereas being male (OR 1.5, CI 1.2- 1.8; p < 0.001), urban (OR 1.9, CI 1.5 -2.3; p < 0.001), and young (OR 1.5, CI 1.2 -1.8; p < 0.001) increased the likelihood of having a high sugar score. Urban residents were less likely to take alcohol (OR 0.7, CI 0.6-0.9; p < 0.01), or smoke cigarette (OR = 0.7, CI = 0.6-0.9); less likely to be those who do not use fruits (OR 0.3, CI 0.2-0.4; p < 0.001); dental clinic (OR 0.5, CI 0.4-0.7; p < 0.001); factory made tooth brushes (OR 0.1, CI 0.08-0.17; p < 0.001) and toothpaste (OR 0.1, CI 0.1-0.2; p < 0.001) than their rural counterparts. More rural (13.2%) than urban (4.6%) residents used charcoal. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrated social demographic disparities in relation to oral health related behaviors, while dental pain was associated with low consumption of sugar and high likelihood to take alcohol.",BMC oral health,2009 Sep 14,England,2009,00
19394122,Drivers of tuberculosis epidemics: the role of risk factors and social determinants.,"The main thrust of the World Health Organization's global tuberculosis (TB) control strategy is to ensure effective and equitable delivery of quality assured diagnosis and treatment of TB. Options for including preventive efforts have not yet been fully considered. This paper presents a narrative review of the historical and recent progress in TB control and the role of TB risk factors and social determinants. The review was conducted with a view to assess the prospects of effectively controlling TB under the current strategy, and the potential to increase epidemiological impact through additional preventive interventions. The review suggests that, while the current strategy is effective in curing patients and saving lives, the epidemiological impact has so far been less than predicted. In order to reach long-term epidemiological targets for global TB control, additional interventions to reduce peoples' vulnerability for TB may therefore be required. Risk factors that seem to be of importance at the population level include poor living and working conditions associated with high risk of TB transmission, and factors that impair the host's defence against TB infection and disease, such as HIV infection, malnutrition, smoking, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and indoor air pollution. Preventive interventions may target these factors directly or via their underlying social determinants. The identification of risk groups also helps to target strategies for early detection of people in need of TB treatment. More research is needed on the suitability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of these intervention options.",Social science & medicine (1982),2009 Jun,England,2009,00
12562034,Correlates and predictors of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy: overview of published literature.,"Knowledge of factors associated with medication adherence could help HIV clinicians to target persons in need of intervention, design these interventions, and help researchers to plan studies of adherence. This review summarizes the results of 20 studies investigating the issue of barriers to optimal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence. Only a few determinants were consistently associated with nonadherence. Symptoms and adverse drug effects, psychologic distress, lack of social or family support, complexity of the HAART regimen, low patient self-efficacy, and inconvenience of treatment were the factors most consistently associated with nonadherence. There were inconsistent findings regarding the relationship of adherence and the following variables: sociodemographic characteristics, substance abuse, depressive symptoms, quality of life, CD4+ cell count, knowledge and beliefs about treatment, patients' satisfaction with health care, and patient-provider relationship. A synthesis of findings relating various factors to adherence to HAART is difficult to reach because of several limitations of the existing body of research. These limitations concern the measurement of adherence, the assessment of correlates and predictors of adherence, the study population, and the study design.",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2002 Dec 15,United States,2002,00
19507717,Global health and local poverty: rich countries' responses to vulnerable populations.,"Poverty is an important determinant of ill health, mortality and suffering across the globe. This commentary asks what we can learn about poverty by looking at the way rich countries respond to the needs of vulnerable populations both within their own societies and those of low-income countries. Taking advantage of recent efforts to redefine child poverty in a way that is consistent with the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, three sets of data are reviewed: levels of child well-being within 23 Organization of Economic Community Development countries; the amount of official development assistance these countries disburse to poor countries; and, government social transfers targeted at families as a percentage of GDP. Analysis shows that countries in Northern Europe tend to have lower levels of child poverty, and are the most generous with social transfers and providing development assistance to poor countries; in contrast, the non-European countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States, and generally, the G7 countries, are the least generous towards the vulnerable at home and abroad and tend to have the highest levels of child poverty. The findings suggest that nations' responses tend to be ideologically based rather than evidence or needs based and that poverty is neither inevitable nor intractable.",Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2009 May-Jun,Switzerland,2009,00
16929906,"[Social determinants, feeding practices and nutritional consequences of intestinal parasitism in young children].","INTRODUCTION: Studies on intestinal intestinal parasitism in children under 2 years of age have rarely been performed. The nutritional consequences and feasibility of parasite prevention justify the current study. OBJECTIVES: The study was undertaken with 3 goals: (1) to identify the prevalence of pathogenic intestinal parasites (PIP), (2) to determine the social factors, sanitary conditions and nutritional practices that predict PIP, and (3) to evaluate PIP effects on infant nutritional status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All mothers with children under 18 months of age and living in an urban community of coastal Colombia were invited to participate in the PIP study. A fecal sample was obtained from each of 136 children; they represented 62% of the total 7-18 month-old population in the community. Presence of intestinal parasites was identified by direct microscopy and confirmed by a concentration test (Ritchie-Frick procedure). Logistic regressions were used to predict presence of PIP. The Z scores of length-for-age (< -2 SD-chronic malnutrition) and weight-for-length (< -2 SD-acute malnutrition) and covariance analysis were done to detect associations between intestinal parasitism and nutritional status. RESULTS: Of the 136 children, 30.6% were infected; 26.2% had helminth infections (A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, S. stercoralis), 14.9% had protozoan infections (G. lamblia) and 11.8% had mixed infections. Wasting and stunting were present in 2.9% and 12.5%, respectively. Lack of sanitary toilet facilities and low maternal education were related to mixed infections and presence of helminths (p < 0.05). Weaned children were at greater risk of mixed infections (Odds Ratio (OR) 6.5; 90% CI: 1.9-21.5) and of G. lamblia infections (OR: 2.89; 90% CI: 1.0-8.34). Children infected with T. trichiura and with mixed infections were more likely to show wasting (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The high infections in young children indicate that they be included in periodic antiparasitic chemotherapy. Burden of disease associated to intestinal parasitism may be reduced if breastfeeding is continued beyond 6 months of age.",Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,2006 Mar,Colombia,2006,00
11075644,Determinants of infant and child mortality in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.,"Infant and child mortality in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has steadily reduced since 1967, even though fertility has remained extremely high. In this paper the determinants of infant and child mortality are discussed, with particular emphasis on the role of consanguineous marriages, short birth spacing and maternal education. It is shown that short birth spacings and type of marriage are more important determinants of infant mortality than maternal education. Moreover, the relative role of consanguineous marriages appears to increase with time.",Journal of biosocial science,2000 Oct,England,2000,00
17068928,Positive identity as a positive youth development construct: conceptual bases and implications for curriculum development.,"According to the theories of Erikson, Marcia, and Higgins, adolescents who can cultivate a clear and positive identity after their developmental struggles in adolescence often advance more smoothly into adulthood. Identity is organized, learned, and dynamic, and subjective evaluation of an individual's identity has emotional consequences for that individual. This paper discusses literature on the nature and importance of identity and presents strategies such as self-esteem enhancement, management of exploration and commitment, as well as reduction of self-discrepancies to help adolescents develop functional identity. Significant determinants of a person's identity development, namely gender and cultural issues, are also addressed as they are important in designing the ""Positive Identity Development"" package of Positive Adolescent Training through Holistic Social Programmes (P.A.T.H.S.), supported by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, to help adolescents develop a positive identity.",International journal of adolescent medicine and health,2006 Jul-Sep,Germany,2006,00
16171258,Determinants of dental service utilization among 2 to 11-year-old California children.,"OBJECTIVE: The 2001 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) was designed to elicit population-based estimates about health care access and insurance coverage. This study aimed to determine factors associated with dental service utilization among children ages 2 to 11 years in California. METHODS: CHIS was a random digit dialing telephone survey. Interviews were conducted with the adult in the household that was most knowledgeable about the child's care, and information was collected on the child's last dental visit. RESULTS: Data on dental visits were collected on 10,569 children ages 2-11 years. In 2001, 73.5 (+/- 0.6)% of children had a dental visit, 58.2 (+/- 0.6)% a preventive dental visit, while 18.3 (+/- 0.5)% had never visited the dentist. Nearly 1 million children had never visited the dentist, primarily children ages 2-5 years. Overall, 76.3 (+/- 0.6)% of children had dental insurance. Children with a past-year dental visit were likely to be school age, insured and from high-income households. Other predictors of utilization were the responding adult's age and educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Dental service utilization is determined by a mix of parental, child and household factors.",Journal of public health dentistry,2005 Summer,United States,2005,00
11708579,Temporary stability of urban food and nutrition security: the East Jakarta study.,"The food and nutrition situation in households of East Jakarta was assessed in 1993/1994 and 1998/1999 with the aim of identifying the determinants of potential problems and the dynamics of change. In 1993/1994, the nutritional status of approximately 73% of children under 5 years of age and 60% of mothers was within the normal range, although underweight and overweight were prevalent in almost all households. Between 1998 and 1999, there was a sharp increase in fathers reporting unemployment. The consumption of animal food sources decreased, whereas the consumption of food derivatives such as oils and sugar remained high. Approximately 90% of the population obtained drinking water from wells. By 1998, the public garbage collection system had almost completely collapsed in East Jakarta. Between 1993 and 1998, the prevalence of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children aged under 5 years increased dramatically, from 8 and 44% to 24 and 70%, respectively. The urban environment has undergone significant changes. In Indonesia, as a whole, many achievements in the improvement of household food security and care have been lost due to the economic and political crisis. The statistical association between mothers' and fathers' education and the nutritional status of their children that was observed in 1993/94 did not appear in the 1998 survey. It seems that the education-related coping mechanisms of the parents were inadequate to deal with the rapid deterioration in the economic and political situation.",Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,2001,Australia,2001,00
15571115,Differences in health determinants between international and domestic students at a German university.,"The authors used a standardized questionnaire to survey 201 international and 193 German students at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, to determine differences in health practices between the 2 groups and to identify targets for health-promoting interventions. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that long-term female international students (those whose duration of residency in Germany was more than 2 years) had lower levels of physical activity and alcohol consumption than their German counterparts and higher rates of smoking independently associated with international citizenship. Short-term international female students were less likely than German students to receive social support. Among men, long-term international student status was associated with daily smoking and inconsistent seat belt use, whereas short-term student status was associated with a lower rate of seat belt use, a higher level of perceived stress, and a healthier diet, compared with domestic students. Findings from the study could give rise to health-promotion activities for international students at German universities; additional studies at other European universities are necessary before making further recommendations.",Journal of American college health : J of ACH,2004 Nov-Dec,United States,2004,00
11571013,Reducing social vulnerability to HIV/AIDS: models of care and their impact in resource-poor settings.,"There has been an increasing understanding of the social, economic, cultural and political factors that have shaped the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has been widely recognized that in order to have effective prevention programmes for HIV/AIDS, the broader determinants of health must be addressed. Concurrently, a deeper understanding of personal and societal vulnerability to HIV/AIDS has emerged. Some prevention efforts have expanded their focus, addressing not only individual risk factors and behaviour, but also social justice and including community mobilization activities to address the wider context of the disease. However, the transition to an expanded approach to mitigating the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has not been complete. There is little evidence that care and support strategies have systematically tried to address these concepts. While the role care plays in prevention is considered vital, viewing models of care in terms of their impact on the social vulnerability of certain groups to HIV/AIDS has been largely neglected. Yet appropriate care programmes that help reduce vulnerability will arguably also make the greatest contribution for prevention. Drawing on examples of the role social vulnerability has played in prevention efforts, this paper evaluates the impact of HIV/AIDS care models on socially vulnerable groups, such as women and children.",AIDS care,2001 Oct,England,2001,00
11793575,A reformulated cognitive-behavioral model of problem gambling. A biopsychosocial perspective.,"With most Western countries expanding the availability of gambling facilities in recent decades, considerable research interest has developed in those people who develop problematic levels of gambling. In the recent decade, a large body of research has been conducted into the determinants of gambling behavior in an attempt to understand this complex social and psychological problem. Research has varied in its nature from investigating underlying biological, psychological, or social factors that are hypothesized to contribute to gambling behavior. Evidence now exists that biological, psychological, and social factors are all relevant to the development of problematic levels of gambling. However, the theoretical explanation for gambling has lagged behind the advances in empirical work in recent years. The purpose of the current paper is to provide a review of the major research findings in the area of gambling and propose a biopsychosocial model that integrates diverse areas of research. The model described is empirically derived, and it is hoped it will stimulate future research work that investigates not only individual factors and their relationship to gambling, but also the interactions between different variables.",Clinical psychology review,2002 Feb,United States,2002,00
15058797,"Perceived stress, internal resources, and social support as determinants of mental health among young adults.","BACKGROUND: Mental health is a central determinant of quality of life. While psychiatric morbidity of populations has been studied extensively, the role of perceived stress, social support, and internal resources as determinant of health is still poorly understood. METHODS: We surveyed 2000 randomly selected university students. Perceived stress was measured by the Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument, social support by the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, internal resources (mastery and self-esteem) by a brief version of the Pearlin coping questionnaire. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationships between these variables and mental health, based on the SF-12 health survey. RESULTS: After two reminders, 1257 students answered the questionnaire. In bivariate analysis, mental health was negatively associated with stress and positively associated with internal resources and social support (all p-values < 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, internal resources were positively associated with mental health, and buffered the negative impact of stress on mental health. Internal resources and stress mediated the positive impact of social support on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that perceived stress is an important risk factor for low mental health and suggest that mastery and self-esteem are important protective factors of mental health among young adults.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2004 Feb,Netherlands,2004,00
18813497,[Social determinants of odontalgia in epidemiological studies: theoretical review and proposed conceptual model].,"The epidemiological literature has been limited by the absence of a theoretical framework reflecting the complexity of causal mechanisms for the occurrence of health phenomena / disease conditions. In the field of oral epidemiology, such lack of theory also prevails, since dental caries the leading topic in oral research has been often studied through a biological and reductionist viewpoint. One of the most important consequences of dental caries is dental pain (odontalgia), which has received little attention in studies with sophisticated theoretical models and powerful designs to establish causal relationships. The purpose of this study is to review the scientific literature on the determinants of odontalgia and to discuss theories proposed for the explanation of the phenomenon. Conceptual models and emerging theories on the social determinants of oral health are revised, in an attempt to build up links with the bio-psychosocial pain model, proposing a more elaborate causal model for odontalgia. The framework suggests causal pathways between social structure and oral health through material, psychosocial and behavioral pathways. Aspects of the social structure are highlighted in order to relate them to odontalgia, stressing their importance in discussions of causal relationships in oral health research.",Ciencia & saude coletiva,2007 Nov-Dec,Brazil,2007,00
11008278,[Patient expectations regarding methods and outcomes of their rehabilitation--a controlled study of back pain- and cancer patients].,"Although patient expectations are important factors of the success of rehabilitation, they have not yet received much attention in research. In the present cross-sectional study, n = 248 rehabilitation patients, n = 160 suffering from chronic back pain and n = 88 suffering from oncological diseases (breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer), were assessed at the time of admission to a rehabilitation clinic, using a newly developed self-report questionnaire to evaluate their expectations regarding the process and outcome of their rehabilitation. Results show on an item level that non-specific process expectations such as balneophysical treatments or features of the surroundings of the clinic were most prevailing. Across both diagnostic groups, common goals of rehabilitation such as reduction of complaints, physical fitness and recreation scored highest. On the basis of factor analysis, 10 scales of process expectations were constructed: medical attention, physical training, vocational counselling, balneophysical treatment, health information, stress management training, support groups, relief from the strains of everyday life, alternative medicine, and pleasant surroundings. Nine dimensions of outcome expectations were detected: ability for work, physical fitness, reduction of complaints, behaviour change, reduction of body weight, positive body feeling, vitality, enjoyment of life, and social contact. In the univariate analysis, orthopaedical patients scored higher on balneophysical treatments and vocational counselling (process expectations) as well as reduction of complaints and ability for work (outcome expectations). However, there were effects of age, gender and working status, too. Thus these differences between diagnostic groups turned out to be nonsignificant after controlling for the effects of age, gender, and working status. On the other hand, some effects of the medical condition had been hidden in the univariate comparison and were only revealed when adjusting for the moderator variables. Those differences show that oncological patients had higher expectations than back pain patients. Patients' expectations were correlated with functional status and, to a lesser degree, emotional distress and locus of control. To conclude, our study demonstrated that medical condition, sociodemographic factors, working status and functional capacity are important determinants of patient expectations regarding the process and outcome of rehabilitation.",Die Rehabilitation,2000 Aug,Germany,2000,00
15260843,The Black-White perception gap and health disparities research.,"Reducing and eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities has become a national research priority. This research agenda requires new research frameworks that encompass the social determinants of health and the translation pathways of these social contexts into physiological morbidity. Within these sociobiological research frameworks, identity and emotions are seen as crucial links in the causal pathways from stressors to biological responses. In this country, the lived social reality of African American individuals is experienced through the color of their skin. Their identity is bound with the racial inequities of our society. It has been suggested that the emotions of anger and frustration resulting from this institutionalized racial discrimination are an emotional causative pathway to the pathophysiology contributing to the health disparities experienced by African Americans. However, as much as we espouse the concept of cultural competency in health care, until recently, there has been very little honest dialogue about how race and racism influences health. This article will explore the Black-White cultural perception gap and attempt to provide insight on the relationship to African American health and implications for health disparities research.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",2004 Jul-Aug,United States,2004,00
17852992,"Types of cultural capital and self-rated health among disadvantaged women in outer Beirut, Lebanon.","AIMS: This study extends research on the social determinants of health by exploring the association between a new, potentially very significant dimension, cultural capital by type, and self-rated health among low-income women living in outer Beirut, Lebanon. METHODS: Self-rated general health was assessed using household data from a cross-sectional survey of 1869 women, conducted in 2003. Three types of cultural capital were included: watching cultural TV programs, producing art (e.g. drawing, theatre performance), and consuming art or literature (e.g. attending exhibitions, reading literary books). Associations between self-rated health status and types of cultural capital were assessed using odds ratios from binary logistic regression models. RESULTS: With the exception of art production, lack of cultural capital increased the odds of self-perceived poor health status adjusting for sociodemographics and other risk factors. The adjusted odds ratios were 1.86 (95% CI 1.07-3.22) for not watching cultural TV programs and 1.52 (95% CI 1.12-2.06) for not consuming art. As expected, health-risk factors, age, social support, and community of residence were also associated with health status. CONCLUSIONS: Two types of cultural capital were strong predictors of self-perceived health status among women living in poor urban communities, regardless of social capital, income, and other relevant risk factors.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2007,Sweden,2007,00
16150659,Pregnancy intention from men's perspectives: does child support enforcement matter?,"CONTEXT: Most research on pregnancy intention has focused on women's perspectives and characteristics. Because decisions about sexual activity and contraceptive use usually involve both men and women, it is important to understand factors associated with men's intentions-for example, child support enforcement-to maximize the potential for reducing unwanted pregnancies. METHODS: Data from the 1982-2002 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were used in multinomial logit analyses to examine the determinants of pregnancy intention from men's perspectives. RESULTS: Forty-six percent of pregnancies reported by never-married men were unwanted, compared with 21% of those reported by married men. Stronger child support enforcement was marginally associated with men's decreased likelihood of being involved in an unwanted pregnancy compared with no pregnancy (coefficient, -0.14) and of being involved in an unwanted pregnancy compared with a wanted pregnancy (-0.15). Without the improvement of child support enforcement over the survey period, the rate of unwanted pregnancies would have been an estimated 7% higher than the observed rate. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening child support enforcement may have a positive impact on preventing unwanted pregnancies. Programs designed to reduce unwanted pregnancies and nonmarital births should include information on child support enforcement to increase their success.",Perspectives on sexual and reproductive health,2005 Sep,United States,2005,00
15122369,[Prevalence of sedentarism and its associated factors among urban adolescents].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and determinants of sedentarism among adolescents living in Pelotas, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Pelotas, in 2002. An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was answered by a representative sample of 960 adolescents with ages ranging from 15 to 18 years old. Those who reported that their participation in some kind of physical activity amounted to less than 20 minutes a day with a frequency of less than 3 times a week were considered to have a sedentary lifestyle. Sociodemographic and behavioral variables were evaluated. The chi-squared test was used for comparisons between proportions. The Poisson regression was used for multivariate analysis with robust adjustment for variances. Corrections were made for study design effects. RESULTS: Interviews were held with 960 adolescents. Of these, 39% were classified as having a sedentary lifestyle. The prevalence of sedentarism was higher among girls than among boys (prevalence ratio of 2.45; 95% CI 2.06-2.95). The adolescents from lower social levels had the highest percentage of sedentarism (prevalence ratio of 1.35; 95% CI 1.06-1.72). There was an inverse relationship between the adolescent's and the mother's schooling and sedentarism. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was also a positive association between sedentarism and minor psychiatric disturbances, and in relation to sexual activity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalences of sedentarism are associated with girls, low social class, low levels of schooling and being the child of a mother with a low level of schooling.",Revista de saude publica,2004 Apr,Brazil,2004,00
16286497,Multilevel analysis of associations between socioeconomic status and injury among Canadian adolescents.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of individual and area level measures of socioeconomic status (SES) to the occurrence of various injury types among Canadian adolescents. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross sectional Canadian data were used from two sources: (1) the 2001/02 health behaviour in school aged children survey (individual level SES measures, injury measures), and (2) the 2001 Canada census of population (area level SES measures). Injury outcomes included: medically treated injury, injury hospitalisation, sport/recreational injury, and fighting injury. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine individual and area level SES measures as potential determinants of adolescent injury. PARTICIPANTS: 7235 students in grades 6-10 from 170 schools across Canada. MAIN RESULTS: Associations between SES and injury were identified for each injury outcome examined, although a clear direction of association was not present for the overall measure of medically treated injury. In general, lower SES was associated with increased risk for hospitalised and fighting injury. Higher SES was associated with increased risks for sport/recreational injury. Independent contributions of individual and area level measures of SES were seen for hospitalised and fighting injury. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between SES and adolescent injury exist; however, the direction of these relations becomes more apparent with particular indicators of SES and when homogenous injury outcomes are evaluated.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2005 Dec,England,2005,00

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Schools in Porto, Portugal. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents born in 1990 and attending schools in Porto, Portugal (n = 2036) completed a questionnaire at school containing the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) and Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition. Anthropometrical measurements were also performed. A questionnaire addressing parents' characteristics was sent home with the adolescents. MAIN EXPOSURE: Psychological, biological, social, and familial characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three core EDI subscales. RESULTS: After using multiple regression analyses, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and depressive symptomatology for both sexes were positively associated with eating disorder symptomatology evaluated by the 3 core EDI subscales (drive for thinness, bulimia, body dissatisfaction). Parents' education had a significant positive effect on girls' drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction scores and a significant negative effect in boys' bulimia and body dissatisfaction scores. CONCLUSIONS: Higher body mass index and higher depressive symptomatology were associated with more severe eating disorder symptomatology in both sexes. A sex effect on the association between socioeconomic status and eating disorder symptomatology was found; girls with higher socioeconomic status and boys with lower socioeconomic status presented more eating disorder symptomatology.",Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,2008 Dec,United States,2008,00

However, registration rate and registration choices failed to meet the expectations. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among a random sample of 1,731 Dutch adolescents of 18 and 19 years was conducted to study potential determinants of organ donor registration choices. RESULTS: Almost one fifth of the adolescents indicated that they did not return their organ donation registration form. Among subjects who registered, 57% were willing to donate their organs or tissues posthumously. More positive social influences, fewer negative outcome beliefs, and a low level of organ donation anxiety were significant predictors of returning a completed registration form and registration as an organ donor. In addition, religion was a significant predictor of returning a completed registration form, and positive outcome beliefs contributed to the prediction of registration as an organ donor. CONCLUSIONS: The results give clear suggestions for tailoring organ donation registration interventions to specific characteristics, beliefs, and misconceptions of adolescents. The results also suggest that it is important to encourage adolescents to discuss issues related to organ donation with their parents and friends in order to increase donor registration.",Transplantation,2001 Jul 15,United States,2001,00
15710642,The GP's perception of poverty: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Health differences between people from lower and higher social classes increase. The accessibility of the health care system is one of the multiple and complex causes. The Physician's perceptions, beliefs and attitudes towards the patient are in this context important determinants. OBJECTIVES: To explore the general practitioners' definition of poverty and their perception of the deprived patients' attitude towards health and health care, to get insight into the ways general practitioners deal with the problem of poverty and to present the proposals general practitioners make to improve health care for the deprived. METHOD: The study involved qualitative methodology using 21 semi-structured interviews. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were coded using Framework Analysis techniques. Interviews were undertaken with general practitioners in primary care, working in a deprived area in the city of Ghent. RESULTS: In the definition of poverty, three concepts can be identified: socioeconomic aspects, psychological and individual characteristics, and socio-cultural concepts. General practitioners adopt different types of approaches to deal with deprived patients in practice: adaptation of the doctor-patient communication, lowering of the financial threshold, referral to specialists and other health care professionals. CONCLUSION: Including the issue of poverty and poverty in the curriculum of the medical students and in the in-service training for practicing doctors could have a positive impact on their attitude towards this patient group. Further research is needed into the barriers in the accessibility of the health care system for the deprived, exploring qualitatively and quantitatively the experiences and the living conditions of deprived patients and the perceptions of health care providers.",Family practice,2005 Apr,England,2005,00
18641724,About unsuspected potential determinants of obesity.,"The positive energy balance underlying obesity is generally attributed to factors exerting a direct measurable impact on energy intake or expenditure. Thus, sedentariness and (or) excess caloric intake represent the ""Big Two"" factors on which almost all the attention of health professionals is devoted in preventive and therapeutic programs for obesity. However, recent research reveals that other more discrete factors can also promote a positive energy balance and body fat gain. Accordingly, this paper documents the effects of low micronutrient intake, short sleep duration, knowledge-based work, and organochlorine compounds on components of energy balance and body composition. These effects aid in the understanding as to why modernity accentuates the risk of obesity. Furthermore, they also suggest that body fat gain is not only a problem, but also a solution in maintaining body homeostasis, i.e., a state of optimal body functionality, in the context of modernity and globalization.","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",2008 Aug,Canada,2008,00
16204363,Ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome in older adults.,"CONTEXT: Ghrelin may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying risk factor clustering observed in the metabolic syndrome, but this has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to study the association between ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome and identify social and behavioral determinants of ghrelin. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. SETTING: The setting of this work was the Rancho Bernardo Study. PARTICIPANTS: Study subjects included 1513 men and women, aged 51-90 yr in 1984-1987. OUTCOMES: Total ghrelin, measured by RIA, and the metabolic syndrome, defined using Adult Treatment Panel III diagnostic criteria, were the outcome measures. RESULTS: Levels of ghrelin (mean +/- SD) did not differ between the 848 men (1451 +/- 532 pg/ml) and the 665 women (1459 +/- 672 pg/ml) or by age. Education, alcohol intake, and smoking history were each significantly and positively associated with ghrelin in a dose-related manner, independent of body mass index (BMI). Compared with participants with the lowest third of ghrelin levels, the age- and sex-adjusted odds of having the metabolic syndrome were 18% lower in the middle third and 53% lower in the highest third. This corresponds to a 21% decrease per SD increase in ghrelin (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.69, 0.89; P < or = 0.001); this was attenuated to 13% (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.75, 1.01; P = 0.07), after adjustment for BMI. Of the five metabolic syndrome components, only the association between ghrelin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was independent of BMI. A significant association independent of BMI was also observed between insulin and ghrelin. CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin levels are influenced by lifestyle factors. The inverse association between endogenous ghrelin and the metabolic syndrome is largely explained by the strong ghrelin-BMI association.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2005 Dec,United States,2005,00
17481949,Working on atypical schedules.,"Shift work has been associated with a number of health problems including cardiovascular disease, impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, gastrointestinal discomfort, reproductive difficulties, and breast cancer. The specific contributions of disturbed physiological rhythms, circadian misalignment, and sleep debt to the various medical problems encountered by shift workers remain to be clarified. Fatigue can be caused by extended on-duty and/or waking periods, inadequate sleep quantity, sleep disturbances, disruption of circadian rhythms, and difficult work and familial conditions. Fatigue-related accidents raise a safety concern for shift workers, especially at the end of the night when the circadian nadir of alertness interacts with increased time awake. Individuals vary greatly in their capacity to adjust to atypical work schedules and their tolerance to circadian misalignment. Predisposing individual and domestic factors have been identified, such as increasing age, being a single woman in charge of children, and split sleep patterns, all of which can affect the ability to adjust to atypical schedules. However, prior studies indicate that predisposing individual and social determinants are generally poor predictors of shift work tolerance in a given individual. In this manuscript, we review several countermeasures to improve adaptation to shift work.",Sleep medicine,2007 Sep,Netherlands,2007,00
17447172,Clinical and social determinants of antipsychotic polypharmacy for Chinese patients with schizophrenia.,"Most prescription pattern surveys have found a high rate of antipsychotic polypharmacy. To date few studies have investigated antipsychotic polypharmacy in Chinese patients with schizophrenia in general and outpatients in particular. This study examined the frequency and sociodemographic and clinical correlates of antipsychotic polypharmacy in Hong Kong (HK) and Beijing (BJ), China. Three hundred and ninety-eight clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly selected and interviewed in HK and BJ using standardized assessment instruments. Antipsychotic polypharmacy was found in 17.6% ( N=70) of the whole sample and in 28% and 7.1% of the HK and BJ samples, respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with monthly income, severity of negative symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), use of depot antipsychotic and anticholinergic drugs, doses of antipsychotics, and the number of hospitalizations. In multiple logistic regression analysis, younger age, number of hospitalizations, site (HK vs. BJ), and the use of depot antipsychotics were all significantly associated with antipsychotic polypharmacy. Although the ethnic and clinical characteristics of the two cohorts were nearly identical, there was a wide variation in the prescription frequency of antipsychotic polypharmacy between HK and BJ, suggesting that sociocultural and economical factors and traditions of psychiatric practice all played a role in determining antipsychotic polypharmacy. Clinicians should bear in mind that, at least for clinically stable patients, no scientifically sound therapeutic principles for antipsychotic polypharmacy exist.",Pharmacopsychiatry,2007 Mar,Germany,2007,00
15793014,How a community-based organization and an academic health center are creating an effective partnership for training and service.,"Community-academic partnerships in the training of doctors offer unique learning opportunities of great importance. Such partnerships can induce a paradigm shift such that physicians view community as a teaching resource and partner rather than as a passive recipient of services or solely as a placement site. The authors describe a model of a community-academic partnership in New York City, begun in 1995, in which, for training and service, pediatric residents are integrally involved in a community-based program. Principles adapted from the Community-Campus Partnerships for Health's principles of partnership provide a framework for portraying the essential elements of developing and maintaining the partnership. The authors explain the clashes that may arise between partners and show how the principles of partnership guide partnership members in working and learning within a setting that by its nature entails conflict and inequality. This report is based on the knowledge gained from the structured reflections of both members of this partnership: the residency program at a large academic health center and the community-based social service organization. Such partnerships provide the training ground for the development of physicians who understand the social and cultural determinants of health and constructively use community agencies' input in promoting child health and well-being. Within this framework, community-based organizations are not solely service providers but become educators of physicians-in-training who, with new knowledge gained through the partnership, more effectively contribute to the overall health of the communities they serve.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2005 Apr,United States,2005,00
19190572,Preventing childhood obesity through state policy: qualitative assessment of enablers and barriers.,"As the prevalence of obesity rapidly climbs among youth in the United States, public health practitioners and policymakers seek effective means of slowing and reversing these trends. Recently, many state laws and regulations addressing childhood obesity have been introduced and enacted. Understanding determinants of such legislation may inform the development and passage of future policies. For this study, key-informant interviews were conducted with 16 legislators and staffers from 11 states in 2005-2006 to examine qualitative factors that enable and impede state-level childhood obesity prevention legislation. Commonly cited factors positively influencing the passage of childhood obesity prevention legislation included national media exposure, introduction of the policy by senior legislators, and gaining the support of key players including parents, physicians, and schools. Noteworthy barriers included powerful lobbyists of companies that produce unhealthy foods and misconceptions about legislating foods at schools. Although the total number of informants was modest, their valuable insights provide policymakers and practitioners with a set of enablers and barriers to be considered when pursuing state-level policy.",Journal of public health policy,2009,England,2009,00
18294782,Formation of linear dominance relationship in captive jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos): implications for individual recognition.,"Jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) flexibly change their social forms depending on their age, time of the day, and the season. In the daytime, paired adults behave territorially and unpaired subadults form small flocks of ten birds, whereas at night hundreds of birds roost together. In the breeding season, pairings remain in their nest all day. This fission-fusion raises questions about the underlying social structure and the cognitive capability of jungle crows. In this study, dyadic encounters were used to investigate dominance relationships (linear or non-linear) and the underlying mechanisms in captive jungle crows. Fourteen crows were tested in 455 encounters (i.e., 5 encounters per dyad), and a stable linear dominance relationship emerged. Sex and aggressiveness were determinants as individual characteristics for dominance formation. Males dominated females, and more aggressive individuals dominated less aggressive ones. Aggressive interactions in dyads occurred primarily during the first encounter and drastically declined during subsequent encounters without any signs of a confidence effect. These results suggest that, in captive jungle crow, a linear form of dominance is intrinsically determined by sex and aggressiveness and maintained extrinsically by memories of past outcomes associated with specific individuals, implying individual recognition.",Behavioural processes,2008 May,Netherlands,2008,00
18519873,Determinants of disability and quality of life in mild to moderate Parkinson disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that independently contribute to disability and quality of life (QoL) in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: A group of 190 patients with PD recruited from outpatient clinics and the Dutch Parkinson's Disease Association participated in this cross-sectional study. Data on demographic and clinical factors, motor symptoms, cognitive functions, affective symptoms, comorbidity, and social support were collected during neurologic and neuropsychological examinations. Disability was rated using the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (SE-ADL), the AMC Linear Disability Score (ALDS), and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). QoL was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire (PDQL) and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to identify determinants of disability and poor QoL. RESULTS: Axial impairment (postural instability and gait difficulty) explained the largest proportion of variance in disability. Bradykinesia and comorbidity contributed to disability, but to a lesser extent. Self-reported mood symptoms and axial impairment were the two factors most closely associated with poorer QoL, but comorbidity and bradykinesia additionally contributed to the explanatory power. Semantic fluency and psychomotor skills were the only cognitive variables related to some aspects of functional outcome. CONCLUSION: Axial impairment is strongly associated with disability in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease (PD). Self-report indices of mood status and axial impairment are identified as the main determinants of poor quality of life (QoL). The results of this study may help to identify patients with PD at risk for functional dependence and reduced QoL.",Neurology,2008 Jun 3,United States,2008,00
10682218,Schizophrenia: genes and environment.,"The historical and genetic foundations of our current understanding of schizophrenia are reviewed, as are the present and future directions for research. Genetic epidemiological investigations, including family, twin, and adoption studies have confirmed the contributions of genetic and environmental determinants of schizophrenia. For example, identical twins show average concordance rates of only 50%; rates of 100% would be expected on the basis of genetic equivalence alone. Genetic factors may cause errors in brain development and synaptic connections. A broad range of environmental components may further damage the brain. Biological components may include pregnancy and delivery complications, such as intrauterine fetal hypoxia, infections, and malnutrition. Primarily nonbiological components may include psychosocial stressors, such as residence in an urban area and dysfunctional family communication. It is likely that the environmental factors interact with the genetic liability in a negative manner to produce disorders in the schizophrenic spectrum. Genetic and environmental components of the disorder are examined, as well as their interactions in producing either neurodevelopmental syndromes or schizophrenia itself. The implication of these findings for prevention and treatment are considered.",Biological psychiatry,2000 Feb 1,United States,2000,00
19523593,Abandonment of infants by HIV-positive women in Russia and prevention measures.,"Since 1990, Russia has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of abandoned children, associated with harsh socio-economic conditions, increases in drug and alcohol addiction and HIV infection. Approximately 20% of infants born to HIV-positive mothers are abandoned in Russia. To find out why, we conducted 266 qualitative interviews in 2004-05 in four Russian cities, including HIV-positive women who had abandoned their infants and others who had not, relatives of the women (mostly their mothers), HIV-negative women who had abandoned, and medical experts. Unintended pregnancy was cited as the most important factor influencing the decision to abandon. Other important determinants included lack of partner and family support, drug abuse, fear of birth defects or disabilities, negative attitudes of medical professionals, and marginalized socio-economic status. HIV infection was closely linked to many of these reasons. Important avenues for interventions among HIV-positive women emerged, including improved contraceptive information and provision, education of medical personnel and women on HIV prevention and treatment, enhancement of social support, and strengthening of fostering and adoption programmes for HIV-affected families.",Reproductive health matters,2009 May,Netherlands,2009,00
19141544,Do childhood social circumstances affect overweight and obesity in early adulthood?,"AIMS: The aim of the study was to examine the association of childhood circumstances with overweight and obesity in early adulthood, to analyse whether the respondent's education and current circumstances mediate these associations, and to explore whether the respondent's health behaviour affects these associations. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study with retrospective inquiries. METHODS: The study was based on a representative two-stage cluster sample (N= 1894, participation rate 79%) of young adults aged 18-29 years in Finland in 2000. The outcome measure was three-class body mass index (BMI) (normal weight, overweight, and obesity). Multinomial logistic regression was used as the main statistical tool. RESULTS: In women, childhood circumstances (low parental education (relative risk ratio (RRR) = 2.43), parental unemployment (RRR= 2.09) and single-parent family (RRR= 1.99)) increased the risk of overweight (25 < or = BMI<30), but the effects were largely attenuated by other childhood factors and early adult circumstances. In men, no significant childhood predictors of overweight were found. Single-parent family (RRR=2.32), parental alcohol problem (RRR= 2.71), parental mental health problems (RRR=2.28) and being bullied at school (RRR=3.13) predicted obesity (BMI > or = 30) in women in the age-adjusted models, and being bullied at school remained a significant predictor after adjusting for all childhood and current determinants. In both genders, the strong association between parental education and obesity remained significant after adjusting for all other determinants (for the lowest educational category, RRR= 3.56 in women, and RRR= 6.55 in men). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood factors predict overweight and obesity in early adulthood. This effect is stronger on obesity than on overweight and in women than in men, and it seems to be partly mediated by adult circumstances. The results emphasize the lasting effect of childhood socioeconomic position on adult obesity. When preventive policies are being planned, social circumstances in childhood should be addressed.",Scandinavian journal of public health,2009 Mar,Sweden,2009,00
11676379,Social cognitive determinants of drinking in young adults: beyond the alcohol expectancies paradigm.,"In prior investigations of the psychology of drinking behavior, drinkers' positive expectancies regarding the effects of alcohol have been studied extensively. From a social cognitive point of view, however, several additional psychological factors also deserve attention, namely negative expectancies, social influence, and self-efficacy expectations. In a representative sample of 161 university students, this study examined to what extent inclusion of these additional social cognitive factors enhanced the predictive power of the predominant alcohol-expectancies model of drinking behavior, and to what extent all four social cognitive factors were related to the uptake and cessation of drinking behavior. The three additional social cognitive factors contributed 17% to the explained variance in drinking behavior, in addition to the 18% accounted for by positive expectancies. The constructs with the greatest predictive strength all pertained to the social effects and social context of drinking. The most important predictors of drinking behavior were found to differ for male versus female students, and for students living with their parents versus those living on their own. The data on drinking acquisition and cessation suggest that in this sample little change in drinking behavior could be expected. The social cognitive factors were strongly related to acquisition stages but only weakly to cessation stages. Recommendations for interventions aimed at lowering alcohol intake are given.",Addictive behaviors,2001 Sep-Oct,England,2001,00

Therefore, a workplace intervention is developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for employees with low back pain. The objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of one year. Employees eligible for this study are on sick leave for 2 to 8 weeks with common mental disorders. The workplace intervention will be compared with usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise approach that aims to reach consensus about a return-to-work plan by active participation and strong commitment of both the sick-listed employee and the supervisor. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome of this study is lasting return-to-work, which will be acquired from continuous registration systems of the companies after the follow-up. Secondary outcomes are total number of days of sick leave during the follow-up, severity of common mental disorders, coping style, job content, and attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal perspective. A process evaluation will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: Return-to-work is difficult to discuss in the workplace for sick-listed employees with mental disorders and their supervisors. Therefore, this intervention offers a unique opportunity for the sick-listed employee and the supervisor to discuss barriers for return-to-work. Results of this study will possibly contribute to improvement of disability management for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Results will become available in 2009.

15005732,Determinants of endotoxin levels in living environments of farmers' children and their peers from rural areas.,"BACKGROUND: Lower frequencies of asthma and hayfever have been observed in children with contact to livestock. At school age, the amount of endotoxin measured in the dust of children's mattresses is inversely related to the occurrence of atopic asthma, hayfever and atopic sensitization both in children from farming and non-farming households. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate which home and lifestyle characteristics of farm and non-farm families contribute to endotoxin levels measured in different indoor home environments. METHODS: In the framework of the Allergy and Endotoxin (ALEX) Study, endotoxin was measured in dust samples from the living room floor and the child's mattress of 319 farmers' families and 493 non-farming families, and in settled dust from stables. Endotoxin content of all dust samples was determined by a kinetic Limulus assay (Limulus-Amebocyte-Lysate test). Information about the child's activities on farms, home characteristics and cleaning behaviours was obtained from parental questionnaires. RESULTS: Endotoxin levels in stables did not predict the amount of endotoxin measured in floors or mattresses. However, a dose-dependent association between the child's activity on the farm and indoor home endotoxin levels was observed, both in farm and non-farm children. In non-farm children pet keeping and the frequency of floor cleaning were additionally associated with endotoxin levels, whereas in farm children parental farm activities, study area, time since last cleaning, the mattress type as well as younger age of the children contributed to increased microbial exposure. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that regular contact to farm animals increases indoor home endotoxin concentrations, both in farm and non-farm children, and might thus explain the protective effect of contact to livestock on atopic outcomes. To assess children's individual exposure to a microbial environment, measures of mattress dust exposure are needed as stable endotoxin concentrations were not associated with indoor home levels.",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2004 Mar,England,2004,00
15177197,"Obesity rates, income, and suburban sprawl: an analysis of US states.","In a decade of economic growth and rising income, obesity has risen dramatically. This is puzzling when researchers have found that there is an inverse relation between income and obesity. This paper argues that new location patterns produced by suburban sprawl are an important cause of rising obesity rates. New location patterns are such that work, school and social activities are not as easily accessible by foot. Changes in sprawl then drive changes in the causes of obesity identified by medical researchers (e.g., low activity levels). We define sprawl as increases in the amount of developed land, holding population constant. Determinants and outcomes are analyzed on a population basis. We use state-level data from the 1990s on obesity to show that states that increased the amount of developed land (holding population constant) showed larger increases in obesity. As a result, town planning efforts to reduce sprawl may be justified not only on aesthetic grounds but also based on efforts to reduce the costs associated with treating medical conditions related to obesity.",Health & place,2004 Sep,England,2004,00
11483930,Are risk factors the same for small for gestational age versus other preterm births?,"OBJECTIVES: This article explores whether the impact of social and demographic risk factors for preterm birth differs for small for gestational age preterm births versus other preterm births. STUDY DESIGN: This was a European case control study of the determinants of preterm birth (4700 cases and 6460 controls). Small for gestational age and non-small for gestational age preterm births were compared with a control group of term births; relationships were explored further by stratifying preterm births into subgroups by mode of onset, the presence of hypertension, and gestational age. RESULTS: Of the social and demographic risk factors for preterm birth identified in this sample, high maternal age, smoking, and low and high maternal body mass index have a stronger effect on small for gestational age preterm births. In contrast, obstetric history, maternal education, and marital status have similar effects regardless of birth weight. Hypertension during pregnancy is strongly associated with small for gestational age preterm birth and contributes to an explanation of observed differences. CONCLUSIONS: These results underline the importance of considering fetal growth restriction in the analysis of risk factors for preterm birth.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2001 Jul,United States,2001,00
17658397,Pathogenesis and clinical features of psoriasis.,"Psoriasis, a papulosquamous skin disease, was originally thought of as a disorder primarily of epidermal keratinocytes, but is now recognised as one of the commonest immune-mediated disorders. Tumour necrosis factor alpha, dendritic cells, and T-cells all contribute substantially to its pathogenesis. In early-onset psoriasis (beginning before age 40 years), carriage of HLA-Cw6 and environmental triggers, such as beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections, are major determinants of disease expression. Moreover, at least nine chromosomal psoriasis susceptibility loci have been identified. Several clinical phenotypes of psoriasis are recognised, with chronic plaque (psoriasis vulgaris) accounting for 90% of cases. Comorbidities of psoriasis are attracting interest, and include impairment of quality of life and associated depressive illness, cardiovascular disease, and a seronegative arthritis known as psoriatic arthritis. A more complete understanding of underlying pathomechanisms is leading to new treatments, which will be discussed in the second part of this Series.","Lancet (London, England)",2007 Jul 21,England,2007,00

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: One city in Portugal (Oeiras) and one in Belgium (Ghent). SUBJECTS: In total 526 participants, 247 from Portugal and 279 from Belgium, completed the long International Physical Activity Questionnaire and a validated questionnaire on environmental and psychosocial correlates. RESULTS: For the sum of all activities of at least moderate intensity, a significantly higher mean level of activity was found in Belgian adults (P < 0.001). However, comparable percentages of the Belgian (38%) and Portuguese (42%) samples did not meet the recommendation of 30 min per day. The variance explained by environmental factors was lower (1% to 8%) than by psychosocial factors (maximum 42%). Regression analyses showed activity-specific relations with environmental variables which were analogous in both countries. Walking/cycling for transportation and walking for recreation were related to social support from family and/or friends and to walkability and walking facilities in the neighbourhood. Recreational physical activity was mainly determined by social support, self-efficacy, and perceived benefits and barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Activity campaigns addressing psychosocial determinants are needed to encourage leisure-time activity, while a combination of neighbourhood design changes and encouragement of social support in walking is warranted to increase walking in different contexts.",Public health nutrition,2005 Oct,England,2005,00
15220946,Longitudinal changes in diet from childhood into adulthood with respect to risk of cardiovascular diseases: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess nutrient intakes relevant in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among young adults in Finland and to find past and present determinants of quality of diet. DESIGN: Prospective study, 21 years of follow-up. SETTING: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study, Finland. SUBJECTS: At baseline in 1980: 3569 children aged 3-18 y participated (83% of those invited), and every second of them (1780) were selected to the dietary study. At follow-ups in 1986 and 2001: 1200 and 1037 of the original sample, respectively, participated. METHODS: Food consumption was assessed using 48-h dietary recall. Intakes in 2001 were compared with those obtained in 1980 and 1986. Nutrients selected for further examination were those implicated in the risk of CVD: saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and n-3 fatty acids, fibre and salt. An index describing the quality of adulthood diet was constructed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent childhood and adulthood determinants of the quality index. RESULTS: The average intakes showed substantial changes since 1980. Intakes of fat and saturated fat had decreased, while the consumption of vegetables and fruit had increased. However, a great disparity was present between the recommended levels and actual intakes for many of the nutrients, particularly salt, saturated fat and fibre. Intake of fat and consumption of vegetables in childhood and physical activity in adulthood were important health behavioural determinants of the cardiovascular quality of the adult diet. Socio-demographic factors, including education of the subject and their parents, had no significant associations with diet. CONCLUSIONS: While intakes of energy and nutrients have changed favourably in Finnish young adults between 1980 and 2001 with regard to the risk of CVD, they are still far from recommended levels. Childhood diet is a significant determinant of adult diet even after 21 y.

17314126,Healthcare-seeking behaviours for sexually transmitted infections among women attending the National Institute of Dermatology and Venereology in Vietnam.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the determinants of delay in seeking healthcare for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among Vietnamese women attending the National Institute of Dermatology and Venereology (NIDV), through assessing to what extent women's sociodemographic backgrounds and their knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) relating to STIs/STI prevention influence their delay in seeking healthcare for STIs. METHODS: A face-to-face semistructured interview of 60 women over 18 years old attending the NIDV, who were diagnosed with an STI by clinicians from the NIDV and volunteered to participate in the study. The relationship between demographic and KAP variables and delay (7 days or more between onset of symptoms and seeking care) and the interval of delay were assessed using chi(2), Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: Of those women reporting delay before first seeking care, 82% delayed by > or =7 days. Women with lower education and from rural or remote areas waited significantly longer before first seeking care than those with higher education and from urban areas. Women who delayed in seeking care knew significantly less routes of STI transmission and engaged significantly more in sex while having symptoms than women who did not delay in seeking care. No relationships existed between delay behaviours and women's income, age or attitudes towards STIs/STI prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Early healthcare-seeking behaviour for STIs could be facilitated through improving women's basic knowledge regarding STIs, changing their sexual behaviour and creating a social support environment for early care-seeking.",Sexually transmitted infections,2007 Aug,England,2007,00

METHODS: Data was triangulated from 3 sources: hospital financial reports by service line for a fiscal year, a survey of 292 self-pay patients, and the self-pay policies and practices of clerical personnel described in a previous publication. RESULTS: Although the public, for-profit and not-for-profit institutions used different strategies for managing self-pays, there were also commonalities in the experiences indigent patients reported. The public institution provided the broadest access to the largest percentage of self-pay patients but offset the burden with the most successful prepayment and collection practices. The for-profit site obeyed federal regulations mandating emergency care but severely curtailed other services, and the not-for-profit limited assess (but not to the extent of the for-profit) and pursued collection (but not to the extent of the public). At all sites, actual practices by clerical staff often diverged from institutions' written self-pay policies. The probability of being turned away because of inability to pay ranged from 0% to 40% with front line personnel exercising considerable discretion on a case-by-case basis. CONCLUSIONS: Large institutional providers balance their particular social and legal obligations with strategies to limit access and optimize prepayment and collection. Stated policies generally do not reflect the practices of personnel. Uninsured patients are forced to navigate a capricious system that manages them as a liability rather than as a legitimate client.",Medical care,2008 Aug,United States,2008,00
18032165,Self-rated health and postnatal depressive symptoms among immigrant mothers in Quebec.,"Data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development were used to examine factors associated with postnatal depression and the links between self-rated health (SRH) and depressive symptoms in mothers 5 months after giving birth, according to immigration status. Postnatal depressive symptoms were measured using the 12-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Immigrant mothers were classified according to their ethnocultural (majority or minority) group and compared with Canadian-born mothers. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between SRH and depressive symptoms. The prevalence of high depressive symptoms was larger among immigrants from minority groups (24.7%) than among immigrants from majority groups (8.3%) and Canadian-born mothers 11.2%). SRH was associated with depressive symptoms among Canadian- born mothers, but not among minority immigrant mothers. Canadian- born mothers integrated mental health into their assessment of overall health status, however, depressive symptoms among minority immigrant mothers were common, and their determinants warrant further research.",Women & health,2007,United States,2007,00
16936981,[Association between dietary carbohydrates and type 2 diabetes mellitus: epidemiological evidence].,"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been escalating throughout the world and usual food consumption is regarded as one of the most important environmental determinants for chronic diseases. Thus, the role of type and quality of carbohydrates on the etiology of type 2 diabetes is still poorly understood. The present review discusses the available epidemiological evidence regarding the effect of the type and source of carbohydrate of the usual diet and the risk of type 2 diabetes in adults. Although epidemiological investigations support the hypothesis for a potential risk effect of high glycemic index and low fiber content diets for diabetes, the results are controversial and the benefit may be related to the magnesium content of the structure of the grains, suggesting the relevance of taking into account the food sources instead of nutrients on investigations of diet and risk of chronic diseases. The available evidence suggests that eating a diet rich in whole grain cereals and vegetables and low in refined grains, sucrose and fructose contents is beneficial in the prevention of diabetes. Thus, more clinical trials are required to support the associations and establish biologically plausible pathways.",Arquivos brasileiros de endocrinologia e metabologia,2006 Jun,Brazil,2006,00
19412929,Racial differences in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"The objective of this cohort study was to determine the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the effects of race/ethnicity, other demographic characteristics, geography, and healthcare utilization on probability of diagnosis. The authors used the Pennsylvania state Medicaid claims dataset from 1999 to 2003 to identify newly diagnosed cases of PD among the 182,271 Medicaid enrolled adults age 40-65; 319 incident cases of PD were identified. The 4-year cumulative incidence of PD was 45 per 100,000; 54 per 100,000 among whites, 23 per 100,000 among African-Americans and 40 per 100,000 among Latinos (P < 0.0001), corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of PD of 0.43 for African-Americans (P < 0.0001) compared with whites. After adjusting for age, sex, geography, reason for Medicaid eligibility, and average number of visits, African-Americans were still half as likely to be diagnosed with PD as whites (RR 0.45, P < 0.0001). Older age, more healthcare visits and Medicaid eligibility because of income alone also were significantly associated with PD diagnosis, while male sex was not. Observed racial differences in incidence of PD are not explained by differences in age, sex, income, insurance or healthcare utilization but still may be explained by biological differences or other factors such as education or aging beliefs. Better understanding of the complex biological and social determinants of these disparities is critical to improve PD care.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2009 Jun 15,United States,2009,00
16443314,Social support and self-rated health revisited: is there a gender difference in later life?,"This study examines the physical, behavioral, emotional and social determinants of self-rated health among Chinese older persons, and investigates if the effect of social support varies by gender. A representative sample of 1589 elderly community dwellers in Hong Kong were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Gender difference in the effect of social support was tested by an interaction term, 'gender x social support', in a hierarchical regression analysis. The frequency of falling ill, the number of chronic illnesses, sleep quality, mobility and positive emotions were most important determinants of self-rated health. The effect of social support was completely redundant when these factors were taken into account. The interaction term 'gender x social support' was significant and indicated a stronger effect for women, but the effect size was negligible (adding only 0.3% to the explained variance). This suggests that the effect of social support by and large is gender free. These findings suggest a high degree of similarity in the determinants of self-rated health between Western and Chinese older populations.",Social science & medicine (1982),2006 Jul,England,2006,00
18325417,Measuring determinants of occupational health related behavior in Flemish farmers: an application of the Theory of Planned Behavior.,"PROBLEM: Preventive interventions to reduce occupational injuries and health problems in farmers require the identification of factors that contribute to unsafe and health damaging behavior. This paper describes the development and validation of a self-report questionnaire, which measures the determinants of occupational health-related behaviors in farmers. METHOD: A representative sample of 283 Flemish farmers completed a provisional 135 item questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, measuring four behaviors related to occupational health (machinery use, animal handling, preventing falls, and pesticide use), as well as the intentions, attitudes, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy for each of these behaviors. RESULTS: The fit indices of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis turned out not to be sufficient to reproduce the dimensions of the TPB. Therefore exploratory factor analysis was use to determine the underlying dimensions. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) on the behavioral items yielded single component solutions explaining a considerable proportion of the variance for each behavior and for behavioral intentions. Principal component analyses toward an a priori three-component structure reflecting the TPB dimensions did not produce sufficient congruence for the determinants of the four behaviors. Subsequent Varimax rotations and discarding of redundant items resulted in three component solutions explaining 50% to 69% of the variance in the determinants of each behavior, corresponding with the dimensions of the TPB. Internal consistencies ranged from .25 to .89. Scale scores accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in intention and self-reported behavior. IMPACT: The study demonstrates the validity of the TPB in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Both authors share the same view on this study's impact on industry. In recent years, efforts have been made to create awareness among farmers about occupational hazards, and to encourage farmers to perform safer and healthier behavior. However, only a limited number of these interventions have proven to be successful. A possible reason for this relative lack of success is that interventions typically focus on risk analysis and raising awareness, whereas the literature on preventive health behavior change indicates that knowledge and awareness with regard to possible health risks are neither necessary nor sufficient to change behavior. To raise the effectiveness of prevention programs, other relevant determinants of behavior need to be addressed as well, such as: attitudes, perceived social norms, self efficacy, and elements of the physical environment that elicit or reinforce behavior. These determinants play a key role in psychological models of health related behavior, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior. Thus far, the use of these models within agricultural settings is fairly limited. This study demonstrates the validity of the Theory of Planned Behavior in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model.",Journal of safety research,2008,United States,2008,00
19948599,Geographic disparities in access to the medical home among US CSHCN.,"OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined geographic disparities in medical home access among US children with special health care needs (CSHCN) aged 0 to 17 years. METHODS: The 2005-2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs was used to estimate prevalence and odds of not having a medical home and 5 component outcomes according to state. Logistic regression was used to examine individual-level and state-level determinants of access. RESULTS: Medical home access varied substantially across geographic areas. CSHCN in Alaska, Arizona, Washington, DC, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, and Virginia had at least 50% higher adjusted odds of not having a medical home than CSHCN in Iowa. The adjusted prevalence of CSHCN lacking a medical home varied from a low of 46% in Iowa and Ohio to a high of 59% in Alaska and 61% in New Jersey. CSHCN in several western and southwestern states experienced greater problems with access to a personal doctor/nurse, a usual source of care, specialty care referrals, care coordination, and family-centered care. Adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, household socioeconomic status, language use, insurance coverage, and functional limitation reduced state disparities in access. CSHCN in states with higher immigrant and non-English-speaking populations had significantly lower medical home access. Increases in state health care expenditure and infrastructure and Medicaid/State Children's Health Insurance Program eligibility were associated with increased access to a personal doctor/nurse. CONCLUSIONS: Although individual-level sociodemographic and state-level health policy variables are important predictors of access, substantial geographic disparities remain, with CSHCN in several western and northeastern states at high risk of not having a medical home.",Pediatrics,2009 Dec,United States,2009,00
19309020,Radiation from mobile phone systems: Is it perceived as a threat to people's health?,"The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence, nature and determinants of concerns about mobile phone radiation. We used data from a 2006 telephone survey of 1004 people aged 15+ years in Denmark. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents were concerned about exposure to mobile phone radiation; radiation from masts was of concern to about 15%. In contrast, 82% were concerned about pollution. Nearly half of the respondents considered the mortality risk of 3G phones and masts to be of the same order of magnitude as being struck by lightning (0.1 fatalities per million people per year) while 7% thought it was equivalent to tobacco-induced lung cancer (approximately 500 fatalities per million per year). Among women, concerns about mobile phone radiation were positively associated with educational attainment, perceived mobile phone mortality risk and concerns about unknown consequences of new technologies. More than two thirds of the respondents felt that they had received inadequate public information about the 3G system. The results of the study indicate that the majority of the population has little concern about mobile phone radiation while a small minority is very concerned.",Bioelectromagnetics,2009 Jul,United States,2009,00
19477880,Exposure to interparental violence and psychosocial maladjustment in the adult life course: advocacy for early prevention.,"BACKGROUND: Early family-level and social-level stressors are both assumed to be the components of two main path models explaining the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and its long-term consequences on mental health explored through life-course epidemiological studies. AIMS: To investigate the association between exposure to interparental violence in childhood and mental health outcomes in adulthood when taking into account early family and social stressors. METHODS: A retrospective French cohort study of 3023 adults representative of the general population in the Paris metropolitan area was conducted in 2005 through at-home, face-to-face interviews. The outcomes measures were current depression and lifetime suicide attempt, intimate partner violence, violence against children and alcohol dependence. RESULTS: The adults exposed to interparental violence during childhood had a higher risk of psychosocial maladjustment. After adjusting for family- and social-level stressors in childhood, this risk was, respectively, 1.44 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.00) for depression, 3.17 (1.75 to 5.73) for conjugal violence, 4.75 (1.60 to 14.14) for child maltreatment and 1.75 (1.19 to 2.57) for alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The adult consequences of parental violence in childhood-and this independently of the other forms of domestic violence and the related psychosocial risks-should lead to intensifying the prevention of and screening for this form of maltreatment of children.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2009 Jul,England,2009,00
19420277,"Employment and social ""determinants"" of smoking in urbanizing China: a representative survey.","INTRODUCTION: This study explored social determinants of smoking among a sample of male Chinese adults in Changqiao, a community representing the transition from traditional to a ""mobile"" urban culture in China. New commercial systems have introduced high profits but also layoffs in the absence of government security systems. METHODS: In-person interviews were conducted by trained interviewers with 123 male participants selected at random. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were computed based on the Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM). About 61% of male participants were ever-smokers and 48% were current smokers. RESULTS: Current smoking was associated with involuntary unemployment (odds ratio [OR] = 6.52), the absence of home smoking restrictions (OR = 0.34), and social reinforcement such as friends' smoking (OR = 4.02) and receiving smoking-related gifts (OR = 6.39). DISCUSSION: Findings support the BEM. It is especially important to verify the relationship between unemployment and smoking, given the recent rise in involuntary job loss due to the transitional economy in China.",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,2009 Jul,England,2009,00
12205250,A prospective study of the role of depression in the development and persistence of adolescent obesity.,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent obesity is a strong predictor of adult obesity, and adult obesity has been associated with depression, especially in women. Studies have also suggested an association between depression in adolescence and higher body mass index (BMI) in adulthood. Whether depression leads to obesity or obesity causes depression is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine in longitudinal analyses whether depressed mood predicts the development and persistence of obesity in adolescents. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 9374 adolescents in grades 7 through 12 who completed in-home interviews for the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Assessments were made at baseline (1995) and at follow-up 1 year later. Depressed mood was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. BMI (kg/m2) was calculated from self-reported height and weight. BMI percentiles and z scores were computed using the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Obesity was defined as BMI > or =95th percentile, overweight as BMI > or =85th percentile and <95th percentile, and normal weight as BMI <85th percentile. A parental respondent gave information on household income, parental education, and parental obesity. RESULTS: At baseline, 12.9% were overweight, 9.7% were obese, and 8.8% had depressed mood. Baseline depression was not significantly correlated with baseline obesity. Among the 9.7% who were obese at follow-up, 79.6% were obese at baseline, 18.6% were overweight at baseline, and 1.8% were normal weight at baseline. Having depressed mood at baseline independently predicted obesity at follow-up (odds ratio: 2.05; 95% confidence interval: 1.18, 3.56) after controlling for BMI z score at baseline, age, race, gender, parental obesity, number of parents in the home, and family socioeconomic status. This finding persisted after controlling further for the adolescents' report of smoking, self-esteem, delinquent behavior (conduct disorder), and physical activity. After controlling for all these same factors, depressed mood at baseline also predicted obesity at follow-up among those not obese at baseline (odds ratio: 2.05; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 4.06) and follow-up BMI z score among those obese at baseline (beta = 0.11; standard error beta = 0.05). In contrast, baseline obesity did not predict follow-up depression. CONCLUSIONS: Depressed adolescents are at increased risk for the development and persistence of obesity during adolescence. Understanding the shared biological and social determinants linking depressed mood and obesity may inform the prevention and treatment of both disorders.",Pediatrics,2002 Sep,United States,2002,00
17176233,The social determinants of health: is there a role for health promotion foundations?,"ISSUE ADDRESSED: If they are to respond effectively to health inequities, organisations involved in health promotion need to refocus on the social determinants of health (SDH) and the distribution of resources for health. METHODS: This paper examines the potential of health promotion foundations (HPFs), a semi-autonomous arm of the state, to act at several policy and program intervention points to address the SDH and reduce health inequities. CONCLUSION: The public purpose, enterprise and innovation potential of health promotion foundations provides them with unique capacity to respond to SDH. In the complex and contested policy environment surrounding action on the determinants of health, the role that foundations can most usefully play is that of a change agent in a broader social movement seeking health equity.",Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2006 Dec,Australia,2006,00
15011941,Determinants of HIV and AIDS among young African-American men who have sex with men: a public health perspective.,"This study was an examination of community, age, race and ethnicity. Individual behavior and health promotion was critically examined within the context of (HIV) Human Immunodeficiency Virus and AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome) among young African-American men who have sex with men. Examples from the literature provided empirical illustrations of how these concepts have been defined conceptually and measured with respect to HIV/AIDS; particularly among this population from a public health perspective. Additionally, a conceptual model depicting the interplay of these concepts was reviewed and is provided and discussed to shed further light on the conceptual link between these concepts and healthy behaviors among sexually active African-American young men who have sex with men. The concepts are discussed in an integrative format throughout the paper within the backdrop of the proposed model for understanding the wave of HIV/AIDS within this subculture from a public health nursing perspective.",Journal of National Black Nurses' Association : JNBNA,2003 Dec,United States,2003,00
17033896,Recovered? Association between self-perceived recovery and the SF-36 after minor musculoskeletal injuries.,"OBJECTIVE: Recovery after minor musculoskeletal injuries is often disproportionately protracted. Our aim was to relate Short Form-36 (SF-36), to self-perceived recovery assessed with the question"" Do you feel recovered"". We hypothesized that restitution of physical factors would be reported at least as often as improvement of symptoms or impairments and that social and mental factors would dominate over physical as determinants for recovery. We followed 318 patients with minor traffic-related injuries for up to 6 months. RESULTS: For all SF-36 subscores more than 60% of the recovered patients had returned to their pre-injury levels. The subscores with the highest proportions (> 80%) were all mainly reflecting disability. For no subscore, however, was the proportion 100%. Normalizations in the SF-36 subscores for ""Bodily Pain"" (BP) (Odds Ratio, OR = 7.2), ""Role limitations due to physical function"" (OR = 5.3) were associated with self-perceived recovery. CONCLUSION: Abolition of pain appears to be paramount for the self-perceived recovery, but it is neither a sufficient nor a necessary prerequisite. Contrary to our expectation, physical aspects of functional health status were more strongly associated with recovery than were emotional or social aspects.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2007 Mar,Netherlands,2007,00
12188471,Cohabitation and marital status as predictors of mortality--an eight year follow-up study.,"In a follow-up study of 1265 women and men aged 50, 60 and 70 years, we analysed how mortality was associated with cohabitation status (living alone/not living alone), living with/without a partner, and marital status respectively. Data originate from a longitudinal questionnaire study of a random sample of people born in 1920, 1930 and 1940 with baseline in 1990. Survival time for all individuals were established during the next 8 years until May 1998. Multivariate Cox analysis stratified by age and gender showed that individuals living alone experienced a significantly increased mortality compared to individuals living with somebody HR = 1.42(1.04-1.95) adjusted for functional ability, self-rated health, having children, smoking, diet and physical activity. Similar analyses were performed for the variable living with/without a partner HR = 1.38(1.01-1.88) and marital status HR = 1.25(0.93-1.69), adjusted for the same covariates. Inclusion of the health behaviour variables--smoking, diet and physical activity--one by one to a model with functional ability, self-rated health and one of the three determinants (cohabitation status, living with/without partner, marital status) showed no effect on the association with mortality. Hereby, we found no evidence of an indirect effect of health behaviours on the association between living arrangements and mortality. In contrast to many previous studies, we found no significant gender and age differences in the association between living arrangement and mortality. We suggest that in future studies of social relations and mortality, cohabitation status is considered to replace marital status as this variable may account for more of the variation in mortality.",Social science & medicine (1982),2002 Aug,England,2002,00
15186873,A developmental perspective on the challenges of diabetes education and care during the young adult period.,"There is increasing recognition that the patient education and care provided to young adults with chronic physical illnesses, including type 1 diabetes, is inattentive to the complex developmental issues facing the older adolescent transitioning into the young adult period [Pediatrics 110 (2002) 1307]. In this paper, we present a clinical perspective on the challenge of improving diabetes education and care during the young adult period focusing on the importance of the developmental changes-cognitive, social, emotional, educational, and familial-that occur during this transitional stage of life. This developmental perspective on young adulthood provides a conceptual framework to better understand the young adult's ""readiness"" for engagement in intensive medical therapy. We review factors such as the timing and context of diabetes care and education that may be important determinants of young adults' ultimate success in becoming independent managers of their health care during this difficult transition. Developmentally-based practice principles for the young adult period are presented which include: assessing the patient's expectation at transition, building the relationship, working with families, assessing barriers to care, and formulating treatment plans and goals.",Patient education and counseling,2004 Jun,Ireland,2004,00
19179839,Healthcare costs for people aged 65+ two years prior to their receiving long-term municipal care.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: More knowledge is needed about patterns of healthcare consumption at different times during old age, particularly with regard to the relationship between various agents in the healthcare and social services system. One aim was to investigate healthcare costs in the public medical healthcare system in men and women (65+) and, with regard to age, in the two years prior to the start of long-term municipal care and services. Another aim was to investigate patterns and determinants of costs. METHODS: The study comprised 362 people who received decisions about municipal care and/or services during 2002-2003, and data were derived from the Swedish National Study of Aging and Care (SNAC) and county councils registers about healthcare consumption. SNAC provided data concerning demographics, functional dependency and informal care at the time of the decision, which were merged with data from the Skane County Council patient administrative system regarding costs in the two years prior to decision. RESULTS: Cluster analysis revealed 13% overall higher healthcare costs. Those involved were more often younger, men, married, and diagnosed with circulatory diseases, cancer, or injuries. Most (58% for women, 54% for men) of the costs for acute inpatient care occurred within five months prior to municipal care. Men had significantly higher costs compared with women for visits to outpatient physicians (EUR 700 vs 400) and inpatient care (EUR 4700 vs 700) 12-0 months prior to municipal care. CONCLUSIONS: A share of 13% had higher healthcare costs throughout the two years. Those involved were more often younger, men, married, and diagnosed with circulatory diseases, cancer, or injuries. Those older people at risk of high healthcare costs should benefit from systematic clinical assessments and more proactive and integrated care, to prevent escalating costs in the period preceding long-term municipal care and services.",Aging clinical and experimental research,2008 Dec,Germany,2008,00
25696242,Quality of life with heart failure: psychosocial determinants to be considered by cardiologists.,"BACKGROUND: Independent determinants of QOL (quality of life) with heart disease have been recognised and include factors such as severity of medical condition, comorbidity, and concomitant medication. Psychosocial factors, as 'ability to cope with the unpleasantness of the medical condition', 'want of information', and 'social identification' have an important influence on self-perceived wellbeing, but their influence on health-related QOL domains and self-perceived QOL in patients with heart failure has not been systematically studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess correlation between such psychosocial factors and QOL in patients with heart failure. METHODS: Patients from the outpatient heart failure clinic of the Martini Hospital, a 1000-bed community hospital in the city of Groningen, the Netherlands, were included if their ejection fractions were <40% and their medical diagnosis according to their cardiologists was stable chronic congestive heart failure. The following QOL estimators were applied: Pearlin's Mastery Scale, Stewart's Short Form 36 Quality of Life Questionnaire, Dupuy's Index of Wellbeing, Cantrill's Self-perceived Quality of Life Scale, Mester's Want of Information Scale. Internal consistency of the multi-item scales was estimated by Cronbach's alphas. Linear and multiple linear regression analyses were performed of the data. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled, 41 males and 19 females, average age 68 years (range 51 to 84 years). 'Ability to cope with the unpleasantness of the medical condition' was not only an independent determinant of self-perceived and health-related QOL (both p<0.001), but also of each domain of health-related QOL separately (p<0.001 for each domain). Lack of 'adequate medical information' and 'negative social identification' (identification with fellow-sufferers who are doing worse) were negative predictors of 'ability to cope' (p<0.01 and <0.001 respectively). 'Negative social identification' was also an independent determinant of self-perceived QOL, both unadjusted and after adjustment for 'ability to cope' and 'adequate medical information'. CONCLUSION: Relevant recommendations from this paper to be considered by cardiologists during everyday office hours could include: 1. Patients who express having difficulties in coping with the unpleasant aspects of their underlying heart condition have low health-related QOL as well as low self-perceived QOL. 2. Providing adequate medical information is a significant contributor to both better 'ability to cope' and better self-perceived QOL. 3. Avoiding identifying with fellow-sufferers who are doing worse and, instead, starting to identify with those who are doing better, are significant contributors to both better 'ability to cope' and better self-perceived QOL.",Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2003 Sep,Netherlands,2003,00
18484442,Work-related stress factors and menstrual pain: a nation-wide representative survey.,"While imposing research has been conducted with respect to the biological determinants of painful menstruation, little is known about the psychosocial factors, including work-related stress that might influence menstrual pain. We conducted a study in which we aimed to determine besides the prevalence of dysmenorrhoea whether menstrual pain was associated with job control, co-worker social support, job security and dissatisfaction with the job. Data of 2772 working women aged 18-55 years, participants in the Hungarostudy 2002 nation-wide representative survey was analyzed. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between work stress factors and menstrual pain. Altogether 15.5% of women reported to experience menstrual pain that limits their daily activity. Low job control, low co-worker social support and low job security were found to be associated with a higher risk for menstrual pain even after controlling for the effect of age, educational attainment, parity status, smoking, body-mass index and treatment for gynecological problems. Job dissatisfaction was also related to dysmenorrhoea, albeit not significantly. The relationship between work-related psychosocial factors and painful menstruation deserves further investigation in order to determine the possible pathways of this association.",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,2008 Jun,England,2008,00
12973579,[Opinions of students and educators concerning health: the public school perspective in a peripheral area of the city of Sao Paulo].,"This study focused on prevailing concepts in society concerning adolescents' health problems and needs. Based on concerns in the field of Collective Health in relation to public policies for social protection, the study attempted to grasp the public school perspective concerning these issues. The study's theoretical reference was the social determination of the health-disease process and the view that health needs are translated into demands for changes in the harmful processes resulting from relations in the production process. Data were gathered through interviews with pedagogical coordinators and focus groups with adolescents in public schools from the Raposo Tavares School District (Municipality of S o Paulo). The results showed that the participants recognized: (1) the sphere of social determinants at the base of adolescents' health problems and (2) in addition to disease processes, a set of social problems impacting the health-disease process, highlighting drug use and violence. Health needs are translated as demands for cross-sector public social policies.",Cadernos de saude publica,2003 Jul-Aug,Brazil,2003,00
17401479,Animal defense strategies and anxiety disorders.,"Anxiety disorders are classified according to symptoms, time course and therapeutic response. Concurrently, the experimental analysis of defensive behavior has identified three strategies of defense that are shared by different animal species, triggered by situations of potential, distal and proximal predatory threat, respectively. The first one consists of cautious exploration of the environment for risk assessment. The associated emotion is supposed to be anxiety and its pathology, Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The second is manifested by oriented escape or by behavioral inhibition, being related to normal fear and to Specific Phobias, as disorders. The third consists of disorganized flight or complete immobility, associated to dread and Panic Disorder. Among conspecific interactions lies a forth defense strategy, submission, that has been related to normal social anxiety (shyness) and to Social Anxiety Disorder. In turn, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder do not seem to be directly related to innate defense reactions. Such evolutionary approach offers a reliable theoretical framework for the study of the biological determinants of anxiety disorders, and a sound basis for psychiatric classification.",Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,2007 Mar,Brazil,2007,00
24403647,Lifecourse Priorities Among Appalachian Emerging Adults: Revisiting Wallace's Organization of Diversity.,"We examine how social demographics (gender, age, or race-ethnicity), census tract characteristics, and family environment during childhood relate to variability in the lifecourse priorities of 344 Cherokee and white youth during emerging adulthood (age 19-24). Analyses were performed using recursive partitioning and random forest methods to examine determinants of prioritizing education, family formation, economic establishment, self characteristics and close relationships, youth independence, conspicuous consumption, and community reliance. Overall, characteristics of census tracts were the most common and influential predictors of lifecourse priorities. Childhood family poverty, parental relationship problems, parental crime, and stressful life events were also important predictors. Race-ethnicity or cultural group (Cherokee vs. white), age, and gender were relatively unimportant. At this developmental stage and in this population, community characteristics and childhood family experiences may be better proxies for developmental settings (and resulting enculturated values and preferences) than social demographic variables (e.g., ethnicity or gender).","Ethos (Berkeley, Calif.)",2009 Jun,United States,2009,00
10774528,The effects of cognitive load on strategic self-handicapping.,"Past research has demonstrated that observers tend to underestimate the importance of situational determinants (e.g. task difficulty) of the performances of others. This tendency is particularly pronounced when observers are unmotivated, distracted or otherwise 'cognitively busy' while making attributional judgments. The objective of the present research was to determine whether a similar tendency exists when actors are given the opportunity to choose the tasks they will undertake in a self-presentational situation. Sixty-one participants were given a choice between a difficult and a simple task, with cognitive busyness being manipulated while this choice was being made. Cognitively busy participants were significantly more likely to choose the simple task than their non-busy counterparts.",The British journal of social psychology,2000 Mar,England,2000,00
12914305,Bridging the equity gap: health promotion for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.,"Health is influenced by political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, behavioral and biological conditions--either positively or negatively. Health promotion aims to make these factors more favorable through health advocacy. Advocating for physical, mental, and social health requires that individuals with I/DD have opportunities to identify and realize their aspirations, develop the capacity to satisfy their needs, and possess the ability to adapt and/or cope with the environment. Because health is both an individual and a social responsibility, effective health promotion strategies must incorporate linkages between health and development, particularly for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups where deprivation in health and economic resources exist simultaneously and reinforce each other [6]. Incorporating health and development at the core of health promotion activities addresses issues of poverty, poor health, and unemployment, while accounting for social, cultural and economic differences. Health promotion enables people with I/DD to achieve their health goals by ensuring equal opportunities and resources. This includes having supportive environments, access to information, and life skills and opportunities to make healthy choices. People cannot achieve their health goals unless they can control health determinants. Health promotion efforts require coordinated action from all interested groups (e.g., government entities, health and other social and economic sectors, nongovernmental and voluntary organizations, local authorities, industry and media), including individuals, families and communities. Community-based health promotion emphasizes community participation, along with empowerment of community members to address inequities and increase control over their health [3]. Individual satisfaction and participation are critical components in community coalitions that are providing health promotion programs. Moreover, community leadership, shared decision-making, linkages with other organizations, and organizational climate can predict satisfaction, participation, and planning. Health becomes a resource for everyday life when individuals with I/DD are empowered and can participate in health promotion activities that are based in their community.",The Nursing clinics of North America,2003 Jun,United States,2003,00
16246515,HIV treatment-related knowledge and self-efficacy among caregivers of HIV-infected children.,"OBJECTIVE: Improvements in treatment-related knowledge and self-efficacy may improve clinical outcomes in HIV-infected populations. We examined whether caregivers' knowledge and self-efficacy was associated with better clinical outcomes and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence among HIV-infected children. METHODS: Caregivers of 77 perinatally HIV-infected children were administered a semi-structured interview which included scales of HIV treatment-related knowledge, adherence self-efficacy and caregiver reports of child medication adherence. RESULTS: While caregivers correctly answered 74% of the knowledge questions, specific misconceptions were noted. Caregivers rated themselves as having high adherence self-efficacy, but were least confident in their ability to adhere to ART if it caused side effects or might result in social disclosure. Higher caregiver treatment-related knowledge and self-efficacy were associated with better clinical outcomes, as measured by viral load and CD4+ count, but not with caregiver reports of ART adherence. CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION: While additional factors may be important determinants of adherence to ART in this population, improving the HIV treatment-related knowledge and self-efficacy of caregivers may help to improve the clinical outcomes of HIV-infected children. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Care providers should address both misconceptions that might serve to undermine adherence as well as factors that limit patients' self-efficacy in adhering to treatment, prior to the initiation of ART and throughout the course of treatment.",Patient education and counseling,2006 Jun,Ireland,2006,00

Consistent with previous research, lack of access to health insurance coverage represents an important financial barrier to access to health care services in this community. This study also highlights the role of perceived need in explaining the presence or absence of a physician consultation.While increased attention to access issues at the national level is important, there also needs to be more emphasis on collecting local data for local decision-making regarding access issues.",Health marketing quarterly,2004,England,2004,00
15913678,Prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections among adolescents: the importance of a socio-ecological perspective--a commentary.,"The sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic among adolescents in the USA is inextricably tied to individual, psychosocial and cultural phenomena. Reconceptualizing the epidemic within an expanded socio-ecological framework may provide an opportunity to better confront its challenges. In this article, we use a socio-ecological framework to identify determinants of adolescents' sexual risk and protective behaviours as well as antecedents of their STI acquisition. The goal is to provide a synthesis of several discrete categories of research. Subsequently, we propose an integrated strategy that addresses the STI epidemic among adolescents by promoting a socio-ecological perspective in both basic research and intervention design. This approach may expand the knowledge base and facilitate the development of a broader array of intervention strategies, such as community-level interventions, policy initiatives, institutionally based programmes, and macro-level societal changes. Although there are inherent challenges associated with such an approach, the end result may have reciprocal and reinforcing effects designed to enhance the adoption and maintenance of STI-preventive practices among adolescents, and further reduce the rate of STIs.",Public health,2005 Sep,Netherlands,2005,00
16821508,Access to health care: does neighborhood residential instability matter?.,"Many Americans do not have access to adequate medical care. Previous research on this problem focuses primarily on individual-level determinants of access such as income and insurance coverage. The role of community-level factors in helping or hindering individuals in obtaining needed medical care, however, has not received much attention. We address this gap in the literature by investigating the association between neighborhood residential instability and access to health care. Using individual-level data from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and block-group level data from the 2000 decennial census, we find that individuals who live in neighborhoods with high residential turnover have worse health care access than residents of other neighborhoods. This association persists even when the prevalence of poverty, the supply of health care, and a variety of individual characteristics are held constant. We offer explanations for these findings and suggest directions for future research.",Journal of health and social behavior,2006 Jun,United States,2006,00
19636745,Childhood and adolescent predictors of late onset criminal careers.,"This study explores the emergence of a criminal career in adulthood. The main hypothesis tested is that late criminal onset (at age 21 or later) is influenced by early factors that delay antisocial manifestations. The Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD) was used to examine early determinants of criminal behavior. 400 Inner London males were followed from ages 8-10 to 48-50, and were classified as follows: 35 late onsetters who were first convicted at age 21 or later, and did not have high self-reported delinquency at ages 10-14 and 15-18; 129 early onsetters first convicted between ages 10 and 20; and 236 unconvicted males. Odds ratios and logistic regression analyses revealed that the best predictors of late onset offenders compared with early onset offenders included nervousness, having few friends at ages 8-10, and not having sexual intercourse by age 18. The best predictors of late onset offenders compared with nonoffenders included teacher-rated anxiousness at ages 12-14 and high neuroticism at age 16. It is concluded that being nervous and withdrawn protected boys against offending in adolescence but that these protective effects tended to wear off after age 21. These findings show that adult offending can be predicted from childhood, and suggest that early intervention might prevent a variety of maladjustment problems and difficulties in adult life.",Journal of youth and adolescence,2009 Mar,United States,2009,00
11990880,The need for mental health promotion.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the concept and evidence for mental health promotion, within an understanding of mental health and mental illness and their determinants. METHOD: A selective review of literature and opinion in the fields of public health and mental health. RESULTS: Mental health and mental illness are often given a low priority, despite growing evidence of the burden of disease and costs to the economy. Improving mental health and reducing mental illness will improve quality of life, public health and productivity. The needs for mental health promotion are complementary to the needs for prevention and treatment of mental illness. The required activities are different. Mental health professionals have a necessary but not sufficient role in mental health promotion. CONCLUSIONS: An understanding that mental illnesses are treatable can encourage early entry to care, improve outcomes and lessen the stigma and discrimination related to mental illness. In primary health care there is some evidence that preventive interventions with groups at high risk of depression can prevent episodes of ill health. However, mental health promotion involves another dimension. Better understanding of the nature of mental health and mental illness is the key to changing the priorities, policies and practices in education, law, social services, housing and health critical in turn to the conditions conducive to mental health.",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,2001 Dec,England,2001,00
16273992,Subjective appraisal of Alzheimer's disease caregiving: the role of self-efficacy and depressive symptoms in the experience of burden.,"Most studies investigating correlates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver burden have focused on the role of objective factors as opposed to subjective factors. Although objective variables (e.g., caregiver age, patient dementia severity, functional status) have been shown to be significantly associated with burden, the correlations generally are modest and explain relatively little of the variability in caregiver outcomes. Moreover, many of these objective variables are not modifiable and are of limited use in the development of caregiver interventions. Thus, there continues to be a need to identify powerful and modifiable determinants of caregiver burden. This study examined the role of two subjective factors-self-efficacy and depressive symptoms-as predictors of AD caregiver burden. Based on a sample of 80 AD caregivers, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy and depressive symptoms each had a significant independent effect on the experience of burden even after accounting for objective factors. These findings suggest that caregiver interventions aimed to reduce burden may benefit from the incorporation of specific strategies to increase self-efficacy and decrease depressive symptoms.",American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,2005 Sep-Oct,United States,2005,00
19034049,Is age at menopause increasing across Europe? Results on age at menopause and determinants from two population-based studies.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variability and determinants of menopause age in two European cohort studies, the European Respiratory Health Survey and the Swiss Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults Cohort. METHODS: Age at menopause was estimated in 5,288 women, aged 30 to 60 years, randomly selected in nine European countries between 1998 and 2002. Determinants of natural and surgically induced menopause were investigated by Cox regression and heterogeneity by meta-analysis. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were assessed in a subsample. RESULTS: A quarter of the women were postmenopausal by age 50.8 years. Median age of natural menopause was 54 years. Hormone levels were within expected ranges for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Surgically induced menopause was highly prevalent (22%-47%), associated with earlier timing of menopause. Determinants of earlier menopause were current smoking (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.27-1.98), body mass index greater than 30 kg/m (HR, 1.32; 95%, CI, 1.02-1.70), and low physical activity (HR, 1.37; 95%, CI, 1.12-1.67). The determinant for later menopause was multiparity (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89). Predictors were similar for naturally and surgically induced menopause. Oral contraceptive use yielded heterogeneous effects on timing of menopause. Later birth was associated with later menopause (HR, 0.934; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96). This evidence of a secular trend is heterogeneous across countries. CONCLUSIONS: Age at menopause varies across Europe, shifting toward higher ages. This secular trend seems paradoxical because several adult determinants, that is, overweight, smoking, sedentarity, and nulliparity, associated with early menopause are on the rise in Europe. The heterogeneity of the secular trend suggests additional country-specific factors not included in the study, such as improved childhood nutrition and health, that have an influence on reproductive aging.","Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",2009 Mar-Apr,United States,2009,00
16290129,Socioeconomic determinants of regional differences in outpatient antibiotic consumption: evidence from Switzerland.,"This paper investigates the determinants of regional variations in outpatient antibiotic consumption using Swiss data. The analysis contributes to the debate on appropriate antibiotic use by improving the understanding of its determinants, and may help to define more effective health care policies to reduce the resistance phenomenon. Findings suggest that Switzerland exhibits relatively low levels of consumption among European countries. There are significant differences between cantons both in the per capita antibiotic sales and defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants (DID). Econometric estimations suggest that DID are significantly related to per capita income, antibiotic price, the density of medical practices, demographic, cultural and educational factors. The incidence of bacterial infections is also relevant. Appropriate policies affecting antibiotic consumption in the community can be designed by looking at crucial determinants in the model and their related impact.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2006 Aug 22,Ireland,2006,00
17980931,Who is willing to pay for long-term care insurance in Catalonia?,"Both public and private insurance for long-term care (LTC) in European countries employed is underdeveloped. However, limited evidence is gathered on the behavioural demand responses to the introduction of insurance schemes expanding insurance coverage. This paper aims at empirically examining the determinants of the ex ante demand for LTC coverage drawing upon an insurance-based WTP referendum approach format. Data is collected from a representative population sample of Catalonia (Spain), before a countrywide funding system was developed. Our findings suggest that (based on our questionnaire format) only one-fifth of the population is willing to pay for LTC coverage though it is a highly elastic product. Ex ante demand for LTC coverage is driven by individual's perceptions of old age disability risk (private information asymmetry) and housing tenure (giving rise to self-insurance), the latter reduces the probability of insurance coverage demand.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2008 Apr,Ireland,2008,00
17907518,"The cost of childhood asthma and its determinants in Ankara, Turkey.","Bronchial asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. In recent years a consistent increase in the prevalence, and concomitantly, in the social and economic impact of the disease, has been reported. In order to provide data for the cost of pediatric asthma and its determinants in Turkish children, a study was performed in a single outpatient clinic, which encompasses a questionnaire-guided interview and retrospective evaluation of the last year files. From the 183 patients enrolled, most were males (65.6%) and atopics (63.5%), with a disease severity of mild intermittent (67.7%). Mean annual total costs per patient was US $991.7 +/- 73.2 (median = 688.8) and the largest proportion of the direct costs was due to outpatient clinic costs (48.5%). Mean cost of any hospitalization per patient was US $955.5 +/- 16.5. In multivariate analysis, the disease severity, current use of preventive drugs and current use of emergency sevice and/or current hospitalization appeared to be the main determinants of direct costs. Adequate control of the disease plays a key role in decreasing the total direct costs of pediatric asthma although it increases the medication and outpatient costs.",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,2007 Apr-Jun,Turkey,2007,00
12194444,A comparative study of determinants of uxorilocal marriage in two counties of China.,"A strictly maintained patrilineal family system makes virilocal marriage almost universal and uxorilocal marriage rare in the history of rural China. Uxorilocal marriage can be divided into two types that may be termed, respectively, contingent and institutional. The former preserves family lineages in families without a son and occurs when uxorilocal marriage is uncommon. The latter serves practical economic purposes in families with sons and occurs when uxorilocal marriage is relatively prevalent. Using data from a survey in two counties of Shaanxi--Lueyang, where both kinds of uxorilocal marriage are prevalent, and Sanyuan, where uxorilocal marriage is rare and usually contingent--this paper employs logistic regression models in a quantitative comparative study of determinants of uxorilocal marriage in rural China. We show that the purposes and prevalence of the two types of uxorilocal marriage differ and that their determinants are also different in the two counties. In Sanyuan, the determinants are only a couple's sibling composition, membership in a large family clan, and educational level. In Lueyang, in addition to those determinants in Sanyuan, important contributions to the type of uxorilocal marriage include a couple's parental marriage type, age at marriage, adoption status, marriage arrangement, and their attitudes toward uxorilocal marriage. The results indicate the potential importance of encouraging uxorilocal marriage in rural areas as a means of mitigating demographic and social problems related to son preference, such as high sex ratio at birth and lack of old-age security, which are projected for China's future.",Social biology,2001 Spring-Summer,United States,2001,00

19742279,Psychosocial determinants for frequent primary health care utilisation in patients with heart failure.,"OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial symptoms are common in patients with heart failure. Little research, however, has been done to determine which psychosocial factors influence primary care patients' consultation frequency in the case of heart failure. METHODS: We recruited 310 primary care patients with heart failure by analysing electronic patient records. At baseline, psychological distress (anxiety and depression; HADS), disease coping (FKV), negative affectivity and social inhibition (DS-14), disease-specific quality of life (MLHFQ) and social support (F-SozU) were measured by validated questionnaires. Severity of heart failure (according to NYHA-classification and Goldman's Specific Activity Scale) and sociodemographic characteristics were documented by self-report instruments. Nine month later, patients were contacted by telephone in order to assess GP consultation frequency. Logistic regression was done to determine whether these psychological, medical and sociodemographic factors were associated with primary care utilisation. RESULTS: On average, patients consulted their general practitioner (GP) 8.2 times during nine months. Female subjects and patients with higher levels of perceived heart failure severity, physical problems and anxiety or depression as well as those living alone visited their GP significantly more often. In multivariate analysis, frequent attendance in general practices was predicted by physical problems and living alone. These factors explained 11.6% of the variance of frequent attendance in general practices. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors of help-seeking behaviour in heart failure patients focus on mental and physical discomfort and a lonely home situation. These factors might need to be compensated by GP consultation. GPs should address the rearrangement of physical, mental, and social resources to strengthen self-reliance of patients with heart failure.",Psycho-social medicine,2008 Apr 2,Germany,2008,00
16487450,Non-pharmacological interventions for aggressive behavior in older adults living in long-term care facilities.,"BACKGROUND: Aggressive behavior (AB) is common in institutional settings. It is an important issue because of its consequences on both the person manifesting such behaviors and their caregivers. Although there are numerous studies assessing non-pharmacologic strategies to manage AB in older adults, no extensive review of the literature is available. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in institutional settings. METHOD: Papers describing the assessment of a non-pharmacological intervention to manage AB in which participants were at least 60 years old and living in a long-term care facility were selected mainly by searching various databases. RESULTS: A total of 41 studies were identified and included in the review. These studies mainly use quasi-experimental designs and include less than 30 participants. Sixty-six percent (27/41) of the studies report either a statistically or behaviorally significant reduction of AB as a result of a non-pharmacological intervention. Staff training programs and environmental modifications appear to be the most effective strategies. CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological interventions seem effective for managing AB. Future studies on the effectiveness of these interventions need to be more rigorous. Development in this field needs to be based on knowledge regarding the determinants of AB in older adults.",International psychogeriatrics,2006 Mar,England,2006,00
15194516,Does it make sense in a coherent way? Determinants of sense of coherence in Swedish women 40 to 50 years of age.,"The aim of this study was to explore how socioeconomic and psychosocial life experiences in childhood and at adult age influence the level of sense of coherence (SOC) in women. The idea was to seek empirical support for establishing whether SOC is an individual construct being developed in early life and basically resistant toward adverse environmental factors or rather an entity influenced by adult psychosocial factors and as such, sensitive to health promotion activities; that is, if evidence could be found for a causal direction from classic factors involved in health promotion, such as social network and support, to SOC. A questionnaire (Krantz & Ostergren, 1999) was mailed to a random sample of 486 women, equivalent to 50% of the women between the ages of 40 and 50 in a medium-sized municipality (population 13,200) in Sweden. The response rate was 81.7% (397 women). Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate bivariate associations between socioeconomic and psychosocial variables and low SOC. Logistic regression analysis was used to test for confounding and as a method of analyzing the structure of tentative causal chains. It was found that adult factors such as job strain (OR = 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11-5.54), low social support (OR = 4.00, CI = 2.48-6.46), and low social anchorage (OR = 4.14, CI = 2.57-6.67) were independent predictors for low SOC in adult women. Childhood conditions such as family disruption and child abuse proved not to influence SOC to a statistically significant degree. Our study suggests that SOC is an entity partly associated with an individual's position in the social structure and partly by work conditions and social network and support rather than by childhood conditions. We could not claim this study to be a critical test of Antonovsky's (1979) theories in the full refutationistic sense. To approach this goal, it would take a carefully designed prospective study assessing the effect of different factors on SOC in a true life course perspective.",International journal of behavioral medicine,2004,England,2004,00
17479578,Sport commitment among competitive female gymnasts: a developmental perspective.,"The purpose of this study was to examine age and competitive level differences in the relationship between determinants and level of sport commitment. Gymnasts (N = 304) comprised three age groups (8-11, 11-14.5, and 14.5-18 years) and two competitive levels (Levels 5-6 and 8-10). Multiple regression analyses revealed: (a) perceived costs and social constraints from parents and best friends were the strongest predictors of commitment for the youngest gymnasts, (b) perceived costs, personal investments, and parent social constraints predicted commitment for 11-14.5-year-old gymnasts, and (c) perceived competence and costs predicted commitment for the oldest gymnasts. Competitive level differences also emerged; for Level 5-6 gymnasts, personal investments, perceived costs, coach social support, and social constraints by coach, best friend, and teammates were predictors of commitment. Personal investments and teammate social constraints were significant predictors for Level 8-10 gymnasts.

18569355,Experimental pretesting of public health campaigns: a case study.,"The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the merits of evaluating new public health campaign materials in the developmental phase using an experimental design. This is referred to as experimental pretesting. In practice, most new materials are tested only after they have been distributed using nonexperimental or quasiexperimental designs. In cases where materials are pretested prior to distribution, pretesting is usually done using qualitative research methods such as focus groups. Although these methods are useful, they cannot reliably predict the effectiveness of new campaign materials in a developmental phase. Therefore, we suggest when pretesting new materials, not only qualitative research methods but also experimental research methods must be used. The present study discusses an experimental pretest study of new campaign materials intended for distribution in a national sexually transmitted infection (STI) AIDS prevention campaign in the Netherlands. The campaign material tested was the storyline of a planned television commercial on safe sex. A storyboard that consisted of drawings and text was presented to members of the target population, namely, students between the ages of 14 and 16 enrolled in vocational schools. Results showed positive effects on targeted determinants of safe sexual behavior. The advantages, practical implications, and limitations of experimental pretesting are discussed.",Journal of health communication,2008 Apr-May,United States,2008,00
19759426,"A behavioral approach to RTW after sickness absence: the development of instruments for the assessment of motivational determinants, motivation and key actors' attitudes.","INTRODUCTION: On the basis of a motivational framework for return to work (RTW) after sickness absence, scales were developed to measure absentee attitudes towards RTW, perceived social norm with respect to RTW, RTW self-efficacy, RTW motivation, and the RTW attitudes of six types of key actors. METHODS: Both theory and 33 in-depth interviews with sickness absentees and occupational physicians produced 95 items. A sample of 119 absentees who had reported sick for more than one month completed these items. Absentees varied with respect to gender, age, educational level, and work sector. RESULTS: Factor analyses and reliability analyses yielded seventeen scales with sufficient reliability (Cronbach's alpha: 0.60-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: The new scales appear to be valid and promising for future research on RTW. Validation in larger samples is necessary and the predictive validity should to be tested.","Work (Reading, Mass.)",2009,Netherlands,2009,00
15098001,Examination of AVPR1a as an autism susceptibility gene.,"Impaired reciprocal social interaction is one of the core features of autism. While its determinants are complex, one biomolecular pathway that clearly influences social behavior is the arginine-vasopressin (AVP) system. The behavioral effects of AVP are mediated through the AVP receptor 1a (AVPR1a), making the AVPR1a gene a reasonable candidate for autism susceptibility. We tested the gene's contribution to autism by screening its exons in 125 independent autistic probands and genotyping two promoter polymorphisms in 65 autism affected sibling pair (ASP) families. While we found no nonconservative coding sequence changes, we did identify evidence of linkage and of linkage disequilibrium. These results were most pronounced in a subset of the ASP families with relatively less severe impairment of language. Thus, though we did not demonstrate a disease-causing variant in the coding sequence, numerous nontraditional disease-causing genetic abnormalities are known to exist that would escape detection by traditional gene screening methods. Given the emerging biological, animal model, and now genetic data, AVPR1a and genes in the AVP system remain strong candidates for involvement in autism susceptibility and deserve continued scrutiny.",Molecular psychiatry,2004 Oct,England,2004,00
15768774,"Maternal, neonatal and community factors influencing neonatal mortality in Brazil.","Child mortality (the mortality of children less than five years old) declined considerably in the developing world in the 1990s, but infant mortality declined less. The reductions in neonatal mortality were not impressive and, as a consequence, there is an increasing percentage of infant deaths in the neonatal period. Any further reduction in child mortality, therefore, requires an understanding of the determinants of neonatal mortality. 209,628 birth and 2581 neonatal death records for the 1998 birth cohort from the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were probabilistically matched. Data were from SINASC and SIM, Information Systems on Live Births and Deaths of Brazil. Logistic regression was used to find the association between neonatal mortality and the following risk factors: birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, delivery mode, plurality, sex, maternal education, maternal age, number of prior losses, prenatal care, race, parity and community development. Infants of older mothers were less likely to die in the neonatal period. Caesarean delivery was not found to be associated with neonatal mortality. Low birth weight, pre-term birth and low Apgar scores were associated with neonatal death. Having a mother who lives in the highest developed community decreased the odds of neonatal death, suggesting that factors not measured in this study are behind such association. This result may also indicate that other factors over and above biological and more proximate factors could affect neonatal death.",Journal of biosocial science,2005 Mar,England,2005,00
18048853,Handicap and its determinants of change in stroke survivors: one-year follow-up study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke, a major health issue affecting the elderly, limits their participation in society. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in stroke survivors' handicap levels and to identify their determinants in the subacute phase from 3 months to 1 year. METHODS: Data were collected from a prospective cohort of 303 Chinese stroke survivors with the use of questionnaires, including the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living-Chinese Version (IADL-CV), Barthel Index, Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination, Chinese Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Chinese version of the London Handicap Scale. RESULTS: A total of 297 and 268 patients were successfully followed up at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Whereas IADL remained unchanged throughout, we found an improvement in Barthel Index but a deterioration in the Chinese Geriatric Depression Scale score at 12 months. Multilevel modeling revealed improvements in the mobility and social integration handicap domains and a deterioration in the orientation domain at 12 months. Overall handicap remained unchanged. At 12 months, depression was most significantly and independently associated with poststroke handicap, and advanced old age alone (>80 years) was associated with clinically significant deterioration in handicap. CONCLUSIONS: Even though IADL remained static at 1 year, mobility and social integration handicap dimensions can be improved in the early community phase after stroke. Nonphysical factors such as depression were confirmed to be significantly associated with handicap. Rehabilitation should target the high-risk group of very elderly stroke survivors who were 4 times more likely to deteriorate in handicap.",Stroke,2008 Jan,United States,2008,00
11420814,Smoking and quitting with the aid of nicotine replacement therapies in the English adult population. Results from the Health Education Monitoring Survey 1995.,"BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials have shown the usefulness of nicotine replacement therapies, family physician advice and other cessation aids in enhancing smoking cessation. However, many trials have taken place amongst selected patients and doctors. This paper assesses cessation amongst a representative general adult population in England in order to see whether such aids are as successful amongst more typical smokers. METHODS: Descriptive information on the pattern of smoking cessation aids use in the English population is presented for the first time. This is followed by multivariate probit analysis of the 'Health in England 1995' survey data set in order to predict successful smoking cessation as a function of several variables including use of nicotine gum and patches, willpower, advice from family physicians, social class, education, gender, marital status and family composition. RESULTS: The results tend to confirm that lower social class and lower educational achievement are linked to continuing smoking status. However, users of nicotine gum and patches were found to be less likely to have given up smoking than non-users. This may be explained by the fact that only those who find it difficult to give up will go to the time and expense of considering such aids. These findings could also be explained by the fact that gum and patches have only been available recently in England. The pattern of results also suggests that 'willpower' is a marker for success in cessation as opposed to a determinant of giving up in its own right. CONCLUSION: This research confirms a lot of other research on the determinants of smoking cessation and has for the first time looked at the use and impact of nicotine replacement therapy on giving up in a representative English adult population. More research is needed on observational data sets in order to tease out the true impact of nicotine replacement on cessation rates in representative smoking populations.",European journal of public health,2001 Jun,England,2001,00
15018090,The role of chronobiology in sleep disorders medicine.,"This review is concerned with circadian (approximately 24 h) aspects of chronobiology, and how they relate to sleep disorders medicine. We begin with an introduction to the key concepts and paradigms of circadian rhythms research in general, including a description of homeostatic and circadian determinants of sleep timing. This is followed by a brief history of chronobiology in relation to sleep disorders medicine. Both animal and human circadian rhythm studies are considered. We trace historical changes in the relative emphasis placed on social contacts, light, and melatonin in human circadian rhythms research. Special attention is given to free-running, forced desynchrony, and ultra-short sleep/wake cycle findings of particular relevance to sleep disorders medicine. The latter part of the review comprises a description of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders, highlighting insights derived from basic circadian rhythms research, including recent advances in molecular genetics. We conclude that the role of chronobiology in sleep disorders medicine is profound and pervasive, and that the two disciplines will move ever closer as a natural function of important new insights into sleep and sleep disorders provided by basic circadian rhythms research.",Sleep medicine reviews,2003 Dec,England,2003,00
12831833,Cytokines and immune activation in systolic heart failure: the role of Type D personality.,"The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and its soluble receptors 1 (sTNFR1) and 2 (sTNFR2) are predictors of mortality in chronic heart failure (CHF) but the determinants of these increased levels of disease-promoting cytokines are largely unknown. Type D personality refers to the combination of the tendency to experience negative emotions (negative affectivity) and the tendency to inhibit the expression of emotions in social interaction (social inhibition). Type D is an independent predictor of cardiac events in coronary patients who are at risk for CHF. The present study examined the effect of Type D personality on TNF-alpha, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 in 42 men with CHF (meanage=57.9+/-10.5 years). There was a significant multivariate effect of Type D on TNF-alpha measures (p=.006); i.e., circulating levels of TNF-alpha (4.8+/-0.9 versus 2.5+/-0.2 pg/ml, p=.003), sTNFR1 (1814+/-314 versus 1134+/-78 pg/ml, p=.014), and sTNFR2 (2465+/-243 versus 1874+/-118 pg/ml, p=.019) were significantly higher in Type D patients as compared to non-Type D patients. The effect size (ES) of Type D personality ranged from rather large (sTNFR1, ES=0.77; sTNFR2, ES= 0.73) to large (TNF-alpha, ES=0.90). After controlling for ischemic etiology and severity of heart failure, Type D personality emerged as an independent predictor of increased circulating levels of both TNF-alpha (OR=9.5, 95% CI 2.1-43.8, p=.004) and TNF-alpha receptors (OR= 6.1, 95% CI 1.4-25.8, p=.014). These findings are consistent with the prognostic power of Type D personality regarding long-term morbidity and mortality in patients with established coronary heart disease. This study suggests that individual differences in personality contribute to the psychoneuroimmunological aspects of heart failure.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2003 Aug,Netherlands,2003,00
15687086,Social and behavioral determinants of self-reported STD among adolescents.,"CONTEXT: Adolescents have among the highest sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates. Rich data are now available to characterize the social and behavioral factors that affect adolescent STD risk. METHODS: Data from Wave 1 (1995) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) are used to estimate school, neighborhood, family and individual level effects on acquiring an STD. Data from Waves 1 and 2 (1996) of Add Health are also used to estimate the effects of prior STD acquisition and other factors on STD occurrence between waves. Random intercept logistic regression and random intercept piecewise exponential hazard regression are used to account for possible clustering in the Add Health data. RESULTS: Seven percent of sexually experienced teenagers reported ever having had an STD as of Wave 1, and almost 7% reported having had an STD between Waves 1 and 2. Respondents' age, gender, race or ethnicity, and their family background, neighborhood and school characteristics affect STD acquisition at Wave 1. Among teenagers who were sexually experienced at Wave 1, younger age at first intercourse elevates STD risk. Other factors contribute, but to a lesser degree. For acquisition of an STD between Waves 1 and 2, females, blacks, teenagers with lower levels of mother's education and those who have had a prior STD are at higher risk. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple social and behavioral factors influence lifetime history of STD. Age at first intercourse and STD history affect subsequent STD acquisition. Self-reports of STD acquisition in probability samples of the general population are useful.",Perspectives on sexual and reproductive health,2004 Nov-Dec,United States,2004,00
10832576,Heterogeneity in the determinants of health and illness: the example of socioeconomic status and smoking.,"Systematic variations in health and illness among social groups have persisted and, in some cases increased, in many countries in spite of improvements in the availability of, and access to, health care services. Health policy makers have responded by showing increasing interest in non-clinical determinants of health as a way of explaining the observed systematic variations in health and illness. Yet health care and non-health care ""factors"" are often seen as competing for society's scarce resources in the production of health. The purpose of this paper is to augment this traditional approach to understanding the determinants of health in populations by exploring heterogeneity in the smoking-health relationship between social groups. Logistic regression analyses were performed using data from the 1992-93 Sante Quebec survey, a weighted random sample of the non-institutionalized population of the province of Quebec, Canada (N = 23,564). The findings suggest that the likelihood of reporting health as poor or fair was greater for smokers than non-smokers. However, the difference between smokers and non-smokers was significantly greater among groups of the population with low incomes and without employment, but significantly less among sub-groups with lower levels of education. These findings suggest that the identification, evaluation and implementation of health care programmes need to pay greater attention to the interface between social, behavioural and clinical determinants of health.",Social science & medicine (1982),2000 Jul,England,2000,00
18306732,Social determinants of health in Slovakia.,"OBJECTIVES: Substantial inequalities of health in various parts of Slovak Republic (SR) are observed. BACKGROUND: Our aim was to analyse the combination of sociological and medical aspects of these inequalities. METHODS: Sociological and mortality data from all 76 counties of SR were analysed by cluster analysis, ANOVA, multiple regressions, parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: In the sociologically weaker clusters the life expectancy was shorter, male and female premature cardiovascular mortality was higher and the male (not female) cancer mortality was higher than in sociologically better clusters. CONCLUSION: Social and economic conditions--low educational level, poverty, unemployment, social exclusion and poor housing--strongly influence the health of inhabitants in SR (Fig. 3, Ref. 8).

11062282,Depression and other determinants of values placed on current health state by stroke patients: evidence from the VA Acute Stroke (VASt) study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This prospective study examined the determinants of the utility (value) placed on health status among a sample of patients with acute ischemic and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke. METHODS: Data were from the VA Acute Stroke (VASt) study, a nationwide prospective cohort of 1073 acute stroke patients admitted at any of 9 Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center sites between April 1, 1995, and March 31, 1997. The primary outcome was the patient's health status utility as measured by the time-tradeoff method. Data were obtained by telephone interviews at 1, 6, and 12 months and by medical record review. General linear mixed modeling was used to assess the effects of social, psychological, and physical factors on patients' valuations of their current health state. The analysis was confined to the 327 patients who were able to provide self-reports at >/=2 time points. RESULTS: Patients' valuations of their health state status over the initial 12 months after stroke were very stable over time, with only a slight improvement at 6 months, followed by a slight decline at 12 months. In adjusted analyses, living alone, being institutionalized, decreased physical function, and depression were independently associated with lower levels of patient health status utility over time. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke patient health status utilities are relatively stable during the initial year after stroke. In addition to physical function, psychological health and social environment are important determinants of patient health status utility. These factors need to be considered when conducting stroke decision analyses if more accurate conclusions are to be drawn regarding preferred patterns of care.",Stroke,2000 Nov,United States,2000,00
19171669,"Water, ecology and health: ecosystems as settings for promoting health and sustainability.","Despite the proposed ecological and systems-based perspectives of the settings-based approach to health promotion, most initiatives have tended to overlook the fundamental nature of ecosystems. This paper responds to this oversight by proposing an explicit re-integration of ecosystems within the healthy settings approach. We make this case by focusing on water as an integrating unit of analysis. Water, on which all life depends, is not only an integral consideration for the existing healthy settings (schools, hospitals, workplaces) but also highlights the ecosystem context of health and sustainability. A focus on catchments (also know as watersheds and river basins) exemplifies the scaled and upstream/downstream nature of ecosystems and draws into sharp focus the cross-sectoral and transdisciplinary context of the social and environmental determinants of health. We position this work in relation to the converging agendas of health promotion and ecosystem management at the local, regional and global scales--and draw on evidence from international initiatives as diverse as the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Using water as a vehicle for understanding the systemic context for human wellbeing, health promotion and disease prevention draws inevitable attention to key challenges of scale, intersectoral governance and the complementary themes of promoting resilience and preventing vulnerability. We conclude by highlighting the importance of building individual and institutional capacity for this kind of integration--equipping a new generation of researchers, practitioners and decision-makers to be conversant with the language of ecosystems, capable of systemic thought and focused on settings that can promote both health and sustainability.",Health promotion international,2009 Mar,England,2009,00
19319620,Relative contributions of multiple determinants to bone mineral density in men.,"SUMMARY: Focus on individual risk factors for osteoporosis could allocate disproportionate attention to trivial relationships. We tested many recognized risk factors of osteoporosis for their association with bone mineral density (BMD) in multivariate models among men. Lean mass accounted for the most variance, with substantially less accounted for by demographic, strength, and health factors. INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis in men has gained recognition as a public health problem, generating an interest in the search for risk factors. Isolation of individual risk factors could allocate disproportionate attention to relationships that may be of limited consequence. METHODS: The Boston Area Community Health/Bone (BACH/Bone) Survey is a population-based study of randomly selected community-dwelling men (age, 30-79 years). BMD and lean mass were measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Socioeconomic status, health history, and lifestyle factors were obtained via interview. Hormone levels and markers of bone turnover were obtained from non-fasting blood samples. Multivariate analyses measured relative contributions of covariates to femoral neck (hip), one-third distal radius (wrist), and lumbar spine BMD. RESULTS: Factors positively associated with BMD in multivariate models at the three sites were black race and appendicular lean mass. Asthma was consistently negatively associated. Various other risk factors also contributed significantly to each of the individual sites. R (2) values for the hip, wrist, and spine were 41%, 30%, and 24%, respectively. Lean mass accounted for the most explained variance at all three sites. CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize the limitation of focusing on individual risk factors and highlight the importance of potentially modifiable lean mass in predicting BMD.",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2009 Dec,England,2009,00
19203335,The health care system as a social determinant of health: qualitative insights from South Australian maternity consumers.,"Health systems and policies are important determinants of health because they influence the type and quality of health care available to a population. This study included semi-structured qualitative interviews and a questionnaire to collect demographic data and household details for a purposeful sample of 38 mothers and 24 fathers from four socioeconomic areas of metropolitan South Australia who had at least one child aged between 1 and 6 years of age. The participants reported that birth experiences within the predominantly medicalised maternity system were at odds with the expectations of a significant proportion of contemporary consumers that maternity care will leave them not only with a healthy mother and baby, but also with no undue adverse impacts on their physical, mental and relationship health. There appears to be no formal mechanism in place for regular consumer feedback of experiences into system and service planning.",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,2009 Feb,Australia,2009,00
15947988,Proteinuria in South Asian children: prevalence and determinants.,"Proteinuria in children is a marker of kidney disease and atherosclerosis, both which are known predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Recent evidence suggests that migrant South Asian populations living in the West may be at higher risk of kidney disease than native Caucasians. However, the determinants of proteinuria in South Asian children have not been explored. Previously, we reported ethnic variation in the prevalence of proteinuria in the adult population of Pakistan. However, it is not known whether ethnic predisposition to proteinuria appears during childhood or whether it is acquired later in life as a result of prolonged exposure to undiagnosed diabetes and hypertension. Analyses were based on a subset of data for 4977 children aged 5 to less than 15 years collected as part of the broad National Health Survey of Pakistan, conducted between 1990 and 1994. Proteinuria was defined as a dipstick positive for protein on a random urine sample. Ethnicity was reported as ""mother-tongue"", which is specific for each of the five major ethnic subgroups of Pakistan: Muhajir, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashtun, and Baluchi. The overall prevalence (95% CI) of proteinuria in the children was 3.3% (2.7-3.9%). It was 6.2% in Sindhis, 3.6% in Muhajirs, 2.8% in Punjabis, 2.8% in Baluchis, and 1.0% in Pashtuns (p<0.001). In multivariable analyses, proteinuria was associated with greater height (p=0.007), urban dwelling (p=0.03), lower socioeconomic status (p=0.02), and certain ethnicities (p=0.005). The ethnic variation in proteinuria in South Asian children mirrors variation among ethnic groups in adults. This suggests variations in susceptibility or early exposure to causes of chronic kidney disease, rather than long-term exposure to undiagnosed diabetes or hypertension. Further studies are needed to determine factors in early life that may differentially predispose certain ethnic groups to proteinuria.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2005 Oct,Germany,2005,00
15370366,Effect of laser photocoagulation treatment for diabetic macular oedema on patient's vision-related quality of life.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular oedema (DME) on patients' Vision Related Quality Of Life (VR-QOL) and to investigate associations between changes in self reported VR-QOL and changes in visual acuity following application of laser treatment. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 55 subjects who underwent laser treatment for DME. Eligible patients with no history of previous laser photocoagulation self-administered the 51-item field-test version of the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) prior to treatment and 3 months following the last session of laser application. Visual acuity was measured by means of the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS) chart. Multi-item scales rating different aspects of VR-QOL were compared prior and after photocoagulation and the change in questionnaire's composite score following treatment was correlated to change in visual acuity and other determinants previously reported as risk factors in the diabetic population. RESULTS: Scale scores associated with general vision, near vision, distance vision, peripheral vision, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, expectations for visual function and dependency due to vision were significantly improved following laser treatment. Multivariate models revealed that improvement of the NEI-VFQ composite score was significant in subjects younger than 65 years of age (p = 0.04) who received more laser burns (p = 0.02) and had worse vision-related QOL prior to laser treatment as expressed by the baseline NEI- VFQ composite score (p = 0.03). There was no statistically significant association between change in the composite score following laser treatment and stage of diabetic retinopathy, duration of diabetes or laser settings used during photocoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Photocoagulation for DME has a beneficial effect on patients' subjective perception of visual function. The use of vision-targeted health status questionnaires in conjunction with the clinical examination appears to provide a more comprehensive overview of individuals' daily well- being following laser treatment.",Current eye research,2004 Jul,England,2004,00
12162831,Inequalities in health in Latin America and the Caribbean: descriptive and exploratory results for self-reported health problems and health care in twelve countries.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore and describe inequalities in health and use of health care as revealed by self-report in 12 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. METHODS: A descriptive and exploratory study was performed based on the responses to questions on health and health care utilization that were included in general purpose household surveys. Inequalities are described by quintile of household expenditures (or income) per capita, sex, age group (children, adults, and older adults), and place of residence (urban vs. rural area). For those who sought health care, median polishing was performed by economic status and sex, for the three age groups. RESULTS: Although the study is exploratory and descriptive, its findings show large economic gradients in health care utilization in these countries, with generally small differences between males and females and higher percentages of women seeking health care than men, although there were some exceptions among the lower economic strata in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in self-reported health problems among the different economic strata were small, and such problems were usually more common among women than men. The presence of small inequalities may be due to cultural and social differences in the perception of health. However, in most countries included in the study, large inequalities were found in the use of health care for the self-reported health problems. It is important to develop regional projects aimed at improving the questions on self reported health in household interview surveys so that the determinants of the inequalities in health can be studied in depth. The authors conclude that due to the different patterns of economic gradients among different age groups and among males and females, the practice of standardization used in constructing concentration curves and in computing concentration indices should be avoided. At the end is a set of recommendations on how to improve these sources of data. Despite their shortcomings, household interview surveys are very useful in understanding the dimensions of health inequalities in these countries.",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,2002 May-Jun,United States,2002,00

17382433,Consumer acceptance of technology-based food innovations: lessons for the future of nutrigenomics.,"Determinants of consumer adoption of innovations have been studied from different angles and from the perspectives of various disciplines. In the food area, the literature is dominated by a focus on consumer concern. This paper reviews previous research into acceptance of technology-based innovation from both inside and outside the food domain, extracts key learnings from this literature and integrates them into a new conceptual framework for consumer acceptance of technology-based food innovations. The framework distinguishes 'distal' and 'proximal' determinants of acceptance. Distal factors (characteristics of the innovation, the consumer and the social system) influence consumers' intention to accept an innovation through proximal factors (perceived cost/benefit considerations, perceptions of risk and uncertainty, social norm and perceived behavioural control). The framework's application as a tool to anticipate consumer reaction to future innovations is illustrated for an actual technology-based innovation in food science, nutrigenomics (the interaction between nutrition and human genetics).",Appetite,2007 Jul,England,2007,00
15741288,Depressive symptoms and development of coronary heart disease events: the Italian longitudinal study on aging.,"BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between depressive symptomatology (DS) and cardiovascular events and mortality in elderly persons have yielded contradictory findings. To address this issue, the authors assessed DS and an extensive array of sociodemographic, behavioral, and biological variables in the largest population-based sample of older Italians ever studied and analyzed their association with coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and total number of deaths. METHODS: This prospective, community-based cohort study included a sample of 5632 Italians, 65 years and older, who were recruited from the demographic registries of eight municipalities in Italy. Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale, and a score > or =10 was used to indicate the presence of DS. All traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were assessed at baseline, through questionnaires, blood tests, and physical examinations. The outcomes were CHD fatal and nonfatal events and total number of deaths. The association of the predictive variables with the outcomes was assessed using different Cox models. RESULTS: Baseline DS was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.60) and with cardiovascular mortality in men (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.60-3.87) and with total mortality in men (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.58-2.58) and women (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.04-1.95) at the 4-year follow-up assessment. This association was observed after adjusting for a vast array of potential confounding variables, including major chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptomatology confers an increased risk for CHD in men and for total mortality in men and women but is not explained by health behaviors, social isolation, or biological or clinical determinants.","The journals of gerontology.

18528821,Predictors of psychosocial adaptation among elderly residents in long-term care settings.,"This cross-sectional descriptive study explored psychosocial adaptation and its determinants among elderly residents of long-term care facilities. A convenience sample of 165 elderly residents was recruited from two nursing homes and two assisted living institutions in the Taichung area. All residents who met the criteria for this study were interviewed individually from April through June 2006. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on participant demographic characteristics, admission conditions, functional status, perceived family support, life attitudes, and psychosocial adaptation. The adaptation inventory incorporated three aspects of adaptation, including (1) sense of self-value, (2) sense of belonging and (3) sense of continuity. Findings, in general, did not indicate participants had achieved a high level of overall adaptation or significant adaptation in any of the three aspects targeted. Most participants were female. More than half were widowed and unable to fully finance their own institutional care. Nearly one-third was not admitted voluntarily. Having adequate funding for admission, voluntary admission, and number of roommates were the three most influential factors affecting overall adaptation, explaining 54% of variance. Study findings reflect the importance to residents' adaptation of self-determination, autonomy, and pre-institutionalization preparation and are intended to provide guidance for nursing intervention and social welfare policy making.",The journal of nursing research : JNR,2008 Jun,China (Republic : 1949- ),2008,00

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: ALT and GGT were studied as determinants of diabetes in the British Women's Heart and Health Study, a cohort of 4,286 women 60-79 years old (median follow-up 7.3 years). A systematic review and a meta-analysis of 21 prospective, population-based studies of ultrasonography, which diagnosed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), ALT, and GGT as determinants of diabetes, were conducted, and associations of ALT and GGT with diabetes were compared. RESULTS: Ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD was associated with more than a doubling in the risk of incident diabetes (three studies). ALT and GGT both predicted diabetes. The fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for diabetes per increase in one unit of logged ALT was 1.83 (95% CI 1.57-2.14, I(2) = 8%) and for GGT was 1.92 (1.66-2.21, I(2) = 55%). To directly compare ALT and GGT as determinants of diabetes, the fully adjusted risk of diabetes in the top versus bottom fourth of the ALT and GGT distributions was estimated using data from studies that included results for both markers. For ALT, the HR was 2.02 (1.59-2.58, I(2) = 27%), and for GGT the HR was 2.94 (1.98-3.88, I(2) = 20%), suggesting that GGT may be a better predictor (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with the role of liver fat in diabetes pathogenesis. GGT may be a better diabetes predictor than ALT, but additional studies with directly determined liver fat content, ALT, and GGT are needed to confirm this finding.",Diabetes care,2009 Apr,United States,2009,00
11109180,"Primary care, income inequality, and self-rated health in the United States: a mixed-level analysis.","Using the 1996 Community Tracking Study household survey, the authors examined whether income inequality and primary care, measured at the state level, predict individual morbidity as measured by self-rated health status, while adjusting for potentially confounding individual variables. Their results indicate that distributions of income and primary care within states are significantly associated with individuals' self-rated health; that there is a gradient effect of income inequality on self-rated health; and that individuals living in states with a higher ratio of primary care physician to population are more likely to report good health than those living in states with a lower such ratio. From a policy perspective, improvement in individuals' health is likely to require a multi-pronged approach that addresses individual socioeconomic determinants of health, social and economic policies that affect income distribution, and a strengthening of the primary care aspects of health services.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2000,United States,2000,00

Multivariable logistic regressions using never-smokers at baseline (N=1137; age 11-14) showed a model of distal determinants was more predictive of initiation within the approximate 10 month follow up period than one of proximal determinants. When all determinants were simultaneously considered, lesser academic achievement and fewer environmental impediments to smoking most strongly predicted initiation. The findings are consistent with some current smoking prevention programs, however such programs may be further potent by using theory-based social development approaches and through reducing tobacco availability or social contexts where youth can smoke without another adult knowing.",Addictive behaviors,2006 Apr,England,2006,00

This study involved 350 randomly recruited community-dwelling older adults. Participation in daily activities and social roles were measured with the Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H). Demographic, health-related and environmental data were also collected. A decline with age was observed in four of the six daily activities domains and two of the four social roles domains of participation. However, these lower scores are mainly explained by the 85+ group, which consistently scored lower than the 65-69-year-old group. No differences were found between the 65-69, 70-74 and 75-79 years old groups. Some participation domains differed according to gender. Satisfaction with participation was high and did not differ between age groups. Characteristics most associated with participation vary according to the domains; generally, age and marital status are the best determinants of participation. This study found that most of older adults have an unrestricted level of participation which decreases only late in the aging process. This reduction in participation in very old adults was not accompanied by a decrease in satisfaction, supporting the hypothesis that they can participate satisfactorily in valued activities.",Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2009 Nov-Dec,Netherlands,2009,00
19850073,Factors associated with short and long sleep.,"OBJECTIVE: Short (<7 h) and long sleep durations (> or = 9 h) have recently been linked with increased mortality in the US, Europe and Asia, but little is known about the sleep patterns of Australian adults. The present study examined the sleep habits of Australian adults and identified socio-demographic and health-related factors associated with short and long sleep. METHODS: This study analyzed cross-sectional and self-reported data from 49,405 Australian adults aged 45 to 65 years collected between 2006 and 2008. Socio-demographic and health-related factors were entered into multinomial logistic regression models predicting self-reported sleep duration. RESULTS: Short and long sleep were reported by 16.6% and 13.9% of participants respectively. Short sleep was associated with long working hours (odds ratio [OR]=1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.28) and obesity (OR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.41); long sleep was associated with recent treatment for cancer (OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.34, 2.02) and heart attack/angina (OR=1.58, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.09).

METHODS: Multilevel modeling was used to explore domestic violence outcomes among a sample of 4520 married men. RESULTS: Recent physical and sexual domestic violence was associated with the individual-level variables of childlessness, economic pressure, and intergenerational transmission of violence. A community environment of violent crime was associated with elevated risks of both physical and sexual violence. Community-level norms concerning wife beating were significantly related only to physical violence. CONCLUSIONS: Important similarities as well as differences were evident in risk factors for physical and sexual domestic violence. Higher socioeconomic status was found to be protective against physical but not sexual violence. Our results provide additional support for the importance of contextual factors in shaping women's risks of physical and sexual violence.",American journal of public health,2006 Jan,United States,2006,00
19733824,Concomitant antipsychotic prescribing in US outpatient settings.,"BACKGROUND: Clinicians use concomitant antipsychotic therapy for management of psychotic disorders despite a paucity of evidence for this practice. OBJECTIVE: To examine national patterns and determinants of concomitant antipsychotic therapy. METHODS: Concomitant antipsychotic therapy was defined as simultaneous use of 2 or more antipsychotic agents. Prescription data from the 2003-2004 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the outpatient department portion of the 2003-2004 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to characterize the prescribing of concomitant antipsychotic therapy and antipsychotic monotherapy (defined as use of a typical or atypical agent). Multiple logistic regression was applied to antipsychotic visits to examine the determinants of concomitant antipsychotic therapy based on patient and provider characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, concomitant antipsychotic therapy was documented in 9% of the visits involving antipsychotic agents, and monotherapy in 91% of the visits. The use of atypical agents, namely risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, was common in both forms of therapy. Concomitant therapy was frequently used for psychoses and bipolar disorder. Logistic regression revealed that the odds of receiving concomitant antipsychotic therapy were higher for patients younger than 65 years, with greatest odds (odds ratio=6.52) for patients 40 to 64 years old. Having a diagnosis of psychosis quadrupled (odds ratio=4.33) the odds of receiving concomitant antipsychotic therapy. Physicians in metropolitan areas were more likely (odds ratio=2.17) to use concomitant antipsychotic therapy than physicians in non-metropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant antipsychotic therapy continues to be prevalent and extensive in outpatient settings. With the use of concomitant antipsychotic therapy as a quality of care measure, there is a need to optimize prescribing of these potent combinations.",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,2009 Sep,United States,2009,00
16040552,Work-related determinants of return to work of employees on long-term sickness absence.,"PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to identify work-related determinants of return to work (RTW) of employees who are on long-term sickness absence. METHOD: The study was based on a sample of 926 employees on sickness absence (maximum duration of 12 weeks). The employees filled out a baseline questionnaire and were subsequently followed until the 10th month after listing sick. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify determinants of RTW. RESULTS: Working in one of the vocational sectors public administration, construction, financial and commercial services, transport, or education (P = 0.00) and having low co-worker support (P = 0.01) were related to longer duration to RTW in the multivariate model. Having low supervisor support (P = 0.01) was associated with a higher RTW rate. CONCLUSIONS: Vocational sector is a strong predictor of RTW. Especially employees from the sector education are slow as to RTW. The observed association between low supervisor support and RTW was unexpected. However, the study confirms earlier research on the association between low co-worker support and RTW.",Disability and rehabilitation,2005 May 6,England,2005,00
20066800,"[Law 180, 30 years later: considerations about changing Psychiatry (and on psychiatrist role)].","In 1978, Law 180 eliminated psychiatric Hospitals for implementing community and rehabilitative care. After 30 years, it is of interest to make the point on limits and unmet needs linked to this Law. Actually, it stemmed from social psychiatry as conceived in 60's and focused on hypothesized social determinants of chronic psychoses, paying less attention to other important variables (e.g. biological) and psychiatric domains like mood and anxiety disorders. In fact, this model was totally devoid of recent epidemiological, diagnostic, psychobiological, therapeutic knowledge, showing the multidimensional etiopathogenesis of mental disorders. In addition, the Law 180 conditioned the formation of clinical psychiatrists with this ""dogmatic"" reductionism with more emphasis on social aspects and less attention to clinical aspects and to non psychotic disorders. Currently, Italian psychiatrists need to regain their clinical skill, role and identity in an open-minded vision of the etiopathogenetic complexity of psychiatric disorders.",Rivista di psichiatria,2009 May-Jun,Italy,2009,00
12878106,Value importance and value congruence as determinants of trust in health policy actors.,"The paper examines levels and determinants of trust in a health care system and in key actors in the health policy community. Talcott Parsons theorizes that the sharing of common values is a necessary condition for interpersonal trust to exist; this paper tests that notion at the level of systemic (institutional) trust. The paper reports findings of a 1999 survey of 493 randomly selected residents of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It uses multiple regression analysis to identify the determinants of three different types of trust-generalized systemic trust, fiduciary trust, and generalized trust in particular actors' input to health system changes. Among the numerous independent variables, special attention is devoted to the degree of congruence or incongruence between the importance which respondents attach to one of the values enunciated in the Canada Health Act-namely, 'accessibility' (equal access to quality health care)-and the importance which respondents believe is attached to that value by the Regional Health Authority and by the Premier of the province. Both value importance and value congruence on equal accessibility are found to be important factors explaining variation in all three types of trust. In explaining levels of trust in the Premier on the issue of health care system reform, congruence on equal accessibility proved to be even more important than such factors as political partisanship, political cynicism, and personal experience as a patient in the health care system. Findings also suggest that there is an emotional component to systemic trust.",Social science & medicine (1982),2003 Sep,England,2003,00
14626465,Risk behavior and social-cognitive determinants of condom use among ethnic minority communities in Amsterdam.,"This study assessed sexual risk behavior and determinants of condom use among migrants in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We tested the predictive utility of constructs derived from the health belief model and the theory of planned behavior. Data were collected by means of a cross-sectional study in a community sample of 537 Surinamese, Antillean, and sub-Saharan African heterosexual men and women randomly recruited from participants in an epidemiological study. Participants donated saliva for HIV testing and were interviewed using two structured questionnaires. Inconsistent condom use occurred in 82% of the primary partnerships and in 25% of the casual partnerships. Multivariate analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and behavioral factors, showed that perceived behavioral control and subjective norm regarding condom use were main social-cognitive determinants of consistent condom use. However, contrary to predictions, the relation between consistent condom use and sociodemographic and behavioral factors was not entirely mediated by these social-cognitive factors.",AIDS education and prevention : official publication of the International Society for AIDS Education,2003 Oct,United States,2003,00
21431819,Health and environment in the context of urbanization.,"This paper introduces a series of research projects designed to fulfill the societal role of environmental health studies by investigating (1) the dynamic and complex relationships between environmental conditions and (2) health in an urban setting. Research in this first category has revealed the existence of the combined influence of multiple physical environmental factors on health and its mechanisms. In the second category, there have been a number of studies of the integrated influence of social environmental factors on health employing an aggregate modeling of multiple determinants of health and studies of individual topics related to social determinants of health. These research projects have contributed to the formulation of specific remedies and the development of comprehensive health policies. Participatory approaches have been used to enhance capacity building opportunities and to ensure that research results reflect the actual conditions in urban societies. Healthy Cities projects and programs have been developed in close collaboration with this type of research. Urban societies have become interdependent and share the same issues globally. Further research into the relationships between health and the environment in the context of urbanization will expand the base of evidence applicable to the complex realities in modern societies.",Environmental health and preventive medicine,2007 Mar,England,2007,00
15113642,The desire for support and respite care: preferences of Dutch informal caregivers.,"Informal care is an indispensable element in the care for many patients. In order to maintain a sustainable input of informal care, it seems important to identify measures to alleviate the burden of care giving for caregivers at risk of burn out or other serious health problems, such as support and respite care. Thus, far research has focused on the burden of caregiving and on the supply of respite care. The demand side: what type of care is preferred by informal caregivers and what determines their preferences, is virtually unknown. We analysed the preferences and the underlying determinants for several types of support and respite care in a sample of 950 Dutch informal caregivers. Almost 80% of the respondents desire support or respite care in general, 42-47% would prefer more communication with other informal caregivers or more information of professional caregivers. Some time off is preferred by 40% of the respondents. The results show that caregiver characteristics, care recipient characteristics, elements of the caregiving situation and institutional variables determine the desire for support and respite care. Especially, the subjective burden of caregiving is important, whereas the number of caregiving tasks and the time invested (objective burden) hardly affect the desire for support and respite care.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2004 Jun,Ireland,2004,00
14520621,"ESRD patient quality of life: symptoms, spiritual beliefs, psychosocial factors, and ethnicity.","BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that patients' perceptions may be more important than objective clinical assessments in determining quality of life (QOL) for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: We interviewed 165 hemodialysis patients from 3 sites using a QOL questionnaire that included the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and the McGill QOL (MQOL) scale, which includes a single-item global measure of QOL (Single-Item QOL Scale [SIS]). The MQOL scale asks patients to report their most troublesome symptoms. We also initiated the use of a Support Network Scale and a Spiritual Beliefs Scale. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 60.9 years, 52% were men, 63% were white, and 33% were African American. Patients had a mean treatment time for ESRD of 44 months, mean hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL (118 g/L), mean albumin level of 3.7 g/dL (37 g/L), and mean Kt/V of 1.6. Forty-five percent of patients reported symptoms. Pain was the most common symptom (21% of patients). There was an inverse relationship between reported number of symptoms and SWLS (P < 0.01), MQOL scale score (P < 0.001), and SIS (P < 0.001). The Spiritual Beliefs Scale correlated with the MQOL scale score, SWLS (both P < 0.01), and SIS (P < 0.05). The Support Network Scale score correlated with the MQOL Existential (P = 0.01) and MQOL Support (P < 0.01) subscales. No clinical parameter correlated with any measure of QOL, spiritual beliefs, or social support. CONCLUSION: Symptoms, especially pain, along with psychosocial and spiritual factors, are important determinants of QOL of patients with ESRD. Additional studies, particularly a longitudinal trial, are needed to determine the reproducibility and utility of these QOL measures in assessing patient long-term outcome and their association with other QOL indices in larger and more diverse patient populations.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2003 Oct,United States,2003,00
15789939,Determinants of the quality of life of patients with congenital heart disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The improvement of the quality of life of chronically ill patients has become an important goal in treatment. However, it is seldom taken into account that many other factors, in addition to somatic factors, have an influence on the quality of life of patients. Using patients with congenital heart defects as an example, we examined the relative significance of biological factors, compared to psychological and social factors, for the various quality of life dimensions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and eleven patients (aged 33+/-12 years) with different degrees of cardiac dysfunction were examined (NYHA 0: 2 I: 56, II: 38, III: 13, IV: 2). All patients for whom there was no contra-indication underwent a treadmill ergometry in order to determine their level of cardiopulmonary functioning (peak oxygen consumption: VO2max). All patients were asked to fill out questionnaires concerning their quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), their cardiac complaints (Giessener Complaint Questionnaire GBB), their personality traits (Giessen Test GTS), and the social support they experience (Social Support Questionnaire SOZU-k22). The data were analyzed using a linear structural equation model (SEM). RESULTS: In all aspects but the social domain, the HRQL of CgHD patients was significantly diminished compared to the normal population. The SEM proposed was valid, showing good indices of fit (chi2 = 1.18; p = 0.55; AGFI = 0.92). The level of cardiopulmonary functioning was most significant for the reporting of specific cardiac complaints (beta = -28) and for the physical component of the general HRQL (beta = 32), although the former was also influenced by a depressed disposition (beta = -0.20) and the extent of social support experienced (beta = 0.18). The objective findings, however, had virtually no individual significance for the psychological (beta = 0.09) and social domains (beta = -0.02). These HRQL domains are primarily influenced by depressive personality traits (beta= -26/-0.16) and the social support experienced (beta = 0.51/0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The patient's organic dysfunction primarily determines illness-specific complaints but has little relevance for the psychological and social aspects of the HRQL. These aspects are predominantly determined by the patient's depressive disposition and by the experienced social support. A successful therapy should therefore take biological as well as psycho-social determinants of the quality of life into account.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2005 Feb,Netherlands,2005,00
19323862,Determinants of fruit and vegetable intake in England: a re-examination based on quantile regression.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the sociodemographic determinants of fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption in England and determine the differential effects of socio-economic variables at various parts of the intake distribution, with a special focus on severely inadequate intakes. DESIGN: Quantile regression, expressing F&V intake as a function of sociodemographic variables, is employed. Here, quantile regression flexibly allows variables such as ethnicity to exert effects on F&V intake that vary depending on existing levels of intake. SETTING: The 2003 Health Survey of England. SUBJECTS: Data were from 11 044 adult individuals. RESULTS: The influence of particular sociodemographic variables is found to vary significantly across the intake distribution. We conclude that women consume more F&V than men; Asians and blacks more than whites; co-habiting individuals more than single-living ones. Increased incomes and education also boost intake. However, the key general finding of the present study is that the influence of most variables is relatively weak in the area of greatest concern, i.e. among those with the most inadequate intakes in any reference group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasise the importance of allowing the effects of socio-economic drivers to vary across the intake distribution. The main finding, that variables which exert significant influence on F&V intake at other parts of the conditional distribution have a relatively weak influence at the lower tail, is cause for concern. It implies that in any defined group, those consuming the least F&V are hard to influence using campaigns or policy levers.",Public health nutrition,2009 Nov,England,2009,00
11496453,Public health advocacy--determining a role for staff of a public hospital.,"This study explored the public health advocacy role of staff employed at a major South Australian specialist public hospital that had made an organisational commitment to health promotion. It was concluded that staff did have a role to play in public health advocacy, though the issues pursued primarily related to disease and injury prevention rather than the broader social determinants of health. Staff gained valuable experience in the political processes of public health advocacy. The hospital had to develop organisational infrastructures to support staff so they could undertake public health advocacy on behalf of the hospital. It was also necessary for the hospital to implement other changes in order to 'get its own house in order' before issues could be addressed in the broader community.",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,2001,Australia,2001,00
15273261,Weighing social and economic determinants related to inequalities in mortality.,"It is well known that there are social inequalities in health. Following the ecological approach, unemployment has been one of the most used indicators to study social inequalities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between indicators of extreme poverty and social unrest, along with unemployment, and mortality in Barcelona, during the years 1989 to 1993. A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out using Primary Health Care Areas (PHCAs) as the unit of analysis. The study population consisted of residents in Barcelona City. The indicators studied as dependent variables were the age-standardized mortality rates of the following causes of death: total mortality; lung cancer; bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma; cirrhosis; cerebrovascular disease; ischemic heart disease; breast cancer; traffic accidents; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); and drug overdose. Independent variables were male unemployment rate of the primary health care areas and indicators of extreme poverty and social conflict. A descriptive analysis, a bivariate analysis using Spearman correlation coefficients, and a multivariate analysis fitting Poisson regression models were carried out. For the main results, one group of causes of death was associated only with unemployment: bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease (both men and women); lung cancer (only among men); total mortality and cirrhosis (only among women). Among men, another group of causes of death was associated with extreme poverty and/or social unrest, as well as unemployment: total mortality, cirrhosis, and drug overdose. AIDS in men was only associated with extreme poverty and social unrest. We concluded that we see different types of relationships between deprivation and mortality. Unemployment has been related to mortality because of pathologies with socially accepted risk factors (tobacco and alcohol). Causes of death with risk factors not socially accepted (illegal drug use) have been related to indicators of marginality as well as unemployment.",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2004 Sep,United States,2004,00
18035447,Inequalities in oral health practices and social space: an exploratory qualitative study.,"This study analyzed the oral health practices and access to dental care of individuals according to their position in social space. The rationale was based on the hypothesis that different positions in social space may imply different habitus, in the sense conferred by Bourdieu. Such dispositions would influence practical behavior, choices and preferences in general and in this context, dental care. Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were carried out with individuals, as part of a multiple case study carried out in two municipalities in the state of Bahia, Brazil. Differences were found between the two study groups both with respect to actions of personal care and in seeking and using dental services. This, in addition to poor material and living conditions, and difficult access to restorative dental work in the public sector, may explain part of the pattern of tooth loss found in the adult Brazilian population. The adoption of effective communicative and educational actions by health professionals should be stimulated. However, the structural dimension of the social determinants requires transformations in the structures that generate the perceptions and practices of agents. The study discusses the implications of these data to public dental policies that are focused on reducing these inequalities.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2008 Apr,Ireland,2008,00
17470038,Sisyphus and self-management: the chronic condition self-management paradox.,"Chronic condition self-management is promoted internationally as not only a possible solution to the health problems of our increasingly chronically ill and ageing population, but as part of a new wave of consumer-led and volunteer-managed health care initiatives. Consumers are now indicating that they want to be more involved in the management of their lives and their health care options, while, especially in rural and smaller communities in Australia, a shortage of clinicians means that health care is rapidly changing. This emphasis on self-management raises crucial questions about where consumer action and control in health care should end and where clinical and medical intervention might begin. Hence, as in the case of Sisyphus and his rock, the self-management process is a difficult and demanding one that poses major challenges and loads for health system reformers and represents a struggle in which new difficulties are constantly emerging. This paper examines some implications of new self-management approaches to chronic illness from an ideological perspective and highlights key elements that underpin the effort to promote health-related lifestyle change. While peer-led self-management programs may assist certain individuals to live engaged and meaningful lives, the essential social and economic determinants of health and wellbeing mean that these programs are not the answer to our urgent need for major reform in the health care arena. Rather, self-management, from an ideological perspective, represents a minor adjustment to the fabric of our health system.",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,2007 May,Australia,2007,00
19504541,Relationship between sexual interactions and the timing of the fertile phase in captive female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata).,"Japanese macaques live in multi-male/multi-female social groups in which competition between males, female mate choice, and alternative male mating strategies are important determinants of mating and reproductive success. However, the extent to which adult males rely on female behavior to make their mating decisions as well as the effect of social rank on mating success are not clear as results are inconclusive, varying from study to study. In this study, we combined behavioral and endocrine data of 14 female Japanese macaques to examine the relationship between ovarian cycle phase and frequency of sexual behaviors, and to investigate how social rank influences sexual behavior in this species. We found that there was no increase in female proceptive behaviors during the fertile phase of the ovarian cycle, suggesting that female behaviors did not clearly signal the probability of conception. In spite of that, the frequencies of ejaculatory copulations were highest during this phase, indicating that the attractivity of females increased significantly during the period with higher probability of conception. Males, and especially the highest ranking male, were able to discriminate females nearing ovulation and to concentrate their mating effort, implying that the timing of ovulation was not concealed from them. The alpha male seemed able to monopolize most female matings, which is probably due in part to the low number of females simultaneously ovulating and to the limited number of inconspicuous places that the lower ranking males have to mate with females and avoid alpha male aggression. All together, these results suggest that different males may have access to different signals of ovulation and/or are differentially restrained as to how they can act on that information. The exact nature of the estrogen-related cues males use to recognize female reproductive status, and to what extent males use them warrants further investigation.",American journal of primatology,2009 Oct,United States,2009,00
11939367,Self-reports of aberrant behaviour on the roads: errors and violations in a sample of Greek drivers.,"Recent studies have shown that unsafe driver acts can be classified into two distinct categories (i.e.. errors and violations) entailing different measures for reducing road traffic accidents. A survey of over 1,400 drivers in Greece is reported in which a variety of aberrant driving behaviours have been identified. The present study has confirmed the results of earlier studies in the driving populations of Britain. Australia and Sweden that errors and violations are the major determinants in the factor structure of aberrant behaviours. Three types of violations were identified including, highway code-, aggressive- and parking-violations (or situational violations). Mistakes and lapses were two major forms of errors. The factor analysis identified another two classes of behaviour that could not be accounted for very well by the error-violation distinction. One class of behaviours referred to a state of low preparedness and negligence while the other class referred to communication errors and 'social disregard' for the other road users. Each class of behaviour was found to have different demographic correlates. Finally, accident liability was predicted by self-reported tendency to commit highway-code violations, but not by tendency to make errors due to failures of judgement (i.e.. mistakes) or lapses. Aggressive violations were significantly related to involvement in speeding convictions and law-breaking whilst highway-code violations were related to speeding convictions only.",Accident; analysis and prevention,2002 May,England,2002,00
11151292,Exercise behavior in a community sample with diabetes: understanding the determinants of exercise behavioral change.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors associated with exercise behavior among adults with diabetes. METHODS: Exercise behavior (stage of exercise readiness and energy expenditure) and potential determinants were measured on a subsample (n = 46) of adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from a randomized population-based telephone survey. Participants were assessed at baseline and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Sociodemographic and biomedical characteristics did not significantly differ between the stages of exercise behavior. Scores on the psychosocial constructs of self-efficacy, behavioral processes, self-concept, and social support were significantly higher for those in the action stage than those in the preaction stage of exercise readiness. Self-efficacy and behavioral process of change were significantly associated with energy expenditure; self-efficacy was the strongest predictor in the longitudinal analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may generate direction for theory development and guide health and medical practitioners when intervening on the specific constructs. Population- and community-based surveys have utility for assessing diabetes health-related behavior (e.g., exercise behavior).",The Diabetes educator,2000 May-Jun,United States,2000,00

INTERVENTION: Pilot projects were implemented in a semirural community with considerable growth potential, and a lower-income, ethnically diverse urban neighborhood. The partners' primary active-living goals included: prepare and sustain a network of public health, planning, community, and policymaking partners; affect urban planning and policy decisions to influence built-environment changes in Portland neighborhoods; and support active-living program and promotion partners. RESULTS: Partners have focused on building capacity for cross-disciplinary collaboration and leading strategic efforts toward policy, environmental, and social change. Partners have been engaged in policy advocacy and strategic campaign initiatives, as well as community program efforts that bring active living opportunities to underserved neighborhoods. LESSONS LEARNED: The ALbD community-action model served as a valuable tool for organizing intervention activities and bringing diverse partners together under a shared vision. Public health professionals engaged in land-use and transportation collaborations must strike a balance between becoming experts in technical aspects of new disciplines and addressing a wide range of active living determinants. Embracing a healthy community agenda can create fruitful new partnerships and increase the impact on systemic change.

This paper examines women's decisions about HIV testing and their experience of PMTCT and HIV-related care in one clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. It is based on qualitative, ethnographic research conducted in 2004 and 2005, including interviews and focus group discussions with 55 HIV-positive women participating in a PMTCT programme, and 21 interviews with key informants from the programme and the health system. Women's expectations from testing were consistent with the benefits for their own health and their infants' health, as communicated by nurses. However, the PMTCT programme only poorly met their expectations. Reasons for this disjuncture included the construction of women as still healthy even when they needed treatment, a focus only on infant health, health system weaknesses, lack of integrated care and timely referral, and defining HIV exclusively as a medical issue, while ignoring the social determinants of health. Women's own health was particularly marginalised within the PMTCT programme, yet good models exist for comprehensive care for women, infants and their families that should be implemented as testing is scaled up.",Reproductive health matters,2009 May,Netherlands,2009,00
18000122,Analysis of social epidemiology research on infectious diseases: historical patterns and future opportunities.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the many triumphs of biomedical research over infectious diseases, human pathogens continue to impact profoundly populations deprived of social resources. Correspondingly, health researchers have advocated a social determinants approach to the study and prevention of infectious diseases. However, it is unknown whether this call has resulted in an increase in the number of studies examining social determinants of infectious outcomes. METHODS: Research on social determinants of infectious diseases was systematically quantified by assessing temporal trends in the published literature using MEDLINE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science. RESULTS: Results of the literature review spanning 1966-2005 show that socially related citations increased an annual average of 180.3 for neuropsychiatric conditions, 81.9 for chronic conditions, 44.7 for sexually transmitted diseases and 18.9 for non-sexually transmitted infectious diseases (p<0.0001). Of the 279 publications found to employ the term ""social epidemiology"", 15 (5.4%) investigated infectious outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the literature review suggest a paucity of social research on infectious diseases. There is a need for increased dialogue and collaboration between infectious disease epidemiologists and social epidemiologists.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2007 Dec,England,2007,00

A multilevel analysis of a case-control study of social determinants of tuberculosis.,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is known to have socio-economic determinants at individual and at area levels, but it is not known whether they are independent, whether they interact and their relative contributions to the burden of tuberculosis. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Recife, Brazil, to investigate individual and area social determinants of tuberculosis, to explore the relationship between determinants at the two levels and to calculate their relative contribution to the burden of tuberculosis. It included 1452 cases of tuberculosis diagnosed by the tuberculosis services and 5808 controls selected at random from questionnaires completed for the demographic census. Exhaustive information on social factors was collected from cases, using the questionnaire used in the census. Socio-economic information for areas was downloaded from the census. Multilevel logistic regression investigated individual and area effects. RESULTS: There was a marked and independent influence of social variables on the risk of tuberculosis, both at individual and area levels. At individual level, being aged >or=20, being male, being illiterate, not working in the previous 7 days and possessing few goods, all increased the risk of tuberculosis. At area level, living in an area with many illiterate people and where few households own a computer also increased this risk; individual and area levels did not appear to interact. Twice as many cases were attributable to social variables at individual level than at area level. CONCLUSIONS: Although individual characteristics are the main contributor to the risk of tuberculosis, contextual characteristics make a substantial independent contribution.",International journal of epidemiology,2009 Oct,England,2009,00
14683572,Psychosocial determinants of premature health deterioration in a changing society: the case of Hungary.,"The drastic increase of morbidity and mortality rates in the transforming Central-Eastern European countries, characterizing the last decades, offers a unique opportunity to analyse the relationship of those social, psychological and biological processes that contribute to rapid health modifications. In 1988 and 1995, two national representative surveys of the Hungarian population aged 16 or older (N = 20,902 and 12,640 respectively) were conducted. The results show that depressive symptom severity mediates between relative socio-economic deprivation and higher self-rated morbidity rates. The worsening of traditional risk factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking, are also the consequences of social and psychological problems. A vicious circle might be hypothesized between social deprivation and depressive symptomatology, which substantially contributes to higher morbidity and mortality rates.",Journal of health psychology,2004 Jan,England,2004,00
19208007,Aetiology and risk factors related to traumatic dental injuries--a review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: During the past 30 years, the number of aetiologies of traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) has increased dramatically in the literature and now includes a broad spectrum of variables, including oral and environmental factors and human behaviour. The aim of this study is to present an international review of well-known as well as less well-known unintentional and intentional causes of TDIs. Moreover, some models that are useful in investigating contact sport injuries are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The databases of Medline, Cochrane, Social Citation Index, Science Citation Index and CINAHL from 1995 to the present were used. RESULT: Oral factors (increased overjet with protrusion), environmental determinants (material deprivation) and human behaviour (risk-taking children, children being bullied, emotionally stressful conditions, obesity and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) were found to increase the risk for TDIs. Other factors increasing the risk for TDIs are presence of illness, learning difficulties, physical limitations and inappropriate use of teeth. A new cause of TDIs that is of particular interest is oral piercing. In traffic facial injury was similar in unrestrained occupants (no seat belts) and occupants restrained only with an air bag. Amateur athletes have been found to suffer from TDIs more often than professional athletes. Falls and collisions mask intentional TDIs, such as physical abuse, assaults and torture. Violence has increased in severity during the past few decades and its role has been underestimated when looking at intentional vs unintentional TDIs. There are useful models to prevent TDIs from occurring in sports. WHO Healthy Cities and WHO Health Promoting Schools Programmes offer a broad solution for dental trauma as a public health problem. CONCLUSION: The number of known causes of TDIs has grown to alarming levels, probably because of increased interest of the causes and the underlying complexity of a TDI. Accepted oral, environmental and human aetiological factors must therefore be included in the registration of TDIs.",Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for Dental Traumatology,2009 Feb,Denmark,2009,00
12521802,Determinants of mission house delivery among booked patients in a Nigerian teaching hospital.,"This study examines the determinants of Mission House Delivery among booked patients in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. During the 12 months of the study (1 May 199930 April 2000) 196 booked patients at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife who delivered at mission houses were analysed. All ages and parity groups, educational level and social classes were involved. The majority (73%) were of low socio-economic class. The reasons for mission house delivery included financial constraints (41%), fear of possible caesarean section (46%), industrial action by health-care workers (39%), transport difficulty at night (26%), previous deliveries in mission houses (16%) and communal feud (12%). Four maternal deaths occurred (MMR 978/100 000 births) and 20 perinatal deaths (PNMR 118/1000 total births). Reduction of hospital user fees, provision of transportation and efficient telecommunication facilities at all times, conflict resolution and proper remuneration of health care workers are urgent needs to be addressed. Legislation against delivery in unsafe places and establishment of appropriate facilities by churches interested in maternity services is highly recommended.",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,2001 Sep,England,2001,00
15332136,Asthma and allergic rhinitis in Quebec children.,"BACKGROUND: The Health and Social Survey of Quebec Children and Youth, conducted on representative samples of children nine, 13 and 16 years of age, provided data on the prevalence and determinants of asthma and allergic rhinitis in Quebec. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis among children in the province of Quebec and to identify the determinants of these pathologies. METHODS: Three groups of more than 1100 children aged nine, 13 and 16 years were recruited. Respiratory symptoms were documented using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire. Questions enquiring about family income, smoking, degree of urbanization of the child's school's location and various variables related to indoor air were also included. The comparisons of proportions were done using the chi2 test. RESULTS: The prevalence rates for reported history of asthma varied from 14% to 15% depending on the age group. The prevalence of wheezing in the past year was 7% to 8%. Asthma was the primary cause of the limitation of activities due to a health problem in nine- and 13-year-old Quebecers, and the second most common cause in 16-year-old Quebecers. The prevalence of rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis and reported history of hay fever increased with age, reaching 28.0%, 15.9% and 21.1%, respectively, in the 16-year-old group. The prevalence of asthma and wheezing was associated with family history and allergies, and inversely related to family income. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of childhood asthma is high in the province of Quebec. It is a major cause of the limitation of activities due to a health problem for young Quebecers. A family history of asthma and an atopic predisposition are important determinants in the development of asthma in Quebec.",Canadian respiratory journal,2004 Jul-Aug,Egypt,2004,00
18173388,The value and challenges of participatory research: strengthening its practice.,"The increasing use of participatory research (PR) approaches to address pressing public health issues reflects PR's potential for bridging gaps between research and practice, addressing social and environmental justice and enabling people to gain control over determinants of their health. Our critical review of the PR literature culminates in the development of an integrative practice framework that features five essential domains and provides a structured process for developing and maintaining PR partnerships, designing and implementing PR efforts, and evaluating the intermediate and long-term outcomes of descriptive, etiological, and intervention PR studies. We review the empirical and nonempirical literature in the context of this practice framework to distill the key challenges and added value of PR. Advances to the practice of PR over the next decade will require establishing the effectiveness of PR in achieving health outcomes and linking PR practices, processes, and core elements to health outcomes.",Annual review of public health,2008,United States,2008,00
14637009,"Analysis of hospital charges for ischemic stroke in Fukuoka, Japan.","OBJECTIVES: Stroke is a heavy economic burden on individuals, society, and health services in Japan, where health expenditures are rising rapidly. The objective of the present study was to examine medical services and demographic factors associated with increased inpatient charges for ischemic stroke in Japan. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study subjects were 316 patients with a principal diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke who were discharged from the National Kyushu Medical Center Hospital from 1 July 1995 through 31 June 1999. Demographic, clinical, and administrative data were retrospectively collected from medical records and the hospital Clinical Financial Information System (CFIS). The influence of social and medical factors on total charges was analyzed using the stepwise multiple regression model. RESULTS: Among the total subjects, the mean (median) length of hospital stay (LOHS) was 33 (30) days (range, 2-155 days). The mean (median) hospital charge per patient was US dollars 9020 (dollars 7974) with a range of dollars 336-54,509. The distribution of charges was 42% for fundamental, 17% for injection therapies, 13% for radiological test, 11% for other laboratory examinations, 3% for drugs, and 3% for operations. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that LOHS was the key determinant of the hospital charge (partial R2=0.5993, P=0.0001). Operations (P=0.0001) and angiography (P=0.03) were also independent but less contributory determinants of the hospital charge. CONCLUSIONS: LOHS was strongly, positively associated with inpatient charges for ischemic stroke in Japan. This implies that significant charge reductions are more likely to rely on shortening LOHS, which probably can be achieved by altering reimbursement policies.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2003 Dec,Ireland,2003,00
18774868,Wealth status and risky sexual behaviour in Ghana and Kenya.,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence seems to suggest that there is some association between individual socioeconomic status and sexual risk-taking behaviour in sub-Saharan Africa. A number of broad associations have emerged, among them, positive, neutral and negative relationships between wealth status and sexual risk-taking behaviour. Reduction in the number of sex partners as a behavioural change has been advocated as an important tool in HIV prevention, and affecting such a change requires an understanding of some of the factors that can influence social behaviour, interactions and activities of subpopulations. OBJECTIVES: To further explore the determinants of sexual risk-taking behaviour (individuals having multiple sex partners), especially the effects that variations in household wealth status, gender and different subpopulation groups have on this behaviour. METHODS: The relationship between wealth status and sexual risk-taking behaviour in the context of HIV/AIDS infection in Ghana and Kenya was assessed using raw data from the 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys of each country. Wealth quintiles were used as a proxy for economic status, while non-marital and non-cohabiting sexual partnerships were considered indicators for risky sexual behaviour. RESULTS: For females, there appears to be an increasing probability of sexual risk taking by wealth status in Kenya, while, in Ghana, an inverted J-shaped relationship is shown between wealth status and sexual risk taking. When controlled for other variables, the relationship between wealth status and sexual risk-taking behaviour disappears for females in the two countries. For males, there is no clearly discernable pattern between wealth status and sexual risk-taking behaviour in Ghana, while there is a general trend towards increasing sexual risk-taking behaviour by wealth status in Kenya. For Ghana, the highest probabilities are among the highest and the middle wealth quintiles; in Kenya, high probabilities were found for the two highest wealth quintiles. Controlling for the effects of other factors, the pattern for Ghana is further blurred (not statistically significant), but the relationship continues to show in the case of Kenya, and is significant for the highest quintile. In general, for both Ghana and Kenya, men in the highest wealth quintile were found to be more likely to have multiple sexual partners than the other groups. CONCLUSION: The changing phases of HIV infection indicate that it is no longer poverty that drives the epidemic. Rather, it is wealth and a number of other sociodemographic factors that explain sexual risk-taking behaviour that puts people at risk. Understanding local specific factors that predispose individuals towards sexual risk taking could help to expand the range of information and services needed to combat the HIV pandemic.",Applied health economics and health policy,2008,New Zealand,2008,00
14693090,Acid burns from personal assault in Uganda.,"Acid burns from assault represent a substantial and neglected proportion of burn injuries in the developing world. A retrospective chart review was conducted to assess the frequency of acid burns in relation to total burns requiring admission in Kampala, Uganda. Seventeen percent of the adult burns admitted at New Mulago hospital over an 18-month period resulted from acid assault. Patients had a mean age of 33.1 years, with a male to female ratio of 1.1:1. The average extent of injury was 14.1% total body surface area (TBSA), commonly involving the face (86.7%), head and neck (66.7%), upper limbs (60.0%) and chest (53.3%). Thirty-three percent of patients suffered partial or complete blindness. Mean length of stay in hospital was 49.5 days and all patients survived. Patterns of assault followed two common trends: attacks during robberies (46.7%), and attacks associated with domestic disputes (33.3%). The Ugandan pattern is contrasted with patterns reported from Bangladesh, Cambodia and Jamaica with a view to understanding the social context underlying such assaults. Prevention of these hideous injuries will require further understanding of their underlying social and cultural determinants. Serious questions remain whether public education programs will reduce the incidence of acid assault or increase it by giving potential assailants an idea they did not have before.",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,2004 Feb,Netherlands,2004,00
19187875,Can successful aging and chronic illness coexist in the same individual? A multidimensional concept of successful aging.,"For the past 4 decades, many studies seeking to develop a definition and identify critical determinants of successful aging have been published. To date, there is still no consensus on a standard definition or measure of ""successful aging."" Most constructs have been one dimensional; although a few have been multidimensional, none has emerged as standard. The most serious limitation of contemporary successful aging constructs is the undue focus on physiologic aspects of aging. To move beyond this limited perspective that stresses disease and impairment, we postulate that successful aging may coexist with diseases and functional limitations if compensatory psychological and/or social mechanisms are used. With this premise, this article presents a new definition and conceptual framework of successful aging, together with an operational definition (measurement) that delineates our successful aging concept. We discuss how the proposed multidimensional measurement may be used as a screening tool, and address its relevance for health services research and health care delivery.",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2009 Feb,United States,2009,00
19228828,Automatically you become a polygamist': 'culture' and 'norms' as resources for normalization and managing accountability in talk about responses to infertility.,"In the developing world, infertility is a serious problem. It leads to both psychological and social hardship, in part because childless marriages often result in divorce, men taking another wife or extramarital relationships. Such responses have been attributed to cultural norms that mandate procreation. However, there are theoretical, methodological and moral issues with treating cultural norms as behavioural determinants. They have been insufficiently acknowledged in health research. Therefore, I demonstrate an alternative discursive approach, which examines how people actively mobilize ;culture' or ;norms' in interactions, and the interpersonal functions thereby fulfilled (e.g. blaming or justifying). Analysis is presented of interviews on (responses to) infertility in Malawi. I show how respondents construct polygamy and extramarital affairs as culturally and normatively required, ;automatic' and normal solutions for fertility problems and play down people's accountability for these practices. These accounts and constructions appear to facilitate engagement in affairs and polygamy when people face fertility problems, which seems problematic from a health and gender perspective. Thus, detailed analysis of how people use ;culture' and ;norms' in situ is important because it provides insights into its potentially undesirable consequences. Moreover, such analysis provides a starting point for culturally and gender sensitive interventions, since it highlights people's agency, and creates a space to re-construct and change practices.","Health (London, England : 1997)",2009 Mar,England,2009,00
15069807,Determinants of self-perceived health.,"OBJECTIVES: This article examines determinants of self-perceived health. Factors associated with very good/excellent rather than good health are compared with those associated with fair/poor rather than good health. DATA SOURCE: The data are from the household cross-sectional and longitudinal components of the first three cycles (1994/95, 1996/97 and 1998/99) of Statistics Canada's National Population Health Survey (NPHS). ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Cross-tabulations from the 1998/99 NPHS cross-sectional file were used to estimate the prevalence of very good/excellent and fair/poor health by sex and age group. Based on the longitudinal file, predictors of health perceptions in 1998/99 were studied in a multivariate model using generalized logistic regression. MAIN RESULTS: While physical conditions were strongly related to health perceptions, some lifestyle, socio-economic and psychosocial factors were also statistically significant. Heavy smoking, irregular exercise and overweight were associated with fair/poor health ratings. Unhealthy changes in lifestyle were associated with fair/poor rather than good health. Distress, low self-esteem and low socio-economic status were negatively associated with very good/excellent health.",Health reports,2001 Dec,Canada,2001,00
12686322,Multi-level determinants of retention in a home-visiting child abuse prevention program.,"OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study investigated how attributes from multiple domains influence retention in a voluntary home-visiting child abuse prevention program. METHOD: A sample of 1093 ""at-risk"" families participated in a home-visiting child abuse prevention program. A total of 71 Family Support Workers (FSWs) provided home visitation services in 12 different communities. Hierarchical general linear modeling (HGLM) was used to examine the community, home visitor, and maternal attributes that predicted retention in the program beyond 1 year. RESULTS: Multi-level analyses (HGLM) revealed significant community, home visitor, and maternal level effects. Families were less likely to remain in a home-visiting child abuse prevention program for at least 1 year if they lived in an area with high community violence. Families were more likely to remain when the home visitor received more hours of direct supervision. Older mothers were more likely to remain for at least 1 year than were younger mothers. Hispanic mothers were more likely to remain than were White non-Hispanic mothers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the utility of looking across multiple levels of influence when examining retention in home-visiting child abuse prevention programs. To increase retention rates home visitors will need to be adaptable to fit the needs of families in violent communities. Supervisors can influence retention rates by providing more hours of direct supervision. Other strategies that may contribute to program retention include meeting the scheduling needs of younger mothers and involving the families of younger mothers more effectively.",Child abuse & neglect,2003 Apr,England,2003,00
10896759,"Changing food knowledge, food choice, and dietary fiber consumption by using tailored messages.","The aim of this research was to compare the effects of tailored or general nutrition messages on individuals' food knowledge, food consumption, and fiber intake. Past research in the area of food choice has applied the Theory of Reasoned Action or the Theory of Planned Behavior to identify the determinants of choice. Neither theory, however, is structured to allow the researcher to examine a person's attitudes toward a wide range of foods and then to specify which food(s) from among the set of foods to include in a nutrition message. In contrast, the Behavioral Alternatives Model (BAM) allows the researcher to examine attitudes toward behavioral alternatives (i.e. foods) and to identify which foods are most likely to be selected from among a set of foods. We used the BAM to specify the foods to include in a tailored nutrition message. The results indicated that respondents who received a tailored message derived from the BAM had more food-related knowledge and dietary changes in the recommended direction than the respondents who received a general message.",Appetite,2000 Aug,England,2000,00
19408642,Biopsychosocial model--the integrated approach to health and disease.,"The biomedical model of health and disease dominates in current medical practice. The model attributes key role to biological determinants and explains disease as a condition caused by external pathogens or disorders in the functions of organs and body systems. Such an approach has its historic justification and has proved effective in the control of massive infectious diseases. However, now that chronic non-infectious diseases prevail, its efficacy has not only become questionable, but also the issue has been raised of its economic justification. The extension of biomedical approach and attribution of equal importance to psychosocial factors have become an imperative in the improvement of treatment efficacy and disease control, together with humanisation of relations between health staff and patients. A new biopsychosocial model has been suggested, that takes into account all relevant determinants of health and disease and that supports the integration of biological, psychological and social factors in the assessment, prevention and treatment of diseases. It does not diminish the significance of biological factors, but extends a rather narrow approach. The biopsychosocial model served as incentive for many studies of how psychological and social factors influence the development, course and outcome of a disease, giving rise to the development of interdisciplinary field--particularly the fields of health psychology and psychoneuroimmunology. Their contribution to better understanding of the impact of psychosocial factors on health stimulates greater interest of medical theory and practice in more holistic approach to a patient. However, the changes of the old, organ oriented approach are still too slow and too narrow.",Collegium antropologicum,2009 Mar,Croatia,2009,00
15967623,Determinants of adoption of cognitive behavioral interventions in a hospital setting: example of a minimal-contact smoking cessation intervention for cardiology wards.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to identify the psychological and organizational determinants of adopting a smoking cessation intervention in cardiology wards, using the Integrated Change Model (I-Change Model) as the theoretical basis. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey by means of questionnaires was conducted among the heads of all 121 cardiology wards in Dutch hospitals, of whom 77 (64%) responded. RESULTS: Adopters had a significantly lower level of formalization and more nurses working on the ward. Adopters also had a significantly more positive attitude towards working with the intervention, perceived more positive social influences from their direct environment and had higher self-efficacy. Psychological determinants explained adoption to a greater extent than organizational determinants did. CONCLUSION: It is very important to take psychological factors into account when studying the adoption of preventive innovations and developing diffusion strategies. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Programs for dissemination of preventive innovations in a hospital setting should primarily focus on psychological characteristics like social influence and self-efficacy.",Patient education and counseling,2006 May,Ireland,2006,00
17854339,"Determinants of injection drug user (IDU) syringe sharing: the relationship between availability of syringes and risk network member characteristics in Winnipeg, Canada.","AIMS: Despite the establishment of syringe exchange programmes, syringe-sharing behaviour remains common among some injection drug users (IDU). Previous studies have identified several individual- and social network-level variables associated with syringe sharing. We examine the extent to which each of these variables is related independently to this behaviour within a diverse study population. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey of 435 IDU conducted between December 2003 and September 2004 in Winnipeg, Canada. MEASUREMENTS: Individual and social-network variables were obtained from a survey instrument administered through a personal interview. Syringe sharing was defined as receptive syringe sharing in the last 6 months. Logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations was used to determine simultaneously the role of individual-level and risk network member-level variables on the odds of syringe sharing. FINDINGS: Individuals' relationship to a risk network member (sex partner, OR: 15.3 95% CI: 7.6-30.8; family member, OR: 3.4 95% CI: 1.3-9.0) and difficulty of access to syringes (OR: 3.6 95% CI: 1.3-9.9) were predictive of syringe sharing. Dyads who 'often' pooled resources to obtain drugs were at 4.9 times (95% CI: 2.1-11.6) the odds of syringe sharing, while those who 'sometimes' pooled resources were at 2.8 times (95% CI: 1.1-6.7) the odds, compared to those who 'never' pooled resources together. CONCLUSIONS: Syringe sharing in this population depended on both the availability of clean syringes and social network relationships. Adopting interventions that take into account relationships and behaviours that shape social norms present in networks/dyads would be a necessary prevention strategy alongside the provision of clean syringes.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2007 Oct,England,2007,00
12503240,What influences health behavior? Learning from caregivers of young children in Viet Nam.,"Globally, the caregiving behaviors that contribute to good nutritional status are well understood; but it is not clear why some caregivers perform these behaviors while others do not. This formative qualitative research was designed to improve understanding about what distinguishes caregivers who practice optimal behaviors from those who do not. This study is a one-time, cross-sectional baseline assessment of factors that affect nutrition-related behavior change. It took place in a rural northern province in Viet Nam. One hundred caregivers of children 6 to 17.9 months of age from five communes were interviewed. None of the five communes were included in the larger prospective study designed to test the impact of the Community Empowerment and Nutrition Program (CENP). Four behaviors were examined: feeding the child ""positive deviant"" foods, feeding the child during diarrheal episodes, washing the child's hands, and taking the child to the health center when ill. Results indicate that for all four behaviors, favorable social norms distinguished those who practiced each behavior from those who did not. Positive, reinforcing beliefs and attitudes were important determinants of every behavior except handwashing Likewise, self-efficacy differentiated doers from non-doers for all behaviors except feeding during diarrheal episodes. Findings from this research suggest that fathers and in-laws of non-doers are more likely to fail to advise mothers about infant feeding and health than they are to provide negative advice. By discovering what distinguishes those who practice optimal behaviors from those who do not, researchers, program planners, and others are better equipped to develop targeted interventions that lead to positive behavior change.",Food and nutrition bulletin,2002 Dec,United States,2002,00
12975677,Elderly people's definition of quality of life.,"OBJECTIVES: Senescence for some elderly people is a phase of with development and satisfaction, whereas for others is a negative stage of life. The determinants of a good quality of life in old age vary from person to person. The aims of this study were to identify 1) the prevalence of octogenarian people who evaluate their current life as being mainly characterized by a positive quality and 2) which were the domains that they identified as being the determinants of this positive quality. A same parallel study was conducted with subjects who evaluated senescence as a preponderantly negative experience. METHODS: A random and representative sample of 35% of the octogenarian people, living residing in the community, was selected among the dwellers of the city of Veranopolis, state of Rio Grande do Sul. A semi-structured questionnaire on quality of life quality was applied as well as the scale of depressive symptoms Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the index of general health Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). RESULTS: Slightly more than half of the studied sample (57%) defined their current quality of life with positive evaluations, whereas 18% presented a negative evaluation of it. A group 0f 25% defined their current lives as neutral or having both values (positive and negative). Those who were dissatisfied presented more health problems according to the CIRS and more depressive symptoms when evaluated by the GDS. Satisfied subjects ones had different reasons to justify this state, however, the dissatisfied had mainly the lack of health as a reason for their suffering. The main source of reported daily well-being was the involvement with rural or domestic activities. Among the interviewed, lack of health was the main source for not presenting well-being, although there was interpersonal variability regarding what each subject considered as loss of health. CONCLUSION: Possibly, for the elderly subjects a negative quality of life is equivalent to loss of health and a positive life quality is equivalent to a greater range of categories such as activity, income, social life and relationship with the family, categories which differed from subject to subject. Therefore, health seems to be a good indicator of negative quality of life, though an insufficient indicator of successful elderliness.","Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)",2003 Mar,Brazil,2003,00

15380317,Impact of informal regulation of pollution on water quality in rivers in India.,"In this paper an attempt is made to assess the impact of informal regulation of water pollution on water quality in Indian rivers. For this purpose, an econometric analysis of determinants of water quality in Indian rivers is carried out using water quality (water class) data for 106 monitoring points on 10 important rivers for five years, 1995-1999. To explain variations in water quality, an Ordered Probit model is estimated, in which poll percentage in parliamentary elections, a proxy for the intensity of informal regulation, is taken as one of the main explanatory variables. Rainfall, industrialization, irrigation intensity and fertilizer use are some of the other explanatory variables used in the model to control for the influence of these factors. As expected, river water quality is found to be positively related with rainfall, and negatively related with industrialization, irrigation intensity and fertilizer use. A significant positive relationship is found between poll percentage and water quality, and also between the rate of increase in literacy level in a district and the water quality in rivers flowing through the district. These results point to a significant favorable effect of informal regulation of pollution on water quality in rivers in India.",Journal of environmental management,2004 Nov,England,2004,00
30282305,The distribution of wellbeing in Ireland.,"OBJECTIVES: There is a substantial knowledge gap about the distribution of mental health in community populations. The European Social Survey is particularly useful as it contains information on over 40,000 individuals, including 2,286 Irish adults. The objective of this study is to conduct a large scale statistical analysis to examine the distribution and determinants of mental wellbeing in a large representative sample of the Irish population. METHOD: Analysis of the European Social Survey using robust multiple linear and non-linear regression techniques. The data-set contains WHO-Five scores and subjective wellbeing for a sample of 2,286 Irish people interviewed in their homes in 2005. RESULTS: Ireland has the second highest average WHO-Five score among the 22 countries in the European Social Survey. Multiple linear regression analysis across the distribution of WHO-Five reveals a wellbeing gradient largely related to education and social capital variables. A probit model examining the determinants of vulnerability to psychiatric morbidity reveals that a similar set of factors predict scores below the threshold point on the WHO-Five scale. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with marked differences in mental wellbeing across education levels and variables relating to social capital factors. Such indicators provide a useful index for policy-makers and researchers. However, much further work is needed to identify causal mechanisms generating observed differences in mental health across different socioeconomic groups.",Irish journal of psychological medicine,2009 Sep,England,2009,00
18471923,Barriers to addressing the social determinants of health: insights from the Canadian experience.,"Despite Canada's reputation as a leader in health promotion and population health, implementation of public policies in support of the social determinants of health has been woefully inadequate. The continuing presence of income, housing, and food insecurity has led to Canada being the subject of a series of rebukes from the United Nations for failing to address child and family poverty, discrimination against women and Aboriginal groups, and most recently the crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity. In this article we consider some of the reasons why this might be the case. These include the epistemological dominance of positivist approaches to the health sciences, the ideology of individualism prevalent in North America, and the increasing influence on public policy of the marketplace. Various models of public policy provide pathways by which these barriers can be surmounted. Considering that the International Commission on the Social Determinants of Health will soon be releasing its findings and recommendations, such an analysis seems especially timely for understanding both the Canadian scene and developments in other nations.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2008 Dec,Ireland,2008,00
17985247,Empowerment: a conceptual discussion.,"The concept of 'empowerment' is used frequently in a number of professional areas, from psychotherapy to social work. But even if the same term is used, it is not always clear if the concept denotes the same goals or the same practice in these various fields. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the discussion and to find a plausible and useful definition of the concept that is suitable for work in various professions. Several suggestions are discussed in the paper, for example control over life or health, autonomy, ability, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and freedom, and it is concluded that there are two plausible complementary uses, one as a goal and one as a process or approach. Empowerment as a goal is to have control over the determinants of one's quality of life, and empowerment as a process is to create a professional relation where the client or community takes control over the change process, determining both the goals of this process and the means to use.",Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy,2008 Jun,Netherlands,2008,00
15562348,"[""Loss of perspective is my disease"" -- subjective feelings of long-term unemployed].","BACKGROUND: Nowadays job loss implies the risk of long-term unemployment particularly in former East Germany. Many physical, psychological and social problems are associated with unemployment. However, health of long-term unemployed may not decrease continually, but may be subject to fluctuations according to different phases of unemployment and short-term work. METHODS: This expectation was examined by structured interviews with long-term unemployed (10 men and women) working in temporary job-creating-schemes (ABM). We asked for determinants of health and subjectively perceived associations between health and employment as well as for conditions of life and work. RESULTS: The employees were on average 55 years old and more than 7 years without work before joining the ABM. Psychosocial complaints such as depression, sleep disorders or nervousness appeared after approximately three months of unemployment. Subjective health improved during job-creating-schemes, depending on specific work conditions, but deteriorate at its end again. Most of the ABM-employees don't have any perspective of future employment. CONCLUSIONS: The well-known association between unemployment and health was confirmed. Furthermore, the study gave new insights into psychological strains of long-term unemployed and subjective work loads during ABM. Future prospects were proved to be an important determinant of health ('lack of perspective is my illness'). From this measures of health promotion for long-term unemployed within ABM companies and other institutions can be derived.",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),2004 Nov,Germany,2004,00
19858492,A theory for the evolution of other-regard integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives.,"Although much previous work describes evolutionary mechanisms that promote or stabilize different social behaviors, we still have little understanding of the factors that drive animal behavior proximately. Here we present a modeling approach to answer this question. Our model rests on motivations to achieve objectives as the proximate determinants of behavior. We develop a two-tiered framework by first modeling the dynamics of a social interaction at the behavioral time scale and then find the evolutionarily stable objectives that result from the outcomes these dynamics produce. We use this framework to ask whether ""other-regarding"" motivations, which result from a kind of nonselfish objective, can evolve when individuals are engaged in a social interaction that entails a conflict between their material payoffs. We find that, at the evolutionarily stable state, individuals can be other-regarding in that they are motivated to increase their partners' payoff as well as their own. In contrast to previous theories, we find that such motivations can evolve because of their direct effect on fitness and do not require kin selection or a special group structure. We also derive general conditions for the evolutionary stability of other-regarding motivations.

On MRI, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) is presumed to reflect Alzheimer- type pathology. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are considered markers of vascular pathology. AIM: We investigated differences in prevalence of behavioural and psychological symptoms in AD according to the presence of MTA and WMH on MRI. METHODS: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of 111 consecutive AD patients were assessed using the Neuropsychatric Inventory (NPI). Symptoms were considered present when the score was > or =1. On MRI, MTA was rated using the five-point Scheltens-scale and WMH using the four-point Fazekas-scale. Both MRI measures were dichotomised (MTA: absent 0/1, present 2-4; WMH absent 0/1, present 2/3). RESULTS: Of the 111 AD patients, 60(55%) had MTA, and 32(29%) had WMH. The presence of MTA was associated with the presence of WMH (chi (2) = 11.8, p < 0.001). The prevalence of behavioural and psychological symptoms--defined as a NPI score of > or =1 on at least one symptom--was 74%.The median NPI score of the total study population was 6(0-41). There was no difference in prevalence according to MTA (p = 0.53) or WMH (p = 0.18). On inspection of individual NPI items, neither MTA, nor WMH was related to any of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in prevalence of behavioural and psychological symptoms according to MTA or WMH, as rated on MRI. This suggests that the occurrence of those symptoms depends on other determinants, such as coping style or genetic make-up.",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2008 Apr,England,2008,00
15382292,Resection for lung cancer in the elderly patient.,"Age is sometimes used as an excuse not to resect lung cancer. Nugent et al [10] noted that, although only 6% of patients younger than 45 years had stage I or II disease, 33% underwent surgical resection. In contrast, of the 33% of elderly patients who had stage I or II disease, only 6% underwent surgical resection. The elderly patients who are carefully selected for lung resection are undoubtedly stronger physiologically than others their same age. Patients with adequate predicted postoperative lung function, no contraindications from other medical problems, good performance status, and social support should be offered standard resection for early-stage NSCLC. Lung cancer resection in elderly patients is justified and has decreasing morbidity and mortality rates. Careful patient selection and operative planning are necessary, however. It is wise to have a diagnosis and staging done before the patient arrives in the operating suite. The surgeon should avoid extended resections when possible. In addition, elderly patients should be ambulated as soon as possible and adequate pain control should be ensured. Finally, the stage of the cancer and occurrence of cardiopulmonary complications are the main determinants of outcome.",Thoracic surgery clinics,2004 May,United States,2004,00
11990012,Determinants of occurrence and recovery from hallucinations in daily life.,"BACKGROUND: Data related to the dynamics of hallucinatory experiences of patients suffering from schizophrenia are scarce. Detecting antecedent conditions and coping strategies may aid development of targeted psychological interventions. METHOD: We studied hallucinating and non-hallucinating patients suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n = 57), and non-schizophrenic severe mentally ill patients with depression (n = 37). Data were collected using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) over a period of 1 week. Contingent on a randomly signalling beep, subjects filled in reports of ongoing hallucinations as well as thought, mood, current activity, social circumstances and places frequented. RESULTS: More subjects suffering from schizophrenia reported hallucinations, but for all hallucinating subjects the qualities of hallucination episodes were quite similar. More subjects reported visual hallucinations at least once. In contrast, the intensity of auditory hallucinations was higher. Anxiety was the most prominent emotion during hallucinations and reports of anxiety intensity exceeded baseline levels before the first report of auditory hallucinations. Context modified hallucination intensity over the course of an episode. Social withdrawal resulted in a decrease of hallucinatory intensity (AH > VH), while social engagement slightly raised intensity levels (VH > AH). Doing nothing (VH > AH) and work activities (AH > VH) led to decreases in intensity levels over time, while passive leisure activities (watching TV) resulted in increases in intensity levels of hallucinations (AH > VH). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that hallucinating experiences are subject to a host of contextual influences. Understanding variation offers useful insights for therapy.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2002 Mar,Germany,2002,00
11407265,"[Depression, anti-thyroid antibodies and Hashimoto encephalopathy].","Psychiatric manifestations are infrequent or rarely described in Hashimoto's encephalopathy. It usually begins like a subacute diffuse encephalopathy with confusion, tremor and other neurologic symptoms. A relapsing course is characteristic. Neither biologic nor clinical symptoms are specific but high antithyroid antibodies levels are characteristic. The diagnosis can be seriously delayed by the fact that the different symptoms implicate approaches by psychiatrists, neurologists or endocrinologists. There are two clinical types. The one presented here evaluates progressively to dementia with psychotic episodes, confusion and seizures. An early steroid treatment makes the symptoms regress without aftereffects. We have analysed the clinical and biological findings of a woman who has been admitted to different neurologic and psychiatric departments before her diagnosis was made. First clinical presentation and evolution were that of a depression. Each time the antidepressive treatment was stopped, depression relapsed in spite of an appropriate steroid treatment. Literature shows that a close link exists between depression and antithyroid antibodies whatever thyroid status. This link does still exist after adjustment of psycho-social determinants of depression. The decrease of those antibodies only reflects the decrease of inflammation. So, for the psychiatrist it is important to diagnose Hashimoto's encephalopathy without delay, especially when psychiatric manifestations are in the foreground. Furthermore, a psychiatric report should systematically be added to the clinical and biological findings in order to make a better approach of the existing links between depression and other manifestations of the disease.",L'Encephale,2001 Mar-Apr,France,2001,00
18079320,Canadian adolescents with migraine: impaired health-related quality of life.,"The objective of this study was to determine the impact of migraine headaches on health-related quality of life among Canadian adolescents. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) collects information related to health status, health care utilization, and health determinants for the Canadian population. Analysis was limited to those adolescents 12-19 years of age residing in Manitoba. Respondents reported whether they had migraine and mood/anxiety disorders. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Short Form-36 survey, which covers 8 health concepts related to functional status, well-being, and overall health. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to model each Short Form-36 scale against age (12-14 years vs 15-19 years), gender, migraine, and the presence of a mood or anxiety disorder. The CCHS was completed by 994 respondents; 9.3% (95% confidence interval, 7.3%-11.5%) reported a diagnosis of migraine. Reported migraine predicted both statistically (P < .0001) and clinically significantly lower health-related quality of life in all Short Form-36 domains except vitality and general health perceptions. Adolescents reporting a mood disorder (2.1%) scored significantly lower in 6 of 8 health-related quality of life domains, most pronounced for emotional role, general mental health, and social functioning. Canadian adolescents with migraine report clinically and statistically significant impairment in health-related quality of life compared to their peers, independent of psychiatric comorbidities.",Journal of child neurology,2008 Jan,United States,2008,00
16365074,Early programming of body composition and fat distribution in adolescents.,"Size at birth and early postnatal growth are determinants of adult height and BMI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of birth weight on body composition and fat distribution in a group of Spanish adolescents. Current body composition was assessed by both skinfold thickness and dual X-ray absorptiometry in 234 adolescents born at term (140 girls and 94 boys), now aged 13-18 y and living in the city of Zaragoza. Relative fat distribution was estimated using the ratio of the subscapular to triceps skinfolds (S:T). Birth weight and gestational age were assessed by a questionnaire. Birth weight was inversely associated with the S:T ratio (P < 0.05) in boys and directly associated with bone mass (P < 0.01) and fat-free mass (P < 0.05) in girls. This association was independent of factors such as age, Tanner stage, gestational age, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and height. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that impaired fetal growth, measured by birth weight, may be related to central fat distribution in boys and decreased bone and fat-free mass in girls.",The Journal of nutrition,2006 Jan,United States,2006,00
11426291,"An assessment lexicon: assessment of dietary trends, physical activity patterns and nutritional status in the elderly.","This article discusses the use of nutritional assessment to improve the health and nutritional status of older persons. A three pronged approach is suggested. First, the emphasis is on screening for poor nutritional status. This involves a search for both biological and social factors that influence diet, physical activity and other determinants of nutritional status. The Determine Checklist is helpful in doing this. Second, after those elders potentially at risk are identified, the goal is to address risks to nutritional status more definitively. The nutritional status lexicon (ABCDEF's) must be assessed in this regard. Finally, it is critical to prevent or treat problems which have been discovered. Without follow-up,b screening and assessment are useless.","The journal of nutrition, health & aging",2001,France,2001,00
16132453,Determinants of a quality wild turkey hunting season.,"According to the National Wild Turkey Federation, there has been a 450% increase in the number of licensed wild turkey hunters since 1973. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research articles focusing specifically on turkey hunting. Most human dimensions of wildlife research have focused on either deer or waterfowl hunting. In this study, dimensions of hunting quality, days a field, and harvest were examined among a sample of 739 Virginia fall turkey hunters. Quality of a hunting season, rather than a specific hunt, was examined. Principal components analysis (PCA) revealed five domains of attributes of a high-quality turkey-hunting season: wildlife interaction, education, being away, social interaction, and hunting skills. The domains of hunting quality revealed by the PCA are similar to domains found previously for spring turkey hunters as well as other types of hunters. Also examined were hunter perceptions of overall hunting quality, the number of days spent hunting turkeys during the fall season, and harvest success. For comparative purposes and agency needs, hunters were segmented into three categories based on days spent hunting: low frequency (1 to 2 days), medium frequency (3 to 4 days), and high frequency (> or =5 days). The influence of these variables to respondents' perceptions of overall quality was examined using a series of regression models. Variables found to be significant predictors of quality were wildlife interaction and harvest success. Hunters who killed a turkey reported a significantly higher quality season than those who did not kill a turkey.",Environmental management,2005 Jul,United States,2005,00
19608320,Interprofessional collaboration within Canadian integrative healthcare clinics: Key components.,"Research shows that interprofessional collaboration has become an important factor in the implementation of effective healthcare models. To date, the literature has not focused on the collaboration between medical doctors and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) healthcare practitioners, an example of interdisciplinary collaboration called integrative healthcare (IHC). Drawing on in-depth, semi-standardized interviews conducted with 21 practitioners working in Canadian IHC clinics, this paper explored and interpreted how IHC is experienced by those working in Canadian IHC clinics. The interview questions and analysis were guided by the Input, Process, Output conceptual framework drawn from the organizational management theory (McGrath, J. E. (1964). Social psychology: A brief introduction. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.) to study collaboration within teams. We found that constructs contributing to collaboration included practitioners' attitudes and educational background, as well as external factors such as the healthcare system and financial pressures. Major processes affecting collaboration included communication, patient referral and power relationships. These determinants of collaboration were found to result in learning opportunities for practitioners, modified burden of work and ultimately, higher affective commitment toward the clinic. These constructs serve as a guide for further investigation of interprofessional collaboration within an IHC clinic. This exploration of interprofessional collaboration in IHC identified a broad array of key factors associated with interprofessional collaboration. These factors are critical to better understand the functioning of IHC clinics, and provide guidance for creation or maintenance of successful clinics.",Social science & medicine (1982),2009 Sep,England,2009,00
15256518,The association of maternal growth and socio-economic measures with infant birthweight in four ethnic groups.,"BACKGROUND: Both maternal socio-economic status (SES) and growth measures are themselves interrelated and are also related to infant birthweight. The objective of this study is to compare the relative importance of such maternal measures as determinants of birthweight of female infants-the prospective mothers of the next generation. METHODS: The study base was derived from a population-based multiethnic intergenerational cohort: the Washington State Intergenerational Cohort. Infants of mothers from four ethnic groups were included: non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics. We generated simple, partial, and multiple correlation coefficients to investigate the association between birthweight and the maternal growth and SES measures. RESULTS: While there were slight differences among the ethnic groups, generally each of three maternal pre-conceptional growth measures-birthweight, stature, and pre-pregnant weight-was a stronger predictor of female infant birthweight than were each of the five maternal SES factors-age, parity, marital status, educational attainment, and prenatal care onset. After accounting for the proportion of variation in birthweight explained by the maternal growth measures and maternal smoking, the addition of the five SES variables added relatively little to the prediction of infant birthweight. The maximal multiple correlation coefficients (R2) yield values ranging from 9.5% to 12.8%. CONCLUSIONS: A mother's growth before pregnancy is a stronger predictor of infant birthweight than is her current socio-economic circumstance. Since the mother's growth must have been influenced by the socio-economic circumstances of her family of upbringing, this further highlights the intergenerational contribution on a woman's reproductive success.",International journal of epidemiology,2004 Dec,England,2004,00
17596091,Health promotion in Brazil.,"Brazil, a Latin American country of continental proportions and contrasts, demographic inequalities, and social inequities, concomitantly faces the challenge of preventing and controlling infectious diseases, injuries, and non-communicable diseases. The loss of strength of the biomedical paradigm, the change in epidemiological profile, and the sociopolitical and cultural challenges of recent decades have fostered the emergence of new formulations about public health thinking and practice. Among them, are the paradigms of Brazilian Collective Health and Health Promotion. The former provides philosophical support for Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS). The aim of this article is to discuss the development of public health within the country's history, and to analyze and compare the theoretical assumptions of Health Promotion and Collective Health. We conclude that health promotion, based on the principles and values disseminated by the international Charters and concerned with social actors and social determinants of the health-disease process, has significant potential to promote the improvement of living and health conditions of the population. This frame of reference guided the formulation of the National Policy of Health Promotion within the Unified Health System, which was institutionalized by a ministerial decree. The importance and application of evaluating the effectiveness of health promotion processes and methodologies in Brazil have been guided by various frames of reference, which we clarify in this article through describing historical processes.",Promotion & education,2007,England,2007,00
11766978,Relatives of patients with severe psychotic illness: factors that influence appraisal of caregiving and psychological distress.,"BACKGROUND: Research shows considerable variability in the effect on relatives of patients' mental illness but the determinants of relatives' experience remain unclear. We investigated the influence of demographic, social and clinical characteristics on relatives' experience when conceptualised using a stress-appraisal-coping paradigm. METHODS: Our sample was drawn from relatives of patients recruited to the UK700 case management study (n = 154). Demographic, social and clinical data were collected from patients, and relatives completed the Experience of Caregiving Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire. We predicted that patients' symptomatology in particular would influence relatives' experience, and that relatives who appraised caregiving more negatively and less positively would experience greater psychological distress. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses revealed that relatives' appraisal was not predicted by patients' symptomatology. Instead, relatives appraised caregiving more negatively if the patient was unemployed or younger, and less positively if the patient had been ill for longer or had poorer social functioning. Little of the variance in appraisal was explained by these variables, however. Consistent with the stress-coping model, relatives' negative appraisal was a strong predictor of psychological distress and accounted for a substantial proportion of its variance. Positive appraisal did not predict psychological distress, however. None of the demographic, social or clinical characteristics tested had any significant effect on relatives' psychological distress once appraisal was adjusted for. There was an unexpected positive correlation between the two appraisal scales, with relatives who appraised caregiving more negatively also appraising it more positively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a stress-coping model of caregiving but further research is required to determine more influential predictors of relatives' appraisal. Our findings indicate that interventions aimed at patients' social functioning and relatives' negative appraisal of caregiving may assist in reducing relatives' psychological distress.",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,2001 Sep,Germany,2001,00
16284402,Does the primary school attended influence self-reported health or its risk factors in later life? Aberdeen Children of the 1950s Study.,"BACKGROUND: Adult health and its determinants are influenced by the environment in childhood. The school attended is known to affect the health behaviours of pupils while still at school. Little is known about the long-term influence of school attended on health. METHODS: A total of 7,095 respondents (mean age 47 years) to a follow-up questionnaire who attended primary school in Aberdeen, UK, provided information on self-reported health; self-reported high blood pressure; GHQ-4; smoking status; alcohol intake; and obesity. Variance partition coefficients (VPCs) summarized the variation in adult health outcomes and behaviours across schools. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the contribution of school to variation in the outcomes taking into account individual-level and school-level factors. RESULTS: There was some variation across schools in the proportion of adults reporting poor self-rated health (VPC = 0.020) and smoking (0.019). Higher VPCs were found for factors potentially confounded with school: paternal social classes (I&II) (0.45) and gender (0.44). Age at leaving secondary education (0.28) and income (0.10) varied across schools. The effects of primary school diminished after adjusting for individual-level childhood risk factors. The further addition of adult risk factors attenuated these childhood effects. After full adjustment there was no effect of the primary school attended for high blood pressure, current smoking, alcohol intake, and obesity, and negligible effects for the other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our expectations, we found little evidence of any relationship between primary school and adult self-reported health or behaviour. This is surprising given the extent to which characteristics known to be associated with adult health were clustered within schools.",International journal of epidemiology,2006 Apr,England,2006,00
15894699,Prenatal and postnatal milk supplementation and adult insulin-like growth factor I: long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) are increasingly recognized as important determinants of adult health, in particular risk of certain cancers. However, little is known about the determinants of adult IGFs and to what degree they may be programmed by early life influences. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of prenatal and postnatal milk supplementation among 951 subjects born in 1972 to 1974 in South Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Measures of IGF-I, IGF binding protein 3, and the molar ratio. RESULTS: Data on adult IGFs were available from 663 subjects at a mean age of 25 years. Subjects in the intervention arm had lower IGF-I (-8.5 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval, -15.1 to -1.8, P = 0.01) and ratio (-1.20; 95% confidence interval, -2.33 to -0.04, P = 0.04). These differences could not be explained by follow-up bias or confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide experimental data on the role of early life programming either in the intrauterine or postnatal period that may have long-term influences on the IGF axis, with potential implications for disease risk.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2005 May,United States,2005,00
18242613,Migration of Lebanese nurses: a questionnaire survey and secondary data analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Nursing is becoming a mobile profession. Nurse migration is multifactorial and not limited to financial incentives. Non-economic factors that might lead to migration include poor recruitment and retention strategies, poor job satisfaction and working conditions, socio-political and economic stability, and the poor social image of the nursing profession. Lebanon is facing a problem of excessive nurse migration to countries of the Gulf, North America and Europe. No study has been conducted to understand the determinants and magnitude of the problem. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to provide an evidence base for understanding the incidence of nurse migration out of Lebanon, its magnitude and reasons. DESIGN: A cross-sectional research design comprising both quantitative and qualitative methods was employed to achieve the stated objectives. This includes a survey of nursing schools in Lebanon, survey of nurse recruitment agencies, secondary data analysis and survey of migrant nurses. RESULTS: An estimated one in five nurses that receive a bachelors of science in nursing migrates out of Lebanon within 1 or 2 years of graduation. The majority of nurses migrate to countries of the Gulf. The main reasons for migration included: shift work, high patient/nurse ratios, lack of autonomy in decision-making, lack of a supportive environment, and poor commitment to excellent nursing care. Further, nurses reported that combinations of financial and non-financial incentives can encourage them to return to practice in Lebanon. The most recurring incentives (pull factors) to encourage nurses to return to practice in Lebanon included educational support, managerial support, better working conditions, utilization of best nursing practices and autonomy. CONCLUSION: Nurse migration and retention have become major health workforce issues confronting many health systems in the East Mediterranean Region. Our study demonstrated that nurse migration is a product of poor management and lack of effective retention strategies and sufficient knowledge about the context, needs and challenges facing nurses. Nurse migration in Lebanon underscores the importance of developing a monitoring system that would identify implications and help implement innovative retention strategies. Nurse migration out of Lebanon is likely to persist and even increase if underlying factors are not properly resolved.",International journal of nursing studies,2008 Oct,England,2008,00

14621254,Social and proximate determinants of sexual activity in rural Nigeria.,"This study analyses the social, physiological and motivational determinants of sexual activity for 644 married women in rural areas of Osun State, Nigeria. The data come from the Fertility Awareness and Pregnancy Avoidance study conducted in 1993-94. Sexual activity is measured by three continuous variables: weekly frequency of (1) total sexual activity, (2) coital-only sex and (3) both coital/non-coital sex. Analyses of variance were performed to test the difference in group means between the predictor variables and measures of sexual activity. Ordinary least squares regression analyses were then performed for the three dependent variables. Two models are used: the first contains only those variables associated with an individual's demographic, social and economic status, and the second adds predictor variables associated with motivational and physiological factors. Results show that while many socioeconomic variables by themselves are significantly associated with sexual activity measures, the addition of physiological and motivational variables weakens their effects and lessens their original statistical significance. Additionally, the socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with frequency of sexual activity are not necessarily the same ones significantly associated with coital-only or combined coital/non-coital sex. While other studies have tended to focus either on socioeconomic or physiological factors, the joint examination of both types of influences seems to indicate that the latter have more proximate effects on the frequency of both coital and non-coital sexual activity of married women in this population. Contraceptive protection is shown to be highly positively associated with all three of the sexual activity measures, empirically confirming the important relationship between contraception and both coital and non-coital forms of sexual activity.",Journal of biosocial science,2003 Oct,England,2003,00
17919890,Subjective and objective quality of life in schizophrenia.,"OBJECTIVE: Quality of life (QOL) is considered an important outcome in the treatment of schizophrenia, but the determinants of QOL are poorly understood in this population. Furthermore, previous studies have relied on combined measures of subjective QOL (usually defined as life satisfaction) and objective QOL (usually defined as participation in activities and relationships). We examined separately the clinical, functional, and cognitive predictors of subjective and objective QOL in outpatients with schizophrenia. We hypothesized that better subjective QOL would be associated with less severe negative and depressive symptoms, better objective QOL, and greater everyday functioning capacity, and that better objective QOL would be associated with less severe negative and depressive symptoms, better cognitive performance, and greater functional capacity. METHOD: Participants included 88 outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who completed a comprehensive series of assessments, including measures of positive, negative, and depressive symptoms; performance-based functional skills; a neuropsychological battery; and an interview measure of subjective and objective QOL. RESULTS: In the context of multiple predictor variables, more severe depressive symptoms and better neuropsychological functioning were independent predictors of worse subjective QOL. More severe negative symptoms predicted worse objective QOL. Functional capacity variables were not associated with subjective or objective QOL. CONCLUSION: Treatments to improve QOL in schizophrenia should focus on negative symptoms and depressive symptoms.",Schizophrenia research,2008 Jan,Netherlands,2008,00
19301505,[Social determinants of psychological distress in adolescents aged 18 years in Poland].,"UNLABELLED: THE PURPOSE of the study was to analyse the relationships between social environment (school, family, peers) factors and distress of adolescents aged 18 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: the questionnaire survey was carried out in the sample of 1379 pupils in the third grade of upper secondary schools; mean age of pupils 18.7 years. The questionnaire contained scale GHQ-12 (General Health Questionnaire) and questions from HBSC (Health Behaviour in School-aged Children. A WHO Collaborative Cross-national Study) survey, concerning school attitude, family structure, parental bonding, communication with parents and peers' relationships. Comparative analyses were done by chi2 test. Odds ratio and multivariate logistic regression models were estimated for risk assessment. RESULTS: over 40% of 18 year olds had a higher level of psychological distress, significantly more frequent among girls than boys (p < 0.001), and urban than rural adolescents (p < 0.01). Pupils from general upper secondary schools more often felt distress than pupils from basic vocational schools (50% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Girls who reported not liking school and felt pressured by schoolwork had a higher level of distress (Exp(B) = 1.8 and 2.1). Significant relationships were found between worse parental bonding, difficulties in communication with parents and higher level of distress both in boys and girls (Exp(B) from 1.8 to 2.8). Lack of same-sex close friends and no time spent with them after school were predictors of higher distress mostly in boys (Exp(B) od2,2 do 11.5). CONCLUSION: school problems (prospect of school-leaving e xams), difficult family relationships and especially lack of same-sex friends and spending time with them outside school are risk factors for psychological distress of youth aged 18 years.",Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,2008 Apr-Jun,Poland,2008,00

We conducted an experiment to test the effect of a news article describing the social determinants of type 2 diabetes on the public's support for diabetes prevention strategies. We found that exposure to the social determinants message led to a divergence between Republicans' and Democrats' opinions, relative to their opinions after viewing an article with no message about the causes of diabetes. These results signify that increasing public awareness of the social determinants of health may not uniformly increase public support for policy action.",American journal of public health,2009 Dec,United States,2009,00

10674582,Determinants of unexplained antepartum fetal deaths.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess fetal, maternal, and pregnancy-related determinants of unexplained antepartum fetal death. METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based cohort study of 84,294 births weighing 500 g or more from 1961-1974 and 1978-1996. Unexplained fetal deaths were defined as fetal deaths occurring before labor without evidence of significant fetal, maternal, or placental pathology. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-six unexplained antepartum fetal deaths accounted for 27.2% of 721 total fetal deaths. Two thirds of the unexplained fetal deaths occurred after 35 weeks' gestation. The following factors were independently associated with unexplained fetal death: maternal prepregnancy weight greater than 68 kg (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85, 4.68), birth weight ratio (defined as ratio of birth weight to mean weight for gestational age) between 0.75 and 0.85 (OR 2.77; 95% CI 1.48, 5.18) or over 1.15 (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.26, 4.44), fewer than four antenatal visits in women whose fetuses died at 37 weeks or later (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.08, 4.52), primiparity (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.26, 2.40), parity of three or more (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.26, 3.20), low socioeconomic status (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.14, 2.22), cord loops (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.04, 2.97) and, for the 1978-1996 period only, maternal age 40 years or more (OR 3.69; 95% CI 1.28, 10.58).

16161852,[Developing local actions: allowing individual talents be expressed and utilised within a strategic framework].,"The Regional Health Programme of Children and Adolescents in Province Alpes Cote d'Azur (PRSJ), developed between March 1998 and May 1999, is characterised by its scope and complexity. It is more a strategic framework for action than an operational programme. To carry out this action, it was adapted to the level of intervention, on the one hand, using instruments at the regional level adapted for professional interventions, and, on the other hand, through the development of territory-based approaches founded on the creation of networks. Evaluations have shown that the actors found the framework proposed by PRSJ positive and adopted it. They expressed their creativity with more spontaneity in the networks with therapeutic objectives, than those responding to health determinants, which needed initial local support. Local communities appeared as the ideal setting for dissemination and sustainability of PRSJ's objectives. PRSJ's strategic framework allowed local actors to express their talent. This mode of action, which accommodates not only programmatic focus within the context of practitioners on the ground, but also, epidemiology and socio-geographic interventions, are pertinent. To go beyond the explicit milestones set by the strategic orientations of the programme, different elements strengthening the framework are highlighted.",Promotion & education,2005,England,2005,00
17302641,Determinants of developmental delay in infants aged 12 months.,"The aim of this study was to determine which demographic, maternal, obstetric and postnatal variables were associated with achievement of developmental milestones at the age of 12 months in term infants. Mothers and babies were enrolled in the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study shortly after birth. All infants were full term (gestation >or= 37 weeks). Approximately half of the sample were small for gestational age (SGA = birthweight <or= 10th percentile), and half were appropriate for gestational age (AGA = birthweight > 10th percentile). A maternal interview was conducted soon after birth. Phase 2 of the study occurred 12 months later when mothers were sent a postal questionnaire requesting information about the child's health and development during the first year of life using the Denver Prescreening Developmental Questionnaire. Seven hundred and forty-four (85.4%) European mothers returned the postal questionnaire. SGA children were not at increased risk of developmental delay at 12 months of age. In a sample representative of New Zealand European children, after adjustment for the effects of potential confounders, maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.1 [95% CI 1.1, 4.0]), maternal smoking during the first year of life (OR = 1.9 [95% CI 1.0, 3.8]) and low levels of satisfaction with parenting (OR = 2.4 [95% CI 1.1, 5.2]) were associated with significantly increased risk of developmental delay. In the subgroup of SGA children, maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.9 [95% CI 1.4, 6.2]), high levels of stress associated with parenting (OR = 2.2 [95% CI 1.2, 4.0]), and low levels of satisfaction with parenting (OR = 4.3 [95% CI 1.3, 13.5]) were significantly associated with developmental delay after adjustment for the effects of potential confounders. In conclusion, maternal and postnatal factors were better predictors of developmental delay than demographic variables.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,2007 Mar,England,2007,00
18535848,A prospective study of the determinants of exercise in bladder cancer survivors using the Theory of Planned Behavior.,"GOALS OF WORK: Although exercise has gained recognition as an effective supportive care intervention for cancer survivors, exercise participation rates are low. The present study examined the determinants of exercise in bladder cancer survivors using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bladder cancer survivors (N = 397) residing in Alberta, Canada completed a mailed questionnaire at baseline that assessed demographic, medical, behavioral, and social cognitive variables and a second questionnaire 3 months later that assessed exercise. Multiple regression was the primary analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Adjuvant therapy (r = -0.10, p = 0.021), cancer invasiveness (r = -0.10, p = 0.051), and age (r = -0.11, p = 0.037) were all negatively associated with exercise. Intention (beta = 0.25, p < 0.001), perceived behavioral control (beta = 0.18, p = 0.001), and planning (beta = 0.12, p = 0.018) explained 20.9% of the variance in exercise over a 3-month period. Perceived behavioral control (beta = 0.32, p < 0.001), affective attitude (beta = 0.18, p = 0.002), instrumental attitude (beta = 0.15, p = 0.025) and descriptive norm (beta = 0.10, p = 0.032) explained 39.1% of the variability in exercise intention. Constructs from the TPB mediated the associations between adjuvant therapy, cancer invasiveness, age, and exercise. Age and adjuvant therapy also moderated some of the associations within the TPB. CONCLUSIONS: Some medical and demographic variables predict exercise behavior in bladder cancer survivors, but these associations are mediated by the TPB. Interventions based on the TPB may be effective for promoting exercise in this cancer survivor population.",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2009 Feb,Germany,2009,00
17672224,"The implications of public policy related to parks, recreation, and public health: a focus on physical activity.","A collaborative framework that influences the promotion of policy related to physical activity should include parks and recreation as well as public health practitioners and researchers. As governments at all levels become increasingly focused on the impact of public resources, park and recreation agencies are challenged to document and demonstrate the impact of leisure services. Public policy associated with parks and recreation is driven by public interest and is often debated in the absence of relevant research to demonstrate the determinants and correlates of parks and recreation to address prevailing social conditions. This paper describes current policy and funding issues faced by public parks and recreation professionals responding to increasing physically active leisure across the lifespan of Americans. We also discuss how a collaborative framework approach can be used to inform public policy designed to increase the physical activity of the American public.",Journal of physical activity & health,2007,United States,2007,00
22692441,Gender Differences in Eating Behavior and Social Self Concept among Malaysian University Students.,"University students may encounter personal, family, social, and financial stresses while trying to cope with their academic challenges. Such constraints could affect their eating behavior and health status which, in turn may have negative effects on their studies. In light of little information in Malaysia on this subject, this study was undertaken on a sample of 180 students pursuing different academic programs in a Malaysian university. The study objectives were to determine the students' eating behavior including body weight control and the extent of fear of being fat, their social self concept that reflects the five selves namely, the psychological self, the social self, the sexual self, the family self and the physical self. Eating behavior and social self concept were determined based on various methods previously validated in studies on young adults in Asia and Australia. This article focuses on gender comparisons for these determinants. The results showed that psychological and emotional factors have a significant bearing on the eating behavior of university students. Uninhibited eating behavior of both the males and females showed significant and negative correlations with feelings pertaining to personal worth, the physical self, and their relationships with peers and families. Gender differences were manifested for some determinants. The females showed more restrained eating behavior than the males; the females have a significantly higher score for family relationship, which appears to be a significant factor on male students' eating behavior. Future studies on a larger sample size may help to unravel the extent to which psychological factors influence eating behavior of students, and the underlying psychosocial basis for some of the gender differences reported in this study.",Malaysian journal of nutrition,2002 Mar,Malaysia,2002,00
16408403,Doctors in society. Medical professionalism in a changing world.,"Medicine bridges the gap between science and society. Indeed, the application of scientific knowledge to human health is a crucial aspect of clinical practice. Doctors are one important agent through which that scientific understanding is expressed. But medicine is more than the sum of our knowledge about disease. Medicine concerns the experiences, feelings, and interpretations of human beings in often extraordinary moments of fear, anxiety, and doubt. In this extremely vulnerable position, it is medical professionalism that underpins the trust the public has in doctors. This Working Party was established to define the nature and role of medical professionalism in modern society. Britain's health system is undergoing enormous change. The entry of multiple health providers, the wish for more equal engagement between patients and professionals, and the ever-greater contribution of science to advances in clinical practice all demand a clear statement of medicine's unifying purpose and doctors' common values. What is medical professionalism and does it matter to patients? Although evidence is lacking that more robust professionalism will inevitably lead to better health outcomes, patients certainly understand the meaning of poor professionalism and associate it with poor medical care. The public is well aware that an absence of professionalism is harmful to their interests. The Working Party's view, based on the evidence it has received, is that medical professionalism lies at the heart of being a good doctor. The values that doctors embrace set a standard for what patients expect from their medical practitioners. The practice of medicine is distinguished by the need for judgement in the face of uncertainty. Doctors take responsibility for these judgements and their consequences. A doctor's up-to-date knowledge and skill provide the explicit scientific and often tacit experiential basis for such judgements. But because so much of medicine's unpredictability calls for wisdom as well as technical ability, doctors are vulnerable to the charge that their decisions are neither transparent nor accountable. In an age where deference is dead and league tables are the norm, doctors must be clearer about what they do, and how and why they do it. We define medical professionalism as a set of values, behaviours, and relationships that underpin the trust the public has in doctors. We go on to describe what those values, behaviours, and relationships are, how they are changing, and why they matter. This is the core of our work. We have also identified six themes where our definition has further implications: leadership, teams, education, appraisal, careers, and research. The Working Party's definition and description of medical professionalism, and the recommendations arising from them, can be found in Section 5 of this report. If our recommendations are acted upon, we believe that professionalism could flourish and prosper to the benefit of patients and doctors alike. However, the exercise of medical professionalism is hampered by the political and cultural environment of health, which many doctors consider disabling. The conditions of medical practice are critical determinants for the future of professionalism. We argue that doctors have a responsibility to act according to the values we set out in this report. Equally, other members of the healthcare team--notably managers--have a reciprocal duty to help create an organisational infrastructure to support doctors in the exercise of their professional responsibilities. Just as the patient-doctor partnership is a pivotal therapeutic relationship in medicine, so the interaction between doctor and manager is central to the delivery of professional care. High-quality care depends on both effective health teams and efficient health organisations. Professionalism therefore implies multiple commitments--to the patient, to fellow professionals, and to the institution or system within which healthcare is provided, to the extent that the system supports patients collectively. A doctor's corporate responsibility, shared as it is with managers and others, is a frequently neglected aspect of modern practice. The audience for this report is, first and foremost, doctors. But we believe it should be of equal interest to patients, policy-makers, members of other health professions, and the media. All these groups have a vital part to play in discussing and advancing medical professionalism. This report is only the beginning of an effort by the Royal College of Physicians, together with others, to initiate a public dialogue about the role of the doctor in creating a healthier and fairer society. Medical professionalism has roots in almost every aspect of modern healthcare. This Working Party could not hope to solve all the issues and conflicts surrounding professionalism in practice today. But our collective and abiding wish is to put medical professionalism back onto the political map of health in the UK.","Clinical medicine (London, England)",2005 Nov-Dec,England,2005,00
19411157,Internet information and medical consultations: experiences from patients' and physicians' perspectives.,"OBJECTIVE: Many patients use the Internet to obtain health-related information. It is assumed that health-related Internet information (HRII) will change the consultation practice of physicians. This article explores the strategies, benefits and difficulties from the patients' and physicians' perspective. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted independently with 32 patients and 20 physicians. Data collection, processing and analysis followed the core principles of Grounded Theory. RESULTS: Patients experienced difficulties in the interpretation of the personal relevance and the meaning of HRII. Therefore they relied on their physicians' interpretation and contextualisation of this information. Discussing patients' concerns and answering patients' questions were important elements of successful consultations with Internet-informed patients to achieve clarity, orientation and certainty. Discussing HRII with patients was appreciated by most of the physicians but misleading interpretations by patients and contrary views compared to physicians caused conflicts during consultations. CONCLUSION: HRII is a valuable source of knowledge for an increasing number of patients. Patients use the consultation to increase their understanding of health and illness. Determinants such as a patient-centred consultation and timely resources are decisive for a successful, empowering consultation with Internet-informed patients. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: If HRII is routinely integrated in the anamnestic interview as a new source of knowledge, the Internet can be used as a link between physicians' expertise and patient knowledge. The critical appraisal of HRII during the consultation is becoming a new field of work for physicians.",Patient education and counseling,2009 Nov,Ireland,2009,00

Stress, individual differences, and the social environment.","The social and physical environments in which we live have an enormous impact on our physiology and behavior and influence the process of adaptation, or ""allostasis."" Genes, early development, adult experiences, life style, and stressful life experiences all contribute to the way the body adapts to a changing environment; and these factors all help to determine the cost to the body, or ""allostatic load."" Studies of these processes involve the disciplines of biology and psychology, but they are incomplete without the input from other fields, such as cultural anthropology, economics, epidemiology, political science, and sociology.

The study was funded by the Canadian International Development Agency's Southeast Asia Gender Equity Program. AIM: The objective was to compare the issues, risk factors, social determinants, and challenges in women's occupational health, according to the status of economic development as defined by the World Bank. METHOD: Data were collected through 27 key informant interviews of high-ranking government officials and senior researchers, self-administered questionnaires on country or regional statistics and 16 courtesy calls. RESULTS: Results indicated that women's occupational health problems common in these countries or regions included women's long hours of work (double workday), shift work and a caring role for family and friends. Problems reported in developing countries but not developed countries included poor access to training and protective equipment, and insufficient legislation to protect women's rights. Problems reported in developed countries but not in developing countries included obesity, smoking and not including women in health research. CONCLUSION: This paper provides insights into the changing environment in the workplace, such as increasing participation of women in the paid workforce and changes in gender differences due to the changing country economy, for improving women's occupational health.","Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)",2005 Oct,England,2005,00
16698975,Living arrangements and mental health in Finland.,"BACKGROUND: Non-married persons are known to have poor mental health compared with married persons. Health differences between marital status groups may largely arise from corresponding differences in interpersonal social bonds. However, official marital status mirrors the social reality of persons to a decreasing extent, and living arrangements may be a better measure of social bonds. Little is known about mental health in different living arrangement groups. This study aims to establish the extent and determinants of mental health differences by living arrangement in terms of psychological distress (GHQ) and DSM-IV psychiatric disorders (CIDI). METHODS: Data were used from the nationally representative cross sectional health 2000 survey, conducted in 2000-1 in Finland. Altogether 4685 participants (80%) aged 30-64 years were included in these analyses; comprehensive information was available on measures of mental health and living arrangements. Living arrangements were measured as follows: married, cohabiting, living with other(s) than a partner, and living alone. RESULTS: Compared with the married, persons living alone and those living with other(s) than a partner were approximately twice as likely to have anxiety or depressive disorders. Cohabiters did not differ from the married. In men, psychological distress was similarly associated with living arrangements. Unemployment, lack of social support, and alcohol consumption attenuated the excess psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity of persons living alone and of those living with other(s) than a partner by about 10%-50% each. CONCLUSIONS: Living arrangements are strongly associated with mental health, particularly among men. Information on living arrangements, social support, unemployment, and alcohol use may facilitate early stage recognition of poor mental health in primary health care.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2006 Jun,England,2006,00
14608444,Determinants of caesarean delivery among women hospitalized for childbirth in a remote population in China.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess determinants of a high Caesarean delivery rate in a remote population in China. METHODS: A prospective cohort study including 20,891 women who gave birth between January 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998, in one of the 18 hospitals participating in a hospital-based regional perinatal surveillance system in Qingyuan, a remote rural region in Guangdong province, China. RESULTS: Of the 20,891 pregnant women registered by the Qingyuan Perinatal Surveillance System, 7.5% were delivered by elective Caesarean section, and 18.4% were delivered by non-elective Caesarean section. The most common indications for elective Caesarean delivery were socio-cultural, non-medical reasons, such as the woman's fear of pain, her wish to give birth on a date or at a time believed to be particularly auspicious, or her belief that delivery by Caesarean section would protect the baby's brain. Factors strongly related to elective Caesarean delivery included insurance status, maternal age, plurality, preeclampsia and eclampsia, gestational age, and birth weight. The most common indication for non-elective Caesarean delivery was cephalopelvic disproportion. Factors strongly related to non-elective Caesarean delivery included maternal age, preeclampsia and eclampsia, placenta previa, gestational age, and birth weight. CONCLUSION: Non-medical causes, including a woman's insurance status and her personal and social demands, accounted for a large proportion of elective Caesarean deliveries in this remote population in China.",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,2003 Nov,Netherlands,2003,00
18544154,Part-time hospitalisation and stigma experiences: a study in contemporary psychiatric hospitals.,"BACKGROUND: Because numerous studies have revealed the negative consequences of stigmatisation, this study explores the determinants of stigma experiences. In particular, it examines whether or not part-time hospitalisation in contemporary psychiatric hospitals is associated with less stigma experiences than full-time hospitalisation. METHODS: Survey data on 378 clients of 42 wards from 8 psychiatric hospitals are used to compare full-time clients, part-time clients and clients receiving part-time care as aftercare on three dimensions of stigma experiences, while controlling for symptoms, diagnosis and clients' background characteristics. RESULTS: The results reveal that part-time clients without previous full-time hospitalisation report less social rejection than clients who receive full-time hospitalisation. In contrast, clients receiving part-time treatment as aftercare do not differ significantly from full-time clients concerning social rejection. No significant results for the other stigma dimensions were found. CONCLUSION: Concerning social rejection, immediate part-time hospitalisation could be recommended as a means of destigmatisation for clients of contemporary psychiatric hospitals.",BMC health services research,2008 Jun 10,England,2008,00
16753093,[Field epidemiology and social epidemiology].,"Comparing field epidemiology and social epidemiology, we pretend to think about the no explicit images and meanings operating in both necessary convergent fields, about the obstacles present in epidemiological practice to fulfil its social function and about the necessity of changing epistemological, methodological and practice grounds, beginning with field epidemiologists teaching programmes. Field epidemiology would tend to act in an absent theoretical frame. On the other hand, social epidemiology would tend to prioritize theoretical developments (thinking and research about social determinants) without correspondent action, because of the limits to change public policies. Other differences are found at intervention level (micro-macrospace), its aim (outbreak control vs. inequalities control) and the way to communicate with society. They are similar in the methodological concern, the predominance of orientation based on positivism and framed through statistic methods, but in process of epistemological opening, the stress experienced between the alternative relationship to a virtual world of data bases or to the real society, their peripherical situation in relation of the political, social, institutional and professional system and the tendency to professional frustration. Finally, we ask ten questions to the field epidemiologists related with their present practice, in order to consider if they are developing social epidemiology, and propose some changes in epidemiologist teaching and practice.",Gaceta sanitaria,2006 Mar-Apr,Spain,2006,00
17453425,"Tooth loss in the elderly and its association with nutritional status, socio-economic and lifestyle factors.","OBJECTIVE: Tooth loss impacts on general health and is a risk factor for malnutrition, disability, loss of self-sufficiency, and deterioration in quality of life. The present study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of edentulism and its association with social and lifestyle factors in a population of elderly Italians. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental, social, and disease conditions were evaluated in a large community-based cohort (3054) of elderly subjects (> or =65 years) of both sexes in northern Italy. Logistic regression analyses with stepwise forward selection were performed to estimate the independent contribution of nutritional, socio-economic, and lifestyle variables to dental status. Adjusted ORs and 95% CI were estimated for variables significantly associated with edentulism. RESULTS: The prevalence of edentulism was about 44.0%. It was more pronounced in females and it was twice as prevalent in the 90+ years age group. Among edentulous subjects, 17.5% wore no prostheses. Difficulties in chewing and in swallowing were reported by 47.6% and 13.7% of the subjects, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicates that edentulism was associated with age in both sexes. For women, independently associated risk factors were: years since menopause >23 (OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.37-2.40), number of children >3 (OR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.36-2.80), and living alone (OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.15-1.88). For men, these were serum albumin <40 g/l (OR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.22-2.63), current smoking (OR = 4.01; 95% CI: 2.59-6.20), and former smoking (OR = 3.42; 95% CI: 2.42-4.82). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of edentulism among the elderly Italian population studied was at the high end among Western countries, and higher in women than in men. In women, tooth loss correlated with aging, female events (pregnancies, menopausal status), and living alone. In men, aging and smoking are important determinants of edentulism, which is associated with the risk condition of hypoalbuminemia. Difficulty in chewing was associated with dentition type. In our study, the high prevalence of edentulous subjects without prostheses suggests a need for educational and social measures to improve patients' attitudes to dental care and to encourage the use of prostheses among the elderly.",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,2007 Apr,England,2007,00
17204532,Psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis.,"Quality of life (QoL) has been recognized as an important outcome of schizophrenia treatment, yet the determinants of QoL for individuals with schizophrenia are not well known. Research has consistently found psychiatric symptoms to be negatively related to QoL, however, findings concerning the strength of these relationships have been mixed, making it difficult to determine the degree to which such symptoms are related to poor QoL. This research presents a systematic meta-analysis of studies examining the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and QoL in schizophrenia, in an effort to elucidate the determinants of QoL for this population. A total of 56 studies were extracted from literature searches of relevant databases for empirical reports published between 1966 and 2005 examining the relationship between positive, negative, and/or general psychiatric symptoms and QoL. Weighted effect size analyses revealed small relationships between psychiatric symptoms and QoL, with general psychopathology showing the strongest negative associations across all QoL indicators. Moderator analyses indicated that variation in effect sizes could be accounted for by differing operationalizations of QoL, study design, sample, and participant treatment setting. In particular, positive and negative symptoms were more strongly related to poor QoL among studies of schizophrenia outpatients, whereas general psychopathology showed a consistent negative relationship with QoL across all study samples and treatment settings. Implications for future research and treatment development are discussed.",Schizophrenia bulletin,2007 Sep,United States,2007,00

To address this subject, they analyzed QOL, as measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General questionnaire (FACT-G), Spanish Version 4, and depicted the complex relations among physical, psychological, social, and cultural factors, including spirituality. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used with a sample of 309 patients with cancer. The influence of several possible determinants was first studied by univariate regression analysis. Variables showing an association were included in a forward stepwise multivariate regression model. RESULTS: Five regression models were studied, for the FACT-G total score and its four subscales. Five variables explained 32.1% of the variance of the FACT-G total score: tumor stage, spiritual well-being, income, mood disorders, and mode of questionnaire administration. The type and relevance of the explanatory variables differed among the various dimensions of QOL. CONCLUSIONS: The authors underlined the entwining of biologic, psychosocial, and spiritual factors as determinants of the QOL of patients with cancer, thus supporting the multidimensional definition and modeling of the construct.",Cancer,2005 Mar 1,United States,2005,00
